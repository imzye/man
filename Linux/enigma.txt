NAME
       enigma - Puzzle game reminiscent of Oxyd

SYNOPSIS
       enigma [options] [levelfile.xml] ...
       enigma [--assert] [-d path] [--help] [-l lang] [--log] [--nograb] [--nomusic] [--nosound] [-p file] [--showfps] [--version] [-w] [levelfile.xml] ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  object of the game is to find and uncover pairs of identically colored Oxyd stones. Simple? Yes. Easy? Certainly not!  Hidden traps, vast mazes, laser beams, and, most of all, countless hairy
       puzzles usually block your direct way to the Oxyd stones.  Enigma's game objects (and there are hundreds of them, lest you get bored) interact in many unexpected ways, and since many of them  fol‐
       low the laws of physics (Enigma's special laws of physics, that is), controlling them with the mouse isn't always trivial ...
