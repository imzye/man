NAME
       mupdisp - display output from Mup music publisher program

SYNOPSIS
       mupdisp [mup_options] file

DESCRIPTION
       Mupdisp  provides a way to view Mup output on your screen.  The file is
       Mup input. Any other Mup options can be given, except -C, -E,  -f,  -F,
       -l, -m, -M, or -v, which don't produce print output.

       Mupdisp  will  run  under  MS‐DOS or will run under UNIX with a TERM of
       AT386, linux, or xterm (under X windows).

       When running under X windows, several standard X options are available:

       -geometry XxY+M+N
              Sets the window size and/or location on the screen.  The  actual
              window  width will be determined by the width of the Mup output.
              The height will be adjusted if necessary to be between  400  and
              the  actual height of the Mup output. The window placment speci‐
              fications can be positive or negative. The actual placement  may
              be adjusted by your window manager.

       -fg color or -foreground color
              Specifies the foreground color to use.

       -bg color or -background color
              Specifies the background color to use.

       These  X options can also be set in your .Xdefaults file using resource
       names of mupdisp.geometry, mupdisp.foreground, and  mupdisp.background.
       Command line arguments will override values in the .Xdefaults file.  As
       an example, you could add these lines to your .Xdefaults file:

                 mupdisp.foreground:   navy
                 mupdisp.background:   gray
                 mupdisp.geometry:     400x760+100-34

       The Mupdisp program begins in partial page mode, which displays  output
       at  approximately  actual size (depending on the size of your monitor).
       In this mode, it may be that not all of the page fits on the screen, so
       the  scrolling commands can be used to move up and down to view differ‐
       ent parts of the page. In full page mode, a small version of the entire
       page  is displayed.  This is useful for seeing overall page layout, but
       is generally too small to see much detail.  This mode is  now  somewhat
       of  a  relic  of the days when screens were typically much smaller than
       they are today, and is thus becoming less useful.

       If the environment variable MUPDISPMODE is set to some  value,  Mupdisp
       will start in full page rather than partial page mode.

       The commands are:

       num<Enter>
              Go to page number num.

       + or <space> or <control‐E> or <control‐F>
              move  forward  on the page by about 1/8 of an inch (partial page
              mode only)

       - or <backspace> or <control‐Y> or <control‐B>
              move backward on the page by about 1/8 of an inch (partial  page
              mode only)

       b or <control‐U> or <control‐P> or <up‐arrow‐key>
              move  backward  on  the page by about an inch (partial page mode
              only)

       f or <Enter> or <control‐D> or <control‐N> or <down‐arrow‐key>
              move forward on the page by about an  inch  (partial  page  mode
              only)

       h or ? display help screen

       m      toggle between partial page and full page modes.

       n or <PageDown>
              go to next page

       p or <PageUp>
              go to previous page

       q or ZZ
              quit

       r      Repaint the page (useful for exiting help page)

       When in X windows, the mouse can be used for scrolling. The left button
       scrolls downward like the f command, while  the  right  button  scrolls
       backwards like the b command.

       Mupdisp  supports page sizes of letter (8.5 x 11.0 inches), note (7.5 x
       10.0 inches), legal (8.5 x 14.0 inches), A4 (8.26 x 11.69  inches),  A5
       (5.85  x  8.26  inches),  A6  (4.125  x  5.85 inches), flsa (8.5 x 13.0
       inches), and halfletter (5.5 x 8.5 inches).

CAVEATS AND BUGS
       You must have mup in your PATH.   You  must  have  ghostscript  (gs  or
       gs386.exe)  in  your  PATH  and  it  must be built to include the "bit"
