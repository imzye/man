ACPIHELP(1)                                                                                 General Commands Manual                                                                                 ACPIHELP(1)

NAME
       acpihelp - ACPI help utility

SYNOPSIS
       acpihelp <option>...  [<name-prefix>|<hex-value>]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the acpihelp command. The option list is taken from the acpihelp interactive help.

       acpihelp provides descriptive text for AML and ASL keywords, methods, and opcodes.

       Much more detailed documentation may be found at http://www.acpica.org/documentation/.

       If neither a <name-prefix> or a <hex-value> is provided, acpihelp will do the logical equivalent of a "display all."

       A  default  search  (that  is,  a  search with no options) and a <name-prefix> can mean two different things: (1) if <name-prefix> does not start with an underscore, find ASL operator names, or (2) if
       <name-prefix> does start with an underscore, find ASL predefined method names.
