NAME
       xglyph - demonstration program for the t1lib font rasterizer library.

SYNOPSIS
       xglyph [ fontfile...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xglyph program.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       xglyph  is a program which demonstrates the capabilities of the t1lib library.  It allows the user to view an arbitrary character or string rendered in the various ways pgossible with the library.  By
       default, it writes a log file named t1lib.log in the current directory.

       If invoked with no arguments, it will attempt to read the global configuration file and font database.  It will also accept any number of filenames on the command line, in which case these are treated
       as font files to be loaded instead of the default font database.

ENVIRONMENT
       In the Debian GNU/Linux version of this program, the environment variable T1LIB_CONFIG, if set, points to an alternate configuration file with which to initialize the library.

SEE ALSO
       FontDataBase(5), t1libconfig(8).

       xglyph  is  much more fully documented in the LaTeX documentation that accompanies the upstream t1lib distribution.  This documentation is installed in PostScript and source formats with the t1lib-dev
       package in /usr/share/doc/t1lib-dev, and is also accessible through the dwww system.
