NAME
       uhd_find_devices - USRP Hardware Driver Discovery Utility

DESCRIPTION
       Find UHD-supporting Ettus Research products attached by USB, network or
       embedded configuration.

       The UHD package is the universal hardware  driver  for  Ettus  Research
       products.  The goal is to provide a host driver and API for current and
       future Ettus Research products. Users will  be  able  to  use  the  UHD
       driver standalone or with 3rd party applications.

SYNOPSIS
       uhd_find_devices [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS
       Device Address Arguments:
              --args arg

IDENTIFYING DEVICES
       Devices  are  addressed  through  key/value string pairs.  These string
       pairs can be used to narrow down the search for a  specific  device  or
       group  of  devices.   Most UHD utility applications and examples have a
       --args parameter that takes a device address, where the device  address
       is   expressed  as  a  delimited  string.   See  the  documentation  in
       types/device_addr.hpp for reference.

       Every device has several ways of identifying it on the host system.

   Identifying by hardware identifier
       All Ettus Research devices can be found through their  hardware  series
       identifier, which match to devices as follows:

       Argument       |  Device

       type=usrp1     |  USRP1

       type=usrp2     |  USRP2, USRP N200, USRP N210

       type=b100      |  USRP B100

       type=b200      |  USRP B200, USRP B210

       type=e3x0      |  USRP E310

       type=x300      |  USRP X300, USRP X310

       type=octoclock |  OctoClock

   Identifying by serial number
       All  Ettus Research devices are given a unique serial number, which can
       be used to identify a device as follows:

       serial=12345678

   Identifying by IP address
       USRP2, USRP N200, USRP  N210,  USRP  X300,  USRP  X310,  and  OctoClock
       devices connected to the host machine can all be found through their IP
       addresses, as follows:

       addr=192.168.10.2

   Identifying by name
       Users have the option of giving their devices  short  names  using  the
       usrp_burn_mb_eeprom     and    octoclock_burn_eeprom    utilities    in
       lib/uhd/utils. Devices that have been given a name can be identified as
       follows:

       name=foo

EXAMPLES
   Device discovery via command line
       Device  address  arguments  can  be supplied to narrow the scope of the
       search.

       uhd_find_devices --args="type=usrp1"

       -- OR --

       uhd_find_devices --args="serial=12345678"
