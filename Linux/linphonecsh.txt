NAME
       linphonecsh - Sends a command to a linphonec running in daemon mode, and exits.

SYNTAX
       linphonecsh init  <optional linphonec args>
       linphonecsh exit
       linphonecsh generic  <linphonec command line surrounded by quotes>
       linphonecsh register  --username <username> --host <proxy> --password <password>
       linphonecsh unregister
       linphonecsh dial <sip address or number>
       linphonecsh status <domain = one of 'register', 'hook', 'autoanswer'>
       linphonecsh --help

DESCRIPTION
       Linphonecsh  is  a  small utility to send basic commands to a linphonec (console mode linphone) process.  Unlike linphonec, linphonecsh does not wait commands from standard input: it takes the command
       from its arguments and sends it using unix pipe to a linphonec process started in daemon mode.  The motivation for this tool is for example to simply execute voip calls from scripts,  web-servers,  or
       javascript web pages.

       The very first thing to do before doing actions is to ask linphonecsh to spawn a linphonec daemon using

       linphonecsh init
              The resulting linphonec daemon does not read or write any configuration file.

              When the linphonec daemon is no more needed, the following commands makes it exit properly:

       linphonecsh exit

FILES
       By default a linphonec started as a daemon by 'linphonecsh init' does not use a config file.
