NAME
       mhc - Message Harmonized Calendaring system

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mhc file format.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

FIELDS
       Mhc file format is based on STD11/RFC822: Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages.  In mhc file, the following extra header fields are used.

       X-SC-Day:
              Date of event in format yyyymmdd.  You can specify multiple date with space separated like:

                 X-SC-Day: 19990409 19990413

              which means April 9th 1999 and April 13th 1999.

       X-SC-Time:
              Time of event in format hh:mm-hh:mm or hh:mm.  For event which has no meanings about time, you can leave it empty in this field.

       X-SC-Duration:
              Period  of  event  in yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd.  You can omit start date or end date, like "19991121-".  X-SC-Duration: is used only to limit date specified by X-SC-Day: or X-SC-Cond, so you can't
              describe event date only by X-SC-Duration:.  If X-SC-Duration: is empty, it means no limit.

       X-SC-Cond:
              Condition of event date by using following keyword.

                 00-31 Day of month.

                 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th Last Week in month.

                 X-SC-Cond: 31 Aug
                        Every August 31th.
