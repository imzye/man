NAME
       owperl - perl interface for the 1-wire filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       OW.pm
       use OW ;
       OW::init( interface );
       OW::init( initialization string );

       The full set of initialization options is extensive. They correspond roughly to the command line options of ,B owfs (1) owhttpd (1) and owftpd (1)
       OW::get( path );
       OW::put( path , value );
       OW::finish();

DESCRIPTION
   1-Wire
       1-wire is a wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector scheme where the data line can also provide
       power.

       Each  device  is  uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage, contact, current), switches,
       timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also 1-wire devices that have encryption included.

       The 1-wire scheme uses a single bus master and multiple slaves on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be individually discovered  and  addressed  using  their
       unique ID.

       Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB adapters.

   OWFS design
       OWFS  is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique ID being the direc‐
       tory, and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.

       Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or  control  ap‐
       plications.  There  are  some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundamental
       goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed.

   owperl
       owperl (3) is a perl module that provides an interface to OWFS. The path to each 1-wire device is the same as owfs (1) . Only the top layer has been modified to return native perl strings.

       owperl (3) is created by swig (1) (http://www.swig.org) which can be easily modified to support other programming languages.

FUNCTIONS
   OW::init( interface )
       interface
       Location of the 1-wire bus:

       "u"    Direct connection to the 1-wire interface on the USB port -- DS9490

       /dev/ttySx
              Direct connection to a 1-wire interface on the serial port -- DS9097U or DS9097

       port | :port | IPaddress:port
              Location of an owserver daemon that connects to the 1-wire bus. Multiple owperl as well as owfs and owhttpd programs can access the owserver process simultaneously. In fact, this will prob‐
              ably be the preferred mode of access to OWFS for owperl except in trivial applications.

EXAMPLE
       perl -MOW -e "OW::init('/dev/ttyS1'); printf OW::get('');"
