NAME
       pam_snapper - PAM module which creates filesystem snapshots via "snapper"

SYNOPSIS
       pam_snapper.so [debug] [homeprefix=prefix] [ignoreservices=services] [ignoreusers=users] [rootasroot] [ignoreroot] [openonly] [closeonly] [cleanup=algorithm]

DESCRIPTION
       Create a snapshot at every login of a user, thus he or she always has a save starting point.

       As many users do not logout for some time, it is a good idea to enable snapper's time based snapshots in addition.

OPTIONS
       debug
           Switch on debugging in the module.

       homeprefix=prefix
           Prefix for the name of the snapper configuration. The username will be appended to this prefix.

           Default: "home_"

       ignoreservices=comma separated list of services
           Default: "crond"

       ignoreusers=comma separated list of users
           Default: (none)

       rootasroot
           Perform a snapshot using the snapper configuration "root" if the user "root" logs in. In other words: the homeprefix is not used in this case. As the snapper configuration "root" is used for the
           system (the root filesystem), this means that with every login of the user "root" the complete "/" filesystem will be snapshotted. This can be useful to help administrators rolling back in case
           their activity / configuration changes have been accidentally wrong.

           "rootasroot" and "ignoreroot" are mutually exclusive.

       ignoreroot
           No snapshot is taken, if the user "root" opens/closes a session.

           "rootasroot" and "ignoreroot" are mutually exclusive.

       openonly
           Only create a single snapshot when opening the PAM session.

           Default: create pre- and post-snapshots

       closeonly
           Only create a single snapshot when closing the PAM session.

           Default: create pre- and post-snapshots

       cleanup=cleanup-algorithm
           Set snapper cleanup algorithm.

           Default: (none)

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Only the module type "session" is provided.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
           pam_snapper will always return PAM_SUCCESS, to not prevent users from login, in case a snapshot fails. This may change in the future.

EXAMPLES
   Basic usage
        1. Create a btrfs subvolume for the new user and a snapper configuration, e.g. using the tool /usr/lib/pam_snapper/pam_snapper_useradd.sh.

        2. Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session:

               session    optional    pam_snapper.so

AUTHORS
       pam-snapper was written by Matthias G. Eckermann <mge@suse.com> as part of SUSE Hackweek#9 in April 2013.

       This module would not have been possible without the work of Arvin Schnell on the snapper project. pam-snapper inherits DBUS handling from "snapper_dbus_cli.c" by David Disseldorp.

       The module builds on the Linux PAM stack and its documentation, written by Thorsten Kukuk.
