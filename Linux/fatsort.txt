NAME
       fatsort - FAT sorting tool

SYNOPSIS
       fatsort [OPTIONS] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       FATSort  sorts  directory structures of FAT file systems (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and exFAT). Many MP3 hardware players don't sort files automatically but play them in the  order they were transferred
       to the device. FATSort can help here.

       Sort options:

       -a     Use ASCIIbetical order for sorting

       -c     Ignore case of file names (default for most locales)

       -I PFX Ignore file name PFX

       -n     Natural order sorting

       -o FLAG Sort order of files where FLAG is one of

              d : directories first (default)

              f : files first

              a : files and directories are not differentiated

       -r     Sort in reverse order

       -R     Sort in random order

              This options makes all other sort options obsolete.

       -t     Sort by last modification date and time

       The following options can be specified multiple times to select which directories shall be sorted:

       -d DIR Sort directory DIR only

       -D DIR Sort directory DIR and all subdirectories

       -x DIR Don't sort directory DIR

       -X DIR Don't sort directory DIR and its subdirectories

       The following options can be specified multiple times to select which directories shall be sorted using POSIX.2 extended regular expressions:

       -e RE  Only sort directories that match regular expression RE

       -E RE  Don't sort directories that match regular expression RE

       However, options -e and -E may not be used simultaneously with options -d, -D, -x and -X.

       -L LOC Use the locale LOC instead of the locale from the environment variables

       More options:

       -l     Print current order of files only

       -i     Print file system information only

       -f     Force sorting even if file system is mounted

       -h, --help

              Print some help

       -v, --version

              Print version information

       -q     Be quiet

       DEVICE must be a FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT file system.

       WARNING: THE FILESYSTEM MUST BE CONSISTENT (NO FILESYSTEM ERRORS).  PLEASE BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFORE USING FATSORT. RISK OF CORRUPT FILESYSTEM!  FATSORT USER ASSUMES ALL RISK. FATSORT  WILL  NOT  BE
       HELD LIABLE FOR DATA LOSS!
