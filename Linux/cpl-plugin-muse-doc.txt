NAME
       muse_create_sky - Create night sky model from selected pixels of an exposure of empty sky.

SYNOPSIS
       esorex muse_create_sky [OPTIONS] FILE.sof

DESCRIPTION
       This recipe creates the continuum and the atmospheric transition line spectra of the night sky from the data in a pixel table(s) belonging to one exposure of (mostly) empty sky.

OPTIONS
       --fraction <float>
              Fraction  of  the  image  (without the ignored part) to be considered as sky. If an input sky mask is provided, the fraction is applied to the regions within the mask. If the whole sky
              mask should be used, set this parameter to 1. (float; default: 0.75). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is muse.muse_create_sky.fraction [default = 0.75].

       --ignore <float>
              Fraction of the image to be ignored. If an input sky mask is provided, the fraction is applied to the regions within the mask. If the whole sky mask should be used, set this  parameter
              to 0. (float; default: 0.05). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is muse.muse_create_sky.ignore [default = 0.05].

       --sampling <float>
              Spectral  sampling  of the sky spectrum [Angstrom]. (float; default: 0.3125). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is muse.muse_create_sky.sampling [default =
              0.3125].

       --csampling <float>
              Spectral sampling of the continuum spectrum [Angstrom]. (float; default: 0.3125). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is muse.muse_create_sky.csampling  [de‐
              fault = 0.3125].

       --crsigma <str>
              Sigma  level clipping for cube-based and spectrum-based CR rejection.  This has to be a string of two comma-separated floating-point numbers.  The first value gives the sigma-level re‐
              jection for cube-based CR rejection (using "median", see muse_scipost), the second value the sigma-level for spectrum-based CR cleaning. Both can be switched off, by passing zero or  a
              negative value. (str; default: ´15.,15.´). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is muse.muse_create_sky.crsigma [default = 15.,15.].

       --lambdamin <float>
              Cut  off  the  data  below  this wavelength after loading the pixel table(s). (float; default: 4000.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is muse.muse_cre‐
              ate_sky.lambdamin [default = 4000.0].

       --lambdamax <float>
              Cut off the data above this wavelength after loading the pixel table(s). (float; default: 10000.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex  configuration  file  is  muse.muse_cre‐
              ate_sky.lambdamax [default = 10000.0].

       --lambdaref <float>
              Reference  wavelength  used for correction of differential atmospheric refraction. The R-band (peak wavelength ~7000 Angstrom) that is usually used for guiding, is close to the central
              wavelength of MUSE, so a value of 7000.0 Angstrom should be used if nothing else is known.  A value less than zero switches DAR correction off. (float; default: 7000.0). The full  name
              of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is muse.muse_create_sky.lambdaref [default = 7000.0].

       Note that it is possible to create a configuration file containing these options, along with suitable default values. Please refer to the details provided by the 'esorex --help' command.
