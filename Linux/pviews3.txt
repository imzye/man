NAME
       pviews3 - Python 3 Pyramid command

DESCRIPTION
       usage: pviews3 [-h] [config_uri] [url] [config_vars ...]

       Print, for a given URL, the views that might match. Underneath each potentially matching route, list the predicates required. Underneath each route+predicate
       set, print each view that might match and its predicates.

       This command accepts two positional arguments: 'config_uri' specifies the PasteDeploy config file to use for  the  interactive  shell.  The  format  is  'in‐
       ifile#name'.  If the name is left off, 'main' will be assumed.  'url' specifies the path info portion of a URL that will be used to find matching views.  Ex‐
       ample: 'proutes myapp.ini#main /url'

   positional arguments:
       config_uri
              The URI to the configuration file.

       url    The path info portion of the URL.

       config_vars
              Variables required by the config file. For example, `http_port=%(http_port)s` would expect `http_port=8080` to be passed here.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit
