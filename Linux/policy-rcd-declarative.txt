SERVICE-POLICY.D(5)                                                                                                                                                                     SERVICE-POLICY.D(5)

NAME
       /etc/service-policy.d/*.pol - configuration for policy-rc.d-declarative

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/service-policy.d/*.pol

DESCRIPTION
       Files in the directory /etc/service-policy.d are opened and parsed by the policy-rc.d-declarative script. Lines should have exactly three fields of data which are separated by whitespace; any
       trailing whitespace is ignored.

       All files are opened in order by file name; following that, all rules in a file are evaluated in order.

       The first rule that matches a given service with a given action is applied. All further rules are ignored.

       If no rule matches a given service with a given action, the default is to exit with exit state 100, which signals "unknown initscript id" to the calling update-rc.d program.

FIELDS
       The file contains the following fields:

       1.  The service(s) to which this should apply. This should be a perl regular expression that matches the init scripts for which this policy should be used.

       2.  The action(s) which invoke-rc.d wants to take. For more information on the available actions, see /usr/share/doc/init-system-helpers/README.policy-rc.d.gz.

       3.  The policy to apply to this action. Available policies are:

           allow
               Allow the action that invoke-rc.d wants to perform without modification

           deny
               Do not allow the action.

           restart-ignore
               Replace the action that invoke-rc.d wants to perform by "restart stop".  That is, try a restart action first; if that fails for some reason, try a stop action.

               Note that at the time of this writing, not all PID1 implementations support this. Notably, the systemd version of invoke-rc.d does not support overriding actions.
