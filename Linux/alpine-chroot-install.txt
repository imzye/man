NAME
       alpine-chroot-install - bootstrap an Alpine Linux chroot

SYNOPSIS
       alpine-chroot-install -d /directory [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This script installs Alpine Linux into a chroot and optionally sets up qemu-user and binfmt to emulate different architecture (e.g. armhf).

OPTIONS AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       -a ARCH
              CPU  architecture  for  the  chroot. If not set, then it's the same as the host's architecture. If it's different from the host's architecture, then it will be emulated using qemu-user. Op‐
              tions: x86_64, x86, aarch64, armhf, armv7, ppc64le, riscv64, s390x.

       -b ALPINE_BRANCH
              Alpine branch to install (default is latest-stable).

       -d CHROOT_DIR
              Absolute path to the directory where Alpine chroot should be installed; Debian's version of this script requires giving this explicitly -- such as -d /alpine

       -i BIND_DIR
              Absolute path to the directory on the host system that should be mounted on the same path inside the chroot (default is PWD, if it's under /home, or none).

       -k CHROOT_KEEP_VARS
              Names of the environment variables to pass from the host environment into chroot by the enter-chroot script. Name may be an extended regular  expression.   Default:  ARCH  CI  QEMU_EMULATOR
              TRAVIS_.*.

       -m ALPINE_MIRROR
              URI of the Aports mirror to fetch packages from (default is http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine).

       -p ALPINE_PACKAGES
              Alpine packages to install into the chroot (default is build-base ca-certificates ssl_client).

       -r EXTRA_REPOS
              Alpine repositories to be added to /etc/apk/repositories (main and community from $ALPINE_MIRROR are always added).

       -t TEMP_DIR
              Absolute path to the directory where to store temporary files (defaults to `mktemp -d`).

       -h     Show this help message and exit.

       -v     Print version and exit.

       APK_TOOLS_URI
              URL of apk.static to download. Default is x86_64 binary from https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/apk-tools/-/packages.

       APK_TOOLS_SHA256
              SHA-256 checksum of $APK_TOOLS_URI.

       Each option can be also provided by environment variable. If both option and variable is specified and the option accepts only one argument, then the option takes precedence.

AFTER INSTALL
       This tool also creates script "enter-chroot" inside the chroot directory, that may be used to enter the chroot environment. That script do the following:

              1. saves environment variables specified by $CHROOT_KEEP_VARS and PWD,

              2. chroots into $CHROOT_DIR,

              3. starts clean environment using "env -i",

              4. switches user and simulates full login using "su -l",

              5. loads saved environment variables and changes directory to saved PWD,

              6. executes specified command or "sh" if not provided.

       Example:
       sudo alpine-chroot-install -d /alpine -p build-base -p cmake
       /alpine/enter-chroot -u $USER ./build
