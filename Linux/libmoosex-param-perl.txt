NAME
       MooseX::Param - Simple role to provide a standard param method

SYNOPSIS
         package My::Template::System;
         use Moose;

         with 'MooseX::Param';

         # ...

         my $template = My::Template::System->new(
             params => {
                 foo => 10,
                 bar => 20,
                 baz => 30,
             }
         );

         # fetching params
         $template->param('foo'); # 10

         # getting list of params
         $template->param(); # foo, bar, baz

         # setting params
         $template->param(foo => 30, bar => 100);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a very simple Moose role which provides a CGI like "param" method.

       I found that I had written this code over and over and over and over again, and each time it was the same. So I thought, why not put it in a role?

ATTRIBUTES
       params
           This role provides a "params" attribute which has a read-only accessor, and a HashRef type constraint. It also adds a builder method (see "init_params" method below) to properly initialize it.

METHODS
       params
           Return the HASH ref in which the parameters are stored.

       param
           This  is  your  standard  CGI style "param" method. If passed no arguments, it will return a list of param names. If passed a single name argument it will return the param associated with that
           name. If passed a key value pair (or set of key value pairs) it will assign them into the params.

       init_params
           This is the params attribute "builder" option, so it is called the params are initialized.

           NOTE: You can override this by defining your own version in your class, because local class methods beat role methods in composition.

       meta
           Returns the role metaclass.

SIMILAR MODULES
       The "param" method can be found in several other modules, such as CGI, CGI::Application and HTML::Template to name a few. This is such a common Perl idiom that I felt it really deserved  it's  own
       role (if for nothing more than I was sick of re-writing and copy-pasting it all the time).

       There are also a few modules which attempt to solve the same problem as this module. Those are:

       Class::Param
           This  module is much more ambitious than mine, and provides much deeper functionality. For most of my purposes, this module would have been overkill, but if you need really sophisticated param
           handling and the ability to provide several different APIs (tied, etc), this module is probably the way to go.

       Mixin::ExtraFields::Param
           This module is very similar to mine, but for a different framework. It works with the Mixin::ExtraFields framework.

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to cpan-RT.
