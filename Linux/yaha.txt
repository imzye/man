NAME
       YAHA - find split-read mappings on single-end queries

DESCRIPTION
       Usage (Default parameter values shown in parenthesis):

       To create an index: yaha -g genomeFilename [-H maxHits (65525)] [-L wordLen (15)] [-S Skip-distance (1)] The genome file can be a FASTA file, or a nib2 file (created by a previous yaha index oper‐
       ation).

       To align queries: yaha -x yahaIndexFile [-q queryFile|(stdin)] [-o8|(-osh)|-oss outputFile|(stdout)][AdditionalOptions] The query file can be either a FASTA file or a FASTQ file.  -o8     produces
       alignment  output  in  modified  Blast8  format.   -osh     produces  alignment  output  in SAM format with hard clipping.  -oss    produces alignment output in SAM format with soft clipping.  [-t
       numThreads (1)]

   Additional General Alignment Options:
              [-BW BandWidth (5)] [-G maxGap (50)] [-H maxHits (650)] [-M minMatch (25)] [-MD MaxDesert (50)] [-P minPercent-identity (0.9)] [-X Xdropoff (25)]

       [-AGS (Y)|N] controls use of Affine Gap Scoring.  If -AGS is off, a simple edit distance calculation is done.  If on, the following are used:

              [-GEC GapExtensionCost (2)] [-GOC GapOpenCost (5)] [-MS MatchScore (1)] [-RC ReplacementCost (3)]

       [-OQC (Y)|N] controls use of the Optimal Query Coverage Algorithm.  If -OQC if off, all alignments meeting above criteria are output.  If on, a set of "primary" alignments are found that optimally
       cover the length of the query, using the following options:

              [-BP BreakpointPenalty (5)] [-MGDP MaxGenomicDistancePenalty (5)] [-MNO MinNonOverlap (minMatch)]

       The cost of inserting a breakpoint in the Optimal Coverage Set is BP*MIN(MGDP, Log10(genomic distance between reference loci)).

       [-FBS Y|(N)] controls inclusion of "secondary" alignments similar to a primary alignment found using OQC.  If -FBS is on, the following are used.  A "secondary" alignemnt must satisfy BOTH  crite‐
       ria.

              [-PRL PercentReciprocalLength (0.9)] [-PSS PercentSimilarScore (0.9)]

       Additional  experimental  parameters:  To  compress  a  FASTA  file  to  a nib2 file without creating an index: yaha -g fastaGenomeFile -c To uncompress a nib2 file back into a FASTA file: yaha -g
       nib2GenomeFile -u For finer control of alignments: [-I maxIntron (maxGap)] allows separate control of max deletion size vs. maxGap for insertion size.  For a more detailed help message, type  yaha
       -xh.

       --version is not a valid option.
