DBIx::Class::Candy::Exports(3pm)                                                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                    DBIx::Class::Candy::Exports(3pm)

NAME
       DBIx::Class::Candy::Exports - Create sugar for your favorite ORM, DBIx::Class

SYNOPSIS
        package DBIx::Class::Widget;

        sub create_a_widget { ... }

        # so you don't depend on ::Candy
        eval {
          require DBIx::Class::Candy::Exports;
          DBIx::Class::Candy::Exports->import;
          export_methods ['create_a_widget'];
          export_method_aliases {
            widget => 'create_a_widget'
          };
        }

        1;

       The above will make it such that users of your component who use it with DBIx::Class::Candy will have the methods you designate exported into their namespace.

DESCRIPTION
       The whole point of this module is to make sugar a first class citizen in the component world that dominates DBIx::Class.  I make enough components and like this sugar idea enough that I want to be
       able to have both at the same time.

IMPORTED SUBROUTINES
   export_methods
        export_methods [qw( foo bar baz )];

       Use this subroutine to define methods that get exported as subroutines of the same name.

        export_method_aliases {
          old_method_name => 'new_sub_name',
        };
