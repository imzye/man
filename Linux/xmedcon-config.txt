NAME
       xmedcon-config - script to get info about the installed version of (X)MedCon

SYNOPSIS
       xmedcon-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
  xmedcon-config  is  a  tool  that  is  used to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the (X)MedCon library. It is also used internally to the .m4
  macro, included for GNU autoconf.

OPTIONS
       --version
              Print the currently installed version of (X)MedCon on the standard output.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an (X)MedCon depended program.

       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile an (X)MedCon depended program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that (X)MedCon was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used  for  the  exec
              prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
              If  specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that (X)MedCon was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified be‐
              fore any --libs or --cflags options.
