       rently it generates 7 files:

       manual2.html
              Server commands

       manual3.html

       manual5.html
              Wonders

BUGS
       This  tool  is currently only really of use to the Freeciv maintainers,
       as a starting point for pages on the main Freeciv wiki; it's  not  very
       useful to end users.

       Known  shortcomings  include  that it is missing many ruleset features,
       and is hardcoded to output a mixture of MediaWiki markup and HTML.

REPORTING BUGS
       Report bugs at https://osdn.net/projects/freeciv/ticket/ (but see above
       caveats).
