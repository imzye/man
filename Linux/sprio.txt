NAME
       sprio - view the factors that comprise a job's scheduling priority

SYNOPSIS
       sprio [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       sprio  is  used  to view the components of a job's scheduling priority when the multi-factor priority plugin is installed.  sprio is a read-only utility that extracts information from the multi-factor
       priority plugin.  By default, sprio returns information for all pending jobs.  Options exist to display specific jobs by job ID and user name.

OPTIONS
       --federation
              Show jobs in federation if a member of one.

       -h, --noheader
              Do not print a header on the output.

       --help Print a help message describing all options sprio.

       -j <job_id_list>, --jobs=<job_id_list>
              Requests a comma separated list of job ids to display.  Defaults to all jobs. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper parsing the single letter option must be followed  immediately
              with the value and not include a space between them. For example "-j1008,1009" and not "-j 1008,1009".

       --local
              Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation (if any). Overrides --federation.

       -l, --long
              Report more of the available information for the selected jobs.

       -M, --clusters=<string>
              The cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.  Note that the SlurmDBD must be up for this option to work properly.  This option implicitly sets the --local option.

       -n, --norm
              Display the normalized priority factors for the selected jobs.

       -o <output_format>, --format=<output_format>
              Specify the information to be displayed, its size and position (right or left justified).  The default formats when all factors have been assigned non-zero weights are

              default        "%.15i %9r %.10Y %.10S %.10A %.10B %.10F %.10J %.10P %.10Q %20T"

              -l, --long     "%.15i %9r %.8u %.10Y %.10S %.10A %.10B %.10F %.10J %.10P %.10Q %.11N %.20T";

              The format of each field is "%[.][size]type".

              size    is the minimum field size.  If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information will be used.

               .      indicates the output should be left justified.  By default, output is right justified.

              Valid type specifications include:

              %a  Normalized age priority

              %A  Weighted age priority

              %b  Normalized association priority

              %B  Weighted association priority

              %c  Cluster name. Only applicable for federated clusters

              %f  Normalized fair-share priority

              %F  Weighted fair-share priority

              %i  Job ID

              %j  Normalized job size priority

              %J  Weighted job size priority

              %N  Nice adjustment

              %p  Normalized partition priority

              %P  Weighted partition priority

              %q  Normalized quality of service priority

              %Q  Weighted quality of service priority

              %r  Partition name

              %S  Weighted admin priority.

              %t  Normalized TRES priorities

              %T  Weighted TRES priorities

              %u  User name for a job

              %Y  Job priority

              %y  Normalized job priority

       -S <sort_list>, --sort=<sort_list>
              Specification of the order in which jobs should be reported. This uses the same field specification as <output_format>. Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields separated
              by commas. The field specifications may be preceded by "+" or "-" for ascending (default) or descending respectively.  For example, a <sort_list> of "u,r,-y" will sort the job priority  reports
              by username, partition name, and descending job priority, in that order. The default <sort_list> is "i" (ascending job id).

       -p <partition_list>, --partition=<partition_list>
              Requests a comma separated list of partitions to display.  Defaults to all partitions.

       --sibling
              Show  all  sibling  jobs  on a federated cluster. Without this option in a federated cluster, each job in each partition will have its priority and its components reported for only one cluster.
              Each sibling job on the various clusters in the federation may have different priority, which will not be reported without using this option. Implicitly adds "%c" (cluster name) to  the  output
              format.

       -u <user_list>, --user=<user_list>
              Request jobs from a comma separated list of users.  The list can consist of user names or user id numbers.

       --usage
              Print a brief help message listing the sprio options.

       -v, --verbose
              Report details of sprios actions.

       -V , --version
              Print version information and exit.

       -w , --weights
              Display the configured weights for each factor.  This is for information purposes only.  Actual job data is suppressed.

PERFORMANCE
       Executing  sprio  sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from sprio or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmctld daemon come in at once, it can
       result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run sprio or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to sprio  to  the  minimum
       necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       If no corresponding command line option is specified, sprio will use the value of the following environment variables.

       SLURM_CLUSTERS      Same as --clusters

       SLURM_CONF          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       SPRIO_FEDERATION    Same as --federation

       SPRIO_FORMAT        Same as -o <output_format>, --format=<output_format>

       SPRIO_LOCAL         Same as --local

       SPRIO_SIBLING       Same as --sibling
