NAME
       scoary - pangenome-wide association studies

SYNOPSIS
       scoary  [-h]  [-t  TRAITS]  [-g  GENES]  [-n  NEWICKTREE]  [-s START_COL] [--delimiter DELIMITER] [-r RESTRICT_TO] [-o OUTDIR] [-u] [-p P_VALUE_CUTOFF [P_VALUE_CUTOFF ...]]  [-c [{I,B,BH,PW,EPW,P}
       [{I,B,BH,PW,EPW,P} ...]]] [-m MAX_HITS] [--include_input_columns GRABCOLS] [-w] [--no-time] [-e PERMUTE] [--no_pairwise] [--collapse] [--threads THREADS] [--test] [--citation] [--version]

OPTIONS
   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

   Input options:
       -t TRAITS, --traits TRAITS
              Input trait table (comma-separated-values). Trait presence is indicated by 1, trait absence by 0.  Assumes strain names in the first column and trait names in the first row

       -g GENES, --genes GENES
              Input gene presence/absence table (comma-separatedvalues) from ROARY. Strain names must be equal to those in the trait table

       -n NEWICKTREE, --newicktree NEWICKTREE
              Supply a custom tree (Newick format) for phylogenetic analyses instead instead of calculating it internally.

       -s START_COL, --start_col START_COL
              On which column in the gene presence/absence file do individual strain info start. Default=15. (1-based indexing)

       --delimiter DELIMITER
              The delimiter between cells in the gene presence/absence and trait files, as well as the output file.

       -r RESTRICT_TO, --restrict_to RESTRICT_TO
              Use if you only want to analyze a subset of your strains. Scoary will read the provided comma-separated table of strains and restrict analyzes to these.

   Output options:
       -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
              Directory to place output files. Default = .

       -u, --upgma_tree
              This flag will cause Scoary to write the calculated UPGMA tree to a newick file

       -p P_VALUE_CUTOFF [P_VALUE_CUTOFF ...], --p_value_cutoff P_VALUE_CUTOFF [P_VALUE_CUTOFF ...]
              P-value cut-off / alpha level. For Fishers, Bonferronis, and Benjamini-Hochbergs tests, SCOARY will not report genes with higher p-values than this.  For empirical p-values, this is treated
              as an alpha level instead. I.e. 0.02 will filter all genes except the lower and upper percentile from this test. Run with "-p 1.0" to report all genes. Accepts standard  form  (e.g.  1E-8).
              Provide a single value (applied to all) or exactly as many values as correction criteria and in corresponding order. (See example under correction). Default = 0.05

       -c [{I,B,BH,PW,EPW,P} [{I,B,BH,PW,EPW,P} ...]], --correction [{I,B,BH,PW,EPW,P} [{I,B,BH,PW,EPW,P} ...]]
              Apply  the indicated filtration measure. Allowed values are I, B, BH, PW, EPW, P. I=Individual (naive) p-value. B=Bonferroni adjusted p-value. BH=BenjaminiHochberg adjusted p. PW=Best (low‐
              est) pairwise comparison. EPW=Entire range of pairwise comparison p-values. P=Empirical p-value from permutations. You can enter as many correction criteria as you would like. These will be
              associated with the p_value_cutoffs you enter. For example "-c I EPW -p 0.1 0.05" will apply the following cutoffs: Naive p-value must be lower than 0.1 AND the  entire  range  of  pairwise
              comparison  values  are  below 0.05 for this gene. Note that the empirical p-values should be interpreted at both tails. Therefore, running "-c P -p 0.05" will apply an alpha of 0.05 to the
              empirical (permuted) p-values, i.e. it will filter everything except the upper and lower 2.5 percent of the distribution. Default = Individual p-value. (I)

       -m MAX_HITS, --max_hits MAX_HITS
              Maximum number of hits to report. SCOARY will only report the top max_hits results per trait

       --include_input_columns GRABCOLS
              Grab columns from the input Roary file. and puts them in the output. Handles comma and ranges, e.g.  --include_input_columns 4,6,8,16-23. The special keyword ALL will include  all  relevant
              input columns in the output

       -w, --write_reduced
              Use  with  -r if you want Scoary to create a new gene presence absence file from your reduced set of isolates. Note: Columns 1-14 (No. sequences, Avg group size nuc etc) in this file do not
              reflect the reduced dataset. These are taken from the full dataset.

       --no-time
              Output file in the form TRAIT.results.csv, instead of TRAIT_TIMESTAMP.csv. When used with the -w argument will output a reduced gene matrix  in  the  form  gene_presence_absence_reduced.csv
              rather than gene_presence_absence_reduced_TIMESTAMP.csv

   Analysis options:
       -e PERMUTE, --permute PERMUTE
              Perform  N number of permutations of the significant results post-analysis. Each permutation will do a label switching of the phenotype and a new p-value is calculated according to this new
              dataset. After all N permutations are completed, the results are ordered in ascending order, and the percentile of the original result in the permuted p-value distribution is reported.

       --no_pairwise
              Do not perform pairwise comparisons. Inthis mode, Scoary will perform population structure-naive calculations only. (Fishers test, ORs etc). Useful  for  summary  operations  and  exploring
              sets. (Genes unique in groups, intersections etc) but not causal analyses.

       --collapse
              Add this to collapse correlated genes (genes that have identical distribution patterns in the sample) into merged units.

   Misc options:
       --threads THREADS
              Number of threads to use. Default = 1

       --test Run Scoary on the test set in exampledata, overriding all other parameters.

       --citation
              Show citation information, and exit.

       --version
              Display Scoary version, and exit.
