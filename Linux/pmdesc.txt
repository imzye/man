PMDESC(1)             User Contributed Perl Documentation            PMDESC(1)

NAME
       pmdesc - print out version and whatis description of perl modules

DESCRIPTION
       Given one or more module names, show the version number (if known) and
       the 'whatis' line, that is, the NAME section's description, typically
       used for generation of whatis databases.

EXAMPLES
           $ pmdesc IO::Socket
           IO::Socket (1.25) - Object interface to socket communications

           $ oldperl pmdesc IO::Socket
           IO::Socket (1.1603) - Object interface to socket communications

           $ pmdesc `pminst -s | perl -lane 'print $F[1] if $F[0] =~ /site/'`
           XML::Parser::Expat (2.19) - Lowlevel access to James Clark's expat XML parser
           XML::Parser (2.19) - A perl module for parsing XML documents

RESTRICTIONS
       This only works on modules.  It should also work on filenames, but then
       it's a bit tricky finding out the package to call the VERSION method
       on.
