GET-NEWS(8)                                                                               System Manager's Manual                                                                               GET-NEWS(8)

NAME
       get-news - Debian Suck front end

SYNOPSIS
       get-news [ sitename ] [ -h ] [ -outgoingfile filename ] [ -userid userid ] [ -password password ] [ -noauth ] [ -port port ] [ -server sitename ] [ -q ] [ -getonly ] [ -postonly ] [ -timestamp ] [
       -verbose ]

       sitename

       The name of the site get-news should connect. If this parameter is specified, it will be used for multiple purposes, setting:

        - the DNS name of the NNTP host which get-news will connect to download and upload articles

        - the suffix for some configuration files get-news will use (sucknewsrc, active-ignore, suckkillfile)

        - the news feed name (name of the file in /var/spool/news/outgoing which contain list of the articles to be send)

       For  example, running the command get-news news.provider.site causes the script to contact news.provider.site, send messages listed in /var/spool/news/outgoing/news.provider.site (according to the
       feed of this name defined in /etc/news/newsfeeds) and use /etc/suck/sucknewsrc.news.provider.site as list of newsgroups, /etc/suck/suckkillfile.news.provider.site as killfile and (in  case  -A  or
       -AL is specified in get-news.conf) suit newsgroup list to /etc/suck/active-ignore.news.provider.site.

       When  the  sitename  parameter is missing (like when get-news is run without parameters), get-news uses parameters from get-news.conf (remoteserver to specify the host, outgoingfile to specify the
       feed) and no-suffix configuration files (sucknewsrc, active-ignore, suckkillfile).

       -outgoingfile filename

       This option tells get-news to use an alternate remote server outgoing articles filename, instead of the default, the remote server name.

       -userid userid

       -password password

       These two options let you specify a userid and password, if your NNTP server requires them.

       -noauth

       This option tells get-news to not send userid and password, even if they are specified in /etc/suck/get-news.conf.

       -port port

       This option let you specify a port number, if your NNTP server has a non standard one.

       -server sitename

       This option tells get-news to use sitename as your local NNTP server, instead of the default, localhost.

       -q

       Be quiet.  Do not display the BPS and article count messages during download.  Multiple -q's makes get-news shut up

       -getonly

       Only get new news, don't post anything outgoing.

       -postonly

       Only post outgoing news, don't get anything.

       -timestamp Add timestamps to the get-news.log and verbose output.

       -verbose Give more messages about what get-news is doing.  Specified multiple times, debugging output is enabled.

GET-NEWS.CONF
       Suck looks for a file get-news.conf in /etc/suck to initialize some defaults and set some options that are not available on the command line.
