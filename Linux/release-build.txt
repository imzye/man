NAME
       release-build - convenient script for "building" an upstream project, prior to release to Ubuntu

SYNOPSIS
       release-build

ASSUMPTIONS
       This script, along with its partner, release(1), require a particular set of project parameters to operate properly.
        * The project must use bzr(1) and http://launchpad.net
        * The project name, [FOO], must match its Launchpad project, http://launchpad.net/[FOO]
        * There must be a corresponding Launchpad team, also matching the same name, http://launchpad.net/~[FOO]
        * The team must have a PPA activated, named "ppa"
        * The project must use a MAJOR.MINOR versioning scheme

DESCRIPTION
       This script will work on a bzr(1) branch with debian packaging in the current directory.  It will:
        * automatically determine the project/package name and version by parsing the debian/changelog file
        * clean out the build-area
        * create an original tarball
        * check the original tarball for common mistakes
        * build a local binary deb
        * build a set of source packages, for each of a set of supported Ubuntu releases

       After the script performs these actions, the next steps are printed to the screen, for the user to copy-and-paste.  These steps include:
        * the command to install the package locally (for testing)
        * the release command, to move on and make it official
        * also the command to revert the changes to the debian/changelog

EXAMPLES
       For sample projects/packages that use the release and release-build commands for publishing, see:
        * bikeshed
        * byobu
        * ecryptfs
        * musica
        * pictor
        * powernap
        * screenbin
        * testdrive
