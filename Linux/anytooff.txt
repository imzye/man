anytooff(1gv)                                                    anytooff(1gv)

NAME
       anytooff  - filter to convert a (set of) geomview data file(s) contain‐
       ing any geomview primitives into a single polylist.

SYNOPSIS
       anytooff  [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Anytooff reads OOGL geometry data (from the given files, if any, other‐
       wise  from standard input) and outputs the new polylist (in OFF format)
       to standard output.  Offcombine is a synonym for anytooff.

BUGS
       In converting a list object, anytooff uses PLCombine(3)  to  merge  the
       members  of the list.  PLCombine(3) has certain limitations with regard
       to the way in handles color and normal data; see its  manual  page  for
       details.

       When  vector  objects are switched into polylists, they are transformed
       into polygons with two vertices.  The faces of  the  polygons  are  the
       same  color  as the given vectors, but the edges of the polygons, which
       are their only visible aspect, have no color.
