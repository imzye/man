NAME
       tkgraphviz - visualise graphviz files with Tk

SYNOPSIS
           tkgraphviz [-c] file...

DESCRIPTION
       Uses Tk::GraphViz to visualise the given graph file, in Graphviz "DOT" format. Allows you to scroll instantly to a specified node.

       When the pointer is over a node or edge, shows you their name or incident nodes.

       If Tk::MatchEntry is available, the search functionality will use it to autocomplete the node name. If not, Tk::BrowseEntry is used so you can select from the dropdown, or type the name.

OPTIONS
       -c  Put another pane on the left, with an image generated by "dot". Allows you to compare that with how Tk::GraphViz did.
