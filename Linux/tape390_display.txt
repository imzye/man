NAME
       tape390_display - display messages on the display unit of a zSeries tape device.

SYNOPSIS
       tape390_display [-b|--blink]
                       [-h|--help]
                       [-l|--load]
                       [-t<type>|--type<type>]

                       message1 [ message2 ] device

DESCRIPTION
       tape390_display displays one or two 8-byte messages on the display unit of a zSeries tape device.  Characters to be displayed include capital letters A-Z, numerics 0-9 and special characters.  However
       some special characters may not display on all device types. The characters that should display on model 3490 are:
            '@$#,./()*&+-=%|:_<>?;' and the <cent> character.
       Spaces and shell-sensitive characters have to be quoted.

OPTIONS
       -h or --help
               Print help text.

       -b or --blink
               Display message1 repeatedly for 2 seconds at half-second intervals.  This option is ignored if two messages are specified on command line.

       -l or --load
               If this option is given the display request will cause a load request to be sent to the automatic tape loader (if installed). The next indexed tape will then be loaded  if  the  loader  is  in
               'system' mode. Otherwise the request is ignored.

       -q or --quiet
               This option causes the command to run in quiet mode which will suppress all warning messages.

       -t type or --type type
               Set the type of the message to be displayed. This influences how long the message(s) stay on the display. Available types are:

               standard        The message(s) stay displayed until the drive executes the next tape movement command. This is the default.

               load            Displays the message(s) until a tape is loaded. If there already is a tape loaded to the device, nothing is displayed at all.

               unload          This will display the message(s) until currently loaded tape is unloaded.  Again, if the drive is currently unloaded there is no output at all.

               noop            For testing purposes only, this will access the drive but won't do anything at all (no operation). This doesn't seem to work with 3590 tape devices.

               reload          This display type requires two messages. The first message is displayed as long as there is a tape loaded up to the time the unload operation is completed (or, if there isn't a
                               tape loaded, it will be ignored). The second message is displayed as soon as a tape gets loaded into the drive.

       -v or --version
               Print the S/390 tools package version, the utility version and exit.

       message1 [ message2 ]
               The message(s) to be displayed. They stay displayed until either the ending condition for the message type takes place or the display is updated with another message.
               If two messages are specified, they are alternated on the display.  Each message is then displayed repeatedly for 2 seconds at half-second intervals.

       device  The tape device on which the message(s) will be displayed, e.g.:

                    /dev/ntibm0

EXAMPLES
       tape390_display --blink --type unload "TESTING" /dev/ntibm0
              Let the message TESTING blink on the display of the tape unit until the tape is removed (or another message is given). If there is no tape in the drive, nothing happens.
       tape390_display "BACKUP" "COMPLETE" /dev/ntibm0
              This will display the messages BACKUP and COMPLETE each for 2 seconds until the tape is moved, ejected or (if there isn't a tape in the device) inserted.
       tape390_display --type reload "UNLOAD" "LOAD" /dev/ntibm0
              The UNLOAD message will be displayed if there is a tape inserted and as long as the tape isn't removed. After that the LOAD message is displayed until a tape is inserted. If there  is  no  tape
              inserted when the command
       tape390_display --load --type load "LOADING" /dev/ntibm0
              Causes the device to display the message LOADING until a tape is inserted and to instruct the automatic stacker to load the next tape (if the mode of operation is system). If there already is a
              tape loaded, nothing will happen at all.
