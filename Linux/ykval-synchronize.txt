NAME
       ykval-synchronize - Request synchronization from servers in a yubikey-val sync pool.

SYNOPSIS
       ykval-synchronize

DESCRIPTION
       Sends a request to a remote server in the sync pool to synchronize YubiKey counters with the sender. Can be used to synchronize a specific key, or all keys.

       The  remote  server must be configured to allow resync requests from the machine the command is run from, and the machine running the command must be configured to accept sync requests from the remote
       server.  The synchronization is queued remotely and handled by the ykval-queue daemon.

EXAMPLES
       Request sync for a specific YubiKey:

           $ ykval-synchronize http://1.2.3.4/wsapi/2.0/resync ccccccdndndn

       If the URL follows the default format (as in the example above) you can skip the protocol and just give the hostname directly, or as an IP address.  Request sync for all (active) YubiKeys from  server
       using the default path:

           $ ykval-synchronize example.com all
