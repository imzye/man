NAME
       HTML::HTML5::Builder::Document - pretty trivial subclass of XML::LibXML::Document

DESCRIPTION
       HTML::HTML5::Builder::html() returns an "HTML::HTML5::Builder::Document" object. This inherits from "XML::LibXML::Document", but overloads stringification using "HTML::HTML5::Writer".

       A non-exhaustive list of interesting methods provided by "HTML::HTML5::Builder::Document" objects:

       "toString" - outputs XML
       "toStringHTML" - outputs HTML
       "documentElement" - returns the root element as an "XML::LibXML::Element"
       "findnodes" - search using XPath
