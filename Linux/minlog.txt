NAME
       minlog - starts Emacs and runs Minlog in it.

SYNOPSIS
       minlog files

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the minlog program.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       The minlog command starts Emacs (by default, set $EMACS to switch to your Emacs version of choice), loads the minlog-mode and open standard Minlog buffers.

OPTIONS
       files  One or more scheme files for the Minlog theorem prover. Usually these files end with .scm
