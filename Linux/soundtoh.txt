NAME
       soundtoh - convert a sound file to a C language header file

SYNOPSIS
       soundtoh filename

DESCRIPTION
       The soundtoh program will convert a sound file in a format supported by the Network Audio System library into a header file suitable for use with the #include C pre-processor directive.  The resulting
       output is directed to the standard output.  The output will look something like:

       /* bark */

       #define barkDataFormat   AuFormatULAW8
       #define barkSampleRate   8000
       #define  barkNumTracks   1
       #define barkNumSamples \
           (sizeof(barkSamples) / sizeof(barkSamples[0]) / barkNumTracks)

       static char *barkComment = "terrier bark";

       static unsigned char barkSamples[] =
       {
           0x57, 0x52, 0x51, 0x55, 0x5d, 0x72, 0xe5, 0xdc,
           0xdc, 0xe2, 0xed, 0x76, 0x61, 0x5b, 0x59, 0x5e,
                              .
                              .
                              .
           0x66, 0xf0, 0xde, 0xe0, 0xf1, 0x6d, 0x67, 0x6a,
           0x77, 0xee, 0xe5, 0xe6, 0xf1, 0x71, 0x6b,
       };

       16-bit samples will be converted appropriately depending upon the endianess of the host machine.
