NAME
       Test::CleanNamespaces - Check for uncleaned imports

VERSION
       version 0.24

SYNOPSIS
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Test::CleanNamespaces;

           all_namespaces_clean;

DESCRIPTION
       This module lets you check your module's namespaces for imported functions you might have forgotten to remove with namespace::autoclean or namespace::clean and are therefore available to be called
       as methods, which usually isn't want you want.

FUNCTIONS
       All functions are exported by default.

   namespaces_clean
           namespaces_clean('YourModule', 'AnotherModule');

       Tests every specified namespace for uncleaned imports. If the module couldn't be loaded it will be skipped.

   all_namespaces_clean
           all_namespaces_clean;

       Runs "namespaces_clean" for all modules in your distribution.

   find_modules
           my @modules = Test::CleanNamespaces->find_modules;

       Returns a list of modules in the current distribution. It'll search in "blib/", if it exists. "lib/" will be searched otherwise.

   builder
           my $builder = Test::CleanNamespaces->builder;

       Returns the "Test::Builder" used by the test functions.

KNOWN ISSUES
       Uncleaned imports from Mouse classes are incompletely detected, due to its lack of ability to return the correct method list -- it assumes that all subs are meant to be callable as methods unless
       they originated from (were imported by) one of: Mouse, Mouse::Role, Mouse::Util, Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints, Carp, Scalar::Util, or List::Util.
