NAME
       netromd - Send and receive NET/ROM routing messages

SYNOPSIS
       netromd [-c] [-d] [-i] [-l] [-p pause] [-q quality] [-t interval] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       For  a NET/ROM based network to operate correctly, a periodic broadcast
       of routing information needs to occur. Typically this occurs once every
       hour on every port which is expected to carry NET/ROM traffic. The pur‐
       pose of netromd is to send and receive NET/ROM routing  broadcasts.  To
       operate  correctly  a  set of parameters that corresponds to each AX.25
       port needs to be passed to the program. This information is encoded  in
       a  configuration  file,  by default which is /etc/ax25/nrbroadcast with
       each line representing one port,  see  the  manual  page  for  nrbroad‐
       cast(5).

       To  cut  down the length of these routing broadcasts, only the informa‐
       tion about the highest quality  neighbour  for  a  particular  node  is
       transmitted.   The transmission is also limited to those node that have
       a certain minimum value in  their  obsolesence  count,  this  value  is
       decremented  every  time a routing broadcast is transmitted, and is re‐
       freshed by receiving a routing broadcast which contains that particular
       node.

       The value of the default quality is traditionally assigned a value that
       represents the quality of the radio links on that port. A higher number
       representing  better  radio  links  with 255 (the maximum) reserved for
       wire connections. The practise in the UK is to set the default  quality
       to  a  low  value, typically 10, and manually set up the trusted neigh‐
       bouring nodes in the neighbour list manually.  The  worst  quality  for
       auto-updates  value  is  a  way  to filter out low quality (ie distant)
       nodes.

       The verbose flag may be either 0 or 1,  representing  no  and  yes.  By
       specifying  no,  the  program will only generate a routing message con‐
       taining information about the node on which it is running, by  specify‐
       ing  the  yes  option,  all the information in the nodes routing tables
       will be transmitted.  The quality advertised for the other  node  call‐
       signs on this machine may be set using the -q option.

       Between  each transmission netromd pauses for five seconds (default) in
       order to avoid flooding the channels that it  must  broadcast  on.  The
       value of this delay is settable with the -p option.

OPTIONS
       -c              Forces  strict  compliance  to Software 2000 specifica‐
                       tions. At present this only determines how node mnemon‐
                       ics  with  lower case characters will be handled.  With
                       compliance enabled mixed case node  mnemonics  will  be
                       ignored.  The  default  is  to accept node mnemonics of
                       mixed case.

       -d              Switches on debugging messages,  the  default  is  off.
                       Logging must be enabled for them to be output.

       -i              Transmit  a  routing broadcast immediately, the default
                       is to wait for  the  time  interval  to  elapse  before
                       transmitting the first routing broadcast.

       -l              Enables  logging  of  errors  and debug messages to the
                       system log. The default is off.

       -p pause        Sets the  delay  between  transmissions  of  individual
                       routing broadcast packets. The default is five seconds.

       -q quality      Sets  the  quality  of the subsidiary nodes relative to
                       the main node. The default is 255.

       -t interval     The time interval between routing broadcasts,  in  min‐
                       utes. The default is 60 minutes.

       -v              Display the version.
