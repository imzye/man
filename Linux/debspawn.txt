NAME
       debspawn-update - Update a container image

SYNOPSIS

       debspawn update [-h|--help] [--variant] [-a|--arch] [--suite] [--recreate] {NAME}

DESCRIPTION
       Update a container base image. This achieves the same thing as running apt update && apt full-upgrade on the base image and making the changes permanent. Additionally, debspawn update will prune
       all caches and ensure all required packages and scripts are installed in the container image.

       Running debspawn update on the images that are in use about once a week ensures builds will happen faster, due to less changes that have to be done prior to each build.

EXAMPLES
       Updating images is easy, you just pass the same arguments you used for creating them, but use the update subcommand instead:

                          $ debspawn update sid
                          $ debspawn update --arch=i386 cosmic

OPTIONS
       NAME
           The name of the container image (usually a distribution suite name).

       -h|--help
           Print brief help information about available commands.

       --variant
           Set the variant of the selected image, that was used for bootstrapping.

       -a|--arch
           The architecture of the base image that should be selected.

       --suite
           Explicitly set a suite name (instead of having it derived from the container name).

       --recreate
           Re-create the container image from scratch using the settings used to create it previously, instead of just updating it.
