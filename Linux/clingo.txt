NAME
       clingo - a combination of clasp and gringo

SYNOPSIS
       clingo [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the clingo command.

       clingo  stands for clasp on gringo and combines both systems in a monolithic way. Its input language is that of gringo and its output corresponds to that of clasp. This way it offers more control over
       the grounding and solving process than gringo and clasp can offer individually: multi-shot solving.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the  potassco-guide
