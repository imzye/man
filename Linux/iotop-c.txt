NAME
       iotop - simple top-like I/O monitor

SYNOPSIS
       iotop [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       iotop  watches  I/O  usage  information  available in the Linux kernel (requires 2.6.20 or later) and displays a table of current I/O usage by processes or threads on the system. At least the CON‐
       FIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT, CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING, CONFIG_TASKSTATS and CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS options need to be enabled in your Linux kernel build configuration.

       Running iotop as non-root user is possible by adding the NET_ADMIN capability. This can be done by e.g.:

              $ sudo setcap 'cap_net_admin+eip' <path-to>/iotop

       Be warned that this will also allow other users to run it and get access to information that normally should not be available to them.

       iotop displays columns for the I/O bandwidth read and written by each process/thread during the sampling period. It also displays the percentage of time the thread/process spent while swapping  in
       and while waiting on I/O.  For each process, its I/O priority (class/level) is shown.

       In  addition,  the  total I/O bandwidth read and written during the sampling period are displayed at the top of the interface.  Total DISK READ and Total DISK WRITE values represent total read and
       write bandwidth between processes and kernel threads on one side and kernel block device subsystem on the other. While Current DISK READ and Current DISK WRITE values represent corresponding band‐
       widths for current disk I/O between the kernel block device subsystem and the underlying hardware (HDD, SSD, etc.). Thus Total and Current values may not be equal at any given moment of  time  due
       to data caching and I/O operations reordering that take place inside the Linux kernel.

       Use the left and right arrows to select the sort column, r or space to reverse the sorting order, o to toggle the --only option (this uses the visible values from the GRAPH column or the IO column
       in  case the GRAPH column is hidden), p to toggle the --processes option, a to cycle between the --accumulated, --accum-bw and normal operation, i to change the priority of a thread or a process's
       thread, f to change filtering by UID/PID (--user and --pid options), 1-9 to toggle the visibility of the respective column, 0 to show all columns, up/down arrows,  page-up/page-down/home/end  keys
       to scroll and q to quit. Any unrecognized key will be ignored.

       All  processes or threads that have exited are displayed grayed for the same time as is visible in the GRAPH column or 3 seconds when it is hidden. The invalid data points in the GRAPHS column are
       displayed inverse or with letter x (see option --dead-x and x shortcut). When using unicode characters each position contains two datapoints and only the positions with two invalid data points are
       reversed.

       It is possible for threads of a process to have different priority from their main process. This is shown with ! in the PRIO column of the main process as e.g. !be/4.

       Threads activity is always aggregated with and shown inside the main process.

       When showing threads, they always appear below their main process and are sorted in the same way as the processes.

       There are two ways to change the IO priority of a process or thread - press i and use arrows to select the process or thread from the visible ones on screen or press i and type its  TID  (PID  and
       TID have the same value for the main process). Then use tab and arrows to change the priority value and confirm with enter. Shortcuts esc or q will cancel this mode.

       To  change the UID and PID filters, press f and use tab to select the UID or PID field, then type the numerical id or n to remove the filter and confirm with enter. Filtering is always done by TID
       because it is unique. Note that for the main process PID is the same as TID. Shortcuts esc or q will cancel this mode.

       Starting with Linux kernel 5.14.x task_delayacct is configurable at runtime and set to off by default. This setting can be changed in interactive mode by the Ctrl-T shortcut. In batch mode a warn‐
       ing is printed when the setting is OFF. From the command line this can be enabled by:

              $ sudo sysctl kernel.task_delayacct=1

       and disabled again by:

              $ sudo sysctl kernel.task_delayacct=0

       It is advisable to keep this option off when not using this or another monitoring program because when enabled it has some effect on system performance.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Show the version number and exit

       -h, --help
              Show usage information and exit

       -H, --help-type=TYPE
              Set the type of interactive help shown. Accepted values for TYPE are none, win and inline.

       -o, --only
              Only show processes or threads actually doing I/O, instead of showing all processes or threads. This can be dynamically toggled by pressing o

       --no-only
              Show all processes or threads

       -b, --batch
              Turn on non-interactive mode.  Useful for logging I/O usage over time

       -n NUM, --iter=NUM
              Set the number of iterations before quitting (never quit by default).  This is most useful in non-interactive mode

       -d SEC, --delay=SEC
              Set the delay between iterations in seconds (1 second by default).  Accepts non-integer values such as 1.1 seconds

       -p PID, --pid=PID
              A process/thread id to monitor (all by default)

       -u USER, --user=USER
              A user id to monitor (all by default).  The value will always be resolved first unless it is prefixed by + in which case it is treated as numeric only. Values that do not resolve but appear
              to be numeric are used as numeric

       -P, --processes
              Only show processes. Normally iotop shows processes and all threads

       --no-processes
              Show processes and all threads

       -a, --accumulated
              Show accumulated I/O instead of bandwidth. In this mode, iotop shows the amount of I/O processes have done since the process or iotop started.  Note that this option and --accum-bw are  ex‐
              clusive and they will turn each other off

       --no-accumulated
              Show bandwidth (useful when changing config file with --write)

       -A, --accum-bw
              Show  accumulated  I/O  as  bandwidth for the whole sampling period. In this mode, iotop shows the amount of I/O per second for the whole period since the process or iotop started Note that
              this option and --accumulated are exclusive and they will turn each other off

       --no-accum-bw
              Show bandwidth (useful when changing config file with --write)

       -k, --kilobytes
              Use kilobytes instead of a human friendly unit.  This mode is useful when scripting the batch mode of iotop. Instead of choosing the most appropriate unit iotop will display  all  sizes  in
              kilobytes

       --no-kilobytes
              Use human friendly units

       -t, --time
              Add a timestamp on each line (implies --batch). Each line will be prefixed by the current time

       -c, --fullcmdline
              Show processes' full file path and parameters

       --no-fullcmdline
              Show processes' names only

       --show-pid
              Show PID/TID column

              Hide DISK WRITE column

       --show-write
              Show DISK WRITE column

       -6, --hide-swapin
              Hide SWAPIN column

       --show-swapin
              Show SWAPIN column

       --no-reverse-graph
              Do not reverse GRAPH direction - show most recent values on the left side

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress headers before each run (implies --batch). This option can be specified up to three times to suppress the output of different header lines:
              -q     column names are only printed on the first iteration,
              -qq    column names are never printed,
              -qqq   the I/O summary is never printed

                     bining characters will be appended to the character under the cursor.

ENVIRONMENT
       NO_COLOR
              As per the recommendation of https://www.no-color.org/ iotop honors the contents of the environment variable NO_COLOR and when it is set to a non empty string,  all  color  output  is  sup‐
              pressed.

       HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME
              Used to determine the config file path. See the W shortcut for details.

       IOTOP_NO_RENICE
              Disable the i shortcut. The user will not be able to change processes' nice values.
