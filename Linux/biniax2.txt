NAME
       Biniax2 - Logic game with arcade and tactics modes

SYNOPSIS
       biniax2

DESCRIPTION
       Biniax  2  is  an  original  and entertaining game. It takes a minute to learn and gives you hours and hours of gameplay. There are three game modes (two singleplayer and one multiplayer), hall of
       fame, dynamic music and a nice cartoon look.

       Playing the game is really simple: you move a single tile around a field of pairs of tiles. You can remove a pair from the game board if one of the tiles is similar to your own. When you do  that,
       your tile changes into the other tile that was part of the pair you just removed. You have to do this quickly, otherwise the pairs will pile on top of you and take you to the Game Over screen.
