NAME
       Color::Spectrum - Just another HTML color generator.

SYNOPSIS
         # Procedural interface:
         use Color::Spectrum qw( generate );
         my @color = generate(10, '#000000', '#FF0000' );

         # OO interface:
         use Color::Spectrum;
         my $spectrum = Color::Spectrum->new;
         my @color = $spectrum->generate( 10, 'black', 'red' );

DESCRIPTION
       From the author, Mark Mills: "This is a rewrite of a script I wrote [around 1999] to make spectrums of colors for web page table tags.  It uses a real simple geometric conversion that gets the job
       done.  It can shade from dark to light, from saturated to dull, and around the spectrum all at the same time. It can go thru the spectrum in either direction."

METHODS
       new Constructor. No args.

       generate
           This method returns a list of size $elements which contains web colors starting from $start_color and ranging to $end_color.

            # Procedural interface:
            @list = generate( $elements, $start_color, $end_color );

            # OO interface:
            @list = $spectrum->generate( $elements, $start_color, $end_color );

       hsi2rgb
           Hue, saturation and intesity to red, green and blue.

       rgb2hsi
           Red, green and blue to hue, saturation and intesity.

About Muliple Color Spectrums
       Just  call  generate()  more than once. If you want expand from one color to the next, and then back to the original color then simply reuse the returned array (minus the last element if you don't
       want the repeated color).

        my @color = $spectrum->generate(4,'#000000','#FFFFFF');

        print for @color, (reverse @color)[1..$#color];

       If you want to expand from one color to the next, and then to yet another color, simply stack calls to generate() and take care to remove the repeated color each time:

        my @color = (
           $spectrum->generate(13,'#FF0000','#00FF00'),
           ($spectrum->generate(13,'#00FF00','#0000FF'))[1..12],
        );

REQUIRES
       Color::Library - Used to look up non hash value colors.
