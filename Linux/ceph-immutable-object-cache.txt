NAME
       ceph-immutable-object-cache - Ceph daemon for immutable object cache

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-immutable-object-cache

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-immutable-object-cache  is a daemon for object cache of RADOS objects among Ceph clusters. It will promote the objects to a local directory upon promote requests and future reads will be ser‐
       viced from these cached objects.

       It connects to local clusters via the RADOS protocol, relying on default search paths to find ceph.conf files, monitor addresses and authentication  information  for  them,  i.e.  /etc/ceph/$clus‐
       ter.conf,  /etc/ceph/$cluster.keyring,  and  /etc/ceph/$cluster.$name.keyring,  where  $cluster  is  the  human-friendly  name  of  the  cluster,  and  $name  is the rados user to connect as, e.g.
       client.ceph-immutable-object-cache.

OPTIONS
       -c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
              Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.

       -m monaddress[:port]
              Connect to specified monitor (instead of looking through ceph.conf).

       -i ID, --id ID
              Set the ID portion of name for ceph-immutable-object-cache

       -n TYPE.ID, --name TYPE.ID
              Set the rados user name for the gateway (eg. client.ceph-immutable-object-cache)

       --cluster NAME
              Set the cluster name (default: ceph)

       -d     Run in foreground, log to stderr

       -f     Run in foreground, log to usual location

AVAILABILITY
       ceph-immutable-object-cache is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at https://docs.ceph.com for more information.
