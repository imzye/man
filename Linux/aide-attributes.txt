NAME
       aide-attributes - decode and compare hex-encoded attribute numbers

SYNOPSIS
       aide-attributes HEX_NUMBER [HEX_NUMBER]

DESCRIPTION
       aide-attributes decodes hex-encoded attribute numbers to attribute names or displays the differences between two attribute numbers. The script is useful to decode the attribute numbers as shown in the
       'Entry X in database has different attributes: OLD_HEX_NUMBER NEW_HEX_NUMBER' message.

EXAMPLES
       Decode the hex number 'c3d' to attribute names:
              $ aide-attributes c3d
              filename
              perm
              uid
              gid
              size
              bcount
              lnkcount

       Display the differences between two hex-encoded attribute numbers:
              $ aide-attributes c3d fbd
              +ctime
              +mtime
              +inode
