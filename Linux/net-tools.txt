NAME
       ethers - Ethernet address to IP number database

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/ethers contains 48 bit Ethernet addresses and their corresponding IP numbers, one line for each IP number:

              Ethernet-address  IP-number

       The two items are separated by any number of SPACE and/or TAB characters.  A # at the beginning of a line starts a comment which extends to the end of the line.  The Ethernet-address is written as
       x:x:x:x:x:x,  where  x is a hexadecimal number between 0 and ff which represents one byte of the address, which is in network byte order (big-endian).  The IP-number may be a hostname which can be
       resolved by DNS or a dot separated number.
