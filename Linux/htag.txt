HTAG(1)                                                                             User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                             HTAG(1)

NAME
       htag.pl - Add taglines and sigs to email, news and fidonet messages.

SYNOPSIS
       htag.pl [-t tagfile -c cfgfile] -m msgfile

       htag.pl -f sigfile

       htag.pl -h

DESCRIPTION
       htag.pl is a sigmonster.  It is designed to be extendable in many different ways through its use of plugins.  It might be getting a little bit too sentient in its old age though.

       It can be used like this:

       htag.pl -m $1

       $EDITOR $1

       For information on configuration see the sample.htrc file

       To create signature files, it is tedious to have to work out what will and won't line up.  This is why the -f option exists.  Feed it a sigfile and it will replace the @[0-9]+[RC]?@ bits with
       required number of spaces so you can see if you got it right or not.  (You could even run it from your favourite editor  e.g. ":! htag.pl -f %" for vim on the current file.)

BUGS
       Inserting a tagline containing "@[0-9]+[RC]?@" has interesting results.

       This documentation is useless.  Use The Source Luke.

FILES
       ~/.htrc
