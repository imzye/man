NAME
       syncplay - synchronize playback of various video players via internet

SYNOPSIS
       syncplay [options] [file] [playeroptions]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the syncplay command.

       syncplay is a program that allows you to watch movies with friends or family at different places synchronized via the internet.

       When  a  viewer pauses/continues playback or seeks within their media player this will be replicated across all media players connected to the same server in the same viewing session. A chat func‐
       tion is included so viewers can discuss the movie while watching it. To improve the communication experience for viewers, the Syncplay developers and this package suggest to  use  additional  VoIP
       (package mumble) or video phone (package jami) software.

       Technically, it synchronizes the position and play states of multiple mpv, VLC, MPC-HC and MPC-BEmedia player instances so viewers' players present the same movie at the same time.

       There are known synchronization issues with VLC. If you experience such problems use MPV instead.
