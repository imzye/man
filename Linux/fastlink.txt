LINKMAP(1)                                                                                General Commands Manual                                                                                LINKMAP(1)

NAME
       linkmap - calculates location scores of one locus against a fixed map of other loci

SYNOPSIS
       linkmap [options] ipedfile.dat pedfile.dat

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the linkmap command.  In fact this is a very raw intend to provide a manpage because the Debian GNU/Linux distribution requires each program to have a manpage.
       Any enhancement would be greatly apreciated.

       linkmap is part of the fastlink software package.

OPTIONS
       There might be options but I did not found any information about them.  Please foreward any information about them to <tille@debian.org>
