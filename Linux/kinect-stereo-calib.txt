NAME
       kinect-stereo-calib - Calibration utility for the Microsoft Kinect sensor

SYNOPSIS
       kinect-stereo-calib

DESCRIPTION
       kinect-stereo-calib is designed to allow an easy calibration of the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters required for an accurate reconstruction of colored 3D point clouds with this sensor.
       Calibration will require a printed checkerboard as those used in common camera calibration.

       It can be also used to calibrate any arbitrary stereo camera, provided stereo images of a checkerboard are already saved to disk.
