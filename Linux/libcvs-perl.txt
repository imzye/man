       Cvs - Object oriented interface to the CVS command

SYNOPSIS
           use Cvs;

           my $cvs = new Cvs
             (
               '/path/to/repository/for/module',
               cvsroot => ':pserver:user@host:/path/to/cvs',
               password => 'secret'

DESCRIPTION
       bla bla

LEGACY CVS METHODS
   new
           Cvs = new Cvs ["workdir"] [key => "value" [, ...]];

           my $obj = new Cvs "workdir";

           my $obj = new Cvs "workdir", cvsroot => "/path/to/cvsroot";

           my $obj = new Cvs cvsroot => ":pserver:user\@host:/path/to/cvs";

       Create a new Cvs object for the repository given in argument. Note that the working directory doesn't need to already exist.

       Allowed parameters are:

       workdir
           Path to the working directory. You don't need it if you plan to use only remote commands like rdiff or rtag.

       cvsroot
           Address  of  the cvsroot. See the Cvs::Cvsroot module documentation for more information on supported CVSROOT. Note that if you don't supply a cvs root but a working directory, Cvs will try to
           guess the CVSROOT value. You still need to supply password and others authentication values. If Cvs can't determine the CVSROOT value, an error will be  thrown  and  the  object  will  not  be
           created.

       password, passphrase, ...
           All options supported by Cvs::Cvsroot are supported here. Please see Cvs::Cvsroot documentation for more details.

   checkout
           Cvs::Result::Checkout = $obj->checkout("module", {key => "value"});

       Checkout the module "module" in the repository (the one that served to create the Cvs object) from the cvsroot given in parameter.

       Allowed parameters are:

       reset
           Boolean value used to reset any sticky tags, dates or options (See the -A cvs checkout option).

       revision
           Specify the revision to checkout the module (See the -r cvs checkout option).

       date
           Specify the date from when to checkout the module (See the -D cvs checkout option).

       Cvs::Result::Checkout.

   update
           Cvs::Result::Update = $cvs->update();

       Cvs::Result::Update.

   status
           Cvs::Result::StatusItem = $cvs->status("file");

           Cvs::Result::StatusList =
               $cvs->status("file1", "file2", {multiple => 1});

       Get the status of one of more files.

       Allowed parameters are:

       multiple
           Boolean  value  that  specify  the  type  of  object  returned.  If  true,  a  Cvs::Result::StatusList  object  is  returned,  and  status  on  more  than one files can be handled. If false, a
           Cvs::Result::StatusItem object is return and only one file status can be handled (the first one if several).

       recursive
           If a directory is supplied, process it recursively (Default true).

       Cvs::Result::StatusItem, Cvs::Result::StatusList

   diff
           Cvs::Result::DiffItem = $cvs->diff();

           Cvs::Result::DiffList = $cvs->diff({multiple => 1});

       Cvs::Result::DiffItem, Cvs::Result::DiffList.

   rdiff
           Cvs::Result::RdiffList =
             $cvs->rdiff("module", {from_revision => $rev});

       Cvs::Result::RdiffList.

   log
           Cvs::Result::Log = $cvs->log();

       Cvs::Result::Log.

   tag
           Cvs::Result::Tag = $cvs->tag("tag");

       Cvs::Result::Tag.

   rtag
           Cvs::Result::Tag = $cvs->rtag("module", "tag");

       Cvs::Result::Rtag.

   release
           Cvs::Result::Release = $cvs->release();

           Cvs::Result::Release = $cvs->release('module', ..., {force => 1});

       Call the release command.

       If call with no directories to release, self repository will be released.

       force
           Boolean value that activate a forced directory release even if some files was not committed.  Defaults to false.

       delete_after
           Boolean value that activate directory removal after a release. Default to false.

       Cvs::Result::Release

   export
           Cvs::Result::Export = $obj->export("module", {key => "value"});

       Checkout the module "module" in the repository (the one that served to create the Cvs object) from the cvsroot given in parameter, but without the CVS administrative directories.

       Allowed parameters are the same as for checkout.  However, one of the options 'revision' or 'date' must be specified.

OTHERS METHODS
   module_list
         my @modules = $cvs->module_list();

       Returns the list of all modules which can be riched on the CVSROOT. This method do something that cvs doesn't implement by itself, we use a little trick to get this list, and this perhaps not work
       with all cvs versions.

       Do not mix up this method with the "-c" argument of the cvs' checkout sub-command.

ACCESSORS
   cvsroot
       Returns the Cvs::Cvsroot object.

   working_directory
       Returns the full path of the working directory
