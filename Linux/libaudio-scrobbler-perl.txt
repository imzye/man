NAME
       scrobbler-helper - submit a track to AudioScrobbler

SYNOPSIS
        scrobbler-helper [-nv] [-e encoding] [-f configfile] -P progname
          -V progver title artist album year comment genre length

DESCRIPTION
       The scrobbler-helper utility uses the "Audio::Scrobbler" module to submit a single track's information to Last.fm's AudioScrobbler - http://www.audioscrobbler.com/.  It requires the program (plug-
       in) name and version to be specified on the command line, and also requires all seven track attributes, although some of them may be omitted by supplying empty strings.

       The following command-line options are recognized:

       -e encoding
           Specify the character encoding of the track info, if it is neither UTF-8 nor the one specified via default_encoding in the configuration file.

       -f configfile
           Specify a different configuration file, not ~/.scrobbler-helper.conf.

       -n  Do not actually perform the handshake and submission (sets the "Audio::Scrobbler" "fake" option).

       -P progname
           Specify the name of the AudioScrobbler plug-in submitting the data.  This option is mandatory!

       -v  Verbose operation - display diagnostic messages to the standard output (sets the "Audio::Scrobbler" "verbose" option).

       -V progver
           Specify the version of the AudioScrobbler plug-in submitting the data.  This option is mandatory!

       Besides the command line, the scrobbler-helper utility also retrieves information from a per-user configuration file, usually ~/.scrobbler-helper.conf; it is a INI-style file, which must contain a
       secion named "global".  The following variables are recognized, with username and password being mandatory:

       •   default_encoding

           The  encoding to assume for the track info, if none is supplied with the -e command-line option.  If neither -e is given on the command line nor default_encoding specified in the configuration
           file, the scrobbler-helper utility assumes UTF-8.

       •   fix_track_name

           A boolean flag specifying whether to do some trivial fixes on the song name before submitting it.  Currently, this only removes a "DD. " sequence at the start of  the  name,  where  'D'  is  a
           digit.

           The values "on", "true", "yes", and 1 are considered to be true.

       •   password

           The password for the AudioScrobbler account.

       •   username

           The username for the AudioScrobbler account.

         [global]
         username=jrandomlistener
         password=mylittlesecret
         # Optional (the default is UTF-8)
         default_encoding=windows-1251
         # Optional (the default is "no")
         fix_track_name=yes

TODO
       •   Command-line options, so people don't have to submit everything...

       •   Storing and caching of unsuccessful submissions for later retrying.
