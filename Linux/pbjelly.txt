NAME
       Jelly - genome assembly upgrading tool

DESCRIPTION
       PBJelly  is  a highly automated pipeline that aligns long sequencing reads (such as PacBio RS reads or long 454 reads in fasta format) to high-confidence draft assembles. PBJelly fills or re‐
       duces as many captured gaps as possible to produce upgraded draft genomes.
