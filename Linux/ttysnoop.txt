NAME
       ttysnoop — snoop on a user's tty

SYNOPSIS
       ttysnoop [pty]
       ttysnoops

DESCRIPTION
       The  ttysnoop  /  ttysnoops  client-server  combo  can  be  used  to  snoop  (watch)  on a user's login tty.  The server (ttysnoops) is usually started by getty(8) or telnetd(8) and reads the file
       /etc/snooptab to find out which tty's should be cloned and which programs to run on them (usually /bin/login). A tty may be snooped through a pre-determined (ie.  fixed) device, or through  a  dy‐
       namically allocated pseudo-tty (pty). This is also specified in the /etc/snooptab file. To connect to the pty, the client ttysnoop should be used. The available pseudo terminals pty are present as
       sockets in the directory /var/spool/ttysnoop/.

   Format of /etc/snooptab
       The /etc/snooptab file may contain comment lines (starting with a '#'), empty lines, or entries for tty's that should be snooped upon. The format of such an entry is as follows:

             tty   snoop-device   type   program

       where  tty  is  the leaf-name of the tty that should be snooped upon (eg. ttyS2, not /dev/ttyS2) OR the wildcard '*', which matches ANY tty.  snoop-device is the device through which tty should be
       snooped (eg. /dev/tty8) OR the literal constant "socket". The latter is used to tell ttysnoops that the snoop-device will be a dynamically allocated pty.  type specifies the type of  program  that
       should  be  run,  currently recognized types are "init", "user" and "login" although the former two aren't really needed. Finally, program is the full pathname to the program to run when ttysnoops
       has cloned tty onto snoop-device.

EXAMPLE
       The following example /etc/snooptab file should illustrate the typical use of ttysnoop / ttysnoops:

              #
              # example /etc/snooptab
              #
              ttyS0    /dev/tty7    login    /bin/login
              ttyS1    /dev/tty8    login    /bin/login
              #
              # the wildcard tty should always be the last one in the file
              #
              *        socket       login    /bin/login
              #
              # example end
              #

       With the above example, whenever a user logs in on /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1, either tty will be snooped through /dev/tty7 or /dev/tty8 respectively. Any other tty's will be snooped through  a  pty
       that  will be allocated at the time of login. The system-administrator can then run ttysnoop pty to snoop through the pty. Note that it is up to the system-administrator to setup getty and/or tel‐
       netd so that they execute ttysnoops instead of /bin/login.

SEE ALSO
       getty(8), telnetd(8)

FILES
       /etc/snooptab

BUGS
       The program is unable to do any terminal control-code translations for the original tty and the snoop-device. I doubt it will ever do this.
