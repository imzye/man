NAME
       pappl - printer application framework

LIBRARY
       Printer Application Framework (libpappl, "pkg-config --cflags --libs pappl")

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pappl/pappl.h>

DESCRIPTION
       PAPPL is a simple C-based framework/library for developing CUPS Printer Applications, which are the recommended replacement for printer drivers.  It is sufficiently general purpose to support any kind
       of printer or driver that can be used on desktops, servers, and in embedded environments.

       PAPPL embeds a multi-threaded HTTP / IPP Everywhere™ server and provides callbacks for a variety of events that allows a GUI or command-line application to interact with both the local  user  that  is
       running the Printer Application and any network clients that are submitting print jobs, querying printer status and capabilities, and so forth.

       PAPPL  provides a simple driver interface for raster graphics printing, and developers of CUPS Raster drivers will readily adapt to it.  PAPPL can also be used with printers that support vector graph‐
       ics printing although you'll have to develop more code to support them.  Drivers provide configuration and capability information to PAPPL, and PAPPL then calls the driver to print things  as  needed.
       PAPPL  automatically  supports  printing of JPEG, PNG, PWG Raster, Apple Raster, and "raw" files to printers connected via USB and network (AppSocket/JetDirect) connections.  Other formats can be sup‐
       ported through "filter" callbacks you register.
