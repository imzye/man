DESCRIPTION
       This utility is used to unsubscribe people  from  the  specified  mail‐
       inglist.  It will remove the specified email address from every file in
       the   <listdir>/subscribers.d/,   <listdir>/digesters.d/   and   <list‐
       dir>/nomailsubs.d/ directories (or if the -d, -n or -N switch is given,
       only the one relevant directory).

       Unless the -U switch is used it will switch its user id to the user  id
       owning  the  list  directory.  This is done to make sure that new files
       created are having correct permissions.

       Normally a mail is sent to the person being unsubscribed if the address
       is  not  subscribed  to  the list. If the -s switch is used such a mail
       will not be sent.

       When neither -c nor -C is specified,  unsubscription  happens  silently
       from  the point of view of the subscriber. When -q is specified, unsub‐
       scription happens silently from the point of view of  the  list  owner.
       Use  of  -s  is  recommended  to  ensure  you  don't  spam unsubscribed
       addresses by accident.
