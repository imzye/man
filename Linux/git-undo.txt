NAME
       git-undo - Remove latest commits

SYNOPSIS
       git-undo [-s, --soft, -h, --hard] [<commitcount>]

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the latest commits.

OPTIONS
       --soft or -s

       Rolls back the commit(s) but leaves the changes in the staging area.

       --hard or -h

       This option wipes your commit(s), so that your changes cannot be recov‐
       ered. Use with care. To avoid being confused with --help, there will be
       a confirmation when -h is specified.

       <commitcount>

       Number of commits to remove. Defaults to 1, thus remove the latest com‐
       mit.

EXAMPLES
       Removes the latest commit.

           $ git undo

       Removes the latest commit, restoring the staging area.

           $ git undo -s

       Remove the latest 3 commits:

           $ git undo 3
