NAME
       munin-node-c - a single binary implementing the node functionality

DESCRIPTION
       The munin-node-c binary can handle a single connection to a Munin node on stdin and stdout.  It is usually run from an inetd like superserver.

OPTIONS
       -d plugin_directory
           Specify  the  directory used to look up plugins.  This directory usually contains symbolic links to installed plugins and executable scripts.  The plugins are executed on request by the client
           to retrieve statistics about the system.

       -e  Enable extension stripping.  When this option is given, filename extensions in plugins are ignored.  This option is mainly useful  on  operating  systems  where  extensions  are  relevant  for
           execution.

       -H hostname
           Specify the hostname with which the node should greet clients.
