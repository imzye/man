NAME
       Package::Stash::PP - Pure perl implementation of the Package::Stash API

VERSION
       version 0.40

SYNOPSIS
         use Package::Stash;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a backend for Package::Stash implemented in pure perl, for those without a compiler or who would like to use this inline in scripts.

BUGS
       •   remove_symbol also replaces the associated typeglob

           This  can cause unexpected behavior when doing manipulation at compile time - removing subroutines will still allow them to be called from within the package as subroutines (although they will
           not be available as methods). This can be considered a feature in some cases (this is how namespace::clean works, for instance), but should not be relied upon - use "remove_glob"  directly  if
           you want this behavior.

       •   Some minor memory leaks

           The pure perl implementation has a couple minor memory leaks (see the TODO tests in t/20-leaks.t) that I'm having a hard time tracking down - these may be core perl bugs, it's hard to tell.
