NAME
       phmmer - search protein sequence(s) against a protein sequence database

SYNOPSIS
       phmmer [options] <seqfile> <seqdb>

DESCRIPTION
       phmmer is used to search one or more query protein sequences against a protein sequence database.  For each query sequence in <seqfile>, use that sequence to search the target database of sequences in
       <seqdb>, and output ranked lists of the sequences with the most significant matches to the query.

       Either the query <seqfile> or the target <seqdb> may be '-' (a dash character), in which case the query sequences or target database input will be read from a <stdin> pipe instead of from a file. Only
       one  input  source  can come through <stdin>, not both.  An exception is that if the <seqfile> contains more than one query sequence, then <seqdb> cannot come from <stdin>, because we can't rewind the
       streaming target database to search it with another query.

       The output format is designed to be human-readable, but is often so voluminous that reading it is impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The --tblout and --domtblout options save output in simple tab‐
       ular formats that are concise and easier to parse.  The -o option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing it away in /dev/null.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING OUTPUT
       -o <f> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <f> instead of the default stdout.

       -A <f> Save a multiple alignment of all significant hits (those satisfying inclusion thresholds) to the file <f> in Stockholm format.

       --tblout <f>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-target output, with one data line per homologous target sequence found.

       --domtblout <f>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-domain output, with one data line per homologous domain detected in a query sequence for each homologous model.

       --acc  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       --noali
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       --notextw
              Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120 characters per line, which helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but can truncate
              target profile description lines.

       --textw <n>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <n> characters per line. The default is 120.

OPTIONS CONTROLLING SCORING SYSTEM
       The probability model in phmmer is constructed by inferring residue probabilities from a standard 20x20 substitution score matrix, plus two additional parameters for position-independent gap open  and
       gap extend probabilities.

       --popen <x>
              Set the gap open probability for a single sequence query model to <x>.  The default is 0.02.  <x> must be >= 0 and < 0.5.

       --pextend <x>
              Set the gap extend probability for a single sequence query model to <x>.  The default is 0.4.  <x> must be >= 0 and < 1.0.

       --mx <s>
              Obtain  residue alignment probabilities from the built-in substitution matrix named <s>.  Several standard matrices are built-in, and do not need to be read from files.  The matrix name <s> can
              be PAM30, PAM70, PAM120, PAM240, BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62, BLOSUM80, or BLOSUM90.  Only one of the --mx and --mxfile options may be used.

       --mxfile <mxfile>
              Obtain residue alignment probabilities from the substitution matrix in file <mxfile>.  The default score matrix is BLOSUM62 (this matrix is internal to HMMER and does not have to  be  available
              as  a  file).  The format of a substitution matrix <mxfile> is the standard format accepted by BLAST, FASTA, and other sequence analysis software.  Only one of the --mx and --mxfile options may
              be used.

OPTIONS CONTROLLING REPORTING THRESHOLDS
       Reporting thresholds control which hits are reported in output files (the main output, --tblout, and --domtblout).  Sequence hits and domain hits are ranked by statistical significance  (E-value)  and
       output  is generated in two sections called per-target and per-domain output. In per-target output, by default, all sequence hits with an E-value <= 10 are reported. In the per-domain output, for each
       target that has passed per-target reporting thresholds, all domains satisfying per-domain reporting thresholds are reported. By default, these are domains with conditional E-values of <= 10. The  fol‐
       lowing options allow you to change the default E-value reporting thresholds, or to use bit score thresholds instead.

       -E <x> In  the  per-target output, report target sequences with an E-value of <= <x>.  The default is 10.0, meaning that on average, about 10 false positives will be reported per query, so you can see
              the top of the noise and decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       -T <x> Instead of thresholding per-profile output on E-value, instead report target sequences with a bit score of >= <x>.

       --domE <x>
              In the per-domain output, for target sequences that have already satisfied the per-profile reporting threshold, report individual domains with a conditional E-value of <= <x>.  The  default  is
              10.0.   A  conditional  E-value  means  the expected number of additional false positive domains in the smaller search space of those comparisons that already satisfied the per-target reporting
              threshold (and thus must have at least one homologous domain already).

       --domT <x>
              Instead of thresholding per-domain output on E-value, instead report domains with a bit score of >= <x>.

OPTIONS CONTROLLING INCLUSION THRESHOLDS
       Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds. They control which hits are included in any output multiple alignment (the -A option) and which domains are marked as significant ("!")  as
       opposed to questionable ("?")  in domain output.

       --incE <x>
              Use  an  E-value  of  <=  <x> as the per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01, meaning that on average, about 1 false positive would be expected in every 100 searches with different
              query sequences.

       --incT <x>
              Instead of using E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, instead use a bit score of >= <x> as the per-target inclusion threshold.  By default this option is unset.

       --incdomE <x>
              Use a conditional E-value of <= <x> as the per-domain inclusion threshold, in targets that have already satisfied the overall per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01.

       --incdomT <x>
              Instead of using E-values, use a bit score of >= <x> as the per-domain inclusion threshold.  By default this option is unset.

OPTIONS CONTROLLING THE ACCELERATION PIPELINE
       HMMER3 searches are accelerated in a three-step filter pipeline: the MSV filter, the Viterbi filter, and the Forward filter. The first filter is the fastest and most approximate; the last is the  full
       Forward scoring algorithm, slowest but most accurate. There is also a bias filter step between MSV and Viterbi. Targets that pass all the steps in the acceleration pipeline are then subjected to post‐
       processing -- domain identification and scoring using the Forward/Backward algorithm.

       Essentially the only free parameters that control HMMER's heuristic filters are the P-value thresholds controlling the expected fraction of nonhomologous sequences that pass the filters.  Setting  the
       default thresholds higher will pass a higher proportion of nonhomologous sequence, increasing sensitivity at the expense of speed; conversely, setting lower P-value thresholds will pass a smaller pro‐
       portion, decreasing sensitivity and increasing speed. Setting a filter's P-value threshold to 1.0 means it will passing all sequences, and effectively disables the filter.

       Changing filter thresholds only removes or includes targets from consideration; changing filter thresholds does not alter bit scores, E-values, or alignments, all of which  are  determined  solely  in
       postprocessing.

       --max  Maximum  sensitivity.   Turn  off  all  filters, including the bias filter, and run full Forward/Backward postprocessing on every target. This increases sensitivity slightly, at a large cost in
              speed.

       --F1 <x>
              First filter threshold; set the P-value threshold for the MSV filter step.  The default is 0.02, meaning that roughly 2% of the highest scoring nonhomologous targets are expected  to  pass  the
              filter.

       --F2 <x>
              Second filter threshold; set the P-value threshold for the Viterbi filter step.  The default is 0.001.

       --F3 <x>
              Third filter threshold; set the P-value threshold for the Forward filter step.  The default is 1e-5.

       --nobias
              Turn  off  the  bias filter. This increases sensitivity somewhat, but can come at a high cost in speed, especially if the query has biased residue composition (such as a repetitive sequence re‐
              gion, or if it is a membrane protein with large regions of hydrophobicity). Without the bias filter, too many sequences may pass the filter with biased queries, leading to slower than  expected
              performance as the computationally intensive Forward/Backward algorithms shoulder an abnormally heavy load.

OPTIONS CONTROLLING E-VALUE CALIBRATION
       Estimating the location parameters for the expected score distributions for MSV filter scores, Viterbi filter scores, and Forward scores requires three short random sequence simulations.

       --EmL <n>
              Sets the sequence length in simulation that estimates the location parameter mu for MSV filter E-values. Default is 200.

       --EmN <n>
              Sets the number of sequences in simulation that estimates the location parameter mu for MSV filter E-values. Default is 200.

       --EvL <n>
              Sets the sequence length in simulation that estimates the location parameter mu for Viterbi filter E-values. Default is 200.

       --EvN <n>
              Sets the number of sequences in simulation that estimates the location parameter mu for Viterbi filter E-values. Default is 200.

       --EfL <n>
              Sets the sequence length in simulation that estimates the location parameter tau for Forward E-values. Default is 100.

       --EfN <n>
              Sets the number of sequences in simulation that estimates the location parameter tau for Forward E-values. Default is 200.

       --Eft <x>
              Sets the tail mass fraction to fit in the simulation that estimates the location parameter tau for Forward evalues. Default is 0.04.

OTHER OPTIONS
       --nonull2
              Turn off the null2 score corrections for biased composition.

       -Z <x> Assert that the total number of targets in your searches is <x>, for the purposes of per-sequence E-value calculations, rather than the actual number of targets seen.

       --domZ <x>
              Assert  that  the  total  number of targets in your searches is <x>, for the purposes of per-domain conditional E-value calculations, rather than the number of targets that passed the reporting
              thresholds.

       --seed <n>
              Seed the random number generator with <n>, an integer >= 0.  If <n> is >0, any stochastic simulations will be reproducible; the same command will give the same results.  If <n> is 0, the random
              number generator is seeded arbitrarily, and stochastic simulations will vary from run to run of the same command.  The default seed is 42.

       --qformat <s>
              Declare  that the input <seqfile> is in format <s>.  Accepted formats include fasta, embl, genbank, ddbj, uniprot, stockholm, pfam, a2m, and afa.  The default is to autodetect the format of the
              file.

       --tformat <s>
              Declare that the input <seqdb> is in format <s>.  Accepted formats include fasta, embl, genbank, ddbj, uniprot, stockholm, pfam, a2m, and afa.  The default is to autodetect the  format  of  the
              file.

       --cpu <n>
              Set  the  number  of parallel worker threads to <n>.  By default, HMMER sets this to the number of CPU cores it detects in your machine - that is, it tries to maximize the use of your available
              processor cores. Setting <n> higher than the number of available cores is of little if any value, but you may want to set it to something less. You can also control this number  by  setting  an
              environment variable, HMMER_NCPU.

              This option is only available if HMMER was compiled with POSIX threads support. This is the default, but it may have been turned off at compile-time for your site or machine for some reason.

       --stall
              For  debugging  the  MPI  master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to attach debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the
              pause.  (Under gdb: (gdb) signal SIGCONT) (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.)

       --mpi  Run in MPI master/worker mode, using mpirun.  (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.)
