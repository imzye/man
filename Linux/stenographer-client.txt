NAME
       stenocurl - curl wrapper to access Stenographer URLs

SYNOPSIS
       stenocurl /<path> [curl args...]

DESCRIPTION
       Runs 'curl' against https://stenographerserver/path, returning data on STDOUT.  Any arguments after the first are passed directly to 'curl'.

       This  script  is  mostly  used  to  access /debug/XXX URLs for Stenographer... for accessing packets, it's probably better to use the 'stenoread' wrapper around this script, which correctly passes
       packet requests into steno, then passes the results through tcpdump for easier handling.

OPTIONS
       This tool forwards its arguments to curl.
