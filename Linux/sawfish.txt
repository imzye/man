NAME
       sawfish — Sawfish window manager.

SYNOPSIS
       sawfish  [--display [=DPY] ]  [--multihead ]  [--visual [=VISUAL] ]  [--depth [=DEPTH] ]  [--disable-nls ]  [FILE ]  [--batch ]  [--interp ]  [-f, --call FUNCTION ]  [-l, --load FILE ]  [--version
       ]  [--no-rc ]  [-q, --quit ]

DESCRIPTION
       Sawfish is a lisp-extensible window manager for X11. Its aim is to allow all areas of window management (decoration, manipulation) to be customized as far as is possible, yet still remain as  fast
       or faster than existing window managers.

OPTIONS
       --display=DPY
                 Connect to X display DPY.

       --multihead
                 Fork a copy of sawfish for each screen.

       --visual=VISUAL
                 Preferred VISUAL type.

       --depth=DEPTH
                 Preferred color DEPTH.

       --disable-nls
                 Disable internationalization of messages.

       FILE
                 Load the Lisp file FILE (from the cwd if possible, implies --batch mode).

       --batch
                 Batch mode: process options and exit.

       --interp
                 Interpreted mode: don't load compiled Lisp files.

       -f, --call       FUNCTION
                 Call Lisp function FUNCTION.

       -l, --load       FILE
                 Load the file of Lisp forms called FUNCTION.

       --version Print version details.

       --no-rc   Don't load rc or site-init files.
