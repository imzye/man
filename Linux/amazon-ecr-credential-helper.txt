NAME
       docker-credential-ecr-login - Amazon ECR Credential Helper for Docker

SYNOPSIS
       docker-credential-ecr-login COMMAND

       docker-credential-ecr-login -v

DESCRIPTION
       The Amazon ECR Credential Helper for Docker is a credential helper for the docker(1) command that makes it easier to store and retrieve container images with Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

USAGE
       Place the docker-credential-ecr-login binary on your PATH and set the contents of your ~/.docker/config.json to be

       {
         "credsStore":"ecr-login"
       }

       With  Docker  1.13.0  or  greater, you can configure Docker to use different credential helpers for different registries.  To use this credential helper for a specific ECR registry, create a cred‐
       sHelper section with the URI of your ECR registry:

       {
         "credHelpers": {
           "public.ecr.aws": "ecr-login",
           "aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com": "ecr-login"
         }
       }

       Once installed, you may use docker pull and docker push with ECR repositories, without running docker login.

AWS CREDENTIALS
       The credential helper reads AWS credentials from standard locations, including environment variables, the shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials), EC2 instance profiles, and ECS task roles.

       To use credentials associated with a different named profile in the shared credentials file, you may set the AWS_PROFILE environment variable.

       The credential helper reads and supports some configuration options specified in the shared configuration file (~/.aws/config).  To disable these options, you must set the AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG  en‐
       vironment variable to false.  The supported options include:

       • Assumed roles specified with role_arn and source_profile

       • External credential processes specified with credential_process

       • Web Identities like IAM roles for Service Accounts in Kubernetes

       The credentials must have a policy applied that allows access to Amazon ECR.  See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ecr_managed_policies.html for more information.

OPTIONS
       -v              Print the version and git commit used to build docker-credential-ecr-login

COMMANDS
       get             Retrieve credentials for a specific Amazon ECR registry. The registry should be passed to the credential helper via stdin(3) and results will be printed to stdout(3)

       list            Retrieve the names of each registry currently known to the helper. The helper will cache the names of all requested registries and return them here.

       version         Return the version of the credential helper protocol implemented by this helper

       store           This command is not implemented and is a no-op.

       erase           This command is not implemented and is a no-op.

BUGS
       Kubernetes  users using the credential helper inside containers with a non-root user may encounter permission issues described here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/pull/1185.  You
       may be able to work around this bug by adjusting the Kubernetes securityContext.
