NAME
       tjbench - benchmark the performance of libjpeg-turbo

USAGE
       tjbench <Inputfile (BMP|PPM)> <Quality> [options]

       tjbench <Inputfile (JPG)> [options]

OPTIONS
       -alloc

              Dynamically allocate JPEG image buffers

       -bmp

              Generate output images in Windows Bitmap format (default=PPM)

       -bottomup

              Test bottom-up compression/decompression

       -tile

              Test performance of the codec when the image is encoded as separate tiles of varying sizes.

       -forcemmx, -forcesse, -forcesse2, -forcesse3

              Force MMX, SSE, SSE2, or SSE3 code paths in the underlying codec

       -rgb, -bgr, -rgbx, -bgrx, -xbgr, -xrgb

              Test the specified color conversion path in the codec (default: BGR)

       -fastupsample

              Use the fastest chrominance upsampling algorithm available in the underlying codec

       -fastdct

              Use the fastest DCT/IDCT algorithms available in the underlying codec

       -accuratedct

               Use the most accurate DCT/IDCT algorithms available in the underlying codec

       -subsamp <s>

              When  testing JPEG compression, this option specifies the level of chrominance subsampling to use (<s> = 444, 422, 440, 420, or GRAY).  The default is to test Grayscale, 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4
              in sequence.

       -quiet

              Output results in tabular rather than verbose format

       -yuvencode

              Encode RGB input as planar YUV rather than compressing as JPEG

       -yuvdecode

              Decode JPEG image to planar YUV rather than RGB

       -scale M/N

              scale down the width/height of the decompressed JPEG image by a factor of M/N (M/N = 2/1, 15/8, 7/4, 13/8, 3/2, 11/8, 5/4, 9/8, 1/1, 7/8, 3/4, 5/8, 1/2, 3/8, 1/4, or 1/8)

       -hflip, -vflip, -transpose, -transverse, -rot90, -rot180, -rot270

              Perform the corresponding lossless transform prior to decompression (these options are mutually exclusive)

       -grayscale

              Perform lossless grayscale conversion prior to decompression test (can be combined with the other transforms above)

       -benchtime <t>

              Run each benchmark for at least <t> seconds (default = 5.0)

              NOTE: If the quality is specified as a range (e.g. 90-100), a separate test will be performed for all quality values in the range.
