NAME
       bpfmon - BPF based visual packet rate monitor

SYNOPSIS
       bpfmon

       bpfmon [-autzvIiLlnNh] <device> '<bpf_filter_code>'

       bpfmon [-autzvIiLlnNh] iptables '[<table>] <chain> <rulenum>'

       bpfmon [-autzvIiLlnNh] iptables [select]

       bpfmon [-autzvIiLlnNh] ip6tables '[<table>] <chain> <rulenum>'

       bpfmon [-autzvIiLlnNh] ip6tables [select]

DESCRIPTION
       bpfmon (like tcpdump) uses BPF filter to select packets that match the filter.  While with tcpdump it is easy to see what packets match the filter, bpfmon shows how much are the matches packets in
       terms of bytes per second and packets per second.

       bpfmon displays the information in pseudo-graphical text interface, developed for modern terminals, but it also supports pure ASCII display.

       In addition, bpfmon allows instead of monitoring packets matching a BPF filter to get its data from an iptables/ip6tables rule (on Linux systems).

       In interactive mode, there are hot keys to display help or modify the mode of operation.

       Without any arguments, bpfmon will display its version and options help.
