NAME
       convmvfs - utility that mirrors a whole filesystem tree from one charset to another.

SYNOPSIS
       convmvfs mountpoint [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the convmvfs command.

       convmvfs  is a FUSE (File System in Userspace) utility that transparently mirrors a filesystem tree converting the filenames from one charset to another on the fly. Only the names of files and di‐
       rectories are converted, the file content remains intact. The mirrored tree is mounted at the given mountpoint.

OPTIONS
   General options
       -o opt[,opt...]
              mount options

       -h, --help
              print help

       -V, --version
              print version

       -h, --help
              show summary of options

   FUSE options
       -d, -o debug
              enable debug output (implies -f)

       -f     foreground operation

       -s     disable multi-threaded operation

       -o     Mount options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma separated list of options.  The following options are recognized:

              allow_other
                     allow access to other users

              allow_root
                     allow access to root

              nonempty
                     allow mounts over non-empty file/dir

              default_permissions
                     enable permission checking by kernel

              fsname=NAME
                     set filesystem name

              large_read
                     issue large read requests (2.4 only)

              max_read=N
                     set maximum size of read requests

              hard_remove
                     immediate removal (don't hide files)

              use_ino
                     let filesystem set inode numbers

              readdir_ino
                     try to fill in d_ino in readdir

              direct_io
                     use direct I/O

              kernel_cache
                     cache files in kernel

              umask=M
                     set file permissions (octal)

              uid=N  set file owner

              gid=N  set file group

              entry_timeout=T
                     cache timeout for names (1.0s)

              negative_timeout=T
                     cache timeout for deleted names (0.0s)

              attr_timeout=T
                     cache timeout for attributes (1.0s)

              srcdir=PATH
                     which directory to convert

              icharset=CHARSET
                     charset used in srcdir

              ocharset=CHARSET
                     charset used in mounted filesystem

NOTES
       If you use a normal user account to mount the file system be sure to have r/w permissions to /dev/fuse.

       Use iconv --list to see which charsets are supported.

       To allow other users to access the mount point use allow_other option.

       IMPORTANT: if the mount point and srcdir point at the same directory, readdir call will enter a dead loop.  BE SURE TO AVOID THIS SITUATION!

SAMPLE USE
       to mount:
       $ convmvfs /ftp/pub_gbk -o srcdir=/ftp/pub,icharset=utf8,ocharset=gbk

       to unmount:
       $ fusermount -u /ftp/pub_gbk
