NAME
       binfmtasm-interpreter - binfmt_misc Assembly handler

SYNOPSIS
       binfmtasm-interpreter Assembly-source-file-name [command-line opions ...]

DESCRIPTION
       binfmtasm-interpreter compiles an assembly source file specified on the command-line using gas compiler, and executes the resulting file.

       It is designed to be used as a handler for binfmt_misc handler, which is a system used in Linux for handling arbitrary files as executables.

       The command-line options are passed on to the compiled binary.

FILE MAGIC
       There is a requirement for C++ source files to have the magic characters /*BINFMTASMCPP: at the beginning of the file.

       That line also is used to specify the additional command-line options for the assmebler.

ENVIRONMENT
       GAS    The compiler used.  The default is to use gcc

       AS     The compiler used, if GAS variable is not set.

              Will fall back to using GCC and CC

       BINFMTCTMPDIR

              Temporary directory used for binary and execution.

              Falls back to $TMPDIR $TEMPDIR or /tmp

       BINFMTC_DEBUG
              enables debug output if set.

       BINFMTASM_GAS_OPTS
              Additional G++ options.  Use BINFMTC_DEBUG to verify the options being passed on to g++.

              The default is  -O2 -Wall
