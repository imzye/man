       abc2abc - a simple abc checker/re-formatter/transposer

SYNOPSIS
       abc2abc  file [ -s ] [ -n ] [ -b ] [ -r ] [ -e ] [ -t semitones ] [ -nda ] [ -u ] [ -d ] [ -v ] [ -Vvoice number] [-Pvoice number] [-nokeys] [ -nokeyf] [ -usekey(sharps/flats)] [-useclef(treble/clef)]
       [ -OCC ]

DESCRIPTION
       abc2abc is a simple abc checker/re-formatter/transposer.  It will check whether the file given on the command line obeys basic abc syntax.

       If you want to check an abc tune, it is recommended that you use abc2midi with the -c option.  This performs extra checks that abc2abc does not do.

       The output of abc2abc goes to standard output.  Use redirection to save it to a file.

OPTIONS
       -s     Rework spacing in the file (which affects how notes are beamed together when the music is printed out). This option does not appear to be working correctly.

       -n X   Reformats the abc file with line breaks every X bars.

       -b     Don't do bar checking.

       -r     Don't do repeat checking.

       -e     Don't report errors.

       -t n   Transpose tune by n semitones. This function will also work with K: none or one of -nokeys or -nokeyf.  If a voice is assigned to channel 10 (drum channel) using a %%MIDI  channel  10  command,
              then this voice is never transposed.

       -nda   Convert double accidentals in guitar chord to another chord though strictly not correct.

       -u     Update notation; the older notation + + for chords is replaced by [] and s s for slurs is replaced by ().

       -OCC   Accept the old notation for chord. Normally this is turned off, since it conflicts with abc draft standard version 2.0 for decorations (eg. +crescendo(+).

       -d     Re-notate the tune with all note lengths doubled. The unit length specified by the L: field command is halved (e.g. L:1/8 to L:1/16).

       -v     Re-notate the tune with all note lengths halved. The unit length specified by the L: field command is doubled (e.g. L:1/8 to L:1/4).

       -ver   Prints version number and exits.

       -V X[,Y...]
              For multivoiced abc files (i.e. contains V: field commands), only voices X[,Y,...] are copied.

       -P X,[,Y...]
              For multivoiced abc files (i.e. contains V: field commands), all voices except X[,Y...] remain the same. Voices X,Y... are modified according the other runtime parameters.

       -X n   For a file containing many tunes, the X: reference numbers are renumbered sequentially starting from number n.

       -xref n
              Only the tune with X: n is processed.

       -nokeys
              No key signature will be assumed. Instead, sharps and naturals will be placed wherever they are needed.

       -nokeyf
              No key signature will be assumed. Instead, flats and naturals will be placed wherever they are needed.

       -usekey  sf
              This  will  force abc2abc to output the notes in the key signature keys[sf] where sf specifies the number of flats (-negative) or sharps (+positive) in the key signature. It is a number between
              -5 and +5 inclusive.

       -useclef
              This works with only the -t (transpose) and provided the abc file does not already have a clef command in the K: field. It does not support voices.

       * Normally abc2abc will convert the deprecated notation for decorations (eg. !ppp!) to the abc version 2.0 draft standard (eg. +ppp+).  If you do not wish to change to this standard include  the  -OCC
       flag.
