NAME
       mimetex - LaTeX math expressions to anti-aliased GIF images converter

SYNOPSIS
       mimetex [options] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mimetex command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       mimetex is a program that parses LaTeX math expressions emitting directly anti-aliased GIF images without intermediate dvi-to-gif conversion.

       -d     dump gif image on stdout [default]

       -e export_file
              write gif image to export_file

       -f input_file
              read expression from input_file

       -m msglevel
              verbosity of debugging output

       -o     render image with opaque background

       -s fontsize
              default fontsize, 0-5

       -m 0-99
              controls verbosity level for debugging output (usually used only while testing code).
