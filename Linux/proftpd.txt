NAME
       proftpd  -  Professional  configurable,  secure  file transfer protocol
       server

SYNOPSIS
       proftpd [ -hlntv ] [ -c config-file ] [ -d debuglevel ] [ -p 0|1 ]

DESCRIPTION
       proftpd is the Professional File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server daemon.
       The  server may be invoked by the Internet "super-server" inetd(8) each
       time a connection to the FTP service is made, or alternatively  it  can
       be run as a standalone daemon.

       Each successful and failed ftp(1) session is logged using syslog with a
       facility of LOG_FTP.  Note: LOG_FTP messages are not displayed by  sys‐
       logd(8) by default, and may have to be enabled in syslogd(8)'s configu‐
       ration file.

       When proftpd is run in standalone mode and it receives a SIGHUP then it
       will  reread its configuration file.  When run in standalone mode with‐
       out the -n option, the main proftpd daemon writes  its  process  ID  to
       /run/proftpd/proftpd.pid  to  make  it  easy  to  know which process to
       SIGHUP.

OPTIONS
       -h,--help   Display a short usage description, including all  available
                   options.

       -n,--nodaemon
                   Runs  the  proftpd process in standalone mode (must be con‐
                   figured as such in the configuration file),  but  does  not
                   background the process or disassociate it from the control‐
                   ling tty.  Additionally, all output (log or debug messages)
                   are sent to stderr, rather than the syslog mechanism.  Most
                   often used with the -d option for debugging.

       -q,--quiet  Quiet mode; don't  send  logging  information  to  standard
                   error when running with the -n option.

       -v,--version
                   Displays the version number of ProFTPD to stdout.

       -D,--define parameter
                   Sets  a  configuration  parameter  which can be used <IfDe‐
                   fine>...</IfDefine> sections in the configuration files  to
                   conditionally skip or process commands.

       -d,--debug debuglevel
                   Sets  proftpd's  internal  debug  level  (normally 0).  The
                   debuglevel should be an integer value from 0  to  10,  with
                   higher  numbers  producing  more  debug  output.  Normally,
                   debug messages are sent to syslog using the DEBUG facility,
                   however  if  the -n option is used, all such output is sent
                   to stderr.

       -c,--config config-file
                   Specifies an alternate config-file to be parsed at startup,
                   rather  than  the  default configuration file.  The default
                   configuration file is /etc/proftpd.conf

       -N,--nocollision
                   Disables address/port collision checking.

       -S,--serveraddr
                   Specifies an IP address for the host machine,  avoiding  an
                   DNS lookup of the hostname

       -t,--configtest
                   Read  the configuration file, report any syntax errors, and
                   exit.

       -p,--persistent 0|1
                   Disables (0) or enables (1) the default persistent password
                   support,  which  is  determined  at configure time for each
                   platform.  This option only affects the default support, it
                   can  still  be  overridden at run-time with the Persistent‐
                   Passwd directive.

       -l,--list   Lists all modules compiled into proftpd.

       -V,--settings
                   Displays various compile-time settings and exits.

       -X,--nofork Debug mode (do not fork a session process); exits after one
                   session.

       -4,--ipv4   Support  IPv4 functionality only, regardless of whether the
                   --enable-ipv6 configure option was used.

       -6,--ipv6   Support IPv6 connections and lookup of IPv6  addresses  for
                   server  DNS  names.   This  is  enabled  by default, if the
                   --enable-ipv6 configure option is used.
