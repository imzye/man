NAME
       seapplet - setroubleshoot client GUI applet

SYNOPSIS
       seapplet

DESCRIPTION
       seapplet is a GTK‐based GUI applet designed to notify users of new SELinux alerts and open sealert to assist with their resolution. Seapplet is normally started at login by the desktop session manager
       and does not need to be executed manually. In order to function properly, seapplet requires that the desktop environment provides a System Tray implementation in which the applet will be embedded.
