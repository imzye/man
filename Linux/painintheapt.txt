PAININTHEAPT(8)                                                                           System Manager's Manual                                                                           PAININTHEAPT(8)

NAME
       painintheapt - Pester people about available package updates by email or jabber.

       Pain  in  the  APT pesters people about available package upgrades, just like apticron or cron-apt. However, it does so by SMTP and XMPP (direct or MUC/conference room or pubsub node), but also by
       calling mailx.

WHAT DOES IT DO?
       1. updates the APT cache and checks for updates

       2. sends list of available updates to Jabber contacts or a conference room or pubsub node immediately

       3. sends list of available updates and relevant changelogs (slow) to email recipients

       4. downloads packages, but does not install them

       Messages are only sent when there is any change in either the list of updates or in the configuration of painintheapt.

OPTIONS
       -c, --configfile configuration file
              configuration file, (defaults: /etc/painintheapt.conf)

       -d, --debug
              print debug output to stderr

       -f, --force
              send message, even if updates did not change

       -h, --help
              print help

       -s, --stampfile stamp file
              stamp file (default: /var/lib/painintheapt/stamp)

       -t, --testmessage
              send a test message only

       -v, --version
              print version

CONFIGURATION
       The default configuration file is /etc/painintheapt.conf in inifile format.

       There are up to three sections, SMTP, XMPP, and MAILX.  The keys for SMTP are server, port, username, password_file, from, to, cc, and send_changes.  The keys for XMPP are jid, password_file,  to,
       room, pubsub_service, pubsub_node, and send_changes.  The keys for MAILX are from, to, cc, and send_changes.  See the sample configuration for their usage.

       The typical cron file is /etc/cron.d/painintheapt. One may call painintheapt without arguments daily, and with the --force option weekly, to make sure the transport does work.

       It is highly recommended to set the accompanying logo as Jabber avatar for the respective user.
