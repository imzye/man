NAME
       mia-viewitgui - Visualization of 3D data

SYNOPSIS
       mia-viewitgui [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mia-viewitgui This program is used to visualize 3D data sets and deformations.

OPTIONS
              -s --src-mesh=
                     mesh to be visualized  For supported file types see PLUGINS:mesh/io

              -v --vectorfield=
                     vector field describing the mesh deformation  For supported file types see PLUGINS:3dtransform/io

   Help & Info
              -V --verbose=warning
                     verbosity of output, print messages of given level and higher priorities. Supported priorities starting at lowest level are:
                        info - Low level messages
                        trace - Function call trace
                        fail - Report test failures
                        warning - Warnings
                        error - Report errors
                        debug - Debug output
                        message - Normal messages
                        fatal - Report only fatal errors

                 --copyright
                     print copyright information

              -h --help
                     print this help

              -? --usage
                     print a short help

                 --version
                     print the version number and exit

   Processing
                 --threads=-1
                     Maxiumum  number of threads to use for processing,This number should be lower or equal to the number of logical processor cores in the machine.
                     (-1: automatic estimation).
