NAME
       t3highlight - create syntax highlighted document from source file.

SYNOPSIS
       t3highlight [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       t3highlight reads a source file and creates a syntax highlighted document from it.

OPTIONS
       t3highlight accepts the following options:

       -d  type, --document-type=type
              For  styles  which define multiple document types, select a specific type instead of the default. For example, the html style supplied with t3highlight provides the standalone, separate-css
              and raw styles. By default the first (standalone) is chosen. See the -D/--list-document-types option for finding out the available document types.

       -D, --list-document-types
              Show a list of the available document types for the selected output style, and exit.

       -l lang, --language=lang
              Use source language lang for highlighting. See the -L/--list option for finding out the available languages.

       --language-file=file
              Use the file file for highlighting. This option allows loading of highlighting patterns directly from a file, rather than using a named language from the lang.map file. This is particularly
              useful when developing new highlighting patterns.

       -L, --list
              Show a list of all the available source languages and output styles, and exit.

       -s style, --style=style
              Use output style style to create the output document. The default is the esc style, which uses escape sequences to provide colored output to the terminal. See the -L/--list option for find‐
              ing out the available styles.

       -t tag, --tag=tag
              The header and footer, as defined by the document style, may contain tag references in the form %{name}. The tags name and charset are always defined, but a document style may include more.
              This option allows specification of extra values, or overriding of predefined tags. tag must have the form name=value.

              Tags in the header or footer that have not been defined will be removed.  An example of a custom tag is the css tag used in the separate-css document style of the html  output  style.  This
              allows insertion of the desired CSS style sheet URL into the generated file.

       -v, --verbose
              Print verbose warning messages.
