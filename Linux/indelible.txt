NAME
       indelible - powerful and flexible simulator of biological evolution

SYNOPSIS
       indelible

       No options can be passed via the commandline.

DESCRIPTION
       indelible can simulate evolution of multi-partitioned nucleotide, amino-acid, or codon data sets through the processes of insertion, deletion, and substitution in continuous time. All common evo‐
       lutionary models are supported.

       The full documentation for indelible is available under /usr/share/doc/indelible/help/index.html.

CONFIGURATION
       indelible reads the settings for a simulation run from a file named control.txt in the current directory. The file is split into blocks, with each block controlling one particular aspect of the
       simulation. Blocks may contain further sub-blocks. Comments can be given in C or C++ style. If indelible is executed without a control file present, an example file is generated.

       [TYPE] type
              Every control file must begin with a TYPE block. The possible types are NUCLEOTIDE, AMINOACID, and CODON.

       [SETTINGS]
              This block specifies non-essential user preferences such as output file types and formats, seeds for the random number generator, and whether to output detailed reports.

       [MODEL] modelname
              This  block  starts a new evolutionary model to be used for simulation. The particular parameters including substitution models, indel-rates and codon-site models are controlled via submod‐
              els. modelname can be any name of your choosing.

       [TREE] treename newick
              This block is used to specify a guide-tree with the given name treename. Evolutionary distances are represented as branch lengths for the tree in NEWICK format.

       [BRANCHES]
              These blocks are used to simulate non-stationary and non-homogenous processes. Different models can be specified on different branches of the guide-tree allowing branches to have  different
              models of substitution, indel length distribution, rate heterogeneity, base composition etc.

       [PARTITIONS] partitionname
              During each run multiple sequence partitions can be simulated. For each partition the guide-tree, evolutionary model and sequence length has to be specified.

       [EVOLVE]
              Within this block multiple replicas of a partition may be generated.
