NAME
       pamtris - triangle rasterizer featuring perspective-correct interpolation of generic vertex attributes and depth buffering

SYNOPSIS
       pamtris

       -width=width

       -height=height

       { -num_attribs=attributes_per_vertex [ -tupletype=tupletype ] | -rgb | -grayscale }

       [ -maxval=maxval ]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may use either white space or an equals sign between an option name
       and its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamtris can be used to draw a great variety of 2D and 3D graphics by composing arbitrarily complex pictures out of separate triangles, triangle strips and triangle fans. The program reads instructions
       written in a simple command script notation from Standard Input and outputs its results as a (potentially multi-image) PAM stream on Standard Output.

       For example, the following input

             mode fan
             attribs 0 128 0
             vertex 0 0 1
             attribs 0 0 128
             vertex 200 0 1
             attribs 50 20 103
             vertex 190 61 1
             attribs 100 40 78
             vertex 161 117 1
             attribs 150 60 53
             vertex 117 161 1
             attribs 200 80 28
             vertex 61 190 1
             attribs 250 100 3
             vertex 0 200 1
             print

       produces this:

       Example pamtris output for FAN mode

       The  input  file  gives triangle data by setting the appropriate drawing mode, if necessary, and then providing a list of vertices. Each vertex is also associated with a list of up to 20 "attributes,"
       which are integer values between 0 and a given maxval. In the most common usage, you use pamtris to draw a visual image and a vertex has three attributes, which are an RGB specification  of  a  color.
       Such attribute lists may be provided on a per-vertex basis.

       Prior  to effectively writing a PAM image to Standard Output, pamtris first rasterizes it onto an internal frame buffer, which consists of an "image buffer" and a "depth buffer." The image buffer con‐
       sists of a sequence of height rows containing a sequence of width tuples. There is one sample for each vertex attribute in every tuple plus an opacity (alpha) sample. Each tuple in the image buffer is
       also  associated  with  an integer depth in the depth buffer, which determines whether subsequent drawing operations affect that particular tuple or not. This provides a way of depth-sorting graphical
       objects which is adequate for many purposes in 2D and 3D computer graphics. One prominent shortcoming of such an approach to depth-sorting, however, is that it does not automatically work with objects
       which are intended to appear "translucent," therefore requiring more elaborate strategies to incorporate said objects into pictures generated using this technique.

       The opacity sample is the last sample of the tuple.  pamtris manipulates opacity internally and for any tuple it is always either 0 or the maxval.  The program does not provide the user direct control
       over the alpha image plane.

       pamtris rasterizes triangles by approximating their visible area as a collection of tuples at particular positions in the frame buffer, and to each sample of every such tuple it assigns a value  which
       is  a perspective-correct interpolation between the values of the corresponding attribute for each vertex of the triangle. Whenever a tuple within the area of the frame buffer is produced, it is writ‐
       ten to the corresponding position in the frame buffer if and only if it passes a depth test.  This test works as follows: the depth value of every incoming tuple (which is itself an interpolation  be‐
       tween  the Z-coordinates of the vertices of the corresponding triangle) is compared against the value in the corresponding position in the depth buffer. If the depth value of the incoming tuple equals
       or is smaller than the depth value already present in said position in the depth buffer, the following happens.

       •      Every sample i, where 0 &#8804; i < num_attribs, of the tuple in the corresponding position in the image buffer is set to equal the value of the respective sample of the incoming tuple; and the
              alpha sample (the last one) is updated to the maxval;

       •      The depth value in the corresponding position in the depth buffer is updated to a depth value directly proportional to that of the incoming tuple.

       Otherwise, that particular tuple effects no change at all in the frame buffer.

       The frame buffer is initially set so that all samples in every tuple of the image buffer contain the value 0, and all entries in the depth buffer contain the maximum permitted depth value.

       The  attributes' values, and therefore the samples in the output PAM images, have no fixed interpretation ascribed to them (except for the last image plane, which is deliberately supposed to represent
       tuple opacity information); one may ascribe any suitable meaning to them, such as that of colors, texture coordinates, surface normals, light interaction  characteristics,  texture  influence  coeffi‐
       cients for multi-texturing, etc.

EXAMPLES
   Fan Mode
       The following command generates the image from the fan mode example at the top of the DESCRIPTION ⟨#description⟩  section. If the file fan.tris contains that code, you could process it with:

           $ pamtris -height=200 -width=200 -rgb <fan.tris >fan.pam

   Strip Mode
       The following is an example of strip mode:

             mode strip
             attribs 255 0 0   # red
             vertex   0 200 1
             vertex  50   0 1
             attribs 0 0 0     # black
             vertex 100 200 1
             attribs 0 205 205 # cyan
             vertex 150 0 1
             attribs 0 0 255   # blue
             vertex 200 200 1
             vertex 250   0 1
             print

       Save the above code in a file named strip.tris (for instance) and process it with:

           $ pamtris -height=200 -width=200 -rgb <strip.tris >strip.pam

       to yield:

       Example pamtris output for STRIP mode

   Triangle Mode
       The following is an example of triangle mode:

             # yellow square
             mode strip
             attrib 155 155 0
             vertex 50  50 100
             vertex 50 200 100
             vertex 200 50 100
             vertex 200 200 100

             # blue triangle
             mode triangles
             attrib 0 205 205
             vertex 20 125 70
             attrib 0 0 140
             vertex 230  70 120 # Change "120" and see what happens
             vertex 230 180 120 #
             print

       Save the above code in a file named pierce.tris (for instance) and process it with:

           $ pamtris -height=200 -width=200 -rgb <pierce.tris >pierce.pam

       to yield:

       Example pamtris output for TRIANGLES mode

   Meta-programming
       The  pamtris  command language is much too rudimentary to be used directly for any serious drawing; you will probably want to use a general purpose programming language to generate a temporary pamtris
       command file.

       For example, the draw_polygon procedure in the C program below outputs pamtris instructions to draw a regular polygon. It does this by generating a number of vertex  instructions  tracing  around  the
       perimeter  of  the  corresponding  circumscribed  circle. (Note: The PAM image produced by piping the output of the below program into pamtris was subsequently downscaled through pamscale -linear -xs‐
       cale 0.25 -yscale 0.25 to achieve an anti-aliased ⟨#antialias⟩  effect.)

       Regular Polygons

       /* ----------------------- *
        * width       = 512       *
        * height      = 512       *
        * num_attribs = 3         *
        * tupletype   = RGB_ALPHA *
        * ----------------------- */

       #include <math.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>

       #define PI 3.14159265358979323844

       void draw_polygon
       (int const center_x, int const center_y, int const radius, int const sides)
       {
           printf("mode fan\n"
                  "vertex %d %d 0\n", center_x, center_y);

           for(int i = 0; i <= sides; i++)
           {
               int const x = round(center_x + radius * cos(i*2.0*PI / sides));
               int const y = round(center_y - radius * sin(i*2.0*PI / sides));

               printf("vertex %d %d 0\n", x, y);
           }
       }

       int main(void)
       {
           puts("attribs 0 185 80");       /* color: green   */
           draw_polygon(300, 210, 150, 5); /* draws pentagon */

           puts("attribs 255 15 240");     /* color: magenta */
           draw_polygon(150, 320, 100, 7); /* draws heptagon */

           puts("!");
       }

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pamtris recognizes the following command line options:

       <dl compact="compact">

       -width=width
              Sets the width of the internal frame buffer and, by extension, of the output PAM images, given in number of columns. This must be an integer in the closed range [1, 8192].

              This option is mandatory.

       -height=height
              This is the height of the internal frame buffer and, by extension, of the output PAM images, given in number of rows. This must be an integer in the closed range [1, 8192].

              This option is mandatory.

       -num_attribs=attributes_per_vertex
              This is the number of attributes per vertex. The depth of the output PAM images equals this value plus one (to accomodate the alpha plane). The argument must be an integer in the  closed  range
              [1, 20].

              The input instruction stream may override this with a reset command.

              You must specify exactly one of -num_attribs, -rgb, and -grayscale.

       -tupletype=tupletype
              This is the tuple type for the output PAM images. The argument is a string which may be no longer than 255 characters.

              The input instruction stream may override this with a reset command.

              The default is a null string.

              This option cannot be specified together with  -rgb or -grayscale.

       -rgb   This  is a convenience option which simply serves as an alias for -num_attribs=3 -tupletype=RGB_ALPHA. In other words, this option is a quick way to specify that you are going to use pamtris to
              draw RGB(_ALPHA) color images directly, and the three vertex attributes are the red, green and blue levels of the color associated with the vertex, in that order.

              The input instruction stream may override this with a reset command.

              You must specify exactly one of -num_attribs, -rgb, and -grayscale.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.85 (December 2018).

       -grayscale
              Another convenience option, similar to -rgb; except this one is an alias for -num_attribs=1 -tupletype=GRAYSCALE_ALPHA. The one vertex attribute is the gray level associated with the vertex.

              The input instruction stream may override this with a reset command.

              You must specify exactly one of -num_attribs, -rgb, and -grayscale.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.85 (December 2018).

       -maxval=maxval
              Sets the maxval of the output PAM images, which is also the maximum permitted value for each vertex attribute. This must be an integer in the closed range [1, 65535].

              The default value is 255.

              The input instruction stream may override this with a reset command.

INSTRUCTION CODE
       The input for pamtris consists of a stream of text lines read from Standard Input.

       Empty lines or lines that contain only white space characters are called blank lines and are ignored.

       When a # occurs anywhere in a line, pamtris ignores it along with every character after it. In other words, everything from the # until the end of the line receives the same treatment as white space.

       Lines which are not blank must contain a sequence of strings, called tokens, separated by white space.  The first such token must be one of the commands recognized by pamtris, and all  further  tokens
       are  interpreted  as the arguments for that command, if it takes any. When an insufficient number of arguments is provided for a command, the line is considered invalid and is given the same treatment
       as a blank line. The same happens when an out of range argument or one of a kind different of what is expected is given (for example, when you give a string of letters where a numerical value  is  ex‐
       pected),  or when an unrecognized command/argument is found. When a number of arguments greater than that required for a particular command is provided, only the portion of the line up to the last re‐
       quired argument is considered and any further tokens are ignored.

       pamtris is case-insensitive. That is, mode, MODE, mODe, etc. are all treated the same way.

       The commands recognized by pamtris are:

       mode

       attribs

       vertex

       print

       clear

       reset

       quit

       You may use a minimum unique abbreviation of a command name.  You may use an exclamation mark (!) in place of the print command name and an asterisk (*) in place of clear.

       The functions of the commands are as follows.

       mode { triangles | strip | fan }

              This makes pamtris enter a new drawing mode. The argument is a word which specifies the mode to change to. Instead of a full argument name, it is permissible to provide a minimum unique  abbre‐
              viation, which has the same effect. The drawing mode will remain the same until the next mode command is given.

              This  command also resets the current vertex list, which is (re)initialized to an empty state after the command is executed. One may add new vertices to this list through successive invocations
              of the vertex command (see below). You do not have to worry about providing "too many" vertices, since the vertex list is virtualized: pamtris maintains only the state pertaining to three  ver‐
              tices at any one time. The current vertex list is initially empty.

              It  is  permissible  to  give  pamtris a mode command which instructs it to enter a drawing mode it is currently already in. One might use this approach to reset the current vertex list without
              changing the current drawing mode.

              Regardless of the current drawing mode, the program immediately rasterizes a new triangle into the frame buffer as soon as you provide the necessary vertices for it through the  current  vertex
              list. (If you reset the vertex list before giving all the vertices necessary to draw a new triangle, the program effectively discards from the list any vertices that might have been pushed into
              the vertex list up to that point without using them to draw any new triangles.)

              In the following descriptions of each drawing mode, triangles' and vertices' indices (ordinal numbers) are 0-based.

              The triangles argument instructs pamtris to enter the "TRIANGLES" drawing mode. While in this mode, a series of separate triangles is constructed. Every three vertices pushed into  the  current
              vertex  list  specify a new triangle.  Formally, this means that every Nth triangle is specified by vertices 3*N, 3*N + 1, and 3*N + 2. This is the default initial mode and is therefore not re‐
              quired to be set explicitly before drawing any triangles.

              The strip argument instructs pamtris to enter the "STRIP" drawing mode.  While in this mode, pamtris constructs a "triangle strip." That is, the first three vertices  pushed  into  the  current
              vertex  list  specify  the  first  triangle, and every new vertex pushed after that specifies, together with the previous two, the next triangle. Formally, this means that every Nth triangle is
              specified by vertices N, N + 1, and N + 2.

              The fan argument instructs pamtris to enter the "FAN" drawing mode.  While in this mode, a so-called "triangle fan" is constructed.  That is, the first three vertices pushed  into  the  current
              vertex list specify the first triangle, and every new vertex pushed after that specifies, together with the previous vertex and the first one, the next triangle. Formally, this means that every
              Nth triangle is specified by vertices 0, N + 1, and N + 2.

       attribs a<sub>0 a<sub>1
              a<sub>2 ... a<sub>num_attribs - 1

              This updates the current attribute values list. This command takes as arguments a sequence of num_attribs integers which represent the values of the attributes to be associated  with  the  next
              vertex. This sequence of values is the just mentioned "current attribute values list."

              Each  ith  argument,  where  0 &#8804; i < num_attribs, indicates the value to be assigned to the ith attribute of the current attribute values list. All arguments must be integer values in the
              closed range [0, maxval].  If a number of arguments less than the current value of num_attribs is given, the command is considered invalid and is therefore ignored.

              The current attribute values list remains unchanged until the next valid attribs or reset command is given. The attribs command allows one to change the values of each  attribute  individually,
              while the reset command is not specifically designed for that function, but it has the side effect of setting all values in the current attribute values list to the maxval (see below).

              All values in the current attribute values list are initially set to the maxval.

              <dt id="cmd_vertex">vertex x y z [w]

              Adds  a  new  vertex to the current vertex list (see the mode command above), assigning the values of the arguments to its respective coordinates, and the values in the current attribute values
              list (see the attribs command above) to the respective entries in the attribute list associated with the vertex.

              x, y and z must be integer values in the closed range [-32767, 32767].  x and y represent, respectively, the column and row of the tuple which corresponds to the location of  the  vertex.  Such
              values may correspond to tuples outside the limits of the frame buffer. The origin of the coordinate system is at the top-left tuple of the frame buffer. The X-axis goes from left to right, and
              the Y-axis from top to bottom. A negative value for x indicates a column that many tuples to the left of the leftmost column of the frame buffer.  Likewise, a negative value for y  indicates  a
              row  that many tuples above the uppermost row of the frame buffer. Observe that those coordinates correspond directly to a particular point in the coordinate system delineated above, regardless
              of whether you are trying to draw an image which is supposed to look as if viewed "in perspective" or not; pamtris does not "warp" the coordinates you give in any way.  Therefore, if  you  want
              to  draw  images in perspective, you must compute values for x and y already projected into pamtris' coordinate system yourself, using an external perspective projection method, prior to giving
              them to the program.

              The z parameter represents the  Z-coordinate of the vertex, which is used to compute depth values for tuples within the areas of rasterized triangles. Intuitively, smaller  values  for  z  mean
              "closer  to the viewer," and larger ones mean "farther away from the viewer" (but remember: as said above, the x and y coordinates are not warped in any way, which implies that they are not af‐
              fected by z; neither by the next parameter, for that matter).

              Optionally, you may provide a w parameter which represents a "perspective correction factor" used to properly interpolate vertex attributes across the area of the corresponding  triangle.  This
              must  be an integer value in the closed range [1, 1048575]. If you don't provide a value for it, the default value of 1 is used (hence, if you want to nullify the effects of perspective correc‐
              tion on a triangle so the output samples are computed as if just linearly interpolated, simply do not provide a value for w for any vertex of the triangle). If, however, you intend to  draw  3D
              geometry in perspective, you must provide an appropriate value for this parameter, otherwise the output images might look very wrong.  w was new in Netpbm 10.85 (December 2018).

              Consider the
               typical model ⟨https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum⟩  of the so-called "viewing frustum" used to project vertices in 3D "world space" onto a planar "image space." If we adopt the con‐
              vention that a "z-plane" means any plane parallel to the view-plane (a.k.a. picture plane, a.k.a. near plane), the value of w for a vertex should  then  be  the  (smallest/euclidean/orthogonal)
              distance  in  pixels between the projection reference point (PRP, or "eye") and the z-plane containing the vertex. One way to compute this value amounts to simply taking the dot product between
              the 3D vector r and the 3D unit vector n, where r is the vector which goes from the projection reference point (PRP, or "eye") to the vertex, and n is a view-plane normal (VPN) of  unit  length
              which points away from the PRP. In other words, this is equal to the length of the orthogonal projection of r on the line "determined" by n.

              (Note:  For  any  two  3D  vectors  a  and  b,  with  respective  real  scalar  components  a<sub>x,  a<sub>y,  a<sub>z  and b<sub>x, b<sub>y, b<sub>z, the dot product between a and b is simply
              a<sub>x*b<sub>x + a<sub>y*b<sub>y + a<sub>z*b<sub>z.)

       print

              This writes a PAM image to Standard Output whose raster is a copy of the current contents of the image buffer. The values of the WIDTH and HEIGHT fields are the same as the  width  and  height,
              respectively, of the frame buffer, which were given on the command line during program invocation. The MAXVAL field is equal to the current maxval; the DEPTH field is equal to the current value
              of num_attribs + 1; and the TUPLTYPE field is equal to the current tupletype.

              This command has no effect upon the current drawing state. E. g. it does not modify the current drawing mode, the current vertex list, etc.

              One may issue an arbitrary number of print commands at different positions in the input instruction sequence to produce a multi-image PAM stream.

       clear [ image | depth ]

              Clears the frame buffer. That is, all samples in the image buffer are once again set to 0, and all entries in the depth buffer are once again set to the maximum permitted depth value.

              Optionally, one may provide an argument to only clear either the image buffer or the depth buffer individually, while leaving the other intact. With the image argument, only the image buffer is
              cleared;  with the depth argument, only the depth buffer is cleared. Instead of full argument names, one may provide a minimum unique abbreviation, which has the same effect. The single charac‐
              ter z is also accepted as an alias for depth.

              Like the print command, this command has no effect upon the current drawing state either.

       reset maxval num_attribs [tupletype]

              This updates the current maxval and number of attributes per vertex (num_attribs), resetting the <u>image</u> buffer with a new maxval and number of samples per tuple while at it. The parameter
              maxval must be an integer in the closed range [1, 65535], and num_attribs must be an integer in the closed range [1, 20].

              Optionally,  after  the  second argument, one may provide a string to be assigned to the current tupletype. The string goes from the first character after the second argument which is not white
              space and continues until (and including) the last character before the end of the line which is not white space.  If a new tupletype is not provided, or the provided string is longer than  255
              characters, the empty string is assigned to the current tupletype.

              The side effects of running this command are

       •

              The new image buffer is completely cleared once the command is executed.

       •

              All values in the current attribute values list are set to the new maxval.

       •

              The current vertex list is reset.

              However,  it  does not touch the depth buffer: it is left the same way as it was found before the command. Also the drawing mode remains the same (e. g. if pamtris was in FAN mode, it will con‐
              tinue in that same mode, etc.).

              If this command is given with an invalid value for maxval or num_attribs, it is ignored and therefore none of the above side effects apply, nor do the current maxval, num_attribs  or  tupletype
              change at all.

              It is permissible to give a value for maxval and num_attribs equal to the current maxval and num_attribs, respectively, although the above side effects will still apply even in such cases.

              Since  this command deals with memory allocation, it may fail to execute successfully. If that happens, no lines of input will be read anymore and pamtris will be terminated as if the quit com‐
              mand was given.

       quit

              This terminates pamtris. It will not read any more lines of input after this command.

TIPS
   Texturing
       It is possible to apply so-called "textures" to images produced with pamtris by using a pair of vertex attributes as texture coordinates, then using pamchannel(1) to select the appropriate channels in
       the  output  image(s), and finally processing the result through pamlookup(1), providing the desired texture file as a "lookup table."  If you are drawing pictures in perspective, make sure to provide
       adequate values for the w parameter to your vertex commands ( see above ⟨#cmd_vertex⟩ ) so that the resulting samples in the images produced by pamtris are perspective-correct. You might want to  con‐
       sider using pnmtile(1) to make textures which are inteded to be "repeated" along triangle meshes.

        The animated GIF below is an example of what can be achieved using the technique described above (Earth texture from nasa.gov ⟨https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=73580⟩ ).

   Anti-aliased edges
       pamtris  performs no anti-aliasing on triangle edges by itself.  However, it is possible to obtain anti-aliased images through a "super-sampling" approach: draw your image(s) at a size larger than the
       desired final size, and then, when all postprocessing is done, downscale the final image(s) to the desired size. Drawing images with twice the desired width and height, then downscaling  them  to  the
       intended  size while disregarding gamma (i.e. what pamscale -linear does) often produces good enough results; but the larger the ratio "size of original image" / "size of downscaled  image" , the bet‐
       ter the quality of the anti-aliasing effect.
