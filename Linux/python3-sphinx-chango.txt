       chango  is a changelog generation tool.  Changes are described alongside the code changes in the codebase.  chango extracts these changes and generates a changelog.  chango consists of both a com‐
       mand line interface and a Python API.  All aspects of the data formats, storage, and rendering are customizable via an interface class approach.

INSTALLING
       You can install or upgrade chango via

          pipx install chango --upgrade

       Note that installation via pipx is recommended since chango should not interfere with your projects dependencies.

MOTIVATION
       Informative and helpful changelogs (or release notes) are an essential part of software development.  They are a core part of the communication between developers and users.   At  the  same  time,
       creating  and maintaining changelogs can be a tedious and error-prone task, especially since this is often done only when a new release is prepared.  chango aims to make the process of maintaining
       changelogs as easy as possible.  This is achieved roughly by two means:

       1. Shifting the creation of changelogs to the time of development: Changes are described alongside the code changes in the codebase.  This reduces the chance to forget about crucial details in the
          changes that should be mentioned in the changelog.  It also ensures that the changelog undergoes the same review process as the code changes.

       2. Automating the generation of changelogs: chango extracts the changes from the codebase and generates a changelog.  At release time, the changelog is thus already up-to-date and  requires  close
          to zero manual work.

   Inspiration
       This  package is heavily inspired by the towncrier  and reno packages.  Both packages are excellent tools for changelog generation but are rather specialized in their use cases.  chango aims to be
       more flexible and customizable than these packages.

QUICK START
       A minimal setup of using chango for your project consists of the following steps.

   Building a ChanGo instance
       chango is designed to be highly customizable.

       Store the following code in a file named chango.py in the root of your project.

          from chango.concrete import (
              CommentChangeNote,
              CommentVersionNote,
              DirectoryChanGo,
              DirectoryVersionScanner,
              HeaderVersionHistory,
          )

          chango_instance = DirectoryChanGo(
              change_note_type=CommentChangeNote,
              version_note_type=CommentVersionNote,
              version_history_type=HeaderVersionHistory,
              scanner=DirectoryVersionScanner(
                  base_directory="changes", unreleased_directory="unreleased"
              ),
          )

       Create the directories changes and changes/unreleased in the root of your project.

       The chango_instance is the object that the CLI will use to interact with the changelog.  It contains information about the data type of individual changes, versions and the  history  of  versions.
       It  also has instructions on how the individual changes are stored and how they are extracted from the codebase.  All these aspects can be customized by providing different classes to the Directo‐
       ryChanGo constructor or using a different implementation of the ChanGo interface.

   Configuring pyproject.toml
       We still need to make the chango CLI aware of the chango_instance.  This is done by adding the following lines to your pyproject.toml file.

          [tool.chango]
          sys_path = "."
          chango_instance = { name= "chango_instance", module = "chango" }

       This instructs the CLI to import the chango_instance from the file chango.py in the root of your project.

   Adding Changes
       Now the chango CLI is ready to be used.  Go ahead and add a change to the changes/unreleased directory.  It's as simple als calling

          chango new short-slug-for-the-change

       For more information on how to use chango, please refer to the documentation.

   GitHub Actions
       When using chango in your project, you will want to ensure that each change adds a change note.  When hosted on GitHub, you can use GitHub Actions to support this process and automatically  create
       a template change note for each new change.  chango defines the following methods to help you with this process:

       • chango.abc.ChanGo.build_github_event_change_note()

       • chango.abc.ChangeNote.build_from_github_event()

       Going even further, chango provides a composite GitHub Action that does the heavy lifting for you.  You can configure it for example as follows:

          name: Create Chango Change Note
          on:
            pull_request:
              branches:
                - main
              types:
                - opened
                - reopened

          jobs:
            create-chango-fragment:
              permissions:
                # Give the default GITHUB_TOKEN write permission to commit and push the
                # added chango note to the PR branch.
                contents: write
              name: create-chango-fragment
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
                - uses: Bibo-Joshi/chango@<sha-of-latest-release>
                  with:
                    # Optional: Specify a Python version to use
                    python-version: '3.13'

       This will automatically use your chango configuration to create a change note for each new change.

   Inputs
       The following inputs can be used to configure the action using the with keyword.

   Sphinx Extension
       In addition to the CLI, chango provides a Sphinx extension that can be used to automatically render change notes in your project documentation.

   Setup
       To enable the extension, simply add 'chango.sphinx_ext' to your extensions list in your conf.py file.

          extensions = [
              ...
              'chango.sphinx_ext',
          ]

       To specify the path to the pyproject.toml file, you can use the chango_pyproject_toml configuration option in your conf.py file.

          chango_pyproject_toml = 'path/to/pyproject.toml'

       This is useful to ensure that chango can find the correct configuration file independent of the current working directory.

       Now, you can use the chango directive in your documentation to render change notes.

          .. chango:: Headline
             :start_from: 1.0.0

       This will render a list of change notes starting from version 1.0.0 up to the latest (unreleased) version.

   Configuration
       The following configuration options are available:

       chango_pyproject_toml

              Type   pathlib.Path | str | None.TP Default None.UNINDENT

                     Path to the pyproject.toml file. Takes the same input as chango.config.get_chango_instance().

       .. chango::
              The chango directive renders the version history of your project.

              If the directive has a body, it will be used as the headline for the change notes with = above and below the headline, which is the default reStructuredText syntax for a headline.

                 Example

                     .. chango:: Headline
                        :start_from: "1.0.0"

                 Renders as

                     ========
                     Headline
                     ========

                     ...

              The options that are valid for the chango directive are the same as the options for load_version_history().

              If your implementation of ChanGo has additional options, you can pass them as keyword arguments to the directive.  chango will inspect the signature of the method and configure the  options
              accordingly.

              IMPORTANT:
                 Since the options will be interpreted as keyword arguments for load_version_history(), by default, each option is required to have a value.

              TIP:
                 The values be interpreted as JSON string and will be loaded using json.loads().

              Since  you can only specify strings as options in reStructuredText, it may be necessary to use custom validator functions to convert the strings to the correct types.  Custom validators can
              be specified by using typing.Annotated in the signature of the method.  Validators should have the following signature:

                 def validator(value: str | None) -> Any:
                     ...

                 Example

                     from collections.abc import Sequence
                     from typing import Annotated

                     def sequence_validator(value: str | None) -> Sequence[int]:
                         if value is None:
                             raise ValueError('Value must not be None')
                         return tuple(map(int, value.split(',')))

                     def flag_validator(value: str | None) -> bool:
                         if value is not None:
                             raise ValueError('Flag options must not have a value')
                         return True

                     class MyChanGo(ChanGo):
                         def load_version_history(
                             self,
                             start_from: str | None = None,
                             end_at: str | None = None,
                             custom_option_1: dict[str, str] | None = None,
                             custom_option_2: Annotated[Sequence[int], sequence_validator] = (1, 2, 3),
                             custom_option_3: Annotated[bool, flag_validator] = False,
                         ):
                             ...

                 With this signature, you can use the following directive:

                     .. chango::
                        :custom_option_1: {"key": "value"}
                        :custom_option_2: 4,5,6
                        :custom_option_3:

              The following options are available by default:

              Keyword Arguments:

                     :start_from: (str, optional): The version to start from. Passed to parameter
                            load_version_history of load_version_history(). Defaults to None.

                     IMPORTANT:
                        This is an optional method and by default raises a NotImplementedError.  Implement this method if you want to automatically create change notes based on GitHub events.

                     TIP:
                        This method is useful for automatically creating change note drafts in GitHub actions to ensure that each pull request has documented changes.

                     TIP:
                        This method calls chango.abc.VersionScanner.invalidate_caches() after writing the change note to disk.

                     Parameters

                            • change_note (CNT | str) -- The change note to write.

              HINT:
                 Objects of this class can be used as MutableMapping, where the keys are the unique identifiers (or file names) of the change notes and the values are the change notes themselves.

              WARNING:
                 To ensure that the changes in this version are displayed in the correct order, the change notes should be added in the order they were made. Manual reordering of the change notes may in‐
                 terfere with the order in which they are displayed.

              Parameters
                     version (Version | None) -- The version of the software project this note is for or May be None if the version is not yet released.

              version
                     (Version | None): The version of the software project this note is for or May be None if the version is not yet released.

              add_change_note(change_note)
                     Add a change note to the version note.

                     Parameters

   VersionScanner
       class chango.abc.VersionScanner
              Bases: Collection[Version]

              Abstract base class for a version scanner that can list available versions.

              HINT:
                 Objects of this class can be used as Collection of versions as returned by the get_available_versions() method.

              abstractmethod get_available_versions(start_from=None, end_at=None)
                     Get the available versions.

                     IMPORTANT:
                        Unreleased changes must not be included in the returned version identifiers.

                     Parameters

                            • start_from (Version | str, optional) -- The version identifier to start from. If None, start from the earliest available version.

                            • end_at (Version | str, optional) -- The version identifier to end at. If None, end at the latest available version, excluding unreleased changes.

                     Returns
                            The available versions.

                     Return type

              abstractmethod get_changes(uid)
                     Get the changes either for a given version identifier or all available.

                     HINT:
                        To easily extract the UIDs from the change files, chango.helpers.change_uid_from_file() can be used.

                     IMPORTANT:
                        The returned UIDs must be in the order in which the changes were made.

                     Parameters
                            uid (Version | str | None) -- The version identifier to get the change files for. If None, get the change files for unreleased changes must be returned.

                     Returns
                            UIDs of the changes corresponding to the version identifier.

                     Return type
                            Tuple[str]

                     Raises ChanGoError -- If the version with the given identifier is not available.

              abstractmethod get_latest_version()
                     Get the latest version

                     Returns
                            The latest version

                     Return type
                            Version

                     Raises ChanGoError -- If no versions are available.

              get_version(uid)
                     Get the version with the given identifier.

                     HINT:
                        The default implementation calls get_available_versions(). Implementations may override this method to provide a more efficient way to get the version.

                     Parameters
                            uid (str) -- The version identifier to get the version for.

                     Returns
                            The version.

                     Return type
                            Version

                     Raises ChanGoError -- If the version with the given identifier is not available.

              abstractmethod has_unreleased_changes()
                     Check if there are changes in the repository that are not yet released in a version.

                     Returns
                            True if there are unreleased changes, False otherwise.

                     Return type
                            bool

              invalidate_caches()
                     Invalidate any internal caches that may be used by the implementation.

                     IMPORTANT:

                        • This method is not required to do anything if the implementation does not use any caches. By default, it does nothing.

                        • This method is called by chango.abc.ChanGo.release() and chango.abc.ChanGo.write_change_note() after the respective operation has been completed. This gives  the  implementation
                          the opportunity to clear any caches that may have been affected by the operation.

              abstractmethod is_available(uid)
                     Check if the version with the given identifier is available.

                     TIP:
                        None may be passed for convenience, but it's recommended that an implementation calls has_unreleased_changes() internally.

                     Parameters
                            uid (Version | str | None) -- The version identifier to check.

              abstractmethod lookup_change_note(uid)
                     Lookup a change note with the given identifier.

                     Parameters
                            uid (str) -- The unique identifier or file name of the change note to lookup

                     Returns

                            The metadata about the change note specifying the file
                                   path and version it belongs to.

                     Return type
                            chango.ChangeNoteInfo

                     Raises ChanGoError -- If the change note with the given identifier is not
                                available.

              property scanner
                     The BackwardCompatibleVersionScanner instance that is used by this BackwardCompatibleChanGo.

                     HINT:
                        The scanner is a composite of the scanners of main_instance and legacy_instance.

   BackwardCompatibleVersionScanner
       class chango.concrete.BackwardCompatibleVersionScanner(scanners)
              Bases: VersionScanner

              An Implementation of the VersionScanner interface that wraps multiple other implementations of VersionScanner.  The purpose of this class is to ease  transition  between  different  version
              note formats in a project.

              WARNING:
                 This assumes that the versions available for each of the scanners are mutually exclusive, i.e. no two scanners can return the same version.

              TIP:
                 Use together with BackwardCompatibleChanGo.

              Parameters

                     • change_note_type (type) -- The type of change notes to load. Must be a subclass of ChangeNote.

                     • version_note_type (type) -- The type of version notes to load. Must be a subclass of VersionNote.

                     • version_history_type (type) -- The type of version histories to load. Must be a subclass of VersionHistory.

                     • scanner (DirectoryVersionScanner) -- The version scanner to use.

                     • directory_format (str, optional) -- Reverse of DirectoryVersionScannerdirectory_pattern.  Must be a string that can be used with str.format() and contain at least one  named  field
                       uid for the version identifier and optionally a second named field date for the date of the version release in ISO format. The default value is compatible with the default value of
                       DirectoryVersionScannerdirectory_pattern.

              build_github_event_change_note(event, data=None)
                     Implementation of build_github_event_change_note().

                     IMPORTANT:
                        By  default,  this  will  always  call  chango.abc.ChangeNote.build_from_github_event()  and  does  not  check  if  a  new  change  note  is necessary.  The only exception is when
                        change_note_type is a subclass of SectionChangeNote:

                        • If there already is a change note for the current pull request, it is updated with the new information. If nothing changed, returns None.

                        • If the data parameter is an instance of ChanGoActionData with a parent pull request, then this method will try to find an existing unreleased change note for the parent pull re‐
                          quest and append the new information to it.

              build_version_note(version)
                     Implementation of build_version_note().  Includes special handling for SectionVersionNote, which has the required argument section_change_note_type.

   DirectoryVersionScanner
       class chango.concrete.DirectoryVersionScanner(base_directory, unreleased_directory, directory_pattern=re.compile('(?P<uid>[^_]+)_(?P<date>[\\d-]+)'))
              Bases: VersionScanner

              Implementation of a version scanner that assumes that change notes are stored in subdirectories named after the version identifier.

              Parameters

                     • base_directory (str | Path) --

                       The base directory to scan for version directories.

                       IMPORTANT:
                          If the path is relative, it will be resolved relative to the directory of the calling module.

                              Example

                                     If you build your DirectoryVersionScanner within /home/user/project/chango.py, passing base_directory="changes" will resolve to /home/user/project/changes.

                     • unreleased_directory (str | Path) --

                       The directory that contains unreleased changes.

                       IMPORTANT:
                          If pathlib.Path.is_dir() returns False for this directory, it will be assumed to be a subdirectory of the base_directory.

                     • directory_pattern (str | re.Pattern, optional) -- The pattern to match version directories against. Must contain one named group uid for the version identifier and a  second  named
                       group for the date for the date of the version release in ISO format.

              base_directory
                     The base directory to scan for version directories.

                     Type   Path

              directory_pattern
                     The pattern to match version directories against.

   HeaderVersionHistory
       class chango.concrete.HeaderVersionHistory
              Bases: VersionHistory, Generic

              A simple version history implementation that renders version notes by prefixing them with the version UID as header, followed by the release date if available.

              render(markup)
                     Does the rendering.

                     TIP:
                        Version notes are automatically sorted by release date before rendering. If unreleased changes are present, they are rendered first.

                     IMPORTANT:
                        Currently, only Markdown, HTML and reStructuredText are supported as markup languages.

   sections
       This  module  contains  an  implementation  of  ChangeNote  that  consists  of  multiple  sections  and  includes  references  to  pull  requests that are related to the change.  The main class is
       SectionChangeNote, while Section and PullRequest are used to define the sections and pull requests, respectively.

          Example

                 To create a change note with two sections, one required and one optional, use

              from chango.concrete.sections import GitHubSectionChangeNote, Section

              class MySectionChangeNote(
                  GitHubSectionChangeNote.with_sections(
                      [
                          Section(uid="required_section", title="Required Section", is_required=True),
                          Section(uid="optional_section", title="Optional Section"),
                      ]
                  )
              ):
                  OWNER = "my-username"
                  REPOSITORY = "my-repo"

       class chango.concrete.sections.GitHubSectionChangeNote(slug, *args, uid=None, pull_requests=<factory>)
              Bases: SectionChangeNote

              Specialization of SectionChangeNote for projects hosted on GitHub.

                 Example

                     from chango.concrete.sections import GitHubSectionChangeNote, Section

                     class MySectionChangeNote(
                         GitHubSectionChangeNote.with_sections(
                             [
                                 Section(uid="req_section", title="Required Section", is_required=True),
                                 Section(uid="opt_section", title="Optional Section"),
                             ]
                         )
                     ):
                         OWNER = "my-username"
                         REPOSITORY = "my-repo"

              OWNER = None
                     The owner of the repository on GitHub. This must be set as a class variable.

                     Type   str

              REPOSITORY = None
                     The name of the repository on GitHub. This must be set as a class variable.

              classmethod build_from_github_event(event, data=None)
                     Implementation of chango.abc.ChangeNote.build_from_github_event().

                     This writes the pull request title to the sections determined by get_sections().  Uses the pull request number as slug.

                     CAUTION:

                        • Does not consider any formatting in the pull request title!

                        • Considers the data argument only if it is an instance of ChanGoActionData.

                     Raises ValueError -- If required data is missing or not in the expected format.

              classmethod get_author_url(author_uid)

                     Determine appropriate sections based on the labels of a pull request as well as the labels and types of the issues closed by the pull request.

                     If this class has required sections, they are all returned.  Otherwise, the first section in the order of sort_order is returned.

                     TIP:
                        This method can be overridden to provide custom logic for determining the section based on the labels and issue types.

              IMPORTANT:

                 • This class does not contain any specified sections by default and must not be instantiated directly. Use with_sections() to create a suitable subclass with the desired sections.

                 • Even though this class is in the concrete module, it is still an  abstract  base  class  and  must  be  subclassed  to  be  used.  However,  only  the  methods  get_pull_request_url(),
                   get_thread_url(), and get_author_url() must be implemented in the subclass. A concrete subclass is provided in GitHubSectionChangeNote.

   config
       This module provides the functionality to load the configuration for the ChanGo CLI.

       class chango.config.ChanGoConfig(_case_sensitive=None, _nested_model_default_partial_update=None, _env_prefix=None, _env_file=PosixPath('.'), _env_file_encoding=None, _env_ignore_empty=None,
       _env_nested_delimiter=None, _env_nested_max_split=None, _env_parse_none_str=None, _env_parse_enums=None, _cli_prog_name=None, _cli_parse_args=None, _cli_settings_source=None,

       fix_char=None, _cli_implicit_flags=None, _cli_ignore_unknown_args=None, _cli_kebab_case=None, _cli_shortcuts=None, _secrets_dir=None, *, sys_path=None, chango_instance)
              Data structure for the ChanGos CLI configuration in the pyproject.toml file.

              TIP:
                 Rather than manually creating an instance of this class, use load() to load the configuration from the pyproject.toml file.

              IMPORTANT:
                 The  attributes  of chango_instance will be passed to importlib.import_module() to import the user defined ChanGo instance. For this to work, the module must be findable by Python, which
                 may depend on your current working directory and the Python path. It can help to set sys_path accordingly.  Please evaluate the security implications of this before setting it.

              Keyword Arguments

                     • sys_path (Path, optional) --

                       A path to temporarily add to the system path before importing the module.

                          Example

                                 To add the current working directory to the system path, set this to ..

                       CAUTION:
                          Since this class is usually loaded via load(), the path is resolved relative to the pyproject.toml file path. If the path is absolute, it will be used as is.  When instantiating
                          this class manually, the path is resolved relative to the current working directory.

                     • chango_instance (ChanGoInstanceConfig) -- Specification of how the ChanGo instance to use in the CLI is imported.

              sys_path
                     The path to temporarily add to the system path before importing the module. If the path is not absolute, it will considered as relative to the current working directory.

                     Type   Path | None

              chango_instance
                     The instance of ChanGo to use in the CLI.

                     Type   ChanGoInstanceConfig

              copy(*, include=None, exclude=None, update=None, deep=False)
                     Returns a copy of the model.

                     !!! warning "Deprecated"
                            This method is now deprecated; use model_copy instead.

                     If you need include or exclude, use:

                     `python {test="skip" lint="skip"} data = self.model_dump(include=include, exclude=exclude, round_trip=True) data = {**data, **(update or {})} copied = self.model_validate(data) `

                     Parameters

                            • include -- Optional set or mapping specifying which fields to include in the copied model.

                            • exclude -- Optional set or mapping specifying which fields to exclude in the copied model.

                            • update -- Optional dictionary of field-value pairs to override field values in the copied model.

                            • deep -- If True, the values of fields that are Pydantic models will be deep-copied.

                     Returns
                            A copy of the model with included, excluded and updated fields as specified.

              import_chango_instance()
                     Import the ChanGo instance specified in chango_instance.  This considers the sys_path attribute to temporarily add a path to the system path.

                     Returns
                            The imported ChanGo instance.

                     Return type
                            ChanGo

              classmethod load(path=None)
                     Load the ChanGoConfig from the pyproject.toml file.

                     TIP:
                        If the specification of sys_path is relative, it will be resolved relative to the path parameter by this method.

                     Keyword Arguments
                            path (Path | None) --

                            The path to the pyproject.toml file. The path resolution works as follows:

                            • If path is None, the current working directory is used.

                            • If path is absolute, it is used as is. Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working directory.

                            • If the path does not point to a file, it is assumed to be a directory and the file name pyproject.toml is appended.

                     Returns
                            The loaded configuration.

                     Return type
                            ChanGoConfig

              classmethod model_construct(_fields_set=None, **values)
                     Creates a new instance of the Model class with validated data.

                     Creates a new model setting __dict__ and __pydantic_fields_set__ from trusted or pre-validated data.  Default values are respected, but no other validation is performed.

                     !!! note
                            model_construct() generally respects the model_config.extra setting on the provided model.  That is, if model_config.extra == 'allow', then all extra passed values  are  added
                            to  the model instance's __dict__ and __pydantic_extra__ fields. If model_config.extra == 'ignore' (the default), then all extra passed values are ignored.  Because no valida‐
                            tion is performed with a call to model_construct(), having model_config.extra == 'forbid' does not result in an error if extra values are passed, but they will be ignored.

                     Parameters

                            • _fields_set -- A set of field names that were originally explicitly set during instantiation. If provided, this is directly used  for  the  [model_fields_set][pydantic.Base‐
                              Model.model_fields_set] attribute.  Otherwise, the field names from the values argument will be used.

                            • values -- Trusted or pre-validated data dictionary.

                     Returns
                            A new instance of the Model class with validated data.

              model_copy(*, update=None, deep=False)

                            [model_copy](../concepts/models.md#model-copy)

                     Returns a copy of the model.

                     !!! note
                            The  underlying  instance's  [__dict__][object.__dict__]  attribute  is copied. This might have unexpected side effects if you store anything in it, on top of the model fields
                            (e.g. the value of [cached properties][functools.cached_property]).

                     Parameters

                            • update -- Values to change/add in the new model. Note: the data is not validated before creating the new model. You should trust this data.

                            • deep -- Set to True to make a deep copy of the model.

                     Returns
                            New model instance.

              classmethod model_parametrized_name(params)
                     Compute the class name for parametrizations of generic classes.

                     This method can be overridden to achieve a custom naming scheme for generic BaseModels.

                     Parameters
                            params -- Tuple of types of the class. Given a generic class Model with 2 type variables and a concrete model Model[str, int], the value (str, int) would be passed to params.

                     Returns
                            String representing the new class where params are passed to cls as type variables.

                     Override  this  method to perform additional initialization after __init__ and model_construct.  This is useful if you want to do some validation that requires the entire model to be
                     initialized.

              classmethod model_rebuild(*, force=False, raise_errors=True, _parent_namespace_depth=2, _types_namespace=None)
                     Try to rebuild the pydantic-core schema for the model.

                     This may be necessary when one of the annotations is a ForwardRef which could not be resolved during the initial attempt to build the schema, and automatic rebuilding fails.

                     Parameters

                            • force -- Whether to force the rebuilding of the model schema, defaults to False.

                            • raise_errors -- Whether to raise errors, defaults to True.

                            • _parent_namespace_depth -- The depth level of the parent namespace, defaults to 2.

                            • _types_namespace -- The types namespace, defaults to None.

                     Returns
                            Returns None if the schema is already "complete" and rebuilding was not required.  If rebuilding _was_ required, returns True if rebuilding was successful, otherwise False.

              copy(*, include=None, exclude=None, update=None, deep=False)
                     Returns a copy of the model.

                     !!! warning "Deprecated"
                            This method is now deprecated; use model_copy instead.

                     If you need include or exclude, use:

                     `python {test="skip" lint="skip"} data = self.model_dump(include=include, exclude=exclude, round_trip=True) data = {**data, **(update or {})} copied = self.model_validate(data) `

                     Parameters

                            • include -- Optional set or mapping specifying which fields to include in the copied model.

                            • exclude -- Optional set or mapping specifying which fields to exclude in the copied model.

                            • update -- Optional dictionary of field-value pairs to override field values in the copied model.

                            • deep -- If True, the values of fields that are Pydantic models will be deep-copied.

                     Returns
                            A copy of the model with included, excluded and updated fields as specified.

              classmethod model_construct(_fields_set=None, **values)
                     Creates a new instance of the Model class with validated data.

                     Creates a new model setting __dict__ and __pydantic_fields_set__ from trusted or pre-validated data.  Default values are respected, but no other validation is performed.

                     !!! note
                            model_construct() generally respects the model_config.extra setting on the provided model.  That is, if model_config.extra == 'allow', then all extra passed values  are  added
                            to  the model instance's __dict__ and __pydantic_extra__ fields. If model_config.extra == 'ignore' (the default), then all extra passed values are ignored.  Because no valida‐
                            tion is performed with a call to model_construct(), having model_config.extra == 'forbid' does not result in an error if extra values are passed, but they will be ignored.

                     Parameters

                            • _fields_set -- A set of field names that were originally explicitly set during instantiation. If provided, this is directly used  for  the  [model_fields_set][pydantic.Base‐
                              Model.model_fields_set] attribute.  Otherwise, the field names from the values argument will be used.

                            • values -- Trusted or pre-validated data dictionary.

                     Returns
                            A new instance of the Model class with validated data.

              model_copy(*, update=None, deep=False)

                     Returns a copy of the model.

                     !!! note
                            The  underlying  instance's  [__dict__][object.__dict__]  attribute  is copied. This might have unexpected side effects if you store anything in it, on top of the model fields
                            (e.g. the value of [cached properties][functools.cached_property]).

                     Parameters

                            • update -- Values to change/add in the new model. Note: the data is not validated before creating the new model. You should trust this data.

                            • deep -- Set to True to make a deep copy of the model.

                     Returns
                            New model instance.

                     Try to rebuild the pydantic-core schema for the model.

                     This may be necessary when one of the annotations is a ForwardRef which could not be resolved during the initial attempt to build the schema, and automatic rebuilding fails.

                     Parameters

                            • force -- Whether to force the rebuilding of the model schema, defaults to False.

   sphinx_ext
       This module contains functionality that allows automatically rendering changelogs in Sphinx documentation using chango.

       SEE ALSO:
          Sphinx Extension

       chango.sphinx_ext.setup(app)
              Sets up the chango Sphinx extension.  This currently does two things:

              1. Adds the chango directive to Sphinx, which allows you to include changelogs in your documentation.

              2. Adds a configuration value chango_pyproject_toml_path to the Sphinx configuration, which allows you to specify the path to the pyproject.toml file that contains the chango configuration.

              Parameters
                     app (sphinx.application.Sphinx) -- The Sphinx application object.

              Returns

                     A dictionary containing metadata about the
                            extension.

              Return type
                     dict[str, typing.Any]
