DESCRIPTION
       Kannel  is an WAP and SMS gateway.  WAP is short for Wireless Application Protocol, and is used to implement hypertext based services on mobile phones.  SMS is short for Short Message Service, and
       is used to send and recive short (up to 160 characters) text messages with mobile phones.  SMS can also be used to implement simple text based services on mobile phones.

       Kannel consists of three programs, usually run as daemons: bearerbox, wapbox, and smsbox.  They implement the connection to the phone (SMS or UDP), the WAP protocol stack, and the SMS  based  ser‐
       vices, respectively.
