NAME
       cccheck  -  Perform  static  code contracts verification for CLR assem‐
       blies.

SYNOPSIS
       cccheck --assembly=<assembly> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Perform static code contracts verification to find bugs  and  inconsis‐
       tencies between code and specification. This includes non-null, integer
       analyses.

       The assembly must  have  been  built  with  the  symbol  CONTRACTS_FULL
       defined,  otherwise  the  calls  to the contract methods will have been
       removed by the compiler.

       Currently only Contract.Assume() and Contract.Assert() methods are sup‐
       ported.  Only  non-null analysis is supported, the consecutive analyses
       are in development. An error message will be shown if cccheck is unable
       to process all or some of the methods of specified assembly.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       --assembly <assembly-name>
              The assembly to perform static verification.

       --debug
              Shows debug information about process of proving the assertions.
              It shows four layers of abstraction,  raw  layer,  stack  layer,
              heap layer, and substituted expression level.

       --method=<method-name-substring>
              String  for  finding  method. It filters all methods in assembly
              where method name has this parameter as a substring.

       --help Show help for cccheck, listing configuration options.

EXAMPLES
       Suppose you have a method:
                void Method() {
                  object x = null;
                  int y = 1;
                  if (y % 2 == 1)
                    x = new object();
                  else
                    x = new string();

                 Contract.Assert(x != null); }

              After the verification the tool will have results  in  following
              format:  "Assertion  at  :  [Subroutine: <id> Block <blockId> PC
              <id>] :
               is  (true|false|unproven|unreachable)".   (PC  is   a   program
              counter)
