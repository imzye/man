NAME
       builder-cc - gcc wrapper to facilitate pentium-optimizations

SYNOPSIS
       export DEBIAN_BUILDARCH=architecture
       export DEBIAN_BUILDGCCVER=gcc-version
       gcc ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  builder-cc wrapper is normally used by calling gcc as usual. If the environment variable DEBIAN_BUILDARCH is not set, builder-cc does nothing, and the real gcc is invoked with the speci‐
       fied arguments.

       When the DEBIAN_BUILDARCH environment variable is set, builder-cc invokes gcc with the specified arguments, plus -mcpu=DEBIAN_BUILDARCH -march=DEBIAN_BUILDARCH This has the effect of  telling
       gcc to use architecture-specific optimizations without changing the command line. This is particularly useful for package builds.

       If DEBIAN_BUILDGCCVER is not set, builder-cc calls gcc.real.  If DEBIAN_BUILDGCCVER is set, builder-cc calls gcc-DEBIAN_BUILDGCCVER instead.

ENVIRONMENT
       DEBIAN_BUILDARCH
              If set, the architecture to compile for. Useful values are pentium or pentiumpro.

       DEBIAN_BUILDGCCVER
              If set, the version of gcc to be invoked. Useful values are 3.0 or 2.95.

NOTES
       The real gcc is renamed gcc.real, and a diversion is registered with dpkg-divert(1).  Thus builder-cc's idea of the default gcc is dictated by whatever package installed /usr/bin/gcc.
