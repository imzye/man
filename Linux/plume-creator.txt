NAME
       plume-creator - open-source tool for novelists

SYNOPSIS
       plume-creator [filename.plume | filename.plume_backup]

DESCRIPTION
       Plume  Creator  helps  you to write your stories in chapters and scenes, write fullscreen, edit notes and synopses, export in html and odt formats, edit in rich text, and manage characters, places
       and items.

USAGE
       The first-run of Plume Creator will require the user to select a language. A new project wizard will then assist in setting up your first writing project. It's a short  and  simple  process.  When
       that is done, you will be shown a welcome dialog box.

       Then, Plume Creator will present a project selection dialog box. Double-clicking the project name works here and opens the main window with that project.
