NAME
       xautomation - control X from the command line, and find things on the screen

DESCRIPTION
       xautomation  is  a  set  of  command  lines  programs to control X and do "visual scraping" to find things on the screen. The control interface allows mouse movement, clicking, button up/down, key
       up/down, etc, and uses the XTest extension so you don't have the annoying problems that xse has when apps ignore sent events. The visgrep program find images inside of images and reports the coor‐
       dinates, allowing programs to find buttons, etc, on the screen to click on.

       xautomation consists in the following programs:

       pat2ppm
              Converts an image file from PAT to PPM format.

       patextract
              Extract a part of a PNG image file.

       png2pat
              Converts an image file from PNG to PAT format.

       rgb2pat
              Converts an image file from 24-bit RGB to PAT format

       visgrep
              Visual grep, greps for images in another image.

       xmousepos
              Gets and prints the current mouse position.

       xte    Generates fake input using the XTest extension.

       For more information, please see the individual manpages of these programs.
