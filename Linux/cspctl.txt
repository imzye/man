cspctl(1)                   General Commands Manual                  cspctl(1)

NAME
       cspctl - Sound Blaster 16 ASP/CSP control program

SYNOPSIS
       cspctl command [-options] <filename>

DESCRIPTION
       cspctl  is  a  simple  CSP  microcode loader for Creative Sound Blaster
       16ASP and some Sound Blaster AWE32 sound  cards  with  Creative  Signal
       Processor (CSP) chip (CT1748A) installed.  cspctl can also be used as a
       post-install function to snd-sb16-csp module to load default  codec  at
       module  installation. If CSP chip is successfully detected and initial‐
       ized, it will be installed as a hardware dependent device  hwC0D2  into
       /dev/snd  directory.  Currently,  following codecs can be loaded to CSP
       device:

           wfm0001a.csp  QSound decoder
           wfm0006a.csp  A-law codec
           wfm0007a.csp  u-law codec
           wfm0011a.csp  IMA ADPCM codec (distorted output for IMA test files)
           wfm0200a.csp  Creative ADPCM codec (sounds like Intel/DVI IMA ADPCM compatible)
           wfm0202a.csp  Fast Speech 8 codec
           wfm0203a.csp  Fast Speech 10 codec

       These codecs are not yet supported by ALSA:

           wfm0201a.csp  Text2Speech decoder

       Qsound microcode file has four functions, each function  is  a  decoder
       for different sample rate. Rates for QSound functions #1, #2, #3 and #4
       are 44100, 22050, 11025 and 8000Hz respectively. IMA  ADPCM  and  Fast‐
       Speech codecs are formed of two functions, the first one is for capture
       and the second one is for playback. A-law and u-law  codecs  have  only
       one  function.   To  load for example function #2 from QSound microcode
       file (decoder for 22050Hz), run as follows:

           % cspctl load -f 2 -d QSound wfm0001a.csp

       After successful loading, /proc/asound/SB16/cspD2 will show:

           Creative Signal Processor [v1.0]
           State: -x--L
           Codec: QSound [func #2]
           Sample rates: 22050Hz
           QSound decoder disabled

       With QSound decoder microcode loaded, all simple PCM file  formats  can
       be played with QSound 180 degree positioning applied. QSound element is
       dynamically added into mixer structure as 3DEffect1-space  element.  It
       will  only show if support for CSP has been compiled into ALSA drivers,
       CSP chip has been found, and QSound codec is loaded into CSP. When  en‐
       abled,  QSound position can be dynamically changed by mixer slider, and
       proc interface should follow the state of  CSP  chip  and  its  current
       QSound position:

           Creative Signal Processor [v1.0]
           State: Qx-RL
           Codec: QSound [func #2]
           Sample rates: 22050Hz
           QSound decoder enabled
           Processing 16bit mono PCM samples
           Qsound position: left = 0x9, right = 0x9

       Driver  supports  autoloading  of  u-Law,  A-Law and Ima-ADPCM hardware
       codecs. Autoloading is active only when there is no microcode loaded to
       CSP, and there is no need to preload appropriate *.csp files. To unload
       manually loaded microcode, you should run

           % cspctl unload

       If hardware codec microcode has been manually  loaded,  then  CSP  will
       support  only  loaded  PCM  format and autoloading will be disabled. In
       such case, proc interface will show loaded codec properties:

           Creative Signal Processor [v1.0]
           State: -x--L
           Codec: IMA-ADPCM [func #2]
           Sample rates: All
           PCM format ID: 0x400000 (16bit/-) [mono/stereo] [playback/-]

COMMANDS
       load   Load microcode from filename to CSP.

       unload Unload microcode from CSP.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display a short help.

       -c card
              Select a card number. Option defaults to 0.

       -f function
              Select a function from microcode file. Option defaults to 1.

       -d description
              Optional microcode description string.
