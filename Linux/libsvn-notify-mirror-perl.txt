SVN::Notify::Mirror::SSH(3pm)                                                       User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                       SVN::Notify::Mirror::SSH(3pm)

NAME
       SVN::Notify::Mirror::SSH - Mirror a repository path via SSH

SYNOPSIS
       Use svnnotify in post-commit:

         svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" \
          --handler Mirror::SSH --to "/path/to/www/htdocs" \
          [--svn-binary /full/path/to/svn] \
          [[--ssh-host remote_host] [--ssh-user remote_user] \
          [--ssh-tunnel 10.0.0.2] \
          [--ssh-identity /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa]]

       or better yet, use SVN::Notify::Config for a more sophisticated setup:

         #!/usr/bin/perl -MSVN::Notify::Config=$0
         --- #YAML:1.0
         '':
           PATH: "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin"
         'path/in/repository':
           handler: Mirror
           to: "/path/to/www/htdocs"
         'some/other/path/in/repository':
           handler: Mirror::SSH
           to: "/path/to/remote/www/htdocs"
           ssh-host: "remote_host"
           ssh-user: "remote_user"
           ssh-tunnel: "10.0.0.2"
           ssh-identity: "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"

DESCRIPTION
       Keep a directory in sync with a portion of a Subversion repository.  Typically used to keep a development web server in sync with the changes made to the repository.  This directory can either be
       on the same box as the repository itself, or it can be remote (via SSH connection).

USAGE
       Depending on whether the target is a "Local Mirror" or a Remote Mirror, there are different options available.  All options are available either as a commandline option to svnnotify or as a hash
       key in SVN::Notify::Config (see their respective documentation for more details).

   Working Copy on Mirror
       Because 'svn export' is not able to be consistently updated, the sync'd directory must be a full working copy, and if you are running Apache, you should add lines like the following to your Apache
       configuration file:

         # Disallow browsing of Subversion working copy
         # administrative directories.
         <DirectoryMatch "^/.*/\.svn/">
          Order deny,allow
          Deny from all
         </DirectoryMatch>

       The files in the working copy must be writeable (preferrably owned) by the user identity executing the hook script (this is the user identity that is running Apache or svnserve respectively).

Local Mirror
       Please see SVN::Notify::Mirror for details.

   Remote Mirror
       Used for directories not located on the same machine as the repository itself.  Typically, this might be a production web server located in a DMZ, so special consideration must be paid to security
       concerns.  In particular, the remote mirror server may not be able to directly access the repository box.

       NOTE: be sure and consult "Remote Mirror Pre-requisites" before configuring your post-commit hook.

       •   ssh-host

           This value is required and must be the hostname or IP address of the remote host (where the mirror directories reside).

       •   ssh-user

           This value is optional and specifies the remote username that owns the working copy mirror.

       •   ssh-identity

           This  value  may  be optional and should be the full path to the local identity file being used to authenticate with the remote host. If you are setting the ssh-user to be something other than
           the local user name, you will typically also have to set the ssh-identity.

       •   ssh-tunnel

           If the remote server does not have direct access to the repository server, it is possible to use the tunneling capabilities of SSH to provide temporary access to the  repository.   This  works
           even if repository is located internally, and the remote server is located outside of a firewall or on a DMZ.

           The  value  passed  for  ssh-tunnel  should  be  the  IP  address  to  which the local repository service is bound (when using svnserve).  This will tunnel port 3690 from the repository box to
           localhost:3690 on the remote box.  This must also be the way that the original working copy was checked out (see below).

           To tunnel some other port, for example when using Apache/mod_dav, ssh-tunnel should be the entire mapping expression, as described in the OpenSSH documentation under the  "-R"  option  (remote
           port  forwarding).   For  most sites, passing "8080:10.0.0.2:80" will work (which will tunnel port 80 from the repository to port 8080 on the remote client).  If you are using SSL with Apache,
           you can use e.g. "80443:10.0.0.2:443".

           For example, see "Remote Mirror Pre-requisites" and after step #6, perform the following additional steps (when using svnserve):

             # su - localuser
             $ ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa remote_user@remote_host -R3690:10.0.0.2:3690
             $ cd /path/to/mirror/working/copy
             $ svn co svn://127.0.0.1/repos/path/to/files .

           where 10.0.0.2 is the IP address hosting the repository service.  For the same configuration when using Apache/mod_dav, do this instead:

             # su - localuser
             $ ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa remote_user@remote_host -R8080:10.0.0.2:80
             $ cd /path/to/mirror/working/copy
             $ svn co http://127.0.0.1:8080/repos/path/to/files .

       •   ssh-options

           If you have any other options that you would like to pass to the ssh client (for example to change the default SSH port), you can pass extra options using this parameter.   Be  sure  that  you
           pass  it  a  string  that  has  ssh  long  option/value  pairs  separated  by  a  space,  or short options without any space at all.  Internally, parameter is split on spaces and passed in the
           @Net::SSH::options array.

   Remote Mirror Pre-requisites
       Before you can configure a remote mirror, you need to produce an SSH identity file to use:

       1. Log in as repository user
           Give the user identity being used to execute the hook scripts (the user running Apache or svnserve) a shell and log in as that user, e.g. "su - svn";

       2. Create SSH identity files on repository machine
           Run "ssh-keygen" and create an identity file (without a password).

       3. Log in as remote user
           Perform the same steps as #1, but this time on the remote machine.  This username doesn't have to be the same as in step #1, but it must be a user with full write access to the mirror  working
           copy.

       4. Create SSH identity files on remote machine
           It is usually more efficient to go ahead and use "ssh-keygen" to create the .ssh folder in the home directory of the remote user.

       5. Copy the public key from local to remote
           Copy  the .ssh/id_dsa.pub (or id_rsa.pub if you created an RSA key) to the remote server and add it to the .ssh/authorized_keys for the remote user.  See the SSH documentation for instructions
           on how to configure

       6. Confirm configuration
           As the repository user, confirm that you can successfully connect to the remote account, e.g.:

             # su - local_user
             $ ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa remote_user@remote_host

           This is actually a good time to either check out the working copy or to confirm that the remote account has rights to update the working copy mirror.  If the remote server does not have direct
           network access to the repository server, you can use the tunnel facility of SSH (see ssh-tunnel above) to provide access (e.g.  through a firewall).

       Once you have set up the various accounts, you are ready to set your options.
