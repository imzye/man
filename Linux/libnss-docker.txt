NAME
       nss-docker - nss module for finding Docker containers

SYNOPSIS
       libnss_docker.so.2

DESCRIPTION
       This is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc) providing mechanism for finding Docker containers by theirs IDs.

       The container names are searched in virtual domain name ".docker".

       The Docker API webservice has to be available as /var/run/docker.sock socket for current user. Usually it requires to add the user to "docker" system group.

       To activate this NSS module, the "docker" module has to be added to /etc/nsswitch.conf file in "hosts:" line.

       It is recommended to put the "docker" module after "files" module and before "dns" module. "[NOTFOUND=return]" setting is recommended before "dns" module to prevent using DNS as fallback if the
       container ID is not found.

EXAMPLE
   /etc/nsswitch.conf
       hosts: files docker [NOTFOUND=return] dns

SEE ALSO
       docker(1), nsswitch.conf(5)

LIMITATIONS
       The container ID can't be longer than "getconf HOST_NAME_MAX" (64 for Linux).

       The container ID are case sensitive. It means that "test.docker" and "Test.docker" can return different IP addresses.

       Only IPv4 addresses are supported.
