DESCRIPTION
       projsync  is a program that downloads remote resource files into a local directory. This is an alternative to downloading a proj-data-X.Y.Z archive file, or using the on-demand networking capabilities
       of PROJ.

       The following control parameters can appear in any order:

       --endpoint URL
              Defines the URL where to download the master files.geojson file and then the resource files. Defaults to the value set in proj-ini

       --local-geojson-file FILENAME
              Defines the filename for the master GeoJSON files that references resources.  Defaults to ${endpoint}/files.geojson

       --user-writable-directory
              Specifies that resource files must be downloaded in the user writable directory. This is the default.

       --system-directory
              Specifies that resource files must be downloaded in the ${installation_prefix}/share/proj directory. The user launching projsync should make sure it has writing rights in that directory.

       --target-dir DIRNAME
              Directory into which resource files must be downloaded.

       --bbox west_long,south_lat,east_long,north_lat
              Specify an area of interest to restrict the resources to download.  The area of interest is specified as a bounding box with geographic coordinates, expressed in degrees in a  unspecified  geo‐
              graphic  CRS.   west_long and east_long should be in the [-180,180] range, and south_lat and north_lat in the [-90,90]. west_long is generally lower than east_long, except in the case where the
              area of interest crosses the antimeridian.

       --spatial-test contains|intersects
              Specify how the extent of the resource files are compared to the area of use specified explicitly with --bbox.  By default, any resource files whose extent intersects  the  value  specified  by
              --bbox will be selected.  If using the contains strategy, only resource files whose extent is contained in the value specified by --bbox will be selected.

       --source-id ID
              Restrict resource files to be downloaded to those whose source_id property contains the ID value. Specifying ? as ID will list all possible values.

       --area-of-use NAME
              Restrict resource files to be downloaded to those whose area_of_use property contains the NAME value. Specifying ? as NAME will list all possible values.

       --file NAME
              Restrict resource files to be downloaded to those whose name property contains the NAME value. Specifying ? as NAME will list all possible values.

       --all  Ask to download all files.

       --exclude-world-coverage
              Exclude files which have world coverage.

       -q / --quiet
              Quiet mode

       --verbose
              New in version 8.1.

              Verbose mode (more than default)

       --dry-run
              Simulate the behavior of the tool without downloading resource files.

       --list-files
              List file names, with the source_id and area_of_use properties.

       --no-version-filtering
              New in version 8.1.

              By  default,  projsync  only downloads files that are compatible of the PROJ_DATA.VERSION metadata of proj.db, taking into account the version_added and version_removed properties of entries in
              files.geojson.  When specifying this switch, all files referenced in files.geojson will be candidate (combined with other filters).

       At least one of  --list-files,  --file,  --source-id, --area-of-use,  --bbox or  --all must be specified.

       Options --file,  --source-id, --area-of-use and --bbox are combined with a AND logic.

EXAMPLES
       1. Download all resource files

          projsync --all

       2. Download resource files covering specified point and attributing to an agency

          projsync --source-id fr_ign --bbox 2,49,2,49
