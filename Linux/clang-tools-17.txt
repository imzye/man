CLANG-QUERY(1)                                                                                 User Commands                                                                                 CLANG-QUERY(1)

NAME
       clang-query - manual page for clang-query 17

DESCRIPTION
       USAGE: clang-query [options] <source0> [... <sourceN>]

       OPTIONS:

       Generic Options:

       --help                      - Display available options (--help-hidden for more)

       --help-list                 - Display list of available options (--help-list-hidden for more)

       --version                   - Display the version of this program

       clang-query options:

       -c <command>                - Specify command to run

       --extra-arg=<string>        - Additional argument to append to the compiler command line

       --extra-arg-before=<string> - Additional argument to prepend to the compiler command line

       -f <file>                   - Read commands from file

       -p <string>                 - Build path

       --preload=<file>            - Preload commands from file and start interactive mode

       --use-color                 - Use colors in detailed AST output. If not set, colors
              will be used if the terminal connected to standard output supports colors.

       -p <build-path> is used to read a compile command database.

              For  example,  it  can  be a CMake build directory in which a file named compile_commands.json exists (use -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON CMake option to get this output). When no build
              path is specified, a search for compile_commands.json will be attempted through all parent paths of the first input file . See: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html for
              an example of setting up Clang Tooling on a source tree.

       <source0> ... specify the paths of source files. These paths are

              looked up in the compile command database. If the path of a file is absolute, it needs to point into CMake's source tree. If the path is relative, the current working directory needs to  be
              in  the CMake source tree and the file must be in a subdirectory of the current working directory. "./" prefixes in the relative files will be automatically removed, but the rest of a rela‐
              tive path must be a suffix of a path in the compile command database.
