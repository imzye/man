NAME
     nfc-emulate-forum-tag4 — NFC Forum tag type 4 emulation command line demonstration tool

SYNOPSIS
     nfc-emulate-forum-tag4 [-1] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
     nfc-emulate-forum-tag4 is a demonstration tool that emulates a NFC Forum tag type 4 v2.0 (or v1.0) with NDEF content.

     -1 can be provided to force old Tag Type 4 version 1.0 behavior.

     infile is the file which contains NDEF message you want to share with the NFC-Forum compliant initiator device (e.g. Nokia 6212 Classic for a v1.0 tag)

     If you want to save a shared content by the initiator device, we have to give outfile argument to point where the NDEF message will be saved.

     This example uses the hardware capability of PN532 to handle ISO/IEC 14443-4 low-level frames like RATS/ATS, WTX, etc.

     All devices compliant with NFC-Forum Tag Type 4 (Version 2.0 or 1.0) can be used with this example in read-write mode.

     If no argument is given, a default NDEF file is available.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     You can specify the same infile and outfile

IMPORTANT
     Only PN532 equipped devices can use this example. (e.g. PN532 breakout board)

     ACR122 devices (like touchatag, etc.) can be used by this example, but if something goes wrong, you will have to unplug/replug your device.  This is not a libnfc's bug, this problem is due to ACR122's
     internal MCU in front of NFC chip (PN532).
