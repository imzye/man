NAME
       znc - An advanced IRC bouncer

SYNOPSIS
       znc --help
       znc --version
       znc --makepass
       znc [-n] [-d datadir] [-D] [-f]
       znc [-n] [-d datadir] [-D] [-f] --makeconf
       znc [-n] [-d datadir] [-D] [-f] --makepem

DESCRIPTION
       znc is an IRC proxy.  It runs as a daemon and connects to IRC server, then allows you to connect from a workstation and work as the user that is logged in to the IRC server.  After you disconnect,
       it maintains the connection to the server.  It acts like any normal IRC server, so you can use any IRC client to connect to it.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output a brief help message.

       -v, --version
              Show the full version number.

       -n, --no-color
              Don't use any color escape sequences.

       -f, --foreground
              Don't fork the ZNC process into the background.

       -D, --debug
              Print debug output to the console. Implies --foreground.

       -d DATADIR, --datadir=DATADIR
              Specify another datadir.  This is where znc saves everything.

       -c, --makeconf
              Interactively create a new configuration.

       -s, --makepass
              Hash a password for use in znc.conf.

       -p, --makepem
              Generate znc.pem.  This is the server certificate znc uses.  You need this for SSL.

       -r, --allow-root
              Don't complain if ZNC is run with root privileges.

SIGNALS
       This section explains how znc reacts to different signals:

       SIGINT Exit ZNC. This is equivalent to /znc shutdown

       SIGHUP Reload znc.conf. This is equivalent to /znc rehash.  DO NOT do this very often, things can break badly!

       SIGUSR1
              Rewrite znc.conf. This is equivalent to /znc saveconfig

FILES
       /usr/local/share/znc/
              Static module data like webadmin skins

       /usr/local/lib/znc/
              znc installs its modules to this directory.

       /usr/local/include/znc/
              These are the headers needed for compiling own modules.

       ~/.znc This is the default datadir. The following paths assume that you use this.  If you change this via --datadir then the following lines are relative to that dir.

       ~/.znc/znc.pem
              This is the server certificate znc uses for listening on SSL ports.  You can generate this via --makepem and you may replace this with your own certificate, if you want to.

       ~/.znc/modules/
              If you compile your own modules, you can save them here.

       ~/.znc/configs/znc.conf
              This is the path to znc.conf.  Use --makeconf for an easy way to generate it.

       ~/.znc/users/USERNAME/
              The data for every user is saved in this dir.  USERNAME refers to the user name of that user.

       ~/.znc/users/USERNAME/moddata/MODULENAME/
              This is where each module can save some stuff. This is mainly used for remembering module settings that are not part of znc.conf.

       ~/.znc/moddata/MODULENAME/
              This is where global modules may save their settings.
