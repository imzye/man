NAME
       GAP - Groups, Algorithms and Programming

SYNOPSIS
       gap [OPTIONS] [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       GAP  is  a  system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming language, a library of thousands of functions implementing
       algebraic algorithms written in the GAP language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. GAP is used in research and teaching for studying groups and  their  representations,  rings,
       vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more.

   Startup:
       -h, --help
              print this help and exit

       --version
              print the GAP version and exit

       --print-gaproot
              print the primary GAP root and exit

       -b, --banner
              disable/enable the banner

       -c     <expr>    execute the expression <expr>

       --systemfile
              <file>    read this file after 'lib/system.g'

   Input/output:
       -q, --quiet
              enable/disable quiet mode

       -e     disable/enable quitting on <ctrl>-D

       -f     force line editing

       -n     prevent line editing

       -E, --readline
              disable/enable use of readline library (if possible)

       -x, --width
              <num>     set line width

       -y, --lines
              <num>     set number of lines

       -p     enable/disable package output mode (for use by XGAP and similar interfaces)

   Memory:
              (may use postfix 'k' = *1024, 'm' = *1024*1024,

              'g' = *1024*1024*1024):

       -g, --gasinfo
              show GASMAN messages (full/all/no garbage collections) (only available if GAP uses GASMAN)

       -m, --minworkspace
              <mem>     set the initial workspace size

       -o, --maxworkspace
              <mem>     set workspace size where GAP will warn about excessive memory usage (GAP may allocate more) (only available if GAP uses GASMAN)

       -K, --limitworkspace <mem>
              set maximal workspace size (GAP never allocates more)

       -s     <mem>     set the initially mapped virtual memory (only available if GAP uses GASMAN)

   Roots:
       -l, --roots
              <paths>   set or modify the GAP root paths Directories are separated using ';'.  Putting ';' on the start/end of list appends directories to the end/start of existing list of root paths

       -r     disable/enable user GAP root dir GAPInfo.UserGapRoot

   Loading:
       -A     disable/enable autoloading of suggested GAP packages

       -D     enable/disable debugging the loading of files

       -M     disable/enable loading of compiled modules

   Error handling, REPL:
       -T, --nobreakloop
              disable/enable break loop and error traceback

       --alwaystrace
              always print error traceback (overrides behaviour of -T)

       --quitonbreak
              quit GAP with non-zero return value instead of entering break loop

       --norepl
              Disable the GAP read-evaluate-print loop (REPL)

       --nointeract
              Start GAP in non-interactive mode (disable REPL and break loop)

   Workspaces:
              (only available if GAP uses GASMAN):

       -L     <file>    restore a saved workspace

       -R     prevent restoring of workspace (ignoring -L)

   Profiling:
       --prof <file>    Run ProfileLineByLine(<file>) on GAP start

       --memprof
              <file>    Run ProfileLineByLine(<file>) on GAP start with recordMem := true

       --cover
              <file>    Run CoverageLineByLine(<file>) on GAP start

       Internal developer tools

       -N     do not use hidden implications

       -O     disable/enable loading of obsolete files

       --bare Attempt to start GAP without even needed packages

              Short boolean options toggle the current value each time they are called.  Default actions are indicated first.
