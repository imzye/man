NAME
       flow-split - Split flow files into smaller files.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-split [ -gGhn ]  [ -b big|little ]  [ -C comment ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -N nflows ]  [ -o outfile_basename ]  [ -T nseconds ]  [ -z z_level ]

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-split utility will split a flow file into smaller files based on the the number of flows or the ammount of time that has passed.

OPTIONS
       -b big|little
              Byte order of output.

       -C Comment
              Add a comment.

       -d debug_level
              Enable debugging.

       -g     Split on source tag.

       -G     Split on destination tag.

       -h     Display help.

       -n     Use symbols for tag field in filename.

       -N nflows
              Split after processing nflows.

       -o outfile_basename
              The basename of the resulting files.

       -T nsecond
              Split after processing an interval of nseconds flows.

       -z z_level
              Configure compression level to  z_level. 0 is disabled (no compression), 9 is highest compression.

EXAMPLES
       Create 1 minute flow files from the flow archive in /flows/krc4. Store the results in /flows/krc4.split

       flow-cat /flows/krc4 | flow-split -T60 -o /flows/krc4.split/1min.

BUGS
       None known.
