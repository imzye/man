DESCRIPTION
       The command cclib-get is a simple command-line interface to cclib that allows you to quickly display the information extracted by cclib from a particular log file or log files.

OPTIONS
       These options are currently supported:

       -f, --future
              Use experimental features (currently optdone_as_list).

       -h, --help
              Print some usage information, in which case no other options or arguments are parsed.

       -j, --json
              Extract attributes available in a CJSON file.

       -l, --list
              List attributes that are present in a file, without actually extracting them.

       -m, --multi
              Parse multiple files as one input stream.

       -v, --verbose
              More verbose parsing output (only errors by default).
