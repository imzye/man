              MDP_LIST_HEAD2=' +- '
              MDP_LIST_HEAD3=' +- '

MARKDOWN FORMATTING
       For a complete list of supported markups, refer the sample presentation (sample.md) provided alongside mdp, or online available at https://github.com/visit1985/mdp.

   Slides
       The input FILE is split into multiple slides by horizontal rules. Each consisting of at least 3 --- or *** characters on a single line.  This line must be prefixed by an completely empty line.  It
       can also contain spaces but no other characters.

       If any slide is too large to fit into your current screen, an error message will be displayed at the moment the presentation is launched.

   Line-by-Line Mode
   Block-by-Block Mode
       A single <br>, <BR> or ^ on an otherwise empty line signals mdp to stop output of the current slide (stop point) and wait for a key-press by the user.

       This enables the user to display bullet points or list items one by one (line by line) or block by block.

   Headers
       mdp supports header lines in the format of @[DESCRIPTION] [VALUE] The first two header lines are displayed as title and author in top and bottom bar.

       Headers are only recognized at the top of the input FILE.

   Line spanning markup
       Supported are headlines, code blocks, quotes and unordered lists.

   In-line markup
       As well as bold text, underlined text and in-line code.

COLOR SUPPORT
       Most  terminals  are  able  to display 256 colors these days. But some of them enable only 16 colors by default. To enjoy mdp's full capabilities, these terminals need to be signaled to enable 256
       color mode. This is usually done by setting the TERM environment variable.

       export TERM=xterm-256color

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
       h, j, k, l, Arrow keys, Space, Enter, Backspace, Page Up, Page Down
              Display next/previous slide or continue after a stop point.

       g, Home
              Jump to first slide.

       G, End Jump to last slide.

       1..N   Jump to Nth slide.

       r      Reload the input FILE. This key is disabled if input was read from standard input.

       q      Exit mdp.

CUSTOMIZATION
       mdp can be configured by modifying config.h and recompiling.
