NAME
       ws_register - create links to valid workspaces

SYNOPSIS
       ws_register [-h] [-F FILESYSTEM]  DIRECTORY

DESCRIPTION
       Create links to workspaces of the calling user in DIRECTORY and remove links pointing to removed workspaces.  The action can be restricted to workspaces in a certain FILESYSTEM.

       The idea of the workspace is to allow the administrator to keep control of filespace in working filesystems, and to avoid the situations that data of past and finished projects/jobs is idling for ever
       on disks. A user can create and dispose arbitrary number of workspaces, they are cheap, and can be created e.g. for each job.

       From the system side, workspaces will be deleted after beeing expired. A friendly user can release workspaces before the expiration date using ws_release which will mark the workspace for future dele‐
       tion and make the data unavailable.

       Deletion is probably a task done once a night and not immediately.

       If a workspace was forgotten and expired, it might make sense to contact the administrator, as he probaly can restore a workspace for some time, if disk space is not low.

OPTIONS
       -h     display usage help text

       -F     select the filesystem to use the workspaces from.

EXAMPLES
       Create links in WS_LINKS
              ws_register WS_LINKS
