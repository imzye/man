KEA-DHCP4(8)                          Kea                         KEA-DHCP4(8)

NAME
       kea-dhcp4 - DHCPv4 server in Kea

SYNOPSIS
       kea-dhcp4  [-v]  [-V]  [-W]  [-d] [-c config-file] [-t config-file] [-p
       server-port-number] [-P client-port-number]

DESCRIPTION
       The kea-dhcp4 daemon provides the DHCPv4 server implementation.

ARGUMENTS
       The arguments are as follows:

       -v     Displays the version.

       -V     Displays the extended version.

       -W     Displays the configuration report.

       -d     Enables the debug mode with extra verbosity.

       -c config-file
              Specifies the configuration file with the configuration for  the
              DHCPv4  server.  It  may  also contain configuration entries for
              other Kea services.

       -t config-file
              Checks the configuration file and reports the  first  error,  if
              any.  Note  that  not  all parameters are completely checked; in
              particular, service and control channel sockets are not  opened,
              and hook libraries are not loaded.

       -p server-port-number
              Specifies  the  server port number (1-65535) on which the server
              listens. This is useful for testing purposes only.

       -P client-port-number
              Specifies the client port number (1-65535) to which  the  server
              responds. This is useful for testing purposes only.

DOCUMENTATION
       Kea  comes  with  an  extensive Kea Administrator Reference Manual that
       covers all aspects of running the Kea software - compilation, installa‐
       tion,  configuration,  configuration  examples, and much more. Kea also
       features a Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible  messages  Kea
       can print with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
       available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea distribu‐
       tion.      The      Kea      documentation      is     available     at
       https://kb.isc.org/docs/kea-administrator-reference-manual .

       Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer's Guide. Its  online
       version is available at https://jenkins.isc.org/job/Kea_doc/doxygen/.

       The Kea project website is available at https://kea.isc.org.

MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT
       There  are  two  public  mailing  lists  available for the Kea project.
       kea-users (kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while
       kea-dev  (kea-dev  at  lists.isc.org)  is  intended for Kea developers,
       prospective contributors, and other  advanced  users.  Both  lists  are
       available  at https://lists.isc.org. The community provides best-effort
       support on both of those lists.

       ISC   provides   professional   support   for   Kea    services.    See
       https://www.isc.org/kea/ for details.

HISTORY
       The  b10-dhcp4 daemon was first coded in November 2011 by Tomek Mrugal‐
       ski.

       In mid-2014, Kea was decoupled from the BIND 10 framework and became  a
       standalone  DHCP  server.  The  DHCPv4  server  binary  was  renamed to
       kea-dhcp4. Kea 1.0.0 was released in December 2015.
