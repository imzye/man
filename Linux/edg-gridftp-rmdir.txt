NAME
       edg-gridftp-rmdir - Remove a directory on a GridFTP server.

SYNOPSIS
       edg-gridftp-rmdir [--proxy=proxy] [--timeout=timeout] URL [URL ...]

       edg-gridftp-rmdir --usage

       edg-gridftp-rmdir --help

DESCRIPTION
       edg-gridftp-rmdir removes the directory from a GridFTP server.  This command will return a status of 0 if the directory was successfully removed.  In all other cases, it will return a non-zero value
       and print an error message to the standard error.

       If more than one URL is given, then a successful return will only occur if all of the URLs were successfully deleted.  The processing will stop with the first failure.

OPTIONS
       --proxy=proxy
           Set the proxy to use for the GridFTP operation.  If this is unset, then the underlying GridFTP library will try to find the proxy in the usual locations.  This is useful if the proxy is in a non-
           standard location, or the caller is a daemon which must act on the behalf of a user.

       --timeout=timeout
           Set the overall time (in seconds) within which all the directory removals must complete. If no timeout is specified a default 120 second timeout will be used.  A negative or zero timeout will
           report a timeout error before attempting to contact any of the FTP servers. If a timeout error does happen then some of the directories may already have been removed.

       --usage
           Short description of the usage of this command is given.

       --help
           A description of the usage of this command and information on all of the options is given.

       URL URLs of the following formats are accepted:

           ftp://ftp.server.org//absolute/file/name gsiftp://gridftp.server.org/~/home/relative/name.txt gridftp://gridftp.server.org/home/relative/name.txt

           Note: for the URLs without a tilde, the server configuration determines whether the filename is absolute or relative.  On servers which do not restrict users to their home areas, the tilde
           notation will not work.
