NAME
       caffeine-indicator - manually inhibit desktop idleness with a toggle

SYNOPSIS
       caffeine-indicator [--help|--version]

DESCRIPTION
       Caffeine-indicator allows the user to prevent the desktop becoming idle, and hence stop screen savers or power-saving activating even if the machine is not being used.

       It is usually more convenient to use the fully-automatic caffeine(1), or the caffeinate(1) wrapper. Caffeine-indicator may be useful when it is not practical or possible to run an application in full-
       screen mode and it is also not desirable to inhibit idleness for the entire time the application is running, for example, when watching a video with side notes, or displayed in a browser  widget  that
       lacks a full-screen mode.
