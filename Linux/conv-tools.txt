NAME
       mixconv — transcode mixed-encoding files

SYNOPSIS
       mixconv [-dv] [-f charset] [-o outfile] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The mixconv utility reads text encoded in a mixture of UTF-8 and a non-UTF 8-bit encoding and converts it to UTF-8.

       The non-UTF 8-bit encoding is assumed to be Latin-1, unless a different encoding is specified with the -f option.

       The following options are available:

       -d      Show debugging information.  This option can be specified multiple times to increase the level of detail.

       -f charset
               Specify the assumed character set for non-ASCII, non-UTF-8 text.  The default is “iso8859-1”.

       -h      Print a usage message and exit.

       -v      Print the source reversion number and exit.

       dirconf(1), iconv(1), regex(3).
