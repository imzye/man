NAME
       jday, j2d - astronomical julian date conversion utilities

SYNOPSIS
       jday

       jday [-d [-]year-mm-dd hh:mm:ss]

       jday [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       jday  and  j2d  are command line utilities to convert calendar dates to astronomical julian dates, and julian dates to calendar dates.  There is a corresponding library libjday.a which can be used for
       the same functionality within applications.

OPTIONS
       jday accepts the following options:

       none at all
               jday will simply print out the julian date based on the date and time found on the system.

       [year [month [day [hour [minute [second]]]]]]
               Always in that order, to override that value found on the system.

       -d [-]year-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
               Specify a year in the same format as that printed out by j2d

       j2d accepts the following options:

       <julian decimal date>
               This is the only, and required argument to j2d

       both commands accept the following options:

       --version
               Display the version of the programs.

       --h[elp]
               Display a command help message
