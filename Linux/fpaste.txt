NAME
       fpaste - A cli frontend for the fpaste.org pastebin

SYNOPSIS
       fpaste [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       It  is often useful to be able to easily paste text to the Fedora Pastebin at http://fpaste.org and this simple utility will do that and return the resulting URL so that people may examine the output.
       This can hopefully help folks who are for some reason stuck without a graphical interface, working remotely, or any other reason they may be unable to paste something into the  pastebin  using  a  web
       browser.

OPTIONS
       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -h, --help
              show help message and exit

       -t "TITLE", --title="TITLE"
              title for paste; default is UNTITLED

       -t "AUTHOR", --title="AUTHOR"
              author name; empty by default

       -l "LANGUAGE"
              language of content for syntax highlighting; default is "text"; use "list" to show all 200+ supported langs

       -x "EXPIRES"
              life of paste in minutes; default is 1 day (maximum)

       -r, --private
              make paste private; default is yes; valid options: 1 (yes), 0 (no)

       -i, --clipin
              read paste text from current X clipboard selection [requires xsel]

       -o, --clipout
              save returned paste URL to all the clipboards i.e primary, secondary and clipboard

       --input-selection=CLIPBOARD
              specify which X clipboard to use. valid options: "primary" (default; middle-mouse-button paste), "secondary" (uncommon), or "clipboard" (ctrl-v paste)

       -w, --wayland-clipin
              read paste text from Wayland selection [requires: wl-clip]

       --fullpath
              use pathname VS basename for file description(s)

       --pasteself
              paste this script itself

       --sysinfo
              paste system information

       --printonly
              print paste, but do not send

       --confirm
              print paste, and prompt for confirmation before sending

EXAMPLES
       Paste file foo.txt at fpaste.org

              fpaste foo.txt

       Paste output of ifconfig to fpaste.org with description "my network config"

              ifconfig | fpaste

       Paste mycode.py to fpaste.org with description as "problem with foo" and language "python"

              fpaste -l python mycode.py

       Paste mouse-selected text from the primary X selection clipboard, and then overwrite the same clipboard with the returned fpaste URL

              fpaste -io

       To  manually paste clipboard contents, run fpaste without file arguments so that it waits for input, then paste using mouse middle-click, <Ctrl-V>, or other, then press <Enter> followed by <Ctrl-D> to
       finish (EOF).

       To paste the output of more than one program and/or file at a time, use the following example forms:

              (lsusb ; lspci) | fpaste
              fpaste <(lsusb) <(lspci)

              fpaste <(fdisk -l) /etc/grub.conf
              (fdisk -l ; cat /etc/grub.conf) | fpaste

              (uname -a ; yum repolist) | fpaste

       Gather and paste various information about the running system. The info collected should be practically anonymous, and you may use the --printonly or --confirm options to preview what would  be  sent.
       fpaste.org URLs are also practically anonymous ([a-zA-Z0-9]**4 == 14,776,336 combinations), so you may also preview it instead before giving the link out.

              fpaste --sysinfo
              fpaste --sysinfo --confirm
              fpaste --sysinfo --printonly | less
