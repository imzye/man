NAME
     obprop — print standard molecular properties

SYNOPSIS
     obprop filename

DESCRIPTION
     The obprop program is a tool to print a set of standard molecular properties for all molecules in a file. It also serves as example code for using the Open Babel library (libopenbabel).

     Output format includes:
     name [Name]
     formula [Formula]
     mol_weight [Molecular Weight]
     exact_mass [Isotopic Mass]
     canonical_SMILES [String]
     num_atoms [Number]
     num_bonds [Number]
     num_residues [Number]
     sequence [Residue Sequence]
     num_rings [Number of Rings (by SSSR)]
     logP [Number (octanol-water partition)]
     PSA [Number (topological polar surface area)]
     MR [Number (molar refractivity)]
     $$$

     The "$$$" is the separator between multiple molecular entries in a file

EXAMPLES
           obprop pyridines.sdf
