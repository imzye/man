NAME
       ncargpath - Return the full pathname to a given NCAR Graphics directory or the default of a particular NCAR Graphics attribute.

SYNOPSIS
       ncargpath name

DESCRIPTION
       ncargpath  has  one  argument  which is the shortened name of the directory whose full pathname you want returned or the name of the attribute whose default value you want.  It is used by several NCAR
       Graphics scripts to find the pathname to certain installables.  For example, the script ncargex uses ncargpath to determine where the directory that contains all the examples is installed.   The  fol‐
       lowing arguments are recognized:

       bin               Directory where NCAR Graphics binaries are installed.

       config            Directory where NCAR Graphics configuration files are installed.

       data              Directory where NCAR Graphics HLU and NCL example data files are installed.

       database          Directory where NCAR Graphics databases (like the Ezmap database) are installed.

       doc               Directory where NCAR Graphics PostScript documents are installed.

       examples          Directory where NCAR Graphics LLU Fortran and C examples are installed.

       fontcap           The default fontcap being used; only returns a valid fontcap if the environment variable FONTCAP is set.

       fontcaps          Directory where NCAR Graphics fontcaps are installed.

       gks_output        The default name of the metafile.

       graphcap          The default graphcap being used; only returns a valid graphcap if the environment variable GRAPHCAP is set.

       graphcaps         Directory where NCAR Graphics graphcaps are installed.

       hluex             Directory where NCAR Graphics HLU Fortran and C examples are installed.

       lib               Directory where NCAR Graphics libraries are installed.

       man               Directory where NCAR Graphics man pages are installed.

       ncarg             Root directory where NCAR Graphics examples, databases, resource files, etc.  are installed.

       nclex             Directory where NCAR Graphics NCL examples are installed.

       ngwww             Directory where NCAR Graphics HTML files are installed (if they were installed).

       ngurl             URL for the NCAR Graphics documentation.

       resfiles          Directory where resource files for the NCL and HLU examples are installed.

       root              Parent directory where NCAR Graphics is installed.

       sysappres         Directory where the NCAR Graphics systems application resource file is installed.

       sysresfile        Directory where the NCAR Graphics system resource file is installed.
