NAME
       dbd - CNID database maintenance

SYNOPSIS
       dbd [-cfFstuvV] volumepath

DESCRIPTION
       dbd scans all file and directories of AFP volumes, updating the CNID
       database of the volume. It must be run with appropriate permissions
       i.e. as root..

OPTIONS
       -c
           convert from "appledouble = v2" to "appledouble = ea"

       -f
           delete and recreate CNID database

       -F
           location of the afp.conf config file

       -s
           scan volume: treat the volume as read only and don't perform any
           filesystem modifications

       -t
           show statistics while running

       -u
           username for use with AFP volumes using user variable $u

       -v
           verbose

       -V
           display version info

CNID BACKGROUND
       The CNID backends maintains name to ID mappings. If you change a
       filename outside afpd(8) (shell, samba), the CNID database will not
       reflect that change. Netatalk tries to recover from such
       inconsistencies as gracefully as possible.
