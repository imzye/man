NAME
       needrestart - needrestart

DESCRIPTION
       needrestart checks which daemons need to be restarted after library upgrades.

USAGE
       Usage:

              needrestart [-(v|q)] [-n] [-c <cfg>] [-r <mode>] [-f <fe>] [-u <ui>] [-(b|p|o)] [-x] [-kl]

       -v     be more verbose

       -q     be quiet

       -m <mode>
              set level of technical details

          e   (e)asy mode

          a   (a)dvanced mode

       -n     set default answer to 'no'

       -c <cfg>
              config filename

       -r <mode>
              set restart mode

          l   (l)ist only

          i   (i)nteractive restart

          a   (a)utomatically restart

              ATTENTION: If needrestart is configured to run in interactive mode but is run non-interactive (i.e. unattended-upgrades) it will fallback to list only mode.

       -b     enable batch mode: don't restart anything and produce machine-readable output.

       -p     nagios plugin mode: makes output and exit codes nagios compatible

       -o     OpenMetrics  output  mode: output information that can be scraped by OpenMetrics-compatible services. Implies batch mode. By combining with any of `-l`, `-k` and `-w` you can decide whether
              the metrics will expose outdated libraries, kernel and microcode, respectively. Note that in order to list system-wide outdated libraries, needrestart needs to be run as root. When  listing
              outdated libraries, a gauge-type metric exposes the number of running processes with such outdated libraries. When exposing kernel or microcode metrics, each one will expose a StateSet-type
              metric  which  indicates the current status. Kernel and microcode will also each expose an additional Info-type metric which informs of the versions of the current vs expected kernel or mi‐
              crocode.

       -f <fe>
              override debconf(7) frontend, sets the DEBIAN_FRONTEND environment variable to <fe>

       -t <seconds>
              When checking running interpreter processes, allow process start times that are close to timestamps of files the interpreter uses, within this tolerance (default 2). The default value of  2
              seconds is best for checks of Linux hosts, on which system limitations prevent more accurate measurements of process start times. Values higher than 0 should prevent false positives yet may
              in extreme cases cause false negatives; values higher than 2 should not be necessary.

       -u <ui>
              use preferred UI package (-u ? shows available packages)

       -x     automatically exit the GUI when there is no process selected by default

       By using one of the following options only the specified checks are performed:

       -k     check for obsolete kernel

       -l     check for obsolete libraries

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables can be used to override the config file options. Command line parameters do always supersede them.

       NEEDRESTART_MODE
              Change the configured restart mode (see also the -r parameter): (l)ist only, (i)nteractive or (a)utomatically

       When used with apt-get(8) needrestart supports the following additional environment variables:

       DEBIAN_FRONTEND
              The debconf(7) frontend to use, can also set using the -f parameter.

       NEEDRESTART_SUSPEND
              If set to a non-empty value the apt-get(8) hook will not run needrestart after installing or updating packages.
