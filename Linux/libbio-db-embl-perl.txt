NAME
       Bio::DB::EMBL - Database object interface for EMBL entry retrieval

SYNOPSIS
         use Bio::DB::EMBL;

         $embl = Bio::DB::EMBL->new();

         # remember that EMBL_ID does not equal GenBank_ID!
         $seq = $embl->get_Seq_by_id('HSFOS'); # EMBL ID
         print "cloneid is ", $seq->id, "\n";

         # or changeing to accession number and Fasta format ...
         $embl->request_format('fasta');
         $seq = $embl->get_Seq_by_acc('J02231'); # EMBL ACC
         print "cloneid is ", $seq->id, "\n";

         # especially when using versions, you better be prepared
         # in not getting what what want
         eval {
             $seq = $embl->get_Seq_by_version('J02231.1'); # EMBL VERSION
         };
         print "cloneid is ", $seq->id, "\n" unless $@;

         # or ... best when downloading very large files, prevents
         # keeping all of the file in memory

         # also don't want features, just sequence so let's save bandwidth
         # and request Fasta sequence
         $embl = Bio::DB::EMBL->new(-retrievaltype => 'tempfile' ,
                                   -format => 'fasta');
         my $seqio = $embl->get_Stream_by_id(['AC013798', 'AC021953'] );
         while( my $clone =  $seqio->next_seq ) {
               print "cloneid is ", $clone->id, "\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Allows the dynamic retrieval of sequence objects Bio::Seq from the EMBL database using the dbfetch script at EBI: <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/dbfetch/dbfetch>.

       In order to make changes transparent we have host type (currently only ebi) and location (defaults to ebi) separated out.  This allows later additions of more servers in different geographical
       locations.

       The functionality of this module is inherited from Bio::DB::DBFetch which implements Bio::DB::WebDBSeqI.

FEEDBACK

       User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to one of the Bioperl mailing lists.  Your participation is much
       appreciated.

   Support
       Please direct usage questions or support issues to the mailing list:

       bioperl-l@bioperl.org

       rather than to the module maintainer directly. Many experienced and reponsive experts will be able look at the problem and quickly address it. Please include a thorough description of the problem
       with code and data examples if at all possible.

APPENDIX
       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods. Internal methods are usually preceded with a _

   new
        Title   : new
        Usage   : $gb = Bio::DB::GenBank->new(@options)
        Function: Creates a new genbank handle
        Returns : New genbank handle
        Args    : -delay   number of seconds to delay between fetches (3s)

       NOTE:  There are other options that are used internally.
