DESCRIPTION
       SPIM  S20  is  a simulator that runs programs for the MIPS32 RISC computers. SPIM can read and immediately execute files containing assembly language or MIPS executable files.  SPIM is a self-con‐
       tained system for running these programs and contains a debugger and interface to a few operating system services.

       SPIM comes in two versions.  The plain version is called spim.  It runs on any type of terminal.  It operates like most programs of this type: you type a line of text, hit the return key, and spim
       executes your command.  The fancier version of SPIM is called xspim.  It uses the X-window system, so you must have a bit-mapped display to run it.  xspim, however, is a  much  easier  program  to
       learn and use because its commands are always visible on the screen and because it continually displays the machine's registers.

OPTIONS
       xspim has many options:

       -asm      Simulate the virtual MIPS machine provided by the assembler.  This is the default.

       -bare     Simulate a bare MIPS machine without pseudo-instructions or the additional addressing modes provided by the assembler.  Implies -quiet.

       -exception
                 Load the standard exception handler and startup code.  This is the default.

       -noexception
                 Do  not load the standard exception handler and startup code.  This exception handler handles exceptions.  When an exception occurs, SPIM jumps to location 0x80000080, which must contain
                 code to service the exception.  In addition, this file contains startup code that invokes the routine main.  Without the startup routine, SPIM begins execution at the instruction labeled
                 __start.

       -quiet    Print a message when an exception occurs.  This is the default.

       -noquiet  Do not print a message at exceptions.

       -mapped_io
                 Enable the memory-mapped IO facility.  Programs that use SPIM syscalls to read from the terminal cannot also use memory-mapped IO.

       -nomapped_io
                 Disable the memory-mapped IO facility.

       -delayed_branches
                 Simulate MIPS's delayed control transfers by executing the instruction after a branch, jump, or call before transferring control.  SPIM's default is to  simulate  non-delayed  transfers,
                 unless the -bare flag is set.

       -delayed_loads
                 Simulate MIPS's original, non-interlocked load instructions.  SPIM's default is to simulate non-delayed loads, unless the -bare flag is set.

       -stext size -sdata size -sstack size -sktext size -skdata size
                 Sets the initial size of memory segment seg to be size bytes.  The memory segments are named: text, data, stack, ktext, and kdata.  The text segment contains instructions from a program.
                 The  data  segment holds the program's data.  The stack segment holds its runtime stack.  In addition to running a program, SPIM also executes system code that handles interrupts and ex‐
                 ceptions.  This code resides in a separate part of the address space called the kernel.  The ktext segment holds this code's instructions and kdata holds its data.  There  is  no  kstack
                 segment since the system code uses the same stack as the program.  For example, the pair of arguments -sdata 2000000 starts the user data segment at 2,000,000 bytes.

       -ldata size -lstack size  -lkdata size
                 Sets the limit on how large memory segment seg can grow to be size bytes.  The memory segments that can grow are data, stack, and kdata.

       -hexgpr   Disply the general purpose registers (GPRs) in hexadecimal.

       -nohexgpr Disply the general purpose registers (GPRs) in decimal.

       -hexfpr   Disply the floating-point registers (FPRs) in hexadecimal.

       -nohexfpr Disply the floating-point registers (FPRs) as floating-point values

       -file file 10
                 Load and execute the assembly code in the file.

       -execute file 10
                 Load and execute the MIPS executable (a.out) file.  Only works on systems using a MIPS processors.

BUGS
       Instruction opcodes cannot be used as labels.
