DESCRIPTION
       OpenRCT2  is  an  open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2).  The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park containing attractions, shops and facili‐
       ties. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the player  to
       complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no restrictions or finance.

       RollerCoaster  Tycoon  2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an
       equivalent open-source project, OpenTTD. OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of these include support for modern platforms,
       an improved interface, improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics  from  RollerCoaster  Tycoon  that  were  not
       present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those include; mountain tool in-game, the “have fun” objective, launched coasters (not passing-through the station) and several buttons on the toolbar.

FILES
       On UNIX systems, OpenRCT2 stores user configuration, data, and cache in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/OpenRCT2, falling back to ~/.config/OpenRCT2 if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set in the environment.

NOTES
       Playing  OpenRCT2 requires original files of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. It can be bought at either Steam or GOG.com. If you have the original RollerCoaster Tycoon and its expansion packs, you
       can point OpenRCT2 to these in order to play the original scenarios.

       OpenRCT2 allows custom scripts (also known as plug-ins) to be written and executed in the game providing additional behaviour on top of the vanilla experience. This can range  from  extra  windows
       providing information about the park to entire new multiplayer game modes.

       Version  0.4.0 of OpenRCT2 introduced a new park save format that allows for higher limits and more features than the original RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Old .SV4 and .SV6 files will continue to work
       - forever. The only thing changed is that you can no longer save to .SV6, it will now be saved as .park.

EXAMPLES
       openrct2 ./my_park.sv6                               Open a saved park.

       openrct2 ./SnowyPark.sc6                             Install and open a scenario.

       openrct2 ./ShuttleLoop.td6                           Install a track.

       openrct2 https://example.org/files/ExamplePark.sv6   Download and open a saved park.

       openrct2 host ./my_park.sv6 --port 11753 --headless  Run a headless server for a saved park.
