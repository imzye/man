OPTIONS
       Mixxx  is  designed to be as user-friendly as possible. As such, its command line options are only useful for development or debugging, as they make these tasks easier. mixxx accepts the following
       case-sensitive options on the command-line:

                 <FILE>
                 Load the specified music file(s) at start-up. Each file you specify will be loaded into the next virtual deck. Supported file types: mp3, ogg, aiff, aif, wav, flac

                 --resourcePath           <PATH>
                 Top-level directory where Mixxx should look for its resource files such as MIDI mappings, overriding the default installation location.

                 --pluginPath           <PATH>
                 Top-level directory where Mixxx should look for sound source plugins in addition to default locations.

                 --settingsPath           <PATH>
                 Top-level directory where Mixxx should look for settings.

                 --controllerDebug/--midiDebug
                 Causes Mixxx to display/log all of the MIDI/HID controller data it receives and script functions it loads.

                 --developer
                 Enables developer-mode. Includes extra log info, stats on performance, and a Developer tools menu.

                 --locale           <LOCALE>
                 Use a custom locale for loading translations (e.g 'fr').

                 --f           --fullScreen
                 Starts mixxx in full-screen mode.

                 -h           --help
                 Display a help message and exit.

FILES
                 ~/.mixxx/
                 The directory where mixxx stores its user data.

                 ~/.mixxx/mixxx.cfg
                 The mixxx configuration file.

                 ~/.mixxx/mixxxdb.sqlite
                 The mixxx library file.  Warning: Deleting your library will lose all of your metadata. This includes saved hotcues, loops, comments, ratings, and other library  related  metadata.  Only
                 delete your library if you are fine with losing these.

                 ~/.mixxx/analysis
                 The  directory  where  mixxx  stores  any  additional analysis data that can't fit into the library file. Currently only the waveforms are saved here. If you delete your library file you
                 should also delete this folder as the waveforms around 1MB each and are unusable without the library that generated them.

                 ~/.mixxx/controllers
                 The directory where mixxx stores user controller mappings.  All mappings that are created with the MIDI learning wizard are saved here. If there are mappings for a controller in the  de‐
                 fault resource directory and this directory mixxx will use the one saved here.

                 /usr/share/mixxx
                 The directory where mixxx stores its default resources like skins, MIDI/HID controller mappings, keyboard mappings, and translations.
