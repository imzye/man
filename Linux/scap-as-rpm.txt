              [--pkg-release    PKG_RELEASE]    [--pkg-summary    PKG_SUMMARY]
              [--pkg-license  PKG_LICENSE] [--pkg-scap-location PKG_SCAP_LOCA‐

              SRPM_DESTINATION] FILE [FILE ...]

       Takes  given SCAP input(s) and makes an RPM package that contains them.
       The  result  RPM  can  be  installed  using  #  yum   install   ./pack‐
       age-name-1-1.rpm  which will put the contents into /usr/share/xml/scap.
       No dependency on openscap or scapworkbench is enforced  in  the  output
       package  so  you  can use any SCAP-capable scanner to evaluate the con‐
       tent.

   positional arguments:
       FILE   List of files that should be put into the result package.  These
              should be SCAP XML files but such requirement is not enforced.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --pkg-name PKG_NAME
              Name of the RPM package, if none is provided the basename of the
              first SCAP input is used. Ex.: xyzsecurity-guide

       --pkg-version PKG_VERSION

       --pkg-release PKG_RELEASE

       --pkg-summary PKG_SUMMARY
              Optional short description of the package.

       --pkg-license PKG_LICENSE
              Short name of the license that you want to publish  the  package
              under. Ex.: GPLv2+, BSD, ...

       --pkg-scap-location PKG_SCAP_LOCATION
              Folder  where  SCAP  files  are  supposed to be installed.  Each
              package will have its own folder inside this folder.  RPM  vari‐
              ables  can  be  used and will be expanded as usual. It is recom‐
              mended to keep the default settings.

       --rpm-destination RPM_DESTINATION
              The folder (absolute or relative to CWD) where  the  result  RPM
              shall be saved.

       --srpm-destination SRPM_DESTINATION
