NAME
       paperconfig - configure the system default paper size

SYNOPSIS
       paperconfig [--version|--help|--paper papername|--choose]

DESCRIPTION
       paperconfig  queries  the current paper size, and sets the system default paper to be used by tools using the papersize file. It can either ask interactively for the paper to use or be called non-
       interactively by scripts.

       When the paper size has been changed, paperconfig notifies other packages of the change by running the scripts in the /etc/libpaper.d directory.

       When no paper is specified, paperconfig prints the current system paper size.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Print the version of paperconfig and exit.

       -h, --help
              Print help about usage and exit.

       -p, --paper papername
              Use papername if possible. If papername is not a valid paper, print an error message and exit.

       -c, --choose
              Choose system paper interactively.

FILES
       /etc/libpaper.d
              Directory of scripts to run after the paper size has been changed.  This package puts no scripts here, but other packages may.  run-parts is used to run the scripts.  Therefore their  names
              must comply with run-part's naming requirements.
