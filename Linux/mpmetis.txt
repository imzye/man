NAME
       mpmetis - Partitions a mesh into a specified number of parts.

SYNOPSIS
       mpmetis [options] meshfile nparts

DESCRIPTION
              Required parameters

       meshfile
              Stores the mesh to be partitioned.

       nparts The number of partitions to split the mesh.

              Optional parameters

       -gtype=string

              Specifies the graph to be used for computing the partitioning The possible values are:

       dual   - Partition the dual graph of the mesh [default]

       nodal  - Partition the nodal graph of the mesh

       -ptype=string

              Specifies the scheme to be used for computing the k-way partitioning.  The possible values are:

       rb     - Recursive bisectioning

       kway   - Direct k-way partitioning [default]

       -ctype=string

              Specifies the scheme to be used to match the vertices of the graph during the coarsening.  The possible values are:

       rm     - Random matching

       shem   - Sorted heavy-edge matching [default]

       -iptype=string [applies only when -ptype=rb]

              Specifies the scheme to be used to compute the initial partitioning of the graph.  The possible values are:

       grow   - Grow a bisection using a greedy strategy [default]

       random - Compute a bisection at random

       -objtype=string [applies only when -ptype=kway]

              Specifies the objective that the partitioning routines will optimize.  The possible values are:

       cut    - Minimize the edgecut [default]

       vol    - Minimize the total communication volume

       -contig [applies only when -ptype=kway]

              Specifies that the partitioning routines should try to produce partitions that are contiguous. Note that if the input graph is not connected this option is ignored.

       -minconn [applies only when -ptype=kway]

              Specifies that the partitioning routines should try to minimize the maximum degree of the subdomain graph, i.e., the graph in which each partition is a node, and edges connect subdomains with a
              shared interface.

       -tpwgts=filename

              Specifies the name of the file that stores the target weights for each partition. By default, all partitions are assumed to be of the same size.

       -ufactor=int

              Specifies the maximum allowed load imbalance among the partitions.  A value of x indicates that the allowed load imbalance is 1+x/1000.  For ptype=rb, the load imbalance is measured as the  ra‐
              tio  of  the  2*max(left,right)/(left+right),  where left and right are the sizes of the respective partitions at each bisection.  For ptype=kway, the load imbalance is measured as the ratio of
              max_i(pwgts[i])/avgpwgt, where pwgts[i] is the weight of the ith partition and avgpwgt is the sum of the total vertex weights divided by the number of partitions requested.  For  ptype=rb,  the
              default value is 1 (i.e., load imbalance of 1.001).  For ptype=kway, the default value is 30 (i.e., load imbalance of 1.03).

       -ncommon=int

              Specifies the common number of nodes that two elements must have in order to put an edge between them in the dual graph. Default is 1.

       -niter=int

              Specifies the number of iterations for the refinement algorithms at each stage of the uncoarsening process. Default is 10.

       -ncuts=int

              Specifies the number of different partitionings that it will compute.  The final partitioning is the one that achieves the best edgecut or communication volume. Default is 1.

       -nooutput

              Specifies that no partitioning file should be generated.

       -seed=int

              Selects the seed of the random number generator.

       -dbglvl=int

              Selects the dbglvl.

       -help

              Prints this message.
