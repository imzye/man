NAME
       Pango - Layout and render international text

SYNOPSIS
         my $surface = Cairo::ImageSurface->create ('argb32', 200, 100);
         my $cr = Cairo::Context->create ($surface);

         my $layout = Pango::Cairo::create_layout ($cr);
         $layout->set_text ("\x{03A0}\x{03B1}\x{03BD}\x{8A9E}");

         my $font = Pango::FontDescription->from_string ('Serif Bold 27');
         $layout->set_font_description ($font);

         Pango::Cairo::show_layout($cr, $layout);

         $surface->write_to_png ('pango.png');

ABSTRACT
       Pango is a library for laying out and rendering text, with an emphasis on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed, but using Pango in conjunction with Cairo and/or
       Gtk2 provides a complete solution with high quality text handling and graphics rendering.

       Dynamically loaded modules handle text layout for particular combinations of script and font backend. Pango provides a wide selection of modules, including modules for Hebrew, Arabic, Hangul, Thai,
       and a number of Indic scripts. Virtually all of the world's major scripts are supported.

       In addition to the low level layout rendering routines, Pango includes Pango::Layout, a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text, and routines to assist in editing internationalized
       text.

DOCUMENTATION
       Pango tries to stick very close in spirit to the C API of the underlying pango library.  Thus, the manual available at <http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/stable/> also applies to this module.
       Additionally, API listings in POD form are generated during compilation for each of the sub-modules.  An index of those POD pages is available at Pango::index.

SEE ALSO
       perl, Glib, Cairo, Gtk2.

       Pango::index lists the autogenerated API documentation pod files for Pango.
