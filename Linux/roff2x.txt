NAME
       roff2x - transform roff code into x mode

SYNOPSIS
       roff2x [groffer-option ...] [--] [filespec ...]

       roff2x -h
       roff2x --help

       roff2x -v
       roff2x --version

       The  options  -v and --version print the version information of the program to standard output and exit.  The options -h and --help print a usage information of the program to standard output and stop
       the program instantly.

       All other options are assumed to be groffer options.  They are internally passed to groffer.  They override the behavior of the program.  The options are optional, they can be omitted.

       The filespec arguments correspond to the filespec arguments of groffer.  So they are either the names of existing, readable files or - for standard input, or the name of a man page or a groffer(1) man
       page search pattern.  If no filespec is specified standard input is assumed automatically.

DESCRIPTION
       roff2x transforms roff code into X mode corresponding to the groff devices X*; this mode is suitable for gxditview(1).  Print the result to standard output.

       There are more of these programs for generating other formats of roff input.

       roff2dvi(1)
              is for dvi mode.

       roff2html(1)
              generates HTML output.

       roff2pdf(1)
              outputs pdf mode.

       roff2ps(1)
              prints PostScript format to standard output.

       roff2text(1)
              generates text output in the groff device latin1.
