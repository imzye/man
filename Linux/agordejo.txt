USAGE
       Agordejo  (Esperanto:  'place to set things up') is a music production session manager.  It is used to start your programs, remember their (JACK) interconnections and make your life easier in
       general.

       You can create a session, or project, add programs to it and then use commands to save, start/stop, hide/show all programs at once, or individually. At a later date you can then  re-open  the
       session and continue where you left off.

       Agordejo  does  not  re-invent the wheel but instead uses the New-Session-Manager daemon and enhances it with some tricks of its own, that always remain 100% compatible with the original ses‐
       sions.

EXAMPLES
       Run agordejo. You are now in the session overview. Press the "Quick New" button and add programs by a double clicking on the list. Try right-clicking on many things to  get  more  options  in
       context menus.
