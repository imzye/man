NAME
       cronic - a shell script to help control the most annoying feature of cron: unwanted emailed output

SYNOPSIS
       cronic [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       Cronic is a small shim shell script for wrapping cron jobs so that cron only sends email when an error has occurred.

       Cronic defines an error as any non-trace error output or a non-zero result code.

       Cronic filters Bash execution traces (or anything matching PS4) from the error output, so jobs can be run with execution tracing to aid forensic debugging.

       Cronic has no options, it simply executes its arguments.

       0 1 * * * cronic backup

       With cronic, you can turn on Bash's strict error handling and debug options (exit on error, unset variable detection and execution tracing) to make sure problems are caught early.

EXAMPLES
       Example cron job:

              #!/bin/bash
              set -o errexit -o nounset -o xtrace
              cp -rp data1 /backup
              cp -rp data2 /backup
              cp -rp data3 /backup

       When an error is detected, Cronic outputs a report listing the result code, error output, and combined trace and error output. The combined output can help put error messages in context.

       Example email from cron with cronic info:

              From: user@example.net (Cron Daemon)
              To: user@example.net
              Subject: Cron <user@server> cronic backup

              Cronic detected failure or error output for the command:
              backup

              RESULT CODE: 1

              ERROR OUTPUT:
              cp: data2: Permission denied

              STANDARD OUTPUT:

              TRACE-ERROR OUTPUT:
              + cp -rp data1 /backup
              + cp -rp data2 /backup
              cp: data2: Permission denied

VERSION HISTORY
       v3 - Use mktemp -d to avoid race-conditions and security problems.

       v2 - Corrected command evaluation, so shell meta-chars are preserved correctly (Thanks to Frank Wallingford for the fix).

       v1 - Initial release.

OTHER TOOLS
       Joey Hess has written a simpler perl version of cronic, named chronic.  It is available in Debian as part of moreutils.
