NAME
       intel2gas - convert between NASM assembly and GAS assembly language

SYNOPSIS
       intel2gas [-higmtcIdV] [-o outfile] [infile]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the intel2gas command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       intel2gas is a small text parser that can convert assembler source written in NASM syntax to gas syntax. And nowadays more often also the other way.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -i     convert from intel to at&t format (default)

       -g     convert from at&t to intel format

       -m     convert from masm to at&t format

       -t     convert from tasm to at&t format

       -c     understand C style comments

       -I     convert inline assembler (intel to at&t only)

       -d     output all % chars as %%

       -V     show version

ENVIRONMENT
       I2G_DATA
              should indicate the location of the syntax files if they are not installed in the default location. The value should be a path to the directory with the subdirectories g2i, i2g and m2g.

FILES
       /usr/share/intel2gas/{g2i,i2g,m2g}/*
              syntaxfiles for the translation.
