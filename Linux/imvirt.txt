IMVIRT(1)                                                                                 General Commands Manual                                                                                 IMVIRT(1)

NAME
       imvirt - detects several virtualizations

SYNOPSIS
       imvirt

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the imvirt script.  imvirt tries to detect if it runs on a physical machine or on a virtualized one. If it detects that it is a virtualized one it also tries to
       find out which virtualization technology is used.

USAGE
       imvirt does not need any arguments.  But there is at the moment a restriction if you do not call this script with the administrative root user, because imvirt also uses dmidecode to determine  the
       used virtualization technology. dmidecode itself needs root privileges to access /dev/mem. So on you have to wrap imvirt with sudo if you want to detect every virtualization technology.

SEE ALSO
       dmidecode(8)
