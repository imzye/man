NAME
       acpixtract - ACPICA source code conversion utility

SYNOPSIS
       acpixtract [<option>...] <acpidump-file>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the acpixtract command. The option list is taken from the acpixtract interactive help.

       acpixtract extracts binary ACPI tables from the output of the acpidump command (see the pm-tools package).  A default invocation will extract the DSDT and all SSDTs.

       Much more detailed documentation may be found at http://www.acpica.org/documentation/.

OPTIONS
       -a     Extract all tables, not just DSDT/SSDT

       -l     List table summaries, do not extract

       -s <signature>
              Extract all tables with <signature>
