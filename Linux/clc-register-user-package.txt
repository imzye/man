NAME
       clc-(un)register-user-package - registers a user asdf system

SYNOPSIS
       clc-register-user-package package-file

       clc-unregister-user-package package-file

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a user defined system into the common lisp controller system. This means that any Common Lisp implementation will know how to find the system.

       The system file itself will be symlinked from the ~/.clc/systems directory and the system will be recorded in the ~/.clc/user-packages.db file.

       No  removal  of old fasl files during upgrades of Common Lisp Implementations will be done, nor will the fasls of different implementations will be separated by clc , it is expected that the users who
       require this will create a full Debian package or create a symlink in /usr/share/common-lisp/systems/ to the system file.

BUGS
       Bug reports should be sent to the Debian BTS, preferably with reportbug.
