NAME
       nd - Tiny little command line WebDAV interface

SYNOPSIS
       nd [options] url

DESCRIPTION
       nd provides a simple command line interface to the RFC 2518 (WebDAV) server. If no option is specified, HTTP GET command is issued and writes response data to the standard output.

       The options are as follows:

       -c dest_url
               COPY url to the dest_url.  Use lock token if -t is specified.

       -f      Force override the content even when the MOVE or COPY target already exits.

       -v      View property information of url by PROPFIND. With -g option, only the specified property is displayed.

       -p file PUT file content to the url.  Use lock token if -t is specified.

       -g name Specify the property name for -v option.

       -e name=value
               Edit the property with name to value using PROPPATCH .

       -N namespace-url
               Specify the property namespace URL for -e or -g option.

       -P file POST file content to the url.  -T is used for the Content-Type.

       -T content_type
               Use content_type as a Content-Type field value of the POST request.  Default is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.

       -d      DELETE url.  Use lock token if -t is specified.

       -l      LOCK url.  Use -o as owner, -s as scope, -i as timeout.

       -o owner
               Specify lock owner.  Default is USER environment variable.

       -s scope
               Specify lock scope (`exclusive' or `shared'). Default is `exclusive'.

       -i timeout
               Specify lock timeout interval. Default is `Infinite'.

       -u      UNLOCK url.  -t option is required.

       -t token
               Specify the lock token.

       -r      Set command execution `Depth' as `Infinity'.

       -a realm
               Specify authentication realm.

       -A realm
               Specify proxy authentication realm.

       -k      MKCOL url

       -m dest_url
               MOVE url to the dest_url.  Use lock token if -t is specified.

       -S      Print output using s-expression.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       http_proxy, HTTP_PROXY
               Specify HTTP proxy.

       USER    When manipulating a lock without an explicit owner option, the value of USER is used to set the owner of the file lock.

BUGS
       A  maintainer  of  the  Debian package has implemented Digest authentication on top of the original software. However, the upstream source uses the nanoHTTP code from libxml2 to implement the HTTP
       transport. Due to properties inherent in that code for detecting and following redirected target sites, there is no way to pull out the new address in order to insert it into the hashes  necessary
       for  the  Digest method. Nd will therefore incorrectly answer with 'Bad request' to any method call aimed at such sites. Using the correct logical name for the target will, however, produce a cor‐
       rect response from Nd.
