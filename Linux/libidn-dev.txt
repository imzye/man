NAME
       punycode_decode - API function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <punycode.h>

       int punycode_decode(size_t input_length, const char [] input, size_t * output_length, punycode_uint [] output, unsigned char [] case_flags);

ARGUMENTS
       size_t input_length
                   The number of ASCII code points in the  input array.

       const char [] input
                   An array of ASCII code points (0..7F).

       size_t * output_length
                   The caller passes in the maximum number of code points that it can receive into the  output array (which is also the maximum number of flags that it can receive into the
                    case_flags  array,  if   case_flags is not a NULL pointer).  On successful return it will contain the number of code points actually output (which is also the number of flags actually
                   output, if case_flags is not a null pointer).  The decoder will never need to output more code points than the number of ASCII code points in the input, because of the way the encoding
                   is defined.  The number of code points output cannot exceed the maximum possible value of a punycode_uint, even if the supplied
                    output_length is greater than that.

       punycode_uint [] output
                   An array of code points like the input argument of punycode_encode() (see above).

       unsigned char [] case_flags
                   A NULL pointer (if the flags are not needed by the caller) or an array of boolean values parallel to the  output array.  Nonzero (true, flagged) suggests that the corresponding Unicode
                   character be forced to uppercase by the caller (if possible), and zero (false, unflagged) suggests that it be forced to lowercase (if possible).  ASCII code points (0..7F)  are  output
                   already in the proper case, but their flags will be set appropriately so that applying the flags would be harmless.

DESCRIPTION
       Converts Punycode to a sequence of code points (presumed to be Unicode code points).

       Return value: The return value can be any of the Punycode_status values defined above.  If not PUNYCODE_SUCCESS, then
        output_length ,  output , and  case_flags might contain garbage.
