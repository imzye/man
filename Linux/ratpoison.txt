        rpws n                 - switch to this workspace

DESCRIPTION
        B<rpws> implements multiple workspaces in ratpoison by making calls
        to fdump, freestore.  It was adapted from rpws which comes with
        ratpoison in the contrib directory.

USAGE
       Add the following line in ~/.ratpoisonrc

            exec /path/to/rpws init 6 -k

       This creates 6 aliases rpws1, rpws2, etc. It also binds the keys M-F1, M-F2, etc to each rpwsN alias. Moreover, rpwsn (Next) and rpwsp (Prev) are created, and C-M-{Right,Left} are bound to
       rpws{n,p}. Aliases rpwsm1, rpwsm2, etc. and rpwsm{n,p} are used to move the focused window to another workspace.

       Full list of keybindings created are:

           M-F$i           Goto workspace $i
           C-M-Right       Goto Next workspace
           C-M-Left        Goto Prev workspace
           C-M-S-F$i       Move window to workspace $i
           C-M-greater     Move current window to next workspace
           C-M-less        Move current window to prev workspace

FILES
        rpws requires use of a lockfile.  It defaults to using
       /tmp/rpws.<UID>.lock but this can be changed by setting the
       environment variable RPWS_LOCKFILE to your desired lockfile.
