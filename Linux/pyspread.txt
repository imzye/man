NAME
       pyspread - non-traditional Python spreadsheet application

SYNOPSIS
       pyspread [options] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       pyspread  is  a non-traditional spreadsheet application that is based on and written in the programming language Python.  The goal of pyspread is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.  Pyspread ex‐
       pects Python expressions in its grid cells, which makes a spreadsheet specific language obsolete. Each cell returns a Python object that can be accessed from other cells. These objects can  repre‐
       sent anything including lists or matrices.
