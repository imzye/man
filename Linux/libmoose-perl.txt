NAME
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint - The Moose Type Constraint metaclass

VERSION
       version 2.4000

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a single type constraint. Moose's built-in type constraints, as well as constraints you define, are all stored in a Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Registry object as objects of
       this class.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint" is a subclass of Class::MOP::Object.

METHODS
   Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint->new(%options)
       This creates a new type constraint based on the provided %options:

       •   name

           The constraint name. If a name is not provided, it will be set to "__ANON__".

       •   parent

           A "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint" object which is the parent type for the type being created. This is optional.

       •   constraint

           This is the subroutine reference that implements the actual constraint check. This defaults to a subroutine which always returns true.

       •   message

           A subroutine reference which is used to generate an error message when the constraint fails. This is optional.

       •   coercion

           A Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion object representing the coercions to the type. This is optional.

       •   inlined

           A  subroutine  which returns a string suitable for inlining this type constraint. It will be called as a method on the type constraint object, and will receive a single additional parameter, a
           variable name to be tested (usually "$_" or "$_[0]".

           This is optional.

       •   inline_environment

           A hash reference of variables to close over. The keys are variables names, and the values are references to the variables.

   $constraint->equals($type_name_or_object)
       Returns true if the supplied name or type object is the same as the current type.

   $constraint->is_subtype_of($type_name_or_object)
       Returns true if the supplied name or type object is a parent of the current type.

   $constraint->is_a_type_of($type_name_or_object)
       Returns true if the given type is the same as the current type, or is a parent of the current type. This is a shortcut for checking "equals" and "is_subtype_of".

   $constraint->coerce($value)
       This will attempt to coerce the value to the type. If the type does not have any defined coercions this will throw an error.

       If no coercion can produce a value matching $constraint, the original value is returned.

   $constraint->assert_coerce($value)
       This method behaves just like "coerce", but if the result is not valid according to $constraint, an error is thrown.

   $constraint->check($value)
       Returns true if the given value passes the constraint for the type.

   $constraint->validate($value)
       This is similar to "check". However, if the type is valid then the method returns an explicit "undef". If the type is not valid, we call  "$self->get_message($value)"  internally  to  generate  an
       error message.

   $constraint->assert_valid($value)
       Like  "check"  and  "validate",  this  method  checks  whether  $value is valid under the constraint.  If it is, it will return true.  If it is not, an exception will be thrown with the results of
       "$self->get_message($value)".

   $constraint->name
       Returns the type's name, as provided to the constructor.

   $constraint->parent
       Returns the type's parent, as provided to the constructor, if any.

   $constraint->has_parent
       Returns true if the type has a parent type.

   $constraint->parents
       Returns all of the types parents as an list of type constraint objects.

   $constraint->constraint
       Returns the type's constraint, as provided to the constructor.

   $constraint->get_message($value)
       This generates a method for the given value. If the type does not have an explicit message, we generate a default message.

   $constraint->has_message
       Returns true if the type has a message.

   $constraint->message
       Returns the type's message as a subroutine reference.

   $constraint->coercion
       Returns the type's Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion object, if one exists.

   $constraint->has_coercion
       Returns true if the type has a coercion.

   $constraint->can_be_inlined
       Returns true if this type constraint can be inlined. A type constraint which subtypes an inlinable constraint and does not add an additional constraint "inherits" its parent type's inlining.

   $constraint->create_child_type(%options)
       This returns a new type constraint of the same class using the provided %options. The "parent" option will be the current type.

       This method exists so that subclasses of this class can override this behavior and change how child types are created.
