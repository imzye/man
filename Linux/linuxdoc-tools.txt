NAME
       sgml2info - create GNU info output from a LinuxDoc DTD SGML source file

SYNOPSIS
       sgml2info [generic-option...]  file[.sgml]

DESCRIPTION
       sgml2info  is an old and obsoleted form of the info converter command of LinuxDoc-Tools (its name may be misleading, as it is not a tool for any SGML DTD, only supports the SGML LinuxDoc DTD).  It
       is recommended to switch the new form linuxdoc -B info now.  This converts a LinuxDoc DTD SGML source file to GNU info format.  Output will appear in file.info where file is the name of  the  SGML
       source file.

       The attribute/value pair "output=info" is set for conditionals.

OPTIONS
       sgml2info accepts all the generic options described in linuxdoc(1).

       file   specifies the SGML source file, named either file or file.sgml

FILES
       Many files and executables in /usr/share/linuxdoc-tools are used.
