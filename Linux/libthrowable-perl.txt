NAME
       Throwable - a role for classes that can be thrown

VERSION
       version 1.001

SYNOPSIS
         package Redirect;
         # NOTE: Moo can also be used here instead of Moose
         use Moose;
         with 'Throwable';

         has url => (is => 'ro');

       ...then later...

         Redirect->throw({ url => $url });

DESCRIPTION
       Throwable is a role for classes that are meant to be thrown as exceptions to standard program flow.  It is very simple and does only two things: saves any previous value for $@ and calls "die
       $self".

       Throwable is implemented with Moo, so you can stick to Moo or use Moose, as you prefer.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

ATTRIBUTES
   previous_exception
       This attribute is created automatically, and stores the value of $@ when the Throwable object is created.  This is done on a best effort basis.  $@ is subject to lots of spooky action-at-a-
       distance.  For now, there are clearly ways that the previous exception could be lost.

METHODS
   throw
         Something::Throwable->throw({ attr => $value });

       This method will call new, passing all arguments along to new, and will then use the created object as the only argument to "die".

       If called on an object that does Throwable, the object will be rethrown.

   new_with_previous
         die Something::Throwable->new_with_previous({ attr => $value });

       Constructs an exception object and return it, while trying to make sure that any values in $@ are safely stored in "previous_exception" without being stomped by evals in the construction process.

       This is more reliable than calling "new" directly, but doesn't include the forced "die" in "throw".
