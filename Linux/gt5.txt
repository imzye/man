NAME
       gt5 - a diff-capable 'du-browser'

SYNOPSIS
       gt5 [ dir | file | dir file | file file2 ] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       gt5 reads the output of du, compares it with a du-log saved by the last run, converts it into HTML and opens the resulting file with a textbrowser.

       If  files are given on the commandline they are expected to be (optionally gzip/bzip2-compressed) logfiles of du -akx /some/dir.  It is up to you to take care that the given directories/files rep‐
       resent the same directory.  gt5 will show lots of new files if you don't. ;-)

OPTIONS
       --cut-at float
              Files and directories that are below float percent of their parents are not shown.  Default is 0.1, gt5 will accept values between 0.01 and 30.

       --debug
              Turn on debug. Generate HTML files and do not run browser.

       --diff-dir directory
              Use directory instead of ~/.gt5-diffs/ to read/store du-logs.  This switch is ignored if gt5 is only used with files.

       --discard
              Do not save the current state, in other words: be able to diff against the old state again.  This feature is disabled if gt5 is only used with files.

       --help Display brief help.

       --link-files
              Also insert links to files to access them from within gt5.  This can be very handy if your browser is configured to handle the files MIME-type correctly.  This feature is disabled if gt5 is
              only used with files.

       --max-depth int
              Do not show anything below a depth of int directories. Default is 5 (also see BUGS below).

       --max-lines int
              Only consider the int biggest files and directories within the output of du.

       --no-diffs
              Use this if you are not interested in the history of the directories processed, for example in /tmp.

       --save-as file
              DEPRECATED, use du -akx or du -ak (see --with-mounts), save the output to a file and run gt5 against one (ore two) of these files later.

       --save-state
              Force saving current state, overwriting a previous --discard.  (Some people seem to have gt5 aliased to 'gt5 --discard'.)

       --verbose
              Display messages.

       --with-mounts
              By default gt5 calls du with -akx to ignore mounted filesystems. Use this to inspect mounted partitions too, i.e. call du with -ak

HELPERS
       If gawk or a textbrowser are missing and you want to install them into ~/bin (or /usr/local/bin if you have write access there), gt5 comes with the following helpers:

       --get-gawk
              Download, compile and install a copy of gawk.

       --get-links
              Download, compile and install a copy of links.

       --get-links2
              Download, compile and install a copy of links2.

       --get-elinks
              Download, compile and install a copy of elinks.

TEXTBROWSERS
       It is recommended to use links with gt5.  Other textbrowsers are also possible but there are several good reasons why links is given priority over the others:

       elinks:
              links is much faster on startup/exit

       lynx:  does not honor a documents coloring

       netrik:
              no colors, unfavourable cursor navigation

       retawq:
              no colors, can't handle <a name>-tags

       w3m:   Version 0.5.2 and later are known to work. Older versions experienced unfavourable handling of <a name>-tag, unfavourable cursor navigation and no colors

       Only links/links2, elinks and lynx are now considered usable (and also chosen in that order). See ENVIRONMENT/GT5_BROWSER below.

FILES
       ~/.gt5.html
              contains a copy of the last run
       ~/.gt5-diffs/
              compressed du-logs are stored here

ENVIRONMENT
       GT5_BROWSER
              force using a (specific) textbrowser

       GT5_CHARSET
              force using a (specific) charset for HTML header instead of using $LANG

       GT5_DEBUG_DIR
              Directory where to write gt5.debug* data if --debug option is set.

BUGS
       Directories at depth max-depth are not browsable and so look like files.
