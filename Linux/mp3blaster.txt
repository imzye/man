NAME
       nmixer - An interactive text-based sound-mixer control program

SYNOPSIS
       nmixer [-q] [[-s mixdev=setting] ...]
              nasmixer [-q] [[-s mixdev=setting] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       NMixer  is an interactive text-based sound-mixer control program that you can use to set the volume of each supported mixer device of your soundcard.  It automagically detects all devices that are
       supported by your sound hardware, and shows a list of scrollbars for each of these devices.

       You can use the up and down arrow keys (or k and j resp.) to scroll though the list of scrollbars (some do not fit on the screen, but you can reach them by simply scrolling down at the  bottom  of
       the  screen).  The  left and right arrow keys (or h and l resp.) change the volume for the currently highlighted device, and (if you're lucky), you can use home/end/PgUp/PgDn on the numerical key‐
       board to set left and right volume independently. You can also use 0..5 to set the volume to the position indicated by the numbers on top of the screen.

       If a device can be recorded from, red brackets will be displayed under the device's name. If it's selected as recording source, a red 'X' is displayed as well. You can set a recording device  with
       the space bar.

       If nmixer is compiled with NAS (Network Audio System) support and it's called as 'nasmixer', it will show the settings for the NAS mixer device.

OPTIONS
       -d device
              Setst the mixer device to use (default = /dev/mixer) -s mixdev=setting Sets a specific mixer device to the volume specified by setting.  Example: bass=100

       -q     Immediately quit (after the command-line specified settings are set!). This only makes sense if you use command-line options to set volumes. (currently, the interface is drawn while setting
              the mixer, and removed afterwards, which might be annoying, but it's in the way of being changed :)

BUGS
       If you find bugs, please report them on the sourceforge project site.
