NAME
       adequate - Debian package quality testing tool

SYNOPSIS
       adequate [options] package-name...

       adequate [options] --all

       adequate [options] --apt-preinst

       adequate [options] --pending

       adequate --list-tags

       adequate --help

DESCRIPTION
       adequate checks packages installed on the system and reports bugs and policy violations.

OPTIONS
       --all

              Run checks against all the installed packages.

       --tags tag1[,tag2...]

              Emit only these tags.

       --tags -tag1[,tag2...]

              Don't emit these tags.

       --debconf

              Report issues via debconf(7).

       --fail

              Exit with status 2 if at least one tag was emitted

       --root directory

              Change the root directory (using chroot(2)).

       --user user[:group]

              Switch user and group before running any checks.  This is most useful together with --root or --pending which require superuser privileges.

       --apt-preinst

              Read APT configuration and .deb filenames from stdin, and append packages names to /var/lib/adequate/pending for later processing (see --pending).

              This option is used internally by the APT hook. The hook is disabled by default; please edit /apt/apt.conf.d/20adequate to enable it.

       --pending

              Run checks against packages listed in /var/lib/adequate/pending, then empty the file.

       --list-tags

              List all tag names and exit.

       --help

              Display help and exit.

TAGS
       bin-or-sbin-binary-requires-usr-lib-library

              This package ships a binary in /bin or /sbin that requires a library in /usr/lib.  Obsolete as of https://wiki.debian.org/UsrMerge

       broken-binfmt-detector

              The detector registered with update-binfmts(8) does not exist.

       broken-binfmt-interpreter

              The interpreter registered with update-binfmts(8) does not exist.

       broken-symlink

              This package ships a symlink which points to a non-existent file.

       incompatible-licenses

              Licenses of the libraries the binary is linked to are incompatible. Obsolete as of adequate version 0.16.19

       invalid-dbus-user-or-group

              A D-Bus configuration file specifies an invalid user or group.

       invalid-systemd-user-or-group

              A systemd service unit script specifies an invalid user or group.

       invalid-sysvinit-user-or-group

              A sysvinit script specifies an invalid user or group.

       ldd-failure

              Running "ldd -r" on the file failed unexpectedly.  This is most likely a bug in libc or adequate itself.

              https://bugs.debian.org/710521

       library-not-found

              The binary is linked with a library, which cannot be found.

              Debian Policy §8.6

       missing-alternative

              This  package is a provider of the virtual package x-terminal-emulator, but it doesn't register itself as an alternative for /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator; or it is a provider of the virtual
              package x-window-manager, but it doesn't register itself as an alternative for /usr/bin/x-window-manager.

              Debian Policy §11.8.3, Debian Policy §11.8.4

       missing-copyright-file

              The copyright file for this package is missing.  This often happens if /usr/share/doc// was a real directory in a previous version of the package, but it's now a  symlink;  dpkg  never  re‐
              places directory with a symlink to a directory.

              Debian Policy §12.5, §6.6

       missing-pkgconfig-dependency

              Dependency of a pkg-config (.pc) file shipped by this package couldn't be satisfied.

              Debian Policy §8.4

       missing-symbol-version-information

              The binary uses versioned symbols, but the library provides only unversioned ones.

       obsolete-conffile

              The current version of this package no longer ships a conffile (that used to be included in the past).  However, the conffile hasn't been removed on upgrade.

              https://wiki.debian.org/DpkgConffileHandling, dpkg-maintscript-helper(1)

       program-name-collision

              This package ships a program with the same name as another program.

              Debian Policy §10.1

       py-file-not-bytecompiled

              This package ships Python modules that are not byte-compiled.

              Python Policy §2.6

       pyshared-file-not-bytecompiled

              This package ships Python modules in /usr/share/pyshared that are not byte-compiled.

              Python Policy §2.6, §1.5

       symbol-size-mismatch

              The  symbol has changed size since the package was built.  It might be an indication that the library broke ABI.  If ABI wasn't broken, and the library bumped shlibs (or symbols), the pack‐
              age should be binNMUed.

       undefined-symbol

              The symbol has not been found in the libraries linked with the binary.  Either the binary either needs to be linked with an additional shared library, or the dependency on  the  shared  li‐
              brary package that provides this symbol is too weak.

              Debian Policy §3.5, §8.6, §10.2

EXAMPLES
       adequate coreutils

              Check the coreutils package.

       adequate --tags obsolete-conffile --all

              Check all the packages for obsolete conffiles.

       adequate --tags -py-file-not-bytecompiled,pyshared-file-not-bytecompiled --all

              Check all the packages, ignoring Python bytecompilation issues.

EXIT STATUS
              0    if no tags were emitted or --fail was not set

              1    on invalid invocation

              2    if at least one tag was emitted and --fail was set

REPORTING BUGS
       If you report a bug that was found by adequate, please use the following usertags:

              User: debian-qa@lists.debian.org

              Usertags: adequate tag-name

       Please  keep  in mind that adequate is not perfect; therefore false positives are possible. Don't report the bug unless you understand the underlying problem.  When in doubt, please ask at debian-
       qa@lists.debian.org first.
