NAME
       fitscopy - copy FITS files with optional filtering

SYNOPSIS
       fitscopy inputfile outputfile

DESCRIPTION
       Copy  an input file to an output file, optionally filtering the file in the process. This seemingly simple program can apply powerful filters which transform the input file as it is being copied. Fil‐
       ters may be used to extract a subimage from a larger image, select rows from a table, filter a table with a GTI time extension or a SAO region file, create or delete columns in a table, create an  im‐
       age by binning (histogramming) 2 table columns, and convert IRAF format *.imh or raw binary data files into FITS images.

EXAMPLES
       simple file copy
              fitscopy in.fit out.fit

       stdin to stdout
              fitscopy - -

       copy a subimage
              fitscopy in.fit[11:50,21:60] out.fit

       IRAF image to FITS
              fitscopy iniraf.imh out.fit

       raw array to FITS
              fitscopy in.dat[i512,512] out.fit

       copy rows with pi>35
              fitscopy in.fit[events][pi>35] out.fit

       bin an image
              fitscopy in.fit[events][bin X,Y] out.fit

       new x column
              fitscopy in.fit[events][col x=.9*y] out.fit

       time filter
              fitscopy in.fit[events][gtifilter()] out.fit

       spatial filter
              fitscopy in.fit[2][regfilter("pow.reg")] out.fit

       Note that it may be necessary to enclose the input file name in single quote characters on the Unix command line.
