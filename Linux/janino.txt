NAME
       Janino - a runtime Java Compiler.

SYNOPSIS
       janinoc [options] source-file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Janino is a compiler that reads a Java expression, block, class body, source file or a set of source files, and generates Java bytecode that is loaded and executed directly. Janino is not intended
       to be a development tool, but an embedded compiler for run-time compilation purposes, e.g. expression evaluators or "server pages" engines like JSP.

       janinoc is a front-end that compiles all specified input files.
