NAME
       HTML::Escape - Extremely fast HTML escaping

SYNOPSIS
           use HTML::Escape qw/escape_html/;

           my $escaped = escape_html("<^o^>");

DESCRIPTION
       This modules provides a function which escapes HTML's special characters. It performs a similar function to PHP's htmlspecialchars.  It escapes the following characters:

           " & ' < > ` { }

       This module uses XS for better performance, but it also provides a pure perl version.

FAQ
       Is there also an unescape_html?
           No. Unescaping HTML requires a lot of code, and we don't want to do it.  Please use HTML::Entities for it.
