DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the delrconsole command.

       delrconsole  removes  a  remote  console user; it kills any remote console instance running for the user, deletes the configuration and logs for the user and
       then finally removes the user account. It runs as an interactive script and requests a username.
