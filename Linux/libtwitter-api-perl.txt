NAME
       Twitter::API::Trait::RetryOnError - Automatically retry API calls on error

VERSION
       version 1.0006

SYNOPSIS
           use Twitter::API;

           my $client = Twitter::API->new_with_options(
               traits => [ qw/ApiMethods RetryOnError/ ],
               %other_optons
           );

           my $statuses = $client->home_timeline;

DESCRIPTION
       With this trait applied, Twitter::API automatically retries API calls that result in an HTTP status code of 500 or greater. These errors often indicate a temporary problem, either on Twitter's
       end, locally, or somewhere in between.  By default, it retries up to 5 times. The initial retry is delayed by 250ms.  Additional retries double the delay time until the maximum delay is reached
       (default: 4 seconds). Twitter::API throws a "Twitter::API::Error" exception when it receives a permanent error (HTTP status code below 500), or the maximum number of retries has been reached.

       For non-blocking applications, set a suitable "retry_delay_code" callback.  This attribute can also be used to provided retry logging.

ATTRIBUTES
   initial_retry_delay
       Amount of time to delay before the initial retry. Specified in fractional seconds. Default: 0.25 (250ms).

   max_retry_delay
       Maximum delay between retries, specified in fractional seconds. Default: 4.0.

   retry_delay_multiplier
       After the initial delay, the delay time is multiplied by this factor to progressively back off allowing more time for the transient condition to resolve. However, the delay never exceeds
       "max_retry_delay". Default: 2.0.

   max_retries
       Maximum number of times to retry on error. Default: 5.

   retry_delay_code
       A coderef, called to implement a delay. It takes a single parameter, the number of seconds to delay. E.g., 0.25. The default implementation is simply:

           sub { Time::HiRes::sleep(shift) }
