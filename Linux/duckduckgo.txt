NAME
       duckduckgo - Command line tool to use the DuckDuckGo API

VERSION
       version 0.008

SYNPOSIS
         duckduckgo facebook

         duckduckgo --batch facebook

         duckduckgo duck duck go

   DESCRIPTION
       This application queries the DuckDuckGo API
       <http://www.duckduckgo.com/api.html> and displays the result in a nice
       human-readable way or in a batch mode which could be used by a
       shellscript to automatically work with the DuckDuckGo API results.

       The --batch parameter tells the application to display the data in a
       more machine readable form.

       The --forcesecure parameter tells the application to not fall back to
       http if the https request failed.

       The startup of the application takes some milliseconds longer cause of
       the compile overhead by Moose. If you want to use a huge bunch of
       queries, you should consider Learning Perl <http://learn.perl.org/>,
       best directly the modern way with the free Modern Perl Book
       <http://www.onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/index.html> available as PDF
       <http://www.onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/modern_perl_letter.pdf>.
       Then you can use the distribution WWW::DuckDuckGo directly todo faster
       a bigger amount of queries
