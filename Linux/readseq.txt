READSEQ(1)                                                                                General Commands Manual                                                                                READSEQ(1)

NAME
       readseq - Reads and writes nucleic/protein sequences in various formats

SYNOPSIS
       readseq [-options] in.seq > out.seq

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the readseq command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it
       has documentation in text form, see below.

       readseq reads and writes biosequences (nucleic/protein) in various formats.  Data files may have multiple sequences.  readseq is particularly useful as it automatically detects many sequence  for‐
       mats, and interconverts among them.

FORMATS
       Formats which readseq currently understands:

         * IG/Stanford, used by Intelligenetics and others
         * GenBank/GB, genbank flatfile format
         * NBRF format
         * EMBL, EMBL flatfile format
         * GCG, single sequence format of GCG software
         * DNAStrider, for common Mac program
         * Fitch format, limited use
         * Pearson/Fasta, a common format used by Fasta programs and others
         * Zuker format, limited use. Input only.
         * Olsen, format printed by Olsen VMS sequence editor. Input only.
         * Phylip3.2, sequential format for Phylip programs
         * Phylip, interleaved format for Phylip programs (v3.3, v3.4)
         * Plain/Raw, sequence data only (no name, document, numbering)
         + MSF multi sequence format used by GCG software
         + PAUP's multiple sequence (NEXUS) format
         + PIR/CODATA format used by PIR
         + ASN.1 format used by NCBI
         + Pretty print with various options for nice looking output. Output only.
         + LinAll format, limited use (LinAll and ConStruct programs)
         + Vienna format used by ViennaRNA programs

       See the included "Formats" file for detail on file formats.
