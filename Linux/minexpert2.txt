NAME
       mineXpert2           —             Open mass spectrometric data files of a wide variety of formats, visualize and mine data graphically

SYNOPSIS
       minexpert2 [options]  [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mineXpert2 software.

       This  program  can  be  used to load mass spectrometry data files and show the spectral data in a variety of graphical representations like plots, color maps.  Any plot or color map can serve as a
       starting point for a mass data integration, like integrating a region of a TIC chromatogram to a mass spectrum or to a drift spectrum.

       Integrations can be performed in any direction, like from a RT|MZ color map to a TIC chromatogram, for example, or from a drift spectrum to a TIC chromatogram.

       The mineXpert2 program allows the user to perform the following tasks:

          •  Open mass spectrometry data files (mzML, mzXML, asc, xy, ...);

          •  Display in a table view the full data set, for easy filtering;

          •  Calculate and display the TIC chromatogram;

          •  Calculate and display a mz=f(rt) color map;

          •  For mobility data, calculate and display a mz=f(dt) color map;

          •  Integrate the mass spectrometric data from any kind of data representation (mass | drift spectra, TIC | XIC chromatogram, JD color maps) to any other kind of data representation;

          •  For any mass data feature (mass peak, TIC | XIC peak, color map) integrate to a XIC single intensity value);

          •  Powerful isotopic cluster calculation starting from a chemical formula, optionally with user-defined isotopic abundance ratios;

          •  Gaussian fit over any isotopic cluster to estimate the average mass of a given ion;

          •  Mouse-driven deconvolution of m/z data (charge envelope-based or isotopic cluster-based);

          •  Export the data to text files;

          •  Export the graphical representation of mass spectrometric data to graphics files of a number of formats (jpg, png, pdf).

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
                 Displays detailed usage information and exits.

       -c | --config
                 Display program configuration at build time and the Qt version used to build it.

       -V | --Version
                 Print the version of the software program along the with version of the Qt libraries used to build it.

       -l | --license
                 Print the license of this software.

       -s | --streamed
                 When opening one or more files in the gui, do that in streamed mode, otherwise in full.

       -j | --scriptFile <filename>
                 Start the program and immediately run the JavaScript script.

       filename ...
                 One or more names of files to be opened.
