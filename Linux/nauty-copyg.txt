NAME
       nauty-copyg - convert format and select subset

SYNOPSIS
       copyg [-gszfp#:#qhx] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Copy a file of graphs with possible format conversion.

       -g     Use graph6 format for output

       -s     Use sparse6 format for output

       -z     Use digraph6 format for output

       -i     Use incremental sparse6 format for output

              In the absence of -g, -s, -z or -i, the format depends on the header or, if none, the first input line.  As an exception, digraphs are always written in digraph6.

       -p# -p#:#

              Specify range of input lines (first is 1) This can fail if the input has incremental lines.

       -f     With -p, assume input lines of fixed length

              (ignored if header or first line has sparse6 format).

       -I#    Have at most this number of incremental steps

       in a row.
              Implies -i.

       -h     Write a header.

       -x     Don't write a header.

              In the absence of -h and -x, a header is written if there is one in the input.

       -q     Suppress auxiliary output.
