NAME
       hyperspace - Flying through hyper space.

SYNOPSIS
       hyperspace [--root/-r] [--maxfps/-x number] [--vsync/-y number] [--dpms/-M number] [--speed/-s number] [--stars/-S number] [--starsize/-t number] [--resolution/-R number] [--depth/-d number] [--fov/-f
       number] [--no-shader/-H]

DESCRIPTION
       From Terry Walsh (http://reallyslick.com): "This is a real number cruncher of a screensaver. Computers are getting much more powerful these days, and my old savers don't bring them to their knees like
       they used to. This one does. Of course, you can still turn the settings way down if you have a pathetic, old computer."

       Ported to Linux by Tugrul Galatali.
