NAME
       Math::Fibonacci - Fibonacci numbers.

VERSION
           $Revision: 1.5 $

SYNOPSIS
           use Math::Fibonacci qw(term series decompose);

           my $term = term ( 42 );
           my @series = series ( 42 );
           my @sum = decompose ( 65535 );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a few functions related to Fibonacci numbers.

EXPORTS ON REQUEST
       term(), series() decompose(), isfibonacci()

FUNCTIONS
       term($n)
           Returns the $n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence. The term is computed using the fast algorithm: "F(n) ~ g^n/sqrt(5)", where g is the golden ratio and ~ means "take the nearest integer".

       series($n)
           Computes and returns the first $n Fibonacci numbers.

       decompose($int)
           Decomposes $int into the sum of Fibonacci numbers. Returns the list of Fibonacci numbers.

       isfibonacci($int)
           Returns the sequence number of $int if it is a Fibonacci number or a non-true value if it is not.
