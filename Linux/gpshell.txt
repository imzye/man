NAME
       gpshell - command line tool for the management of GlobalPlatform compliant smart cards

SYNOPSIS
       gpshell scriptfile

DESCRIPTION
       gpshell  can  manage applications on smart cards supporting the GlobalPlatform.  This comprises the installation and deletion of applications, getting the applications status and card data.  These
       applications are practical always Java Card applets.  Additional key management commands are provided.

       The most common way to use gpshell is a script file.  But it is also possible to read the commands from stdin if no script file is provided.

       Within a script environment variables can be accessed with the syntax ${ENV_VAR_NAME}.

       Reading the commands from stdin allows one to feed in the commands dynamically and use conditionals when using the Expect pattern.  Tools are available for a variety of  script  languages,  shells
       and programming languages.  Example are to support environment variables and handle results and output conditionally.

       There are several txt example scripts provided which gets installed into /usr/share/doc/gpshell/examples/ that can also be found online.

COMMANDS
       #      Start a line with a comment.

       //     Starts a line with a comment.

       mode_201
              Set protocol mode to OpenPlatform 2.0.1.  This is the default.

       mode_211
              Set protocol mode to GlobalPlatform 2.1.1 and later

       visa_key_derivation
              For cards which use the VISA key derivation scheme for the key calculation, like GemXpresso Pro, Palmera Protect or some JCOP cards this must be set.

       emv_cps11_key_derivation
              For cards which uses the EMV CPS 1.1 key derivation scheme for the key calculation, like a Sm@rtCafe Expert 3.0 this must be set.

       enable_trace
              Enable APDU trace

       You  will see the sent APDUs in clear text.  The last two bytes of the response are the response code.  A response code of 9000 means success, otherwise the response code indicates an error.  This
       may be OK when deleting a non existing applet or package.

       enable_timer
              Enable the logging of the execution times of commands.

       establish_context
              Establish context.  This must always be executed before connecting to a card.

       list_readers
              List the card readers.

       card_connect -reader readerName -protocol protocol
              Connect to card in the reader with readerName.  By default protocol is 0 = T0.

       card_connect -readerNumber x -protocol protocol
              Connect to card in the x th reader in the system.  By default protocol is 0 = T0.

       open_sc -keyind x -keyver x -key key -mac_key mac-key -enc_key enc-key -kek_key kek-key -security securityLevel -scp protocol -scpimpl impl -keyDerivation derivation
              Open a secure channel

       For OpenPlatform 2.0.1’ cards only -keyind -keyver -mac_key and -enc_key are necessary.

       For GlobalPlatform 2.1.1 and later cards -scp and -scpimpl should not be necessary to supply.  You must also specify -kek_key.

       If the card supports a Secure Channel Protocol Implementation with only one base key, specify this key with -key and omit the others.

       If the card uses a key derivation mechanism you must enable the derivation mode with the -keyDerivation option and you must specify with -key the  master  (mother)  key.   -kek_key,  -mac_key  and
       -enc_key are not relevant is this case.  See the section Options and Key Derivation.  NOTE: If the secure channel is going to be opened when no security domain is selected then the command get_se‐
       cure_channel_protocol_details must be executed before to be able to get the Secure Channel Protocol Implementation.

       -keyDerivation derivation method
              Possible values are none, visa1, visa2 or emvcps11

       Choose visa2 if you have a card which uses the VISA key derivation scheme for the key calculation, like GemXpresso Pro or some JCOP cards you must set this.

       Choose emvcps11 If you have a card which uses the EMV CPS 1.1 key derivation scheme for the key calculation, like a Sm@rtCafe Expert 3.0 and later you must set this.  Also for put_sc_key  this  is
       necessary for Sm@rtcafe 5.0 (and earlier(?)) cards

       visa1 is an old VISA key derivation scheme and is only needed for older cards.

ENVIRONMENT
       GLOBALPLATFORM_DEBUG
              Enables debugging output from the underlying GlobalPlatform library.

       GLOBALPLATFORM_LOGFILE
              Sets the log file name for the debugging output.

Key Derivation
       visa2  For the VISA2 key derivation scheme, like used in a GemXpresso Pro or some JCOP cards.

       emvcps11
              For the key derivation according to EMV CPS 1.1 (CDK (CPG 2.04)), like Sm@rtCafe Expert 3.0 and later.

       Known unsupported key derivation schemes are:

Misc
   About install_for_load and install
       For CosmopoliC 64K (tested on V5.2), you need to specify the Security Domain AID.  For example,

              install -file helloworld.cap -sdAID A000000003000000 -nvCodeLimit 4000

       For GemXpresso R3.2 E64, you need to specify the Security Domain AID (Card Manager AID).  For example,

              install -file helloworld.cap -sdAID A000000018434D00 -nvCodeLimit 4000

   JCOP cards
       If you cannot authenticate to your card it might be not fused.  In this case you need the transport key from the vendor.  Execute the JCOP IDENTIFY command.

       select -aid A000000167413000FF Offset 14 (decimal) of the response has the pre-personalized state.  00h means not fused (not personalized), 01h means fused.

   CyberFlex cards
       For  the  Cyberflex  you also need the CAP transformer (I believe this is a kind of obfuscator) which you must apply to the CAP file.  Download it from http://www.trusted-logic.fr/down.php and use
       it.

BUGS
       JCOP 10
              install_for_load fails for unknown reason, so nothing can be installed.

       Some cards are not supporting the GET DATA command.  This command is used by GPShell for retrieving the secure channel parameters.  So you have to pass -scp 2 -scpimpl 0x15 to open_sc command.
