NAME
       telnetd — DARPA TELNET protocol server

SYNOPSIS
       telnetd [options ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  telnetd  command  is a server which supports the DARPA standard TELNET virtual terminal protocol.  telnetd is normally invoked by the internet server (see inetd(8)) for requests to connect to
       the TELNET port as indicated by the /etc/services file (see services(5)).

OPTIONS
       The telnetd command accepts the following options:

       -a, --authmode authmode
                    This option may be used for specifying what mode should be used for authentication.  Note that this option  is  only  useful  if  telnetd  has  been  compiled  with  support  for  the
                    AUTHENTICATION option.  There are several valid values for authmode:

                    user   Only  allow  connections  when  the remote user can provide valid authentication information to identify the remote user, and is allowed access to the specified account without
                           providing a password.

                    valid  Only allow connections when the remote user can provide valid authentication information to identify the remote user.  The login(1) command will  provide  any  additional  user
                           verification needed if the remote user is not allowed automatic access to the specified account.

                    other  Only  allow  connections  that supply some authentication information.  This option is currently not supported by any of the existing authentication mechanisms, and is thus the
                           same as specifying -a valid.

                    none   This is the default state.  Authentication information is not required.  If no or insufficient authentication information is provided, then the login(1)  program  will  provide
                           the necessary user verification.

                    off    This disables the authentication code.  All user verification will happen through the login(1) program.

       -S, --server-principal name
                    Set the Kerberos principal name for this server instance, with or without an explicit realm.

       -X, --disable-auth-type authtype
                    This option is only valid if telnetd has been built with support for the authentication option.  It disables the use of authtype authentication, and can be used to temporarily disable
                    a specific authentication type without having to recompile telnetd.

       -D, --debug [debugmode]
                    This  option  may be used for debugging purposes.  This allows telnetd to print out debugging information to the connection, allowing the user to see what telnetd is doing.  There are
                    several possible values for debugmode:

                    options   Prints information about the negotiation of TELNET options.

                    report    Prints the options information, plus some additional information about what processing is going on.

                    netdata   Displays the data stream received by telnetd.

                    ptydata   Displays data written to the pty.

                    auth      Displays authentication information.

                    encr      Displays encryption information.

       -E, --exec-login string
                    Set the program to be executed instead of /bin/login.

       -h, --no-hostinfo
                    Disables the printing of host-specific information before login has been completed.

       -l, --linemode [mode]
                    Specifies line mode.  Tries to force clients to use line- at-a-time mode.  If mode is nokludge, then automatic klugde linemode will be disabled.  If the LINEMODE option  is  not  sup‐
                    ported, it will go into kludge linemode.

       -n, --no-keepalive
                    Disable  TCP  keep-alives.   Normally telnetd enables the TCP keep-alive mechanism to probe connections that have been idle for some period of time to determine if the client is still
                    there, so that idle connections from machines that have crashed or can no longer be reached may be cleaned up.

       -U, --reverse-lookup
                    This option causes telnetd to refuse connections from addresses that cannot be mapped back into a symbolic name via the gethostbyaddr(3) routine.

       -?, --help   Display a help list.

       --usage      Display a short usage message.

       -V, --version
                    Display program version.

OPERATION
       telnetd operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device (see pty(4)) for a client, then creating a login process which has the slave side of  the  pseudo-terminal  as  stdin,  stdout  and  stderr.
       telnetd manipulates the master side of the pseudo-terminal, implementing the TELNET protocol and passing characters between the remote client and the login process.

       When a TELNET session is started up, telnetd sends TELNET options to the client side indicating a willingness to do the following TELNET options, which are described in more detail below:

             DO AUTHENTICATION
             WILL ENCRYPT
             DO TERMINAL TYPE
             DO TSPEED
             DO XDISPLOC
             DO NEW-ENVIRON
             DO ENVIRON
             WILL SUPPRESS GO AHEAD
             DO ECHO
             DO LINEMODE
             DO NAWS
             WILL STATUS
             DO LFLOW
             DO TIMING-MARK

       The pseudo-terminal allocated to the client is configured to operate in “cooked” mode, and with XTABS and CRMOD enabled (see tty(4)).

       telnetd has support for enabling locally the following TELNET options:

       WILL ECHO          When the LINEMODE option is enabled, a WILL ECHO or WONT ECHO will be sent to the client to indicate the current state of terminal echoing.  When terminal echo is not desired, a
                          WILL  ECHO  is  sent  to indicate that telnetd will take care of echoing any data that needs to be echoed to the terminal, and then nothing is echoed.  When terminal echo is de‐
                          sired, a WONT ECHO is sent to indicate that telnetd will not be doing any terminal echoing, so the client should do any terminal echoing that is needed.

       WILL BINARY        Indicates that the client is willing to send a 8 bits of data, rather than the normal 7 bits of the Network Virtual Terminal.

       WILL SGA           Indicates that it will not be sending IAC GA, go ahead, commands.

       WILL STATUS        Indicates a willingness to send the client, upon request, of the current status of all TELNET options.

       WILL TIMING-MARK   Whenever a DO TIMING-MARK command is received, it is always responded to with a WILL TIMING-MARK

       WILL LOGOUT        When a DO LOGOUT is received, a WILL LOGOUT is sent in response, and the TELNET session is shut down.

       WILL ENCRYPT       Only sent if telnetd is compiled with support for data encryption, and indicates a willingness to decrypt the data stream.

       telnetd has support for enabling remotely the following TELNET options:

       DO BINARY          Sent to indicate that telnetd is willing to receive an 8 bit data stream.

       DO LFLOW           Requests that the client handle flow control characters remotely.

       DO ECHO            This is not really supported, but is sent to identify a 4.2BSD telnet(1) client, which will improperly respond with WILL ECHO. If a WILL ECHO is received, a DONT  ECHO  will  be
                          sent in response.

       DO TERMINAL-TYPE   Indicates a desire to be able to request the name of the type of terminal that is attached to the client side of the connection.

       DO SGA             Indicates that it does not need to receive IAC GA, the go ahead command.

       DO NAWS            Requests that the client inform the server when the window (display) size changes.

       DO TERMINAL-SPEED  Indicates a desire to be able to request information about the speed of the serial line to which the client is attached.

       DO XDISPLOC        Indicates a desire to be able to request the name of the X windows display that is associated with the telnet client.

       DO NEW-ENVIRON     Indicates a desire to be able to request environment variable information, as described in RFC 1572.

       DO ENVIRON         Indicates a desire to be able to request environment variable information, as described in RFC 1408.

       DO LINEMODE        Only sent if telnetd is compiled with support for linemode, and requests that the client do line by line processing.

       DO TIMING-MARK     Only  sent if telnetd is compiled with support for both linemode and kludge linemode, and the client responded with WONT LINEMODE. If the client responds with WILL TM, the it is
                          assumed that the client supports kludge linemode.  Note that the [-k] option can be used to disable this.

       DO AUTHENTICATION  Only sent if telnetd is compiled with support for authentication, and indicates a willingness to receive authentication information for automatic login.

       DO ENCRYPT         Only sent if telnetd is compiled with support for data encryption, and indicates a willingness to decrypt the data stream.

BUGS
       Some TELNET commands are only partially implemented.

       Because of bugs in the original 4.2 BSD telnet(1), telnetd performs some dubious protocol exchanges to try to discover if the remote client is, in fact, a 4.2 BSD telnet(1).

       Binary mode has no common interpretation except between similar operating systems (Unix in this case).

       The terminal type name received from the remote client is converted to lower case.

       telnetd never sends TELNET IAC GA (go ahead) commands.
