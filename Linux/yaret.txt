NAME
       YaRET - Yet another Ripper Encoder Tagger

SYNOPSIS
       yaret [options]
       yaret [--help|--version|--option_only]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the yaret command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       YaRET is a Perl script that automates the ripping, normalization, and encoding of CDs. It supports CDDB very well via the Perl Audio::CD module, and also can work with your favorite ripper/normal‐
       izer/encoder (e.g., cdparanoia, cdda2wav, normalize, etc.) It supports useful features like multiple concurrent encoders and an easy to use configuration file that lets you customize YaRET to your
       taste (such as file naming based on the CDDB information).

       Please  see  your  ~/.yaretrc  file  (auto-generated  at  the  first  time  execution)  as  well  as  the  /usr/share/doc/yaret/README  and  yaretrc  files that came with YaRET (perhaps located in
       /usr/share/yaret/dot-yaretrc) for more information about configuring the many features that YaRET comes with.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       [General]

       -h, --help
              Display this help (also -?)

       --option_only
              Display configuration data

       -f, --include=<file>
              Include this file as configuration data (in addition to ~/.yaretrc and any command line options) (also --conf_file)

       --cddb_file=<file>
              Include this CDDB information in addition to that obtained from the CDDB query (in same format as both --cddb_dump and --cddb_out produce)

       --max_fork=<value>
              Maximum number of normalizers and encoders forked (per type)

       --size_order
              Sorts tracks in order of size, completing smaller ones first.

       [Display]

       --date Display the start/end times

       --color
              Use color

       --alarm

       [Paths and Filenames]

       --root_final=<path>
              Where to place the results

       --root_work=<path>
              Where to work on the results

       --output_name=<pattern>
              How to name the final file

       --output_path=<pattern>
              Path under root_final to place file

       --output_track_num_format=<format>
              Specifies a printf format for the track numbering, e.g. "%02d"

       --output_trans=<regexp>
              Specifies a regular expression that effects the output of what filename is generated, e.g. "tr/ /_/"

       [CDDB Overrides]

       --global==<attr>=<val>
              e.g. ARTIST=Bare Naked Ladies (Make sure to use escapes or quotes) (also --cddb_global)

       --track==<tracknum>=[<attr>=<val> ]*
              e.g. 14=TRACK=Alone ARTIST=Heart (Make sure to use escapes or quotes)

       --cddb_dump=<file>
              Dump cddb information to <file> then exit (no editing, encoding, etc.)

       --cddb_out=<pattern>
              After the entire process is completed, output the cddb information to <pattern>.  This filename works with the same pattern rules as the other output files, however some keyword may may not
              be available. The information saved will reflect any editing.

       --confirm
              Confirm cddb information (also --cddb_confirm) Use --noconfirm to turn off.

       [Ripper]

       -r, --ripper=<label>
              Which ripper to use (cdparanoia and cddawav have already been defined) (also --ripper_use)

       --ripper_command==<label>=<command>
              The <command> associated with <label>

       -d, --device=<device>

       --skip=<tracknumlist>
              Skip these tracks, e.g. 3,10-13 (also --ripper_skip)

       --auto_skip=<seconds>
              Auto skip tracks that do not grow after <seconds> (also --ripper_auto_skip)

       --min_space=<megabytes>

       --normalize_type=<value>
