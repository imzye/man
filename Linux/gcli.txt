NAME
       gcli — gcli configuration file formats

DESCRIPTION
       gcli  has  two different configuration files. A user configuration file that contains default values for gcli and a repository-local configuration that contains sensible default values for a given
       repository. The latter is meant to be checked into the repository and provide these default values to other users as well.

   User Configuration File
       The user configuration file is located in ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/gcli/config.  On most systems this equal to ${HOME}/.config/gcli/config.

       The user configuration file contains definitions for accounts as well as sensible default values for things like an editor.

       The file is structured in sections, each section has a name and consists of a collection of key-value pairs. E.g.:

             section-name {
                     key1 = value 1
                     key2 = value 2
             }

       There must be a section named “defaults” which may contain the following keys:

       editor  Path to a default editor. This might be overridden by the environment variable EDITOR.

       pager   Name of the default pager when interactively displaying large output.  May be overridden by the environment variable PAGER.  If none of the above are specified, less(1) is used as  a  sane
               default pager.

       github-default-account
               Section name of a default GitHub account to use whenever the account is unspecified on the command line or in the environment. See GCLI_ACCOUNT in gcli(1).

       gitlab-default-account
               Section name of a default GitLab account to use whenever the account is unspecified on the command line or in the environment. See GCLI_ACCOUNT in gcli(1).

       gitea-default-account
               Section name of a default Gitea account to use whenever the account is unspecified on the command line or in the environment. See GCLI_ACCOUNT in gcli(1).

       disable-spinner
               Disable the progress spinner in the ui.  gcli uses this when making requests. This can also be set, and overridden with the GCLI_NOSPINNER environment variable.

       url-open-program
               Name of a program in the PATH to open URLs with. Defaults to xdg-open which uses your default web browser. Note that the program name may not contain any arguments. If you need to pass any
               arguments to the program you must write a wrapper script.

       All other sections define accounts for forges. Each of these account definitions have the account name as their section name and may have one or more of the following keys defined:

       forge-type  The type of the forge. May be one of:
                   •   github
                   •   gitlab
                   •   gitea
                   •   bugzilla

       api-base    (optional) Used to override the API base URL of the forge. This is useful for self-hosted instances.  Depending on the “forge-type” the default values are:

                   forge-type    default value
                   github        https://api.github.com
                   gitlab        https://gitlab.com/api/v4
                   gitea         https://codeberg.org/api/v1
                   bugzilla      https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla

       account     (optional) The username used to authenticate at the API.

       token       (optional) A generated application token to use with this account.  The gcli tutorial at https://herrhotzenplotz.de/gcli/tutorial has some documentation on how to generate thes tokens.

   Repository Local Configuration File
       For repository-local configuration you can use a special configuration file. It contains definitions for gcli that are specific to the repository.

       The Repository-local configuration file is located in the root directory of the repository and should be named .gcli.

       It contains a list of key-value pairs. Allowed keys are:

       pr.base      Name of a branch that the changes should be merged into by default.  Usually this is one of master, main or trunk.

       pr.upstream  Name of the upstream repository to submit the pull request to by default.  This is a pair of the format “owner/repository”.

       pr.inhibit-delete-source-branch
                    If defined and set to “yes” this will prevent the pull request source branch to get deleted when merging a pull request by default.

       forge-type   When  hosting  on  multiple  forges this can be set to a type that will be used as a default when other overrides are unspecified. For possible values see the equivalent definition in
                    “User Configuration File”.

EXAMPLES
   User Configuration File
       An example for the user configuration file consisting of both a GitHub and a GitLab account:

       defaults {
               editor=/path/to/ganoooo/emacs
               pager=less
               github-default-account=herrhotzenplotz-gh
               gitlab-default-account=herrhotzenplotz-gitlab
       }

       herrhotzenplotz-gh {
               account=herrhotzenplotz
               token=foobar
               api-base=https://api.github.com
               forge-type=github
       }

       herrhotzenplotz-gl {
               account=herrhotzenplotz
               token=<valid gitlab api token>
               api-base=https://gitlab.com/api/v4
               forge-type=gitlab
       }

       Notice that this allows you to run gcli and force it to use a specific GitLab account. E.g.:

       $ gcli -a herrhotzenplotz-gl issues -a

   Repository-Local Configuration file
       The .gcli file for the gcli project itself looks like this:

       pr.upstream=herrhotzenplotz/gcli
       pr.base=trunk
       pr.inhibit-delete-source-branch=yes
