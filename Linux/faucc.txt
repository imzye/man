SYNOPSIS

       faucc [ -B path ] [ -D MACRO [=def]] [ -E ] [ -I path ] [ -L path ] [ -MD ] [-MF file ] [ -MP ] [ -MT target ] [ -O level ] [ -S ] [ -T script ] [ -U macro ] [ -Wl,arg ] [ -Xlinker arg ]
             [ -b arch ] [ -c ] [ -f arg ] [ -m arch ] [ -nostdlib ] [ -o output ] [ -print-lib-faucc-file-name ] [ --freestanding ] [ --no-stack-protector ] { file ...}

DESCRIPTION
       faucc is a C compiler, that can generate Intel 16 bit or 32 bit Code.

OPTIONS
       faucc tries to mimic the options of gcc. A number of options will be passed to the C preprocessor cpp or to the linker (done via a call to the c-compiler gcc) in unmodified form.

       -B path
           Override the directory prefix where cc1 is looked up with path.

       -D MACRO, -D MACRO=def
           Define MACRO with the optional initial definition def. If def is omitted, it defaults to 1.

       -E
           Only perform preprocessing, but do not run the compiler.

       -I path
           Add path to the include path in which header files are searched.

       -L path
           Add path to the library search path, in which the linker will look for libraries.

       -MD
           Output dependency information while preprocessing.

       -MF, file
           Output dependency information while preprocessing to file.

       -MP,
           When the preprocessor should output dependency information, it will generate PHONY targets for each dependency.

       -MT target
           When the preprocessor should output dependency information, use target as the dependency rule target.

       -O level
           Currently ignored.

       -S
           Output assembly code.

       -T script
           Use script as linker script.

       -U macro
           Undefine a previously defined macro.

       -Wl,arg, -Xlinker arg
           Pass arg to the linker.

       -b arch
           Generate code for arch (either i286 or i386)

       -c
           Perform compilation, but do not link.

       -f arg
           Pass code generation argument arg to the compiler. See the cc1 man page for possible arguments.

       -m arch
           Currently ignored.

       -nostdlib
           With this option, the linker will only search for libraries that are passed as command line arguments.

       -o file
           Write output to file.

       -print-libfaucc-file-name
           Print the full path of the internal compiler library libfaucc.a.

       -static
           Perform static linking.

       --freestanding, --no-stack-protector
           Currently ignored.

EXAMPLES
        faucc -c hello-world.c -o hello-world.o
           Compile the program hello-world.c and output the object as hello-wolrd.o.

        faucc -S -b i286 -o test.s test.c
           Compile the program test.c to 16 bit code and output the assembly listing to test.s, but do not assemble or link the result yet.
