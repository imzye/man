                     prints category

              cddbgenre
                     synonym for category

              all    parse file and dumps to stdout in a form sourceable by the shell

       send [file] address

       Mails file file (or stdin of no file specified) to specified address, using correct format.  Category should be one of blues, classical, country, data, folk, jazz,  newage,  reggae,  rock,  sound‐
       track, misc.

       template [disc-id] [tracks]

       Generates a template (empty) cddb file to stdout.  The command line should be essentially the output of cd-discid.

       query [server] [user] [host] [disc-id] [tracks]

       Looks  up disc on server (should be of form "http://host/cddb/cddb.cgi") remainder of command line is in the same form as that returned by the cd-discid program. Uses wget, so if you need to use a
       proxy then just configure wget to do so. user and host will be used for identifying ourselves to the CDDB server. Outputs response code and entries with matching CDDB entries, if successful,  from
       the CDDB server.

       read [server] [user] [host] [disc-id] [genre]

       Dumps  CDDB entry to stdout. File will contain an extra #CATEGORY= line, which leaves it a valid CDDB file but which will be recognized by parse and send commands. Uses wget, so if you need to use
       a proxy then just configure wget to do so. user and host will be used for identifying ourselves to the CDDB server.
