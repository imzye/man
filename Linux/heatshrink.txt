NAME
       heatshrink - compress/decompress byte streams using LZSS

SYNOPSIS
       heatshrink [-h]

       heatshrink [-e | -d] [-v] [-w SIZE] [-l BITS] [IN_FILE] [OUT_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       heatshrink compresses or decompresses byte streams using LZSS and is designed especially for embedded, low-memory, and/or hard real-time systems.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print help

       -e     Encode (compress, default)

       -d     Decode (decompress)

       -v     Verbose (print input & output sizes, compression ratio, etc.)

       -w SIZE
              Base-2  log of LZSS sliding window size A larger value allows searches a larger history of the data for repeated patterns, potentially compressing more effectively, but will use more memory
              and processing time.  Recommended default: -w 8 (embedded systems), -w 10 (elsewhere)

       -l BITS
              Number of bits used for back-reference lengths.  A larger value allows longer substitutions, but since all back-references must use -w + -l bits, larger -w or -l can be counterproductive if
              most patterns are small and/or local.  Recommended default: -l 4

       If IN_FILE or OUT_FILE are unspecified, they will default to - for standard input and standard output, respectively.
