NAME
       ident2 - An advanced ident daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ident2 [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ident2  is  an  advanced ident daemon, which can run as an inetd service or on it's own. It has various features such as user defined and random replies, extensive logging, and full administrative
       control.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU syntax command-line unless it is unsupported on your system. GNU options begin with two dashes(`-') and have much more descriptive names.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -u, --usage
              Shows example command lines

       -v, --version
              Show version information

       -l, --license
              Show licensing information

       -a, --force-inetd
              Force inetd mode, if autodetection isn't working.

       -d, --force-daemon
              Force standalone daemon, if autodetection isn't working.

       -i, --use-user-ident
              Allow user defined ident replies. Just do a echo 'ident ar' > ~/.ident to change your ident reply.

       -y, --user-reply-file
              File ident2 should look for in user's homedir for replies. Default is ~/.ident

       -n, --allow-noident-file
              Disable replies for user if user has a ~/.noident file. This behavior is disabled by default.

       -o, --client-timeout
              Clients timeout after this many seconds

       -s, --dont-change-uid
              Ident2 will normally try to change it's uid to something less privileged if it finds it's uid to be 0. This option disables this behavior altogether.

       -r, --always-random
              Always send a random reply, regardless of what kind of request the client made. This is useful for abusing the ident protocol as well as assisting outgoing IP masqueraded connections.

       -m, --daemon-maxclients
              Daemon-only: Accept no more than this many connections at a time.

       -p, --daemon-port
              Daemon-only: Bind this port, instead of 'auth' aka 113
