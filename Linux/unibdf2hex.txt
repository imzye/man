NAME
       unibdf2hex - Convert BDF font glyphs into Unifont .hex glyphs

SYNOPSIS
       unibdf2hex < input-font.bdf > output-font.hex

DESCRIPTION
       unibdf2hex  reads  a  BDF  font file, extracting selected code points and printing them on stdout in Unifont .hex format.  This program was used to extract CJK ideographs from the 16x16 version of Wen
       Quan Yi's BDF font.  Currently the program is hard-coded to only extract those code points that comprise the "wqy.hex" source font file used to build "unifont.hex" but this source code could easily be
       modified.

FILES
       *.hex GNU Unifont font files
