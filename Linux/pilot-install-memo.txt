OPTIONS
   pilot-install-memo options
                               -c,
                               --category category

       Install  memo(s)  to  category defined by category. pilot-install-memo uses the Unfiled category as the default category if no category is chosen or if the specified category does not already exist on
       the Palm.

                               -f,
                               --file STRING

       File containing the target memo entry. Append other filenames to install one memo per file.

                               -r, --replace

       Replace all memos in the category specified by the -c  category option.

                               -t --title

       Use the filename as the title for the memo. (Normally, the first line of a memo is used as the title if one is not supplied with the -t option).

   Conduit Options

BUGS
   Known Bugs
       The  Palm  Device  has  a maximum length of 4,096 bytes (4k) on memopad entries, if you wish to retain the ability to edit the Memo (add/remove/change data within the memo) on the Palm itself. You can
       create a memo entry of 65,490 bytes in size (the absolute maximum) if you do not need to edit the memo entry any further on the Palm device itself. Any memo larger  than  4,096  bytes  and  less  than
       65,490 bytes will not be editable on the Palm itself. Consider these memo entries "read-only".

       This is not specifically a "bug", but a limitation in the PalmOS design itself.

   Reporting Bugs
       We  have  an online bug tracker. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is
       not very useful in terms of accountability. Please point your browser to http://bugs.pilot-link.org: http://bugs.pilot-link.org and report your bugs and issues there.
