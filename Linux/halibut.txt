NAME
       halibut - multi-format documentation formatting tool

SYNOPSIS
       halibut [options] file1.but [file2.but ...]

DESCRIPTION
       halibut reads the given set of input files, assembles them into a document, and outputs that document in one or more formats.

       The available command-line options can configure what formats Halibut should output in, and can also configure other things about the way Halibut works.

OPTIONS
       The command-line options supported by halibut are:

       --text[=filename]
              Makes  Halibut  generate an output file in plain text format. If the optional filename parameter is supplied, the output text file will be given that name. Otherwise, the name of the output
              text file will be as specified in the input files, or output.txt if none is specified at all.

       --html[=filename]
              Makes Halibut generate one or more output files in HTML format. If the optional filename parameter is supplied, there will be precisely one HTML output file with that name,  containing  the
              whole document. Otherwise, there may be one or more than one HTML file produced as output; this, and the file names, will be as specified in the input files, or given a set of default names
              starting with Contents.html if none is specified at all.

       --chm[=filename]
              Makes  Halibut  generate an output file in Windows HTML Help format. If the optional filename parameter is supplied, the output help file will be given that name. Otherwise, the name of the
              output help file will be as specified in the input files, or output.chm if none is specified at all.

       --winhelp[=filename]
              Makes Halibut generate an output file in old-style Windows Help format. If the optional filename parameter is supplied, the output help file will be given that name. Otherwise, the name  of
              the output help file will be as specified in the input files, or output.hlp if none is specified at all.

              The  output  help file must have a name ending in .hlp; if it does not, .hlp will be added. A secondary contents file will be created alongside the main help file, with the same name except
              that it will end in .cnt (for example output.cnt, if the main file is output.hlp).

       --man[=filename]
              Makes Halibut generate an output file in Unix man page format. If the optional filename parameter is supplied, the output man page will be given that name. Otherwise, the name of the output
              man page will be as specified in the input files, or output.1 if none is specified at all.

       --info[=filename]
              Makes Halibut generate an info file. If the optional filename parameter is supplied, the output info file will be given that name. Otherwise, the name of the output info  file  will  be  as
              specified in the input files, or output.info if none is specified at all.

              By default, unless configured otherwise using the \cfg{info-max-file-size}{0} directive, the info output will be split into multiple files. The main file will have the name you specify; the
              subsidiary files will have suffixes -1, -2 etc.

       --pdf[=filename]
              Makes  Halibut generate an output file in PDF format. If the optional filename parameter is supplied, the PDF output file will be given that name. Otherwise, the name of the output PDF file
              will be as specified in the input files, or output.pdf if none is specified at all.

       --ps[=filename]
              Makes Halibut generate an output file in PostScript format. If the optional filename parameter is supplied, the PostScript output file will be given that name. Otherwise, the  name  of  the
              output PostScript file will be as specified in the input files, or output.ps if none is specified at all.

       -Cword:word[:word...]
              Adds  a  configuration directive to the input processed by Halibut. Using this directive is exactly equivalent to appending an extra input file to the command line which contains the direc‐
              tive \cfg{word}{word}{word...}.

       --input-charset=charset
              Changes the assumed character set for input files from the default of ASCII.

       --list-charsets
              Makes Halibut list character sets known to it.

       --list-fonts
              Makes Halibut list fonts known to it, either intrinsically or by being passed as input files.

       --precise
              Makes Halibut report the column number as well as the line number when it encounters an error in an input file.

       --help Makes Halibut display a brief summary of its command-line options.

       --version
              Makes Halibut report its version number.

       --licence
              Makes Halibut display its licence (MIT).
