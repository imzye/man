NAME
       make-ssl-cert - Debconf wrapper for openssl

SYNOPSIS
       make-ssl-cert [OPTION]... template output-certificate
       make-ssl-cert [OPTION]... generate-default-snakeoil

DESCRIPTION
       make-ssl-cert  is  a  simple  debconf to openssl wrapper to create self-signed certificates.  It requires a source template (Ex: /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf) and it will place the new generated
       certificate in the specified output file.
       Invoked with "generate-default-snakeoil", it will generate /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem and /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options are included below.

       --force-overwrite
              Always create a new certificate, even if the file already exists.  For backwards compatibility with 1.0.x, this option can be given as last argument, too.

       --no-overwrite
              Never overwrite an existing file, even if the old certificate's key length is too small or if it uses an obsoltete signature algorithm.

       --expiration-days N
              Make the new certificate expire in N days.  Default is 3650.
