NAME
       idevicerestore - Restore IPSW firmware at PATH to an iOS device

SYNOPSIS
       idevicerestore [OPTIONS] PATH

DESCRIPTION
       Restore firmware files to iOS devices while either erasing the device or updating to preserve content and settings.

       PATH can be a compressed .ipsw file or a directory containing all files extracted from an IPSW.

OPTIONS
       -i, --ecid ECID
              Target specific device by its ECID, e.g. 0xaabb123456 (hex) or 1234567890 (decimal).

       -u, --udid UDID
              Target specific device by its device UDID.

              NOTE: only works with devices in normal mode.

       -l, --latest
              Use  latest available firmware (with download on demand).  Before performing any action it will interactively ask to select one of the currently signed firmware versions, unless -y has been
              given too.

              The PATH argument is ignored when using this option.

              DO NOT USE if you need to preserve the baseband/unlock!

              USE WITH CARE if you want to keep a jailbreakable firmware!

       -e, --erase
              Perform full restore instead of update, erasing all data

              DO NOT USE if you want to preserve user data on the device!

       -y, --no-input
              Non-interactive mode, do not ask for any input.

              WARNING: This will disable certain checks/prompts that are supposed to prevent DATA LOSS. Use with caution.

       -n, --no-action
              Do not perform any restore action. If combined with -l option the on-demand ipsw download is performed before exiting.

       --ipsw-info
              Print information about the IPSW at PATH and exit.

       -h, --help
              Prints usage information.

       -C, --cache-path DIR
              Use specified directory for caching extracted or other reused files.

       --logfile PATH
              Write logging output to file at PATH. If PATH equals NULL or NONE, no log file will be written. This disables automatic log file creation.

       -d, --debug
              Enable communication debugging.

       -v, --version
              Prints version information.

ADVANCED/EXPERIMENTAL OPTIONS
       -c, --custom
              Restore with a custom firmware (requires bootrom exploit)

       -s, --server URL
              Override the default signing server request URL. If the URL doesn't contain a path component, the default path /TSS/controller?action=2 will be added.

       -x, --exclude
              Exclude nor/baseband upgrade.

              NOTE: This option only works with legacy devices and/or custom firmware.

       -t, --shsh
              Fetch TSS record and save to .shsh file, then exit.

       -z, --no-restore
              Do not restore and end after booting to the ramdisk.

       -k, --keep-pers
              Write personalized components to files for debugging.

       -p, --pwn
              Put device in pwned DFU mode and exit (limera1n devices only).

       -P, --plain-progress
              Print progress as plain step and progress

       -R, --restore-mode
              Allow restoring from Restore mode

       -T, --ticket PATH
              Use file at PATH to send as AP ticket

       --variant VARIANT
              Use given VARIANT to match the build identity to use, e.g. 'Customer Erase Install (IPSW)'

       --ignore-errors
              Try to continue the restore process after certain errors (like a failed baseband update).

              WARNING: This might render the device unable to boot or only partially functioning. Use with caution.
