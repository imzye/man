NAME
       Text::Unaccent - Remove accents from a string

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Unaccent;

         $unaccented = unac_string($charset, $string);
         $unaccented = unac_string_utf16($string);
         $version = unac_version();
         unac_debug($level);

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Unaccent is a module that remove accents from a string.  "unac_string" converts the input string from the specified  charset to UTF-16 and call "unac_string_utf16" to return the unaccented
       equivalent. The conversion from  and to  UTF-16  is  done  with iconv(1).

       $unaccented = unac_string($charset, $string)
           Return  the  unaccented  equivalent of the  string $string. The character set of $string is specified by the $charset argument. The returned string is coded using the same character set. Valid
           values for the $charset argument are character sets known by iconv(1). Under GNU/Linux try "iconv -l" for a complete list.

       $unaccented = unac_string_utf16($string)
           Return the unaccented equivalent of the  string $string. The character set of $string must be UTF-16.

       $version = unac_version()
