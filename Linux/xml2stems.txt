XML2STEMS(1)                  Filetype Conversion                 XML2STEMS(1)

NAME
       xml2stems - Verilator XML to rtlbrowse stems conversion.

SYNTAX
       xml2stems [option]... INFILE [OUTFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Converts  Verilator  XML  AST representation to stems file for use with
       rtlbrowse.  Intended to replace the obsolete vermin, and in the future,
       advanced tool features may possibly use additional data provided by the
       Verilator AST.  Using "-" as an input filename reads from stdin.  Omit‐
       ting the output filename outputs to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -V,--vl_sim
              Adds  TOP  hierarchy for Verilator sim.  Not necessary for other
              simulators.

       -h,--help
              Display help then exit.

EXAMPLES
       The following is a chain of commands to compile Verilog source and then
       bring  up  gtkwave  and  rtlbrowse together for source code annotation.
       This assumes the file des.fst was already generated from a prior  simu‐
       lation.

       verilator -Wno-fatal des.v -xml-only --bbox-sys

       xml2stems obj_dir/Vdes.xml des.stems

       gtkwave -t des.stems des.fst
