NAME
       Catalyst::Model::CDBI - [DEPRECATED] CDBI Model Class

SYNOPSIS
           # use the helper
           create model CDBI CDBI dsn user password

           # lib/MyApp/Model/CDBI.pm
           package MyApp::Model::CDBI;

           use base 'Catalyst::Model::CDBI';

           __PACKAGE__->config(
               dsn           => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=myapp',
               password      => '',
               user          => 'postgres',

           # As object method
           $c->comp('MyApp::Model::CDBI::Table')->search(...);

           # As class method
           MyApp::Model::CDBI::Table->search(...);

DESCRIPTION
       This is the "Class::DBI" model class. It's built on top of "Class::DBI::Loader". "Class::DBI" is generally not used for new applications, with "DBIx::Class" being preferred instead. As such this
       model is deprecated and (mostly) unmaintained.

       It is preserved here for older applications which still need it for backwards compatibility.

   new
       Initializes Class::DBI::Loader and loads classes using the class config. Also attempts to borg all the classes.
