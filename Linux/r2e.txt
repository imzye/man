NAME
       r2e - receive RSS feeds by email

SYNOPSIS
       r2e [options] <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       r2e is a simple program which you can run in your crontab(5).  It watches RSS feeds and sends you nicely formatted email message for each new item.

       For a quick start with r2e try these steps:

           r2e new your@yourdomain.com
           r2e add feedname http://feed.url/somewhere.rss
           r2e run

       The last command should eventually be put into your crontab if you want things be sent you automatically.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Print the rss2email help and exit.

       -v, --version
           Print the rss2email version and exit.

       --full-version
           Print the versions of Python, the compiler used to compile Python, and packages used by rss2email.

       -c, --config <path>
           The program configuration is read from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rss2mail.cfg by default (see also FILES and ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).  Use this option to set a different configuration file.

       -d, --data <path>
           Dynamic program data is read from $XDG_DATA_HOME/rss2mail.json by default (see also FILES and ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).  Use this option to set a different data file.

       -V, --verbose
           Increment the logging verbosity.

COMMANDS
       new [<email>]
           Create a new feed database. If the <email> argument is given, it sets the default email address that mails are sent to.

       email [<email>]
           Update the default target email address to <email>.

       add <name> <url> [<email>]
           Subscribe  to  a  feed.  The  <name> argument gives the feed a name for future manipulation. <url> is the URL of the feed.  The optional <email> argument is the email address to send new items to,
           overriding the default address for this particular feed.  Repeat for each feed you want to subscribe to.

       run [--no-send] [<index> [<index> ...]]
           Scan the feeds and send emails for new items. This can be run in a cron job.

           The --no-send option stops r2e from sending any email. This can be useful the first time you run it, as otherwise it would send an email for every available feed entry.

           If an <index> is specified, r2e will only download that feed. <index> can be either the feed name (as set by add) or the feed index (as shown by list).

       list   List all the feeds in the database.

       pause [<index> [<index> ...]]
              Pause feeds (disable fetching).  The <index> option selects the feed(s) to pause (see run for possible values).  If no <index> is given, all feeds are paused.

       unpause [<index> [<index> ...]]
              Unpause feeds (enable fetching).

       delete <index> [<index> [<index> ...]]
              Remove a feed (or feeds) from the database.  The <index> option selects the feed(s) to delete (see run for possible values).

       reset [<index> [<index> ...]]
              Forget dynamic feed data (e.g. to re-send old entries).  The <index> option selects the feed(s) to reset (see run for possible values).  If no <index> is given, all feeds are reset.

       opmlimport [<path>]
              Import new feeds from OPML.  <path> is the file from which the OPML data will be read.  If <path> is not given r2e reads the data from stdin.

       opmlexport [<path>]
              Export all feeds to OPML.  <path> is the file to which the OPML data will be written.  If <path> is not given r2e writes the data to stdout.

CONFIGURATION
       The program's behavior can be controlled via the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rss2email.cfg (see also FILES and ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).  The file format is similar to a Microsoft Windows INI  file.   It  is
       parsed by Python's ConfigParser class, so see the Python documentation at http://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html for format details.

       The  config  file  stores  general configuration (applied to all feeds) in the [DEFAULT] section.  The new command will create a configuration file for you, which you can edit as you see fit.  The add
       command will add feed-specific sections.  To override any a setting for all feeds, change the value in the [DEFAULT] section.  To override a setting for a particular feed,  add  that  setting  to  the
       feed-specific section.  Here is an example overriding use-publisher-email and name-format for the feedname feed.

           [DEFAULT]
           from = user@rss2email.invalid
           force-from = False
           use-publisher-email = False
           name-format = {feed-title}: {author}
             ...
           verbose = warning

           [feed.feedname]
           url = http://feed.url/somewhere.rss
           use-publisher-email = True
           name-format = {author} ({feed.title})

       You can configure the following items:

   Addressing
       from   The email address messages are from by default

       use-8bit
              Transfer-Encoding. For local mailing it is safe and convenient to use 8bit.

       force-from
              True: Only use the 'from' address.  False: Use the email address specified by the feed, when possible.

       use-publisher-email
              True: Use the publisher's email if you can't find the author's.  False: Just use the 'from' email instead.

       name-format
              If empty, only use the feed email address rather than friendly name plus email address.  Available attributes may include 'feed', 'feed-name', 'feed-url', 'feed-title', 'author', and

       to     Set this to default To email addresses.

   Fetching
       proxy  Set an HTTP proxy (e.g. 'http://your.proxy.here:8080/')

       feed-timeout
              Set the timeout (in seconds) for feed server response

   Processing
       active True: Fetch, process, and email feeds.  False: Don't fetch, process, or email feeds

       digest True: Send a single, multi-entry email per feed per rss2email run.  False: Send a single email per entry.

       date-header
              True: Generate Date header based on item's date, when possible.  False: Generate Date header based on time sent.

       date-header-order
              A comma-delimited list of some combination of ('issued', 'created', 'modified', 'expired') expressing ordered list of preference in dates to use for the Date header of the email.

       bonus-header
              Set this to add bonus headers to all emails Example: bonus-header = 'Approved: joe@bob.org'

       trust-guid
              True: Receive one email per post.  False: Receive an email every time a post changes.

       trust-link
              True: Receive one email per unique link url.  False: Defer to trust-guid preference.  Toggling this for existing feeds may result in duplicates, because the old entries will not be recorded un‐
              der their new link-based ids.

       encodings
              To most correctly encode emails with international characters, we iterate through the list below and use the first character set that works.

       post-process
              User processing hooks.  Note the space after the module name.  Example: post-process = 'rss2email.post_process.downcase downcase_message'

       digest-post-process
              User processing hooks for digest messages.  If 'digest' is enabled, the usual 'post-process' hook gets to message the per-entry messages, but this hook is called with the  full  digest  message
              before it is mailed.  Example: digest-post-process = 'rss2email.post_process.downcase downcase_message'

   HTML conversion
       html-mail
              True: Send text/html messages when possible.  False: Convert HTML to plain text.

       use-css
              Use CSS

       css    Optional CSS styling

   html2text options
       unicode-snob
              Use Unicode characters instead of their ascii psuedo-replacements

       links-after-each-paragraph
              Put the links after each paragraph instead of at the end.

       body-width
              Wrap long lines at position. Any negative value for no wrapping, 0 for 78 width (compatibility), or any positive width.

   Mailing
       email-protocol
              Select protocol from: sendmail, smtp, imap, maildir

       sendmail
              Path to sendmail (or compatible)

FILES
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rss2email.cfg
           If this file exists, it is read to configure the program.

       $XDG_DATA_HOME/rss2email.json
           The database of feeds. Use r2e to add, remove, or modify feeds, do not edit it directly.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The environment variables used by r2e are all defined in the XDG Base Directory Specification, which aims to standardize locations for user-specific configuration and data files.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           The preferred directory for configuration files.  Defaults to $HOME/.config.

       XDG_DATA_HOME
           The preferred directory for data files.  Defaults to $HOME/.local/share.

       XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
           A  colon  ':'  separated,  preference ordered list of base directories for configuration files in addition to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.  Defaults to /etc/xdg.  If multiple configuration files are found in
           this path, they will all be read by the ConfigParser class (see also CONFIGURATION above).

       XDG_DATA_DIRS
           A colon ':' separated, preference ordered list of base directories for data files.  Defaults to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/.  Only the first matching file is used.
