SYNOPSIS

         print ("IP  : ".$ip->ip()."\n");
         print ("Sho : ".$ip->short()."\n");
         print ("Bin : ".$ip->binip()."\n");
         print ("Int : ".$ip->intip()."\n");

         print ("Rev:  ".$ip->reverse_ip()."\n");

DESCRIPTION
       An XS (C) implementation of Net::IP. See Net::IP's documentation (as at version 1.25) for the functions and methods that are available.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NET::IP AND NET::IP::XS
       Exports
           Nothing is exported by default.

       Error messages
           In some instances this won't set error codes or messages where "Net::IP" would, though it should be mostly the same.

       Object-oriented interface
           The object-oriented interface uses function calls and hashref lookups internally, such that subclassing "Net::IP::XS" will not have the same effect as it does with "Net::IP".

       ip_auth
           Returns "undef" on failure, instead of dying.

       ip_binadd
           Returns "undef" if either of the bitstring arguments is more than 128 characters in length.

           Any character of the bitstring that is not a 0 is treated as a 1. The "Net::IP" version returns different results for different digits, and treats non-digits as 0.

       ip_bintoint
           The integer returned will be at most ((1 << 128) - 1) (i.e. the largest possible IPv6 address). "Net::IP" handles bitstrings of arbitrary length.

       ip_compress_address
           Returns "undef" if the IPv6 address argument is invalid.

       ip_compress_v4_prefix
           Returns "undef" if the "len" argument is negative or greater than 32.

       ip_expand_address
           Does not set "Error" or "Errno" where there is a problem with an embedded IPv4 address within an IPv6 address.

           Returns the zero IP address if the empty string is provided. The "Net::IP" version returns "undef".

           Returns  a  full  IPv6 address if a partial address is provided (e.g.  returns 'ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000' if 'ffff:ffff' is provided).  The "Net::IP" version returns the partial
           address.

           Returns "undef" on an invalid IPv4/IPv6 address. The "Net::IP" version returns the zero address for IPv4 and whatever was provided for IPv6.

       ip_get_mask
           The mask returned will always have a length equal to the number of bits in an address of the specified IP version (e.g. an IPv4 mask will always comprise 32 characters). The "Net::IP"  version
           will return a longer mask when the "len" argument is larger than the number of bits in the specified IP version.

           If a negative "len" is provided, it will be treated as zero.

       ip_inttobin
           The  bitstring returned will always be either 32 or 128 characters in length, and it returns "undef" if the integer argument would require more than 128 characters to represent as a bitstring.
           If an invalid version is provided, the returned bitstring will be 128 characters in length. The "Net::IP" version  handles  arbitrary  integers  and  expands  to  accommodate  those  integers,
           regardless of the version argument.  Also, if an invalid version is provided, the returned bitstring is only as long as is necessary to accommodate the bitstring.

       ip_iptobin
           Returns "undef" on an invalid IPv4/IPv6 address.

       ip_last_address_bin
           Returns  an  empty  string if an invalid version (i.e. not 4 or 6) is provided. If the bitstring provided is longer than the number of bits in the specified version, then only the first 32/128
           bits will be used in determining the last address. If the "len" provided is invalid (negative or more than 32/128 depending on the version), it will be treated as the  maximum  length  of  the
           specified version.

       ip_normalize
           For  the  'plus'  style  of  string  (e.g. '1.0.0.0 + 255'), whitespace between the plus character and the parts before and after it is optional. In the "Net::IP" version, there has to be some
           whitespace before and after the plus character. Also, "undef" will be returned if the part after the plus sign is not a number. The "Net::IP" version will  return  two  copies  of  the  single
           address in this instance.

           For  the  'prefix  range' style of string (e.g. '1.0.0.0/8'), the part after the slash must be a number. If it is not, "undef" will be returned. The "Net::IP" version will return two copies of
           the single address in this instance.

       ip_range_to_prefix
           Returns "undef" if the version argument is invalid.

       ip_reverse
           The "len" argument determines the length of the reverse domain - e.g., if the arguments are '127.0.0.1', '16' and '4', the reverse domain will be '0.127.in-addr.arpa.'. The  "Net::IP"  version
           does not take the "len" argument into account for IPv4 addresses. For IPv6 addresses, a compressed IP address string may be provided.

       ip_splitprefix
           Returns "undef" unless the first component of the string is less than or equal to 64 characters in length. The "Net::IP" version handles strings of arbitrary length.

       prefix
           Returns  a  string  with  a  prefix length of zero (e.g. '127.0.0.1/0') where "prefixlen" is not defined in the object. The "Net::IP" version will not include any prefix length in the returned
           string (e.g. '127.0.0.1/').
