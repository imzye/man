NAME
       Sys::Utmp - Object(ish) Interface to UTMP files.

SYNOPSIS
         use Sys::Utmp;

         my $utmp = Sys::Utmp->new();

         while ( my $utent =  $utmp->getutent() )
         {
            if ( $utent->user_process )
            {
               print $utent->ut_user,"\n";
            }
          }

          $utmp->endutent;

       See also examples/pwho in the distribution directory.

DESCRIPTION
       Sys::Utmp provides a vaguely object oriented interface to the Unix user accounting file ( sometimes /etc/utmp or /var/run/utmp).  Whilst it would prefer to use the getutent() function from the
       systems C libraries it will attempt to provide its own if they are missing.

       This may not be the module that you are looking for - there is a User::Utmp which provides a different procedural interface and may well be more complete for your purposes.

   METHODS
       new The constructor of the class.  Arguments may be provided in Key => Value pairs : it currently takes one argument 'Filename' which will set the file which is to be used in place of that defined
           in _PATH_UTMP.

       getutent
           Iterates  of  the  records  in the utmp file returning a Sys::Utmp::Utent object for each record in turn - the methods that are available on these objects are descrived in the Sys::Utmp::Utent
           documentation.  If called in a list context it will return a list containing the elements of th Utent entry rather than an object.  If the import flag ':fields' is used then constants defining
           the indexes into this list will be defined, these are uppercase versions of the methods described in Sys::Utmp::Utent.

       setutent
           Rewinds the file pointer on the utmp filehandle so repeated searches can be done.

       endutent
           Closes the file handle on the utmp file.

       utmpname SCALAR filename
           Sets the file that will be used in place of that defined in _PATH_UTMP.  It is not defined what will happen if this is done between two calls to getutent() - it is recommended that  endutent()
           is called first.

   EXPORT
       No methods or constants are exported by default.

   Exportable constants
       These constants are exportable under the tag ':constants':

            ACCOUNTING
            BOOT_TIME
            DEAD_PROCESS
            EMPTY
            INIT_PROCESS
            LOGIN_PROCESS
            NEW_TIME
            OLD_TIME
            RUN_LVL
            USER_PROCESS

       These are the values that will be found in the ut_type field of the Sys::Utmp::Utent object.

       These constants are exported under the tag ':fields' :

            UT_USER
            UT_ID
            UT_LINE
            UT_PID
            UT_TYPE
            UT_HOST
            UT_TIME

       These provide the indexes into the list returned when "getutent" is called in list context.

BUGS
       Probably.   This  module  has been tested on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD ,SCO Openserver and SCO UnixWare and found to work on those platforms.  If you have difficulty building the module or it doesnt
       behave as expected then please contact the author including if appropriate your /usr/include/utmp.h

       Patches to make this work better on any platform are always welcome. The source is managed at https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Sys-Utmp so feel free to fork and send a pull request.
