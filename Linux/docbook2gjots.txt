DOCBOOK2GJOTS(1)            General Commands Manual           DOCBOOK2GJOTS(1)

NAME
       docbook2gjots - Convert a DOCBOOK file to gjots format (on stdout)

SYNOPSIS
       docbook2gjots [ DOCBOOK-file ]

DESCRIPTION
       docbook2gjots converts a DOCBOOK XML file into gjots format.

       docbook2gjots uses gawk(1) to perform the conversion.

       <preface>,  <chapter>, <section>, <sect1>, <sect2>, <sect3> and <sect4>
       tags are used to define NewEntry and NewFolder boundaries. They  should
       definitely have <title> tags.

       This  is a quick and dirty hack using gawk(1) and does no formal check‐
       ing of XML or SGML syntax nor does it validate against the DOCBOOK DTD.
       Consequently,  if  the syntax of the file is broken the conversion will
       probably fail.

       It is intended that a round-trip can be made so that  gjots(1)  can  be
       used  as a tool at all stages of DOCBOOK production - mainly as an out‐
       line processor to help the author organise and order the work.  A docu‐
       ment  may  well  start its life in gjots(1) as the initial thoughts are
       marshalled. As the document forms up, it can be  converted  to  DOCBOOK
       with  the  following  command  which  automatically  adds  tags such as
       <?xml...>, <para> etc:

              gjots2docbook -b file.gjots >file.xml
              docbook2pdf file.xml

       Or, starting with an existing DOCBOOK file:

              docbook2gjots file.xml >file.gjots

       In the latter case, the document will already have  a  lot  of  DOCBOOK
       tags so to convert back to docbook, add the -e and -p options:

              gjots2docbook -b -p -e file.gjots >file.xml
              docbook2pdf file.xml
