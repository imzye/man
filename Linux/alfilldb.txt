NAME
       alfilldb - Add/update information of music files in the AudioLink database

SYNOPSIS
       alfilldb [OPTION]... /path/to/songs/...

       alfilldb [OPTION]... --file=/path/to/song...

DESCRIPTION
       You can use this script to add or update information about your music files (MP3 or Ogg Vorbis) in the AudioLink database. This information will be used when you use the alsearch(1) program to search
       for particular music. This program is part of the audiolink(1) package.

       The path given for the location of individual files or directories must be an absolute path (paths with ~ are allowed). Relative paths are not allowed. See the "examples" section for more information.

       The user and password options have to be specified to gain access to the database. See the "more information" section in the audiolink(1) man page for the various ways in which you can specify them.

       Options that are used repetitively during different invocations of the program (like the user, password options) may be put in the config file. See the audiolink(1) man page for details on the config
       file.

OPTIONS
       --add-only
           Only the information about new songs will be added to the database; information about existing songs will not be updated.

       --file=xxx
           Works on just a single file instead of a directory. If this argument is given, the /path/to/dirs is not considered.  (You can have more than one of these).

       --help
           Brief usage information

       --host=xxx
           Connects to the MySQL server on the given host. Default is localhost.

       --no-prompt
           Don't prompt for anything. Songs which do not have information for mandatory fields (eg., song title) will not be added to the database.

       --pass=xxx
           Password for accessing the database

       --prompt=xxx
           Prompt for input if there isn't enough information in the song (ID3 or Ogg Vorbis comments).

           The parameters that prompt accepts are:

           basic
               Prompts just for the album name and the artist/band name

           limited
               Prompts for album, artist/band, genre and year fields

           most
               Prompt for all the fields except the Male, Female Artists and the Track number

           paranoid
               Prompt for all the fields, including Male Artist (1/2), Female Artist (1/2), Track Number.

       -s, --na
           Simulate or no-act mode: doesn't update the database.

       --upd-only
           Only entries in the database will be updated from the input the user gives. Make sure you don't use the --no-prompt option along with this one... else you won't get anything done!

       --upd-song
           Update the tags in the file, ie, ID3 for MP3, comments for Ogg Vorbis.

       --user=xxx
           Username for accessing the database

       --verbose
           Displays some extra information while processing files

EXAMPLES
       "alfilldb --add-only /home/user/tmp/songs/"
           This invocation will scan the /home/user/tmp/songs directory recursively for new songs only. Songs already existing in the database will not be considered.

       "alfilldb --upd-only --prompt=most ~/tmp/songs/"
           This invocation will scan the $(HOME)/tmp/songs directory recursively for the current user for incomplete information in the database.

       "alfilldb ~user/tmp/songs/"
           This invocation will scan the /home/user/tmp/songs folder for music files; will add new entries to the database as well as update the existing ones.

       "alfilldb --file=~/tmp/songs/somefile.ogg --file=~/tmp/songs/otherfile.mp3"
           This invocation will just add (or update) information about the files $(HOME)/tmp/songs/somefile.ogg and $(HOME)/tmp/songs/otherfile.mp3.

CAVEATS
       If the --prompt option is not specified, alfilldb will just prompt for the title of the song being processed. The title information is asked only if the ID3 tag or the Vorbis comment doesn't contain
       the title. This behavior can be overriden by the --no-prompt option, and in this case, the entry for the file will not be made, since the song title is a mandatory field for storing song information
       in the datbase.

       If neither of --add-only or --upd-only are specified, the default action is to add new entries as well as update existing ones.

       If the ID3 tags or Vorbis comments for a file were updated after entries were made in the AudioLink database, they will not be reflected in the database. If you want to maintain consistency, it is
       advised that you keep the database updated (by using the --upd-only option) and then update the ID3 tag in the MP3 or the comment in the Ogg Vorbis file (by running alfilldb with the --upd-only
       option).
