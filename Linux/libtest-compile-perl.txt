Test::Compile::Internal(3pm)                                                        User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                        Test::Compile::Internal(3pm)

NAME
       Test::Compile::Internal - Assert that your Perl files compile OK.

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::Compile::Internal;
           my $test = Test::Compile::Internal->new();
           $test->all_files_ok();
           $test->done_testing();

DESCRIPTION
       "Test::Compile::Internal" is an object oriented tool for testing whether your perl files compile.

       It is primarily to provide the inner workings of "Test::Compile", but it can also be used directly to test a CPAN distribution.

METHODS
       new()
           A basic constructor, nothing special.

       all_files_ok(@search)
           Looks for perl files and tests them all for compilation errors.

           If  @search is defined then it is taken as an array of files or directories to be searched for perl files, otherwise it searches the default locations you'd expect to find perl files in a perl
           module - see "all_pm_files" and "all_pl_files" for details.

       all_pm_files_ok(@search)
           Checks all the perl module files it can find for compilation errors.

           If @search is defined then it is taken as an array of files or directories to be searched for perl files, otherwise it searches the default locations you'd expect to find perl files in a  perl
           module - see "all_pm_files" for details.

       all_pl_files_ok(@search)
           Checks all the perl program files it can find for compilation errors.

           If @search is defined then it is taken as an array of directories to be searched for perl files, otherwise it searches some default locations - see "all_pl_files".

       verbose($verbose)
           An accessor to get/set the verbosity.  The default value (undef) will suppress output unless the compilation fails.  This is probably what you want.

           If "verbose" is set to true, you'll get the output from 'perl -c'. If it's set to false, all diagnostic output is suppressed.

       all_pm_files(@search)
           Searches for and returns a list of perl module files - that is, files with a .pm extension.

           If you provide @search, it'll use that as a list of files to process, or directories to search for perl modules.

           If you don't provide "search", it'll search for perl modules in the blib/lib directory (if that directory exists). Otherwise it'll search the lib directory.

           Skips any files in CVS, .svn, or .git directories.

       all_pl_files(@search)
           Searches for and returns a list of perl script files - that is, any files that either have a case insensitive .pl, .psgi extension, or have no extension but have a perl shebang line.

           If you provide @search, it'll use that as a list of files to process, or directories to search for perl scripts.

           If you don't provide "search", it'll search for perl scripts in the blib/script/ and blib/bin/ directories if blib exists, otherwise it'll search the script/ and bin/ directories

           Skips any files in CVS, .svn, or .git directories.

       pl_file_compiles($file)
           Returns true if $file compiles as a perl script.

       pm_file_compiles($file)
           Returns true if $file compiles as a perl module.

TEST METHODS
       "Test::Compile::Internal" encapsulates a "Test::Builder" object, and provides access to some of its methods.

       "ok($test, $name)"
           Your basic test. Pass if $test is true, fail if $test is false. Just like "Test::Simple"'s ok().

       done_testing()
           Declares that you got to the end of your test plan, no more tests will be run after this point.

       "plan(tests => $count)"
           Defines how many tests you plan to run.

       diag(@msgs)
           Prints out the given @msgs. Like print, arguments are simply appended together.

           Output will be indented and marked with a # so as not to interfere with test output. A newline will be put on the end if there isn't one already.

           We encourage using this rather than calling print directly.

       skip($reason)
           Skips the current test, reporting the $reason.

       skip_all($reason)
           Skips all the tests, using the given $reason. Exits immediately with 0.
