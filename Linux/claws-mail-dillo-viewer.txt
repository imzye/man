NAME
       claws-mail-dillo-viewer - display HTML message parts using Dillo browser

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-dillo-viewer package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-dillo-viewer is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin allows viewing HTML messages with the Dillo browser embedded in the message view.

       By default no remote URLs are retrieved for safe browsing.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named dillo.so, and press the “Open”
       button.
