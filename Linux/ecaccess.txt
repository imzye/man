DESCRIPTION
       Allow uploading source-local-file on the ECaccess File System. If no target-ecaccess-file is specified then the source-local-file name is used.

       The target-ecaccess-file is in the form [domain:][/user-id/]path. Please read the "Shell commands -> File Management" section of the "ecaccess" guide for more information on the ECaccess File
       System.

ARGUMENTS
       source-local-file
               The name of the source Local File.

       target-ecaccess-file (optional)
               The name of the target ECaccess File.

OPTIONS
       -progress
               Provide a progress meter on the standard terminal, allowing to monitor the file transmission in real-time. The progress bar is removed from the terminal when the transmission is done. This
               option is not supported and ignored on Windows platforms.

       -umask mode
               The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is used to determine the file permission for newly created files. The default value is 640.

       -offset number
               Every open file has an associated file offset, which determines where the next read operation will start. This number is set to 0 by default.

       -bufsize length
               Specify the length of the buffer (in bytes) which is used to upload the file.  The larger the buffer the smaller the number of http/s requests. By default a buffer of 10485760 bytes (10MB)
               is used.

       -version
               Display version number and exits.

       -help   Print a brief help message and exits.

       -manual Prints the manual page and exits.

       -retry count
               Number  of  SSL  connection  retries  per  5s  to  ECMWF. This parameter only apply to the initial SSL connection initiated by the command to the ECMWF server. It does not apply to all the
               subsequent requests made afteward as it is mainly targeting errors that can happen from time to time during the SSL handshake. Default is no retry.

       -debug  Display the SOAP and SSL messages exchanged.
