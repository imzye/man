DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents gmotionlive.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       gmotionlive is a multipart/x-mixed-replace viewer.  It uses gnomevfs to open a stream and it displays the downloaded parts.

       It was written as a viewer for the motion program (http://motion.sourceforge.net) but should be usable for other sources such as network cameras.
