NAME
       zgetdump - Tool for copying and converting System z dumps

SYNOPSIS
       zgetdump    DUMP [-s SYS] [-f FMT] > DUMP_FILE
                -m DUMP [-s SYS] [-f FMT] DIR
                -i DUMP [-s SYS]
                -d DUMPDEV
                -u DIR
                -h|-v

DESCRIPTION
       The  zgetdump  tool  copies  a source dump into a target dump with a configurable dump format. The source dump can be located either on a dump device or on a
       file system. By default the source dump content is written to standard output, which you can redirect to a specific file. You can also mount  the  dump  con‐
       tent, print dump information, check whether a dump device contains a valid dump tool, or create a non-disruptive dump on a live system.

OPTIONS
       -h or --help
              Print usage information, then exit.

       -v or --version
              Print version information, then exit.

       -m <DUMP> <DIR> or --mount <DUMP> <DIR>
              Mount  the  source dump DUMP to mount point DIR and generate a virtual target dump file instead of writing the content to standard output. The virtual
              dump file gets the name "dump.FMT", where FMT is the name of the specified dump format (see "--fmt" option).

       -u <DIR> or --umount <DIR>
              Unmount the dump that is mounted at mount point DIR. This option is a wrapper for  "fusermount  -u".  Instead  of  DIR  also  the  DUMP  (for  example
              /dev/dasdd1) can be specified.

       -d <DUMPDEV> or --device <DUMPDEV>
              Check the dump disk DUMPDEV for a valid dump tool and print information about it. See chapters DUMPDEV and DUMPDEV INFORMATION below for more informa‐
              tion.

       -i <DUMP> or --info <DUMP>
              Print the dump header information reading from the DUMP and check if the dump is valid. See chapters DUMP and DUMP INFORMATION below for more informa‐
              tion.

       -V or --verbose
              Show the detailed memory map layout when printing the dump header information (relevant for s390_ext and ELF dump formats).

       -f <FMT> or --fmt <FMT>
              Use the specified target dump format FMT when writing or mounting the dump.  The following target dump formats are supported:

              - elf: Executable and Linking Format core dump (default)

              - s390: s390 dump

       -s <SYS> or --select <SYS>
              If  kdump  fails and a stand-alone dump is created, the resulting dump captures two systems: The crashed kdump system and the previously crashed Linux
              instance. With the "--select" option you can choose which system data to use:

              - prod: Data for the initial crashed Linux instance

              - kdump: Data for the crashed kdump system

              - all: Data for the initial crashed Linux and kdump system

              The "-s" option returns an error for dumps that capture only a single crashed system.

       DUMP   This parameter specifies the file, partition or tape device node where the source dump is located:

                -  Regular dump file (e.g. /dumps/dump.0)

                -  DASD partition device node (e.g. /dev/dasdc1)

                -  DASD device node for multi-volume dump (e.g. /dev/dasdc)

                -  Device mapper multipath partition device node of a FCP attached SCSI disk (e.g.  /dev/mapper/3600..20c0-part1)

                -  Tape device node (e.g. /dev/ntibm0)

                -  Device node for live system (/dev/mem or /dev/crash)

               Note: For DASD multi-volume dump it is sufficient to specify only one of the multi-volume DASD partitions as DUMP.

       DUMPDEV When using the "--device" option, DUMPDEV must be the device node of the dump disk that should be verified. This can be either a DASD device node  or
               a device mapper multipath device node of a FCP attached SCSI disk.

COPY DUMP
       The  default  action  of zgetdump is to copy the source dump to standard output in the target format specified by the --fmt option. Read the examples section
       below for more information.

MOUNT DUMP
       Use the "--mount" option to make a source dump accessible to tools that cannot directly read the original dump format. Rather than creating a converted  copy
       of the dump, zgetdump creates a virtual dump file with the requested target format. This is fast and does not consume any additional disk space.  Also multi-
       volume dumps can be assimilated into a single virtual dump file, which can then be accessed directly with dump-processing tools like makedumpfile or crash.

       Specify a command of this form to mount and convert a dump:

       # zgetdump --mount <DUMP> <DIR>  --fmt <FMT>

       Where:

       DUMP   is the source dump or dump device

       DIR    is the mount point where the virtual dump file is created

       FMT    is the target dump format to which the virtual dump file is converted.  The resulting virtual dump file is <DIR>/dump.<FMT>

       The virtual dump file exists until the directory is unmounted.  Use zgetdump -u <DIR> to unmount a dump.

       The zgetdump tool uses the file system in user space (fuse) to mount the source dump. Therefore, the fuse kernel module must to be loaded  before  using  the
       "--mount" option.

       Read the examples section below for more information.

DUMP FORMATS
       The  default  target format of zgetdump is "elf". Use the "--fmt" option to change the target format. The following dump formats are supported for target and
       source dump:

       elf    Executable and Linking Format core dump. This dump format is also used for Linux user space core dumps.

       s390   This dump format is System z specific and is used for DASD and tape dumps.

       The following dump formats are supported for the source dump only:

       s390_ext
              This dump format is System z specific and is used for DASD dumps only.

       lkcd   This dump format is used by the Linux Kernel Crash Dumps (LKCD) project and also on System z for the "vmconvert" dump tool.

       devmem On live systems the /dev/mem or /dev/crash device nodes can be used as source dumps for creating live dumps.

       kdump/kdump_flat
              Dump formats created by the "makedumpfile" tool. For these formats only the "--info" option can be used.

DUMP INFORMATION
       Depending on the dump format, the following dump attributes are available when calling zgetdump with the "--info" option:

       Dump format
              Name of the dump format.

       Version
              Version number of the dump format.

       Dump method
              Dump method that has been used to create the dump. Currently the only supported value for this attribute is "live" which indicates that the  dump  has
              been created from a live system and therefore is not consistent.

       Dump created/ended
              Time  when the dump process was started or ended. The dump time information is printed in your local time zone. E.g. "Wed, 03 Feb 2010 10:47:37 +0100"
              shows the time at your location. The meaning of "+0100" is that your time zone is one hour behind GMT. You can use the "TZ"  environment  variable  or
              use  the  "tzselect" tool to change the time zone. For example, if you know that the dump has been created in Hawaii, you can get the correct time in‐
              formation with:

              # TZ='Pacific/Honolulu' zgetdump -i DUMP

       Dump CPU ID
              Identifier of the CPU that ran the dump tool.

       UTS node name
              The network node hostname of the Linux system.

       UTS kernel release
              The kernel release of the Linux system.

       UTS kernel version
              The kernel version of the Linux system.

       Build arch
              Architecture (s390 or s390x) on which the dump tool was built.

       System arch
              Architecture (s390 or s390x) of the Linux system.

       CPU count (online)
              Number of online CPUs.

       CPU count (real)
              Number of total CPUs (online and offline).

       Dump memory range
              Memory range that was dumped. This value is the difference between the last dumped and the first dumped memory address.

       Real memory range
              Memory range that was available on the system. This value is the difference between the last and the first memory address of the system on  which  the
              dump  was  created.   The  "real memory range" can differ from the "dump memory range" when the SIZE parameter was used when preparing the dump device
              with the zipl tool (see man zipl).

       Dump file size
              Actual size of dump file on disk in megabytes. "Dump file size" may differ from the "dump memory range" because of zero memory chunks.

       Memory map
              Available memory chunks in the dump. Some dump tools create multiple memory chunks when creating a dump on a system with memory gaps

DUMPDEV INFORMATION
       Depending on the dump tool, the following attributes are available when calling zgetdump with the "--device" option:

       Dump tool
              Name of the dump tool.

       Version
              Version of the dump tool.

       Architecture
              Architecture (s390 or s390x) of the dump tool.

       DASD type
              Type of the DASD where the dump tool is installed (ECKD or FBA).

       Dump size limit
              If this attribute is set, the dump tool will dump memory only up to that limit even if there is more memory available.

       Force specified
              If this attribute is set to "yes", the multi-volume DASD dump tool will not verify the dump signature on dump partitions. This can be useful,  if  the
              dump partition is also used for swap.

       Partition info
              For SCSI partition dump, the partition number and the maximum dump size is printed. The partition number corresponds to the output of "parted /dev/sdx
              print" or "fdisk -l /dev/sdx".

EXAMPLES
       Copy single-volume DASD dump

              The DASD partition /dev/dasdx1 was prepared for dump with:

                # zipl -d /dev/dasdx1

              An IPL was performed on the corresponding single-volume dump tool and a dump has been created. To copy the  dump  from  the  DASD  partition  to  file
              dump.elf issue:

                # zgetdump /dev/dasdx1 > dump.elf

       Copy multi-volume DASD dump

              DASD partitions /dev/dasdx1 and /dev/dasdy1 contained in file dev_list.conf were prepared for multi-volume dump with:

                # zipl -M dev_list.conf

              An  IPL  was  performed  on  the  corresponding  multi-volume dump tool and a dump has been created. To copy the dump from the DASD partitions to file
              dump.elf issue:

                # zgetdump /dev/dasdx > dump.elf

       Copy SCSI dump

              The device mapper multipath partition on a SCSI disk /dev/mapper/3600..20c0-part1 was prepared for dump with:

                # zipl -d /dev/mapper/3600..20c0-part1

              An IPL was performed on the corresponding dump tool and a dump has been created. To copy the dump from the device mapper partition  to  file  dump.elf
              issue:

                # zgetdump /dev/mapper/3600..20c0-part1 > dump.elf

       Copy tape dump

              Tape device /dev/ntibm0 was prepared with:

                # zipl -d /dev/ntibm0

              An IPL was performed on the corresponding tape dump tool and a dump has been created. To copy the dump from the tape to file dump.elf issue:

                # zgetdump /dev/ntibm0 > dump.elf

       Create live dump

              To store an ELF-format dump from a live system in a file called dump.elf issue:

                # nice -n -20 zgetdump /dev/mem > dump.elf

       Using pipes for network transfer

              You  can  redirect  standard  output  to  tools like ftp or ssh in order to transfer the dump over the network without copying it into the file system
              first.

              Copy DASD dump using ssh:

                 # zgetdump /dev/dasdd1  | ssh user@host "cat > dump.elf"

              Copy and compress DASD dump using ftp and gzip (note that not all ftp clients can do this):

                 # ftp host
                 ftp> put |"zgetdump /dev/dasdd1 | gzip" dump.elf.gz

              The same effect can also be achieved by using the "--mount" option and run scp or ftp directly on the mounted virtual dump file.

       Using the --mount option

              Mount a single-volume DASD dump as virtual ELF dump file, compress it with the makedumpfile tool, and unmount it with zgetdump:

                # zgetdump -m /dev/dasdc1 /dumps
                # makedumpfile -c -d 31 -x vmlinux.debug \
                     /dumps/dump.elf dump.kdump
                # zgetdump -u /dumps

              Mount a multi-volume DASD dump, process it with the "crash" tool, and unmount it with fusermount:

                # zgetdump -m /dev/dasdx /dumps
                # crash vmlinux /dumps/dump.elf
                # fusermount -u /dumps

       Print dump information (--info)

              Print information about a DASD dump on /dev/dasdd1:

                # zgetdump -i /dev/dasdd1

              Print information about a dump on a device mapper multipath partition device node of a SCSI disk:

                # zgetdump -i /dev/mapper/3600..20c0-part1

       Print dump tool information (--device)

              Print information about a DASD dump tool on /dev/dasdd:

                # zgetdump -d /dev/dasdd

              Print information about a dump tool on a SCSI multipath device:

                # zgetdump -d /dev/mapper/3600..02c0

NOTES
       The ELF dump format is not supported by the zgetdump tool under 31 bit.

       While it is not recommended for reasons of recovery and redundancy, FCP attached SCSI disks can also be accessed directly without multipathing,  for  example
       via the "/dev/disk/by-path/" device nodes.
