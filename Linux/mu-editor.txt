DESCRIPTION
       mu-editor is a simple code editor for beginner programmers based on extensive feedback from teachers and learners.  Having said that, mu-editor is for anyone
       who wants to use a simple “no frills” editor.

       mu-editor is a modal editor with modes for:

       • Adafruit’s CircuitPython

       • the micro:bit’s version of MicroPython

       • PyGame Zero

       • standard Python 3 (including a graphical debugger)

       Some of the modes make available a REPL (either running on the connected CircuitPython or MicroPython device,  or  as  a  Jupyter-based  iPython  session  in
       Python3 mode).
