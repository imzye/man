NAME
       nbdsh - network block device (NBD) shell

SYNOPSIS
        $ nbdsh

        Welcome to nbdsh, the shell for interacting with
        Network Block Device (NBD) servers.

        The ‘nbd’ module has already been imported and there
        is an open NBD handle called ‘h’.

        nbd> h.connect_command(["nbdkit", "-s", "memory", "1G"])
        nbd> h.get_size()
        1073741824
        nbd> buf = b"hello, world"
        nbd> h.pwrite(buf, 0)
        nbd> exit()

DESCRIPTION
       nbdsh is a Python-based client shell for accessing Network Block Device (NBD) servers.

       For documentation about the libnbd API please open the shell and type:

        help(nbd)

EXAMPLES
   Print the size of an NBD export
       The -u option connects to an NBD URI.  The -c option lets you execute single Python statements from the command line.  Combining these two options lets you print the size in bytes of an NBD
       export:

        $ nbdsh -u nbd://localhost -c 'print(h.get_size())'
        1073741824

   Hexdump the boot sector of an NBD export
       Using -c - you can feed a whole Python program to the standard input of nbdsh:

        nbdsh -c - <<'EOF'
        from subprocess import *

        h.connect_uri("nbd://localhost")
        bootsect = h.pread(512, 0)
        p = Popen("hexdump -C", shell=True, stdin=PIPE)
        p.stdin.write(bootsect)
        EOF

OPTIONS
       -h
       --help
           Display brief command line help and exit.

       --base-allocation
           Request   the   use   of   the   "base:allocation"   meta   context,   which   is   the   most   common   context   used   with   nbd_block_status_64(3).    This   is   equivalent  to  calling
           "h.set_meta_context(nbd.CONTEXT_BASE_ALLOCATION)" in the shell prior to connecting, and works even when combined with "--uri" (while attempting the same with "-c" would be too late).

       -c 'COMMAND ...'
       --command 'COMMAND ...'
           Instead of starting an interactive shell, run a command.  This option can be specified multiple times in order to run multiple commands.

       -c -
       --command -
           Read standard input and execute it as a command.

       -n  Do not create the implicit handle "h".

       --opt-mode
           Request that option mode be enabled, which gives fine-grained control over option negotiation after initially contacting the server but prior to actually using the export.  This is  equivalent
           to calling "h.set_opt_mode(True)" in the shell prior to connecting, and works even when combined with "--uri" (while attempting the same with "-c" would be too late).

       -u URI
       --uri URI
           Connect to the given NBD URI.  This is equivalent to the "h.connect_uri(URI)" command in the shell.

           Note  that  the  connection  is  created prior to processing any "-c" commands, which prevents the use of configuration commands such as "h.add_meta_context("NAME")" from the command line when
           mixed with this option.  The options "--opt-mode" and "--base-allocation" can be used to make this situation easier to manage.

       -v
       --verbose
           Enable verbose libnbd messages.  This has the same effect as setting the environment variable "LIBNBD_DEBUG=1"

       -V
       --version
           Display the package name and version and exit.

NOTES
   nbdsh examples
       There are some example nbdsh scripts in the libnbd source repository under sh/examples or see https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/libnbd/tree/master/sh/examples.

   Using libnbd directly from Python
       nbdsh is convenient for command line scripting, but you do not have to use it.  Instead you can write an ordinary Python program or module which imports the "nbd" module:

        #!/usr/bin/python3
        import nbd
        h = nbd.NBD()
        h.connect_uri("nbd://localhost")

       There are some example Python scripts in the libnbd source repository under python/examples or see https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/libnbd/tree/master/python/examples.
