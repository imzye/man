NAME
       html2pdf - Convert HTML to PDF

SYNOPSIS
       html2pdf [ -l ] [ -e encoding ] [ -f font ] [ -s size ]
                   input.html [ output.pdf ]

       If input.html is not given, reads HTML from standard input.

       If output.pdf is not given, writes PDF to the same name as the input file with an additional .pdf suffix, or to standard output if it's being redirected to somewhere other than a terminal.

       If encoding is not given, the input encoding defaults to "utf-8".

       If font is not given, the base font family defaults to "Helvetica".  The value of font can be a truetype font file, one of the PDF core fonts, or one of:
       "traditional"/"simplified"/"korean"/"japanese".

       If size is not given, the base font size defaults to 12 points.

       If -l is specified, the output uses landscape layout.
