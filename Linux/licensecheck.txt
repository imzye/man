NAME
       licensecheck - simple license checker for source files

VERSION
       Version v3.3.9

SYNOPSIS
           licensecheck [ --help | --version ]

           licensecheck [ --list-licenses | --list-naming-schemes ]

           licensecheck [OPTION...] PATH [PATH...]

DESCRIPTION
       licensecheck attempts to determine the license that applies to each file passed to it, by searching the start of the file for text belonging to various licenses.

       If any of the arguments passed are directories, licensecheck will add the files contained within to the list of files to process.

       When multiple PATHs are provided, only files matching --check and not --ignore are checked.

OPTIONS
   Resolving patterns
       --shortname-scheme
                       Since v3.2.

                       comma-separated priority list of license naming schemes to use for license identifiers (default value: unset (use verbose description))

       --list-licenses Since v3.2.

                       list identifiers for all detectable licenses and exit

       --list-naming-schemes
                       Since v3.2.

                       list all available license naming schemes and exit

   Selecting files
       -c REGEX, --check=REGEX
                       Since v2.10.10.

                       regular expression of files to include when more than one PATH is provided (default value: common source files)

       -i REGEX, --ignore=REGEX
                       Since v2.10.10.

                       regular expression of files to skip when more than one PATH is provided (default value: some backup and VCS files)

       -r, --recursive Since v2.10.7.

                       traverse directories recursively

   Parsing contents
       -l N, --lines=N Since v2.10.3.

                       number  of  lines  to  parse from top of each file; implies optimistic search including only first cluster of detected copyrights or licenses; set to 0 to parse the whole file (and
                       ignore --tail) (default value: 60)

       --tail=N        Since v2.15.10.

                       number of bytes to parse from bottom of each file when parsing only from top of each file and finding nothing there; set to 0 to avoid parsing from end of file (or set --lines to 0
                       and ignore this setting) (default value: 5000 (roughly 60 lines))

       -e CODEC, --encoding=CODEC
                       Since v2.15.10.

                       try decode source files from the specified codec, with "iso-8859-1" as fallback (default value: unset (no decoding))

   Reporting results
       --copyright     Since v2.10.7.

                       add copyright statements to license information

       -s, --skipped   Since v3.3.0.

                       Log files in PATHs matching neither --check nor --ignore as warnings (default: log as debug)

       -m, --machine   Since v2.12.2.

                       print license information as "TAB"-separated fields, for processing with line-oriented tools like "awk" and "sort"

       --[no-]deb-machine
                       Since v3.0.0.

                       print license information like a Debian copyright file; implies --copyright and --shortname-scheme=debian,spdx

       --list-delimiter=PRINTF
                       Since v3.0.18.

                       printf-string used between multiple plain list items in Debian copyright file (default value: '\n ' (NEWLINE SPACE))

       --rfc822-delimiter=PRINTF
                       Since v3.0.18.

                       printf-string used between multiple RFC822-style items in Debian copyright file (default value: '\n  ' (NEWLINE SPACE SPACE))

       --copyright-delimiter=PRINTF
                       Since v3.0.19.

                       printf-string used between years and owners in Debian copyright file (default value: ', ' (COMMA SPACE))

       --[no-]merge-licenses
                       Since v3.0.0.

                       merge same-licensed files in Debian copyright file

   General
       -h, --help      print help message and exit

       -v, --version   print version and copyright information and exit

       --quiet, --verbose, --debug, --trace
                       Since v3.3.0.

                       Emit only error messages to STDERR (with option --quiet), or (in addition errors and warnings) also notices/debug/traces.   The  more  "noisy"  option  wins  if  several  are  set.
                       (default: emit errors and warnings

ENVIRONMENT
       NO_COLOR
             If defined, will disable color.  Consulted before COLOR.

       COLOR Can be set to 0 to explicitly disable colors.  The default is to use color when connected to a terminal.

       LOG_LEVEL =item QUIET =item VERBOSE =item DEBUG =item TRACE
             Used  to  emit  varying  details about discoveries to STDERR when verbosity is not set using either of options --quiet, --verbose, --debug or --trace.  See Log::Any::Adapter::Screen for more
             details.

       LOG_PREFIX
             The default formatter groks these variables.  See formatter in Log::Any::Adapter::Screen for more details.

CAVEATS
       The exact output may change between releases, due to the inherently fragile scanning of unstructured data, and the ongoing improvements to detection patterns.  For some level of stability, use one
       of the machine-readable output formats and define a --shortname-scheme.

       Option --deb-fmt was deprecated since v3.2.  Please use option --shortname-scheme=debian,spdx instead.
