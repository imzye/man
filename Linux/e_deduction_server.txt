NAME
       e_deduction_server - manual page for e_deduction_server 2.6-DEBUG Floral Guranse

DESCRIPTION
       e_deduction_server 2.6-DEBUG "Floral Guranse"

              Usage: e_deduction_server -p <port> [options] [files]

              The E deduction server offers deduction services based on local or

              uploaded axiom sets via network. See README.server.

OPTIONS
       -h

       --help

              Print a short description of program usage and options.

       -V

       --version

              Print the version number of the prover. Please include this with all bug reports (if any).

       -v

       --verbose[=<arg>]

              Verbose  comments  on the progress of the program. This differs from the output level (below) in that technical information is printed to stderr, while the output level determines which logical
              manipulations of the clauses are printed to stdout. The short form or the long form without the optional argument is equivalent to --verbose=1.

       -p <arg>

       --port=<arg>

              The port on which the server will receive connections. Only effective when interactive mode is on. If not given stdin/stdout will be used.

       -s

       --silent

              Equivalent to --output-level=0.

       -l <arg>

       --output-level=<arg>

              Select an output level, greater values imply more verbose output. Level 0 produces nearly no output, level 1 will output each clause as it is processed, level 2 will  output  generating  infer‐
              ences,  level  3  will  give a full protocol including rewrite steps and level 4 will include some internal clause renamings. Levels >= 2 also imply PCL2 or TSTP formats (which can be post-pro‐
              cessed with suitable tools).

       -w <arg>

       --wtc-limit=<arg>

              Set the global wall-clock limit for each batch (if any).

       -L <arg>

       --lib=<arg>

              Set the axioms library directory of the server.
