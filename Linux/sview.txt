NAME
       sview - graphical user interface to view and modify Slurm state.

SYNOPSIS
       sview

DESCRIPTION
       sview can be used to view Slurm configuration, job, step, node and partitions state information.  Authorized users can also modify select information.

       The  primary  display modes are Jobs and Partitions, each with a selection tab.  There is also an optional map of the nodes on the left side of the window which will show the nodes associated with
       each job or partition.  Left-click on the tab of the display you would like to see.  Right-click on the tab in order to control which fields will be displayed.

       Within the display window, left-click on the header to control the sort order of entries (e.g. increasing or decreasing) in the display.  You can also left-click and drag the headers to move  them
       right  or left in the display.  If a JobID has an arrow next to it, click on that arrow to display or hide information about that job's steps.  Right-click on a line of the display to get more in‐
       formation about the record.

       There is an Admin Mode option which permits the user root to modify many of the fields displayed, such as node state or job time limit.  In the mode, a Slurm Reconfigure Action is also  available.
       It is recommended that Admin Mode be used only while modifications are actively being made.  Disable Admin Mode immediately after the changes to avoid possibly making unintended changes.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Some  sview  options  may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.  (Note: Command line options will always override
       these settings.)

       SLURM_CONF          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

NOTES
       The sview command can only be build if gtk+-2.0 is installed.  Systems lacking these libraries will have Slurm installed without the sview command.

       At least some gtk themes are unable to display large numbers of lines (jobs, nodes, etc). The information is still in gtk's internal data structures, but not visible by scrolling down the  window.
       The gtk2-engines-qtcurve theme does seem to have particularly good scalability.

       Newer gtk3 themes do not allow the background colors used for the node map to be displayed.

       On  systems  with the topology/tree plugin configured, the sview command will attempt to display the nodes on each switch on a separate line.  Change the sview configuration for optimal viewing by
       selecting "Options" then "Set Default Settings".  The "Nodes in Row" and "Node Button Size in Pixels" would be the mostly commonly changed options.
