NAME
       ditaa - convert ASCII diagrams into proper bitmap graphics

SYNOPSIS
       ditaa [options] input [output]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ditaa command.

       DiTAA is a small command-line utility that can convert diagrams drawn using ASCII art ("drawings" that contain characters that resemble lines, like | / and -), into proper bitmap graphics.

       DiTAA also uses special markup syntax to increase the possibilities of shapes and symbols that can be rendered.

OPTIONS
       --help Show summary of options.

       -v, --verbose
              Makes ditaa more verbose.

       -A, --no-antialias
              Turns anti-aliasing off.

       -d, --debug
              Renders the debug grid over the resulting image.

       -E, --no-separation
              Prevents the separation of common edges of shapes.

       -e ENCODING, --encoding ENCODING
              The encoding of the input file.

       -h, --html
              In  this  case  the input is an HTML file. The contents of the <pre class="textdiagram"> tags are rendered as diagrams and saved in the images directory and a new HTML file is produced with
              the appropriate <img> tags.

       -o, --overwrite
              If the filename of the destination image already exists, an alternative name is chosen.  If the overwrite option is selected, the image file is instead overwritten.

       -r, --round-corners
              Causes all corners to be rendered as round corners.

       -s SCALE, --scale SCALE
              A natural number that determines the size of the rendered image. The units are fractions of the default size (2.5 renders 1.5 times bigger than the default).

       -S, --no-shadows
              Turns off the drop-shadow effect.

       -t TABS, --tabs TABS
              Tabs are normally interpreted as 8 spaces but it is possible to change that using this option. It is not advisable to use tabs in your diagrams.
