NAME
       powerline - Powerline prompt and statusline script.

SYNOPSIS
          powerline EXT [SIDE] [-rMODULE] [-wWIDTH] [--last-exit-code=INT]
                    [--last-pipe-status=LIST] [--jobnum=INT]
                    [-cKEY.KEY=VALUE]… [-tTHEME.KEY.KEY=VALUE]… [-RKEY=VAL]…
                    [-pPATH]… [--socket=ADDRESS]

DESCRIPTION
       EXT    Extension: application for which powerline command is launched (usually shell or tmux). Also supports wm. extensions: wm.awesome.

       SIDE   Side: left and right represent left and right side respectively, above emits lines that are supposed to be printed just above the prompt and aboveleft is like concatenating above with left with
              the exception that only one Python instance is used in this case. May be omitted for wm.* extensions.

       -r, --renderer-module MODULE
              Renderer module. Usually something like .bash or .zsh (with leading dot) which is powerline.renderers.{ext}{MODULE}, may also be full module name (must contain at least one dot or  end  with  a
              dot in case it is top-level module) or powerline.renderers submodule (in case there are no dots).

       -w, --width WIDTH
              Maximum prompt with. Triggers truncation of some segments.

       --last-exit-code INT
              Last exit code.

       --last-pipe-status LIST
              Like above, but is supposed to contain space-separated array of statuses, representing exit statuses of commands in one pipe.

       --jobnum INT
              Number of jobs.

       -c, --config-override KEY.KEY=VALUE
              Configuration  overrides  for  config.json.  Is translated to a dictionary and merged with the dictionary obtained from actual JSON configuration: KEY.KEY=VALUE is translated to {"KEY": {"KEY":
              VALUE}} and then merged recursively. VALUE may be any JSON value, values that are not null, true, false, start with digit, {, [ are treated like strings. If VALUE is omitted then  corresponding
              key is removed.

       -t, --theme-override THEME.KEY.KEY=VALUE
              Like above, but theme-specific. THEME should point to an existing and used theme to have any effect, but it is fine to use any theme here.

       -R, --renderer-arg KEY=VAL
              Like  above, but provides argument for renderer. Is supposed to be used only by shell bindings to provide various data like last-exit-code or last-pipe-status (they are not using --renderer-arg
              for historical reasons: --renderer-arg was added later).

       -p, --config-path PATH
              Path to configuration directory. If it is present then configuration files will only be sought in the provided path. May be provided multiple times to search in a list of directories.

       --socket ADDRESS
              Socket address to use in daemon clients. Is always UNIX domain socket on linux and file socket on Mac OS X. Not used here, present only for compatibility with other powerline clients. This  ar‐
              gument must always be the first one and be in a form --socket ADDRESS: no = or short form allowed (in other powerline clients, not here).

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.
