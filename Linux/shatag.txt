NAME
       shatag - tag files with their SHA-256 checksums

SYNOPSIS
       shatag [-fhlLqrstuv0] [-d DATABASE] [-n NAME] [-R NAME]...  [FILES]...

DESCRIPTION
       shatag is a tool for computing and caching SHA-256 file checksums, and efficiently search for identical file across systems. Checksums are stored using the POSIX Extended Attributes filesystem facili‐
       ty, and are preserved when files are moved or renamed.  Checksums can be fetched from a remote host and stored in an sqlite database for fast lookups.

OPTIONS
       When invoked with no options, shatag just displays the cached, valid checksums. If no files are specified, it applies to all non-hidden files in the current directory. The output format  is  identical
       to the one of the sha256sum command.

       -0, --null
              Instead of outputting one record per line (like sha256sum does,) separate records with null characters.

       -c, --canonical
              Show canonical (full path) file names.

       -d DATABASE, --database DATABASE
              Set the path of the SQLite database to query when using -l , -L or -p (The default path is $HOME/.shatagdb, overridable from the config file)

              Instead of a file name, a PostgreSQL database can be specified with a prefix of "pg:" followed by a psycopg2 DSN string, like:

              "pg:dbname=shatag user=myuser password=mypassword host=192.168.1.3"

       -f, --force
              When running with -t or -u , force recompute the checksum and overwrite the old one, even if the timestamp indicates a good checksum.

       -h, --help
              Displays the help message

       -l, --lookup
              Instead  of  displaying  the checksums, look them up against the local database and indicate if the file exists. A yellow - mark indicates that the file does not exist somewhere else, a green =
              that the file exists at one or several remote locations, a red + that the file has a duplicate on the local system, and a magenta * that the file is empty.

       -L, --lookup-verbose
              Instead of displaying the checksums, look them up against the local database.  Print all the known remote locations for identical files.

       -n NAME, --name NAME
              Name of local storage (defaults to canonical local host name). This needs to be correct if the local database contains entries for this own host.

       -p, --put
              Record found tags in the database, for duplicate detection.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not display the valid checksums when they are found.

       -r, --recursive
              Recurse trough subdirectories

       -R NAME, --remote NAME
              When using -l or -L , This is used to restrict the set of remote names to consider. If present, other storages will be ignored.

       -s, --scrub
              Recompute the checksum even if the timestamp indicates it would not be needed, and report inconsistencies.  Useful to detect silent corruption.

       -t, --tag
              Compute new checksums for files that don't have one, or when it is outdated.

       -u, --update
              Recompute the outdated checksums only. Be aware that this can behave counter-intuitively; outdated checksums will only exists for files that have been appended to or partially  modified.   Many
              programs  dealing  with small files (some well-known text editors, notably) will overwrite the whole file when saving, and the new file will be lacking a checksum entirely. For these cases, use
              -t instead.

       -v, --verbose
              Report encoutered files that have an outated or missing checksum.

EXAMPLES
       Retag a whole directory and record everything to the database:
              shatag -pqrt .

       Check files in the current directory for remote duplicates:
              shatag -l

       Show alternate locations for duplicates of a single file:
              shatag -L somefile

FILES
       ~/.shatagrc
              YAML configuration file. Currently has only two possible configuration keys: "database", which sets the database path (by default, ~/.shatagdb) and "name" for the volume name  in  the  database
              (default to canonical host name.)

              Examples:

              database:  /var/lib/shatag.db    # sqlite3 backend database: "pg: dbname=shatag host=localhost user=shatag password=xxxsecretpasswordxxx"  # postgres backend database: http://service.com/shatag
              # http backend database: insecure-https://service.com/shatag  # http backend, skip ssl certificate verification

BUGS
       Support for non-ASCII filenames across systems of different and/or inconsistent encodings have not been fully tested.

       Not all option combinations are sensible.
