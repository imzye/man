NAME
       RoPkg::Exceptions - exceptions used by RoPkg packages

DESCRIPTION
       RoPkg::Exceptions is a collection of predefined exceptions used by all modules from RoPkg namespace.

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/perl

        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use RoPkg::Exceptions;

        sub main {
          eval {
            if ( $#ARGV == -1 ) {
              Param::Missing->throw('No parameter found');
            }
          };

          if ( my $e = Exception::Class->caught('Param::Missing') ) {
            print STDERR $e->message,$/,$e->trace,$/;
          }
        }

        main();

       It is very possible that you don't find a good reason for using exceptions from this example. And you are right. This example is kind of silly. But, try to
       use exceptions in a real project. Then, you will apreciate their real value.

DEPENDENCIES
       RoPkg::Exceptions require perl 5.008 or later and the Exception::Class module.

Exceptions List
       The following exceptions are defined in this class:

       *) General - general pourpose exception
       *) OutsideClass - raised when a method is called outside a class instance
       *) File - the base for all file related exceptions . This exception has the filename parameter, who can be used to specify the path to the file. filename
       parameter can be used by all derivated exceptions. The following exceptions are derivated from File:
             *) File::NotFound - the file was not found
             *) File::Open - error while opening file
             *) File::Create - could not create file
       *) Dir - the base for all directory related exceptions . This exception has the dirname parameter, who can be used to specify the path to the directory.
       dirname parameter can be used by all derivated exceptions. The following exceptions are derivated from Dir:
             *) Dir::NotFound - the directory was not found
             *) Dir::Open - error while opening directory
             *) Dir::Create - could not create directory
       *) Param - the base for all parameters related exceptions. This exception has the name parameter, who can be used to specify the parameter name. name can be
       used by all derivated exceptions. The following exceptions are derivated from Param:
             *) Param::Missing - the parameter was not found
             *) Param::Unknown - the parameter is unknown
             *) Param::Wrong - the parameter has the wrong value or is not defined
       *) DB - the base for all database related exceptions. This exception has the following parameters: dsn, user and pass . This exception (and the ones
       derivated from her) are mostly used in RoPkg::DB class. Of course, this doesn't means that you can't use them in your application ;) .The following
       exceptions are derivated from DB:
             *) DB::Connect - raised when the connection with the database could not be established
             *) DB::ConnExists - raised when a connection with the same name already exists.
             *) DB::ConnNotFound - the requested connection was not found
