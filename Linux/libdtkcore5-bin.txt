NAME
       qdbusxml2cpp-fix - Produces the C++ code to implement the interfaces defined in the input file

SYNOPSIS
       qdbusxml2cpp-fix [options...] [xml-or-xml-file] [interfaces...]

DESCRIPTION
       Produces the C++ code to implement the interfaces defined in the input file.

OPTIONS
       -a <filename>
              Write the adaptor code to <filename>

       -c <classname>
              Use <classname> as the class name for the generated classes

       -h     Show this information

       -i <filename>
              Add #include to the output

       -l <classname>
              When generating an adaptor, use <classname> as the parent class

       -m     Generate #include "filename.moc" statements in the .cpp files

       -N     Don't use namespaces

       -p <filename>
              Write the proxy code to <filename>

       -v     Be verbose.

       -V     Show the program version and quit.

       If the file name given to the options -a and -p does not end in .cpp or .h, the program will automatically append the suffixes and produce both files.  You can also use a colon (:) to separate the
       header name from the source file name, as in '-a filename_p.h:filename.cpp'.

       If you pass a dash (-) as the argument to either -p or -a, the output is written to the standard output
