NAME
       rbenv - Simple Ruby Version Management

USAGE
       Initialize rbenv for your acccount:

         $ rbenv init
         $ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc

         $ ruby -v
         ruby 2.4.0p0 (2016-12-24 revision 57164) [x86_64-linux]
         $ rbenv global system
         $ ruby -v
         ruby [whatever version of Ruby Debian provides by default]
