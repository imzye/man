NAME
       Text::Diff::FormattedHTML - Generate a colorful HTML diff of strings/files.

VERSION
       Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Diff::FormattedHTML;

           my $output = diff_files($file1, $file2);

           # for strings

           my $output = diff_strings( { vertical => 1 }, $file1, $file2);

           # as you might want some CSS:
           open OUT, ">diff.html";
           print OUT "<style type='text/css'>\n", diff_css(), "</style>\n";
           print OUT diff_files('fileA', 'fileB');
           close OUT;

DESCRIPTION
       Presents in a (nice?) HTML table the difference between two files or strings.  Inspired on GitHub diff view.

SUBROUTINES
   diff_files
          my $html = diff_files("filename1", "filename2");

       "diff_files" and "diff_strings" support a first optional argument (an hash reference) where options can be set.

       Valid options are:

       "vertical"
           Can be set to a true value, for a more compact table.

       "limit_onesided"
           Makes tables look nicer when there is a side with too many new lines.

   diff_strings
          my $html = diff_strings("string1", "string2");

       Compare strings. First split by newline, and then treat them as file content (see function above).

   diff_css
          my $css = diff_css;

       Return the default css. You are invited to override it.
