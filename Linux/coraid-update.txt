NAME
       coraid-update - upload an update file to a CORAID appliance

SYNOPSIS
       coraid-update {update file} {AoE device}

DESCRIPTION
       The coraid-update script performs a few sanity checks before copying the local update file to the remote update AoE target on the CORAID appliance.

       Two arguments are provided: 1) the name of the update file to be uploaded, and 2) the special block device file corresponding to the update target, e.g., /dev/etherd/e100.40.

       It generates no output and exits with a zero status when the update file has been successfully uploaded to the update target on the appliance.  Otherwise, an error message is printed to standard error
       and  coraid-update exits with a non-zero status.
