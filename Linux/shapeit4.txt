NAME
       shapeit4 - fast and accurate method for estimation of haplotypes (phasing)

SYNOPSIS
       shapeit4 [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Segmented  HAPlotype Estimation and Imputation Tools version 4 (SHAPEIT4).  SHAPEIT4 is a fast and accurate method for estimation of haplotypes (aka phasing) for SNP array and sequencing data.  It
       includes a Positional Burrow Wheeler Transform (PBWT) based approach to quickly select a small set of informative conditioning haplotypes to be used when updating the phase of an  individual.   It
       accounts  for  sets  of  pre-phased genotypes (i.e. haplotype scaffold).  The scaffold can be derived either from family data or large reference panels.  It reads and writes files using HTSlib for
       better I/O performance in either VCF or BCF formats.  The genotype graph and HMM routines have been re-implemented for better hardware usage and performance.
