NAME
       certmgr - Mono Certificate Manager (CLI version)

SYNOPSIS
       certmgr  [action]  [object  type] [options] store [filename] or certmgr
       -ssl [options] url

DESCRIPTION
       This tool allows to list, add, remove or extract certificates, certifi‐
       cate  revocation lists (CRL) or certificate trust lists (CTL) to/from a
       certificate store. Certificate stores are used to  build  and  validate
       certificate  chains for Authenticode(r) code signing validation and SSL
       server certificates.

STORES
       The store represents the certificate store to use. It can be one of the
       following:

       My     This is the personal certificate store.

       AddressBook
              This is the store for other people.

       CA     This is a store for intermediate certificate authorities.

       Trust  This is for trusted roots.

       Disallowed
              This is for untrusted roots

ACTIONS
       -list  List the certificates, CTL or CTL in the specified store.

       -add   Add a certificate, CRL or CTL to specified store. If filename is
              a pkcs12 or pfx file, and it contains a private key, it will  be
              imported to local key pair container.

       -del   Remove  a certificate, CRL or CTL from specified store. You must
              specify the object to be removed with it's hash value (and not a
              filename).  This  hash  value is shown when doing a -list on the
              store.

       -put   Copy a certificate, CRL or CTL from a store to a file.

       -ssl   Download and add the certificates from a SSL session. You'll  be
              asked to confirm the addition of every certificate received from
              the server. Note that SSL/TLS protocols do not requires a server
              to send the root certificate.  This action assumes a certificate
              (-c) object type and will import the certificates in appropriate
              stores  (i.e.  server  certificate in the OtherPeople store, the
              root certificate in the Trust store and any  other  intermediate
              certificates in the IntermediateCA store).

       -importKey
              Allows  importing  a private key from a pkcs12 file into a local
              key pair store. (Useful when you already have the  key's  corre‐
              sponding certificate installed at the specific store.)

OBJECT TYPES
       -c , -cert , -certificate
              Add,  Delete  or  Put  certificates.  That is the specified file
              must/will contain X.509 certificates in DER binary encoding.

       -crl   Add, Delete or Put certificate revocation lists (CRL).  That  is
              the  specified  file  must/will  contain X.509 CRL in DER binary
              encoding.

       -ctl   Add, Delete or Put certificate trust lists (CRL). UNSUPPORTED.

OPTIONS
       -m     Use the machine's certificate stores  (instead  of  the  default
              user's stores).

       -v     More details displayed on the console.

       -p password
              Use the specified password when accessing a pkcs12 file.

       -help , -h , -? , /?
              Display help about this tool.

FILES
       WARNING:  This  details  the  current behavior of Mono and could change
       between releases.  The only  safe  way  to  interact  with  certificate
       stores  is  to use the certmgr tool. The current releases of Mono keeps
       all the user certificate stores in separates directories under  ~/.con‐
       fig/.mono/certs/

       For  example  the  trusted  root  certificates for a user would be kept
       under
              ~/.config/.mono/certs/Trust/

       Certificates files are kept in DER (binary) format (extension .cer).

       The filenames either start with
              tbp (thumbprint) or ski (subject key identifier).

       The rest of the filename is the base64-encoded value (tbp or ski).

       Private key data is stored under
              ~/.config/.mono/keypairs/

EXAMPLES
       mono certmgr.exe -list -c -m Trust
              List all certificates in the machine Trust store. This will dis‐
              play the hash value for each certificate. This value can be used
              to identify uniquely a certificate  for  some  operations  (e.g.
              delete).              E.g.              Unique             Hash:
              FFA3AC0084DA1673B5A031EBB2156B3E8FBBF6D8

       mono        certmgr.exe        -del         -c         -m         Trust
       FFA3AC0084DA1673B5A031EBB2156B3E8FBBF6D8
              Remove  the certificate, represented by the hash value, from the
              machine Trust store. Note that the  machine  store  is  normally
              restricted.  The following error message will appear if the cur‐
              rent user doesn't have the minimum access rights to  remove  the
              certificate: Access to the machine 'Trust' certificate store has
              been denied.

       certmgr -ssl https://www.verisign.com
              Import certificates from www.verisign.com  used  for  HTTP  over
              SSL.   See   KNOWN  ISSUES  (MD2)  if  you're  downloading  from
              www.verisign.com.

       certmgr -ssl ldaps://www.nldap.com:636
              Import the certificates from www.nldap.com used for secure LDAP.
              This  works  even  if we don't know how to speak LDAP because we
              stop the communication shortly after the  SSL  handshake  (which
              gives us the certificate).

KNOWN ISSUES
       MD2    Some  Certificate Authorities (CA) old root certificates use the
              MD2 hash algorithm. MD2 is old enough not  to  be  part  of  the
              standard .NET framework.  This makes it impossible to validate a
              digital signature made with MD2. For this reason MD2 is included
              in  the  Mono.Security.dll  assembly. However the machine.config
              file must be updated so the OID for MD2 is known at runtime.

              To correct this insert the  following  XML  snippet  inside  the
              <configuration> element of your machine.config file.
