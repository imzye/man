NAME
       File::SearchPath - Search for a file in an environment variable path

SYNOPSIS
         use File::SearchPath qw/ searchpath /;

         $file = searchpath( 'libperl.a', env => 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' );
         $file = searchpath( 'my.cfg', env => 'CFG_DIR', subdir => 'ME' );

         $path = searchpath( $file, env => 'PATH', exe => 1 );
         $path = searchpath( $file, env => 'PATH', dir => 1 );

         $file = searchpath( 'ls', $ENV{PATH} );

         $exe = searchpath( 'ls' );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the ability to search a path-like environment variable for a file (that does not necessarily have to be an executable).

FUNCTIONS
       The following functions can be exported by this module.

       searchpath
           This is the core function. The only mandatory argument is the name of a file to be located. The filename should not be absolute although it can include directory specifications.

             $path = searchpath( $file );
             @matches = searchpath( $file );

           If  only  two arguments are provided, it is assumed that the second argument is a path-like string. This interface is provided for backwards compatibility with "File::SearchPath" version 0.01.
           It is not as portable as specifying the name of the environment variable. Note also that no specific attempt will be made to check whether the file is executable when the subroutine is  called
           in this way.

             $path = searchpath( $file, $ENV{PATH} );

           By default, this will search in $PATH for executable files and is equivalent to:

             $path = searchpath( $file, env => 'PATH', exe => 0 );

           Hash-like options can be used to alter the behaviour of the search:

           env     Name  of the environment variable to use as a starting point for the search. Should be a path-like environment variable such as $PATH, $LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc. Defaults to $PATH. An error
                   occurs if the environment variable is not set or not defined. If it is defined but contains a blank string, the current directory will be assumed.

           exe     If true, only executable files will be located in the search path.  If $PATH is being searched, the default is for this to be true. For all other environment variables the  default  is
                   false. If "dir" option is specified "exe" will always default to false.

           dir     If true, only directories will be located in the search path. Default is false. "dir" and "exe" are not allowed to be true in the same call. (triggering a croak() on error).

           subdir  If you know that your file is in a subdirectory of the path described by the environment variable, this direcotry can be specified here.  Alternatively, the path can be included in the
                   file name itself.

           In scalar context the first match is returned. In list context all matches are returned in the order corresponding to the directories listed in the environment variable.

           Returns undef (or empty list) if no match could be found.

           If an absolute file name is provided, that filename is returned if it exists and is readable, else undef is returned.

HISTORY
       "File::SearchPath" used to exist on CPAN (now on backpan) and was written by Robert Spier.  This version is completely new but retains an interface that is compatible with Robert's version. Thanks
       to Robert for allowing me to reuse this module name.

NOTES
       If "Env::Path" module is installed it will be used. This allows for more flexibility than simply assuming colon-separated paths.
