NAME
       yuy2topam - convert YUY2 bytes to PAM

SYNOPSIS
       yuy2topam

       -width=pixels -height=pixels [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       yuy2topam  reads  raw  YUY2  bytes as input and produces a PAM image as
       output.  The input file is just YUY2 bytes.  You have  to  specify  the
       width and height on the command line, since the program obviously can't
       get them from the file.

       The output image has maxval 255.
