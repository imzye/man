NAME
       twa - tiny web auditor with strong opinions

SYNOPSIS
       twa [-wvcsdV] DOMAIN

DESCRIPTION
       twa  takes a DOMAIN hosting a website and performs a short security audit.  It can be used to detect HTTP(S) issues, missing security headers, information-leaking headers, and other potential security
       hazards.

       twa takes only one DOMAIN at a time. If you need to audit multiple sites, run the program again.

OPTIONS
       -v     Verbose mode.

       -w     Perform the audit on the main DOMAIN and the www.  subdomain.

       -c     Emit output in CSV.

       -s     Run testssl-based checks (skipped by default)

       -d     Disable scanning common development ports

       -V     Print the version and exit.

       -h     Print a help message and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       NO_COLOR
              Don't colorize output, even when on a TTY.

       TWA_TIMEOUT
              The maximum length, in seconds, for internal curl calls.

       TWA_USER_AGENT
              The User-Agent to use for all curl calls.

       TWA_CURLOPTS
              Any additional options to pass to curl calls.

TEST RESULTS
       Each line of output describes the result of a single test, and follows the "RESULT(DOMAIN): explanation" format, where RESULT is one of the following:

       PASS   The test passed with flying colors.

       MEH    The test passed, but with one or more things that could be improved.

       FAIL   The test failed, and should be fixed.

       UNK    The server gave us something we didn't understand.

       SKIP   The server gave us something we understood, but that we don't handle yet.

       FATAL  A really important test failed, and should be fixed immediately.
