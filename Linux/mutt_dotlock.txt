NAME
       mutt_dotlock - Lock mail spool files.

SYNOPSIS
       mutt_dotlock [-t|-f|-u|-d] [-p] [-r retries] file

DESCRIPTION
       mutt_dotlock implements the traditional mail spool file locking method: To lock file, a file named file.lock is created. The program operates with group mail privileges if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -t     Just try.  mutt_dotlock won't actually lock a file, but inform the invoking process if it's at all possible to lock file.

       -f     Force the lock.  If another process holds a lock on file longer than a certain amount of time, mutt_dotlock will break that lock by removing the lockfile.

       -u     Unlock.  mutt_dotlock will remove file.lock.

       -d     Delete.  mutt_dotlock will lock file, remove it if it has length 0, and afterwards remove file.lock.

       -p     Use privileges.  If given this option, mutt_dotlock will operate with group mail privileges when creating and deleting lock files.

       -r retries
              This  command  line  option tells mutt_dotlock to try locking retries times before giving up or (if invoked with the -f command line option) break a lock.  The default value is 5.  mutt_dotlock
              waits one second between successive locking attempts.

FILES
       file.lock
              The lock file mutt_dotlock generates.

SEE ALSO
       fcntl(2), flock(2), lockfile(1), mutt(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
       mutt_dotlock gives all diagnostics in its return values:

       0 - DL_EX_OK
              The program was successful.

       1 - DL_EX_ERROR
              An unspecified error such as bad command line parameters, lack of system memory and the like has occurred.

       3 - DL_EX_EXIST
              The user wants to lock a file which has been locked by another process already.  If mutt_dotlock is invoked with the -f command line option, mutt_dotlock won't generate this  error,  but  break
              other processes' locks.

       4 - DL_EX_NEED_RPIVS
              This return value only occurs if mutt_dotlock has been invoked with the -t command line option.  It means that mutt_dotlock will have to use its group mail privileges to lock file.

       5 - DL_EX_IMPOSSIBLE
              This return value only occurs if mutt_dotlock has been invoked with the -t command line option.  It means that mutt_dotlock is unable to lock file even with group mail privileges.

NOTES
       mutt_dotlock tries to implement an NFS-safe dotlocking method which was borrowed from lockfile (1).

       If  the  user  can't open file for reading with his normal privileges, mutt_dotlock will return the DL_EX_ERROR exit value to avoid certain attacks against other users' spool files. The code carefully
       avoids race conditions when checking permissions; for details of all this see the comments in dotlock.c.

HISTORY
       mutt_dotlock is part of the Mutt mail user agent package.  It has been created to avoid running mutt with group mail privileges.
