USAGE
       You can simply start duf without any command-line arguments:

         $ duf

       If you supply arguments, duf will only list specific devices & mount points:

         $ duf /home /some/file

       If you want to list everything (including pseudo, duplicate, inaccessible file systems):

         $ duf --all

       You can show and hide specific tables:

         $ duf --only local,network,fuse,special,loops,binds

         $ duf --hide local,network,fuse,special,loops,binds

       You can also show and hide specific filesystems:

         $ duf --only-fs tmpfs,vfat

         $ duf --hide-fs tmpfs,vfat

       ...or specific mount points:

         $ duf --only-mp /,/home,/dev

         $ duf --hide-mp /,/home,/dev

       Wildcards inside quotes work:

         $ duf --only-mp '/sys/*,/dev/*'

       Sort the output:

         $ duf --sort size

       Valid keys are: mountpoint, size, used, avail, usage, inodes, inodes_used, inodes_avail, inodes_usage, type, filesystem.

       Show or hide specific columns:

         $ duf --output mountpoint,size,usage

       Valid keys are: mountpoint, size, used, avail, usage, inodes, inodes_used, inodes_avail, inodes_usage, type, filesystem.

       List inode information instead of block usage:

         $ duf --inodes

       If duf doesn't detect your terminal's colors correctly, you can set a theme:

         $ duf --theme light

       duf highlights the availability & usage columns in red, green, or yellow, depending on how much space is still available. You can set your own thresholds:

         $ duf --avail-threshold="10G,1G"

         $ duf --usage-threshold="0.5,0.9"

       If you prefer your output as JSON:

         $ duf --json
