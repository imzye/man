NAME
       gerbv - Gerber Viewer

SYNOPSIS
       gerbv [OPTIONS] [gerberfile[s]]

DESCRIPTION
       gerbv is a viewer for RS274-X, commonly known as Gerber, files.  RS274-X files are generated from different PCB CAD programs and are used in the printed circuit board manufacturing process.  gerbv
       also supports Excellon/NC drill files as well as XY (centroid) files produced by the program PCB (http://pcb.geda-project.org/).

OPTIONS
       Warning!  On some platforms, which hasn't long option available, only short options are available.

   gerbv General options:
       -V|--version Print the version number of gerbv and exit.

       -h|--help
              Print a brief usage guide and exit.

       -b<hex>|--background=<hex>
              Use background color <hex>. <hex> is specified as an html-color code, e.g. #FF0000 for Red.

       -f<hex>|--foreground=<hex>
              Use  foreground color <hex>. <hex> is specified as an html-color code, e.g. #00FF00 for Green. If a user also wants to set the alpha (rendering with Cairo) it can be specified as an #RRGGB‐
              BAA code. Use multiple -f flags to set the color for multiple layers.

       -l <filename>|--log=<filename>
              All error messages etc are stored in a file with filename <filename>.

       -t <filename>|--tools=<filename>
              Read Excellon tools from the file <filename>.

       -p <project filename>|--project=<project filename>
              Load a stored project. Please note that the project file must be stored in the same directory as the Gerber files.

   gerbv Export-specific options:
       The following commands can be used in combination with the -x flag:

       -B<b>|--border=<b>
              Set the border around the image <b> percent of the width and height.  Default <b> is 5%.

       -D<XxY>or<R>|--dpi=<XxY>or<R>
              Resolution (Dots per inch) for the output bitmap. Use <XxY> for different resolutions for the width and height (only when compiled with Cairo as render engine). Use <R>  to  have  the  same
              resolution in both directions.  Defaults to 72 DPI in both directions.

       -T<XxYrR|X;YrR>|--translate=<XxYrR|X;YrR>
              Translate  image  by X and Y and rotate by R degree. Use multiple -T flags to translate multiple files. Distance defaults to inches but may be changed with --units.  Only evaluated when ex‐
              porting as RS274X or drill.

       -O<XxY|X;Y>|--origin=<XxY|X;Y>
              Set the lower left corner of the exported image to coordinate <XxY>.  Coordinates defaults to inches but may be changed with --units.

       -a|--antialias
              Use antialiasing for the generated output-bitmap.

       -o <filename>|--output=<filename>
              Export to <filename>.

       -u<inch/mm/mil>|--units=<inch/mm/mil>
              Use given unit for coordinates. Default to inches.

       -W<WxH>|--window_inch=<WxH>
              Window size in inches <WxH> for the exported image.

       -w<WxH>|--window=WxH>
              Window size in pixels <WxH> for the  exported image. Autoscales to fit if no resolution is specified (note that the default 72 DPI also changes in that case). If a resolution is  specified,
              it will clip the image to this size.

       -x<png/pdf/ps/svg/rs274x/drill>|--export=<png/pdf/ps/svg/rs274x/drill>
              Export to a file and set the format for the output file.

GENERAL
       When you start gerbv you can give the files to be loaded on the command line, either as each file separated with a space or by using wildcards.

       The  user  interface is graphical. Simply press and drag middle mouse button (scroll wheel) and the image will pan as you move the mouse. To manipulate a layer, right-click on one of the rightmost
       list items. That will bring up a pop-up menu where you can select what you want to do with that layer (reload file, change color, etc).

       If you hold the mouse button over one the rightmost button a tooltips will show you the name of the file loaded on that layer.

ACTIVATION AND DEACTIVATION OF LAYERS
       You can load several files at one time. You can then turn displaying of the layers on and off by clicking on one of check boxes near the layer names.

       You can also control this from the keyboard. Press Ctrl, enter the number on the layer you want activate/deactivate on the numerical keypad and then release the Ctrl key.

ALIGNING OF LAYERS
       You can align two layers by selected elements. Select one element on each of two layers and click Align layers from context menu.

ZOOMING
       Zooming can be handled by either menu choices, keypressing or mouse scroll wheel. If you press z you will zoom in and if you press Shift+z (i.e. Z) you will zoom out. Scroll wheel works if you en‐
       abled that in your X server and mapped it to button 4 and 5. You can make the image fit by pressing f (there is also a menu alternative for this). If Pan, Zoom, or Measure Tool is selected you can
       press right mouse button for zoom in, and if you press Shift and right mouse button you will zoom out.

       You can also do zooming by outline. Select Zoom Tool, press mouse button, draw, release. The dashed line shows how the zooming will be dependent on the resolution of  the  window.  The  non-dashed
       outline  will show what you actually selected. If you change your mind when started to mark outline, you can always abort by pressing escape. By holding down the Shift key when you press the mouse
       button, you will select an area where the point you started at will be the center of your selection.

MEASUREMENTS
       You can do measurement on the image displayed. Select Measure Tool, the cursor changes to a plus. By using left mouse button you can draw the lines that you want to measure. The result of the last
       measurement is also displayed on the statusbar. All measurements are in the drawing until you select other Tool.  To measure distance between elements select two of  them  and  switch  to  Measure
       Tool.

       The  statusbar  shows the current mouse position on the layer in the same coordinates as in the file. I.e. if you have (0,0) in the middle of the image in the Gerber files, the statusbar will show
       (0,0) at the same place.

SUPERIMPOSING
       When you load several Gerber files, you can display them "on top of each other", i.e. superimposing. The general way to display them are that upper layers cover the layers beneath, which is called
       copy (GTK+ terms).

       The other ways selectable are and, or, xor and invert. They map directly to corresponding functions in GTK. In GTK they are described as: "For colored images, only GDK_COPY, GDK_XOR and GDK_INVERT
       are generally useful. For bitmaps, GDK_AND and GDK_OR are also useful."

PROJECTS
       gerbv can also handle projects. A project consist of bunch of loaded layers with their resp. color and the background color. The easiest way to create a project is to load all files you want  into
       the layer you want, set all the colors etc and do a "Save Project As...".

       You load a project either from the menu bar or by using the commandline switches -p or --project.

       Currently there is a limit in that the project file must be in the same directory as the Gerber files to be loaded.

SCHEME
       The project files are simple Scheme programs that is interpreted by a built in Scheme interpreter. The Scheme interpreter is TinyScheme and needs a Scheme program called init.scm to initialize it‐
       self.  The  search path for init.scm is (in the following order) /usr/share/gerbv/scheme, the directory with the executable gerbv, the directory gerbv was invoked from and finally according to the
       environment variable GERBV_SCHEMEINIT.

TOOLS FILE
       Not every Excellon drill file is self-sufficient. Some CADs produce .drd files where tools are only referenced, but never defined (such as what diameter of the tool is.) Eagle CAD is one  of  such
       CADs, and there are more since many board houses require Tools files.

       A Tools file is a plain text file which you create in an editor. Each line of the file describes one tool (the name and the diameter, in inches):

            T01 0.024
            T02 0.040
            ...

       These  are  the same tools (T01 etc.) that are used in the Drill file.  A standard practice with Eagle is to create an empty Tools file, run the CAM processor, and the error report tells you which
       tools you "forgot".  Then you put these tools into the file and rerun the CAM processor.

       You load a tool file by using the commandline switches -t or --tools.  The file can have any name you wish, but Eagle expects the file type to be ".drl", so it makes sense to  keep  it  this  way.
       Some board houses are still using CAM software from DOS era, so you may want to exercise caution before going beyond the 8.3 naming convention.

       When  gerbv reads the Tools file it also checks that there are no duplicate definitions of tools. This does happen from time to time as you edit the file by hand, especially if you, during design,
       add or remove parts from the board and then have to add new tools into the Tools file. The duplicate tools are a very serious error which will stop (HOLD) your board until you fix the  Tools  file
       and  maybe  the Excellon file. gerbv will detect duplicate tools if they are present, and will exit immediately to indicate such a fatal error in a very obvious way. A message will also be printed
       to standard error.

       If your Excellon file does not contain tool definitions then gerbv will preconfigure the tools by deriving the diameter of the drill bit from the tool number. This is probably not what  you  want,
       and you will see warnings printed on the console.

PICK&PLACE FILE
       Supported comma separated file (CSV) with fixed order of data:

            # X,Y in mils.
            Designator,"Description","Value",X,Y,"Rotation (deg)",top/bottom

            or

            Designator,"Footprint","Mid X","Mid Y","Ref X","Ref Y",
                      "Pad X","Pad Y",T/B,"Rotation","Comment"

       Units can be specified in format "# X,Y in mils." or as suffix for X/Y-coordinates, i.e ",10mil,". Supported units: in, mil, cmil, dmil, km, m, dm, cm, mm, um, nm.

ENVIRONMENT
       GERBV_SCHEMEINIT
              Defines where the init.scm file is stored. Used by scheme interpreter, which is used by the project reader.
