NAME
       tempest_for_eliza - play your music with your computer monitor and AM radio

SYNOPSIS
       tempest_for_eliza pixelclock x 1000000 HDisplay VDisplay HTotal VTotal * radio frequency play mode amplification filename

DESCRIPTION
       This program displays patterns on a computer monitor that can produce musical tones on AM radios tuned to the proper frequency.

OPTIONS
       pixelclock x 1000000, HDisplay, VDisplay, HTotal, and VTotal all should be the same each time for your monitor.  Use the xvidtune(1) application to determine these values.

       As the name suggests, for the pixelclock parameter multiply the result given by xvidtune(1) by 1000000.

       A usual sensible value for radio frequency is 10000000, or 10Mhz.

USAGE
       In order to play custom music, it needs to be converted.  For this, see /usr/share/doc/tempest-for-eliza/mksong.sh.

AUTHORS
