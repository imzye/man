NAME
       pimd — PIM-SM/SSM v2 dynamic multicast routing daemon

SYNOPSIS
       pimd [-fhlNqr] [-c FILE] [-d [SYS[,SYS,...]] [-s LEVEL]

DESCRIPTION
       pimd  is  a lightweight, stand-alone PIM-SM/SSM v2 multicast routing daemon available under the free 3-clause BSD license.  This is the restored original from University of Southern California, by
       Ahmed Helmy, Rusty Eddy and Pavlin Ivanov Radoslavov.

       Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM):
       •  maintains the traditional IP multicast service model of receiver-initiated membership;
       •  uses explicit joins that propagate hop-by-hop from members' directly connected routers toward the distribution tree.
       •  builds a shared multicast distribution tree centered at a Rendezvous Point (RP), and then builds source-specific trees for those sources whose data traffic warrants it.
       •  is not dependent on a specific unicast routing protocol; and
       •  uses soft-state mechanisms to adapt to underlying network conditions and group dynamics.

       The robustness, flexibility, and scaling properties of this architecture make it well suited to large heterogeneous internetworks.

       pimd originally only implemented RFC2362, but since v2.3.0 is supporting more and more of RFC4601.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual UNIX command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  The options are as follows:

       -h, --help
               Print a help message and exit.

       -c, --config=FILE
               Specify an alternative configuration file, default /etc/pimd.conf.  If pimd cannot find its configuration file it will  start  up  with  fallback  defaults,  which  include  enabling  both
               bsr-candidate and rp-candidate.

       -d, --debug[=SYS[,SYS...]
               By  default, pimd daemonizes itself by detaching from the invoking terminal and forking to the background.  However, if -d, --debug or -f, --foreground is specified, pimd runs in the fore‐
               ground of the starting terminal.  If -d is given without any argument pimd defaults to debug all subystems.

               Available subsystems are:

                     packet      Debug inbound/outbout packets
                     prunes      Pruning operations, or pruned routes
                     routes      Routing messages
                     rtdetail    Detailed routing information
                     peers       Neighbor gossip
                     cache       Debug routing cache
                     timeout     Debug timeouts
                     interface   Show interface (VIF) debug messages
                     groups      Debug group memberships
                     mtrace      Multicast traceroute information
                     igmp        Debug IGMP messages
                     icmp        Debug ICMP messages
                     rsrr        Debug RSRR messages
                     pim         All PIM messages
                     pim_routes  PIM routing messages
                     pim_bsr     PIM bootstrap router messages
                     pim_detail  Detailed PIM debug
                     pim_hello   Debug hello messages to/from neighbors

       -f, --foreground
               Run in the foreground, do not detach from calling terminal and do not fork to background.  Useful not only when debugging (above) but also when running under a process monitor like daemon‐
               tools, runit, finit, or systemd.

       -l, --reload-config
               Tell a running pimd to reload its configuration.  This is done by sending a SIGHUP to the PID listed in /var/run/pimd.pid.  Depending on the capabilities of your user, you may need  to  be
               root to do this.

       -N, --disable-vifs
               This  prevents pimd from being activated on all interfaces by default.  When this command line option is given, use `phyint IFNAME enable` to selectively activate PIM services on an inter‐
               face.

       -q, --quit-daemon
               Tell a running pimd to quit.  Similar to -l, --reload-config but this command sends SIGTERM.  Depending on the capabilities of your user, you may need to be root to do this.

       -r, --show-routes
               Show state of VIFs and multicast routing tables. This is command sends SIGUSR1 to a running pimd, similar to -l --reload-config. Depending on the capabilities of your user, you may need to
               be root to do this.

       -v, --version
               Show pimd version

       -s, --loglevel=LEVEL
               Set log level to one of the following, default notice:

                     none     Disable all logging
                     error    Error conditions
                     warning  Warning conditions
                     notice   Normal but significant condition (Default)
                     info     Informational
                     debug    Debug-level messages

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration is kept in the file /etc/pimd.conf.  The file format is relatively free-form: whitespace (including newlines) is not significant.  However, the order of some statements  are  im‐
       portant, see more below.

       All <masklen> arguments to an IPv4 address, group or network can also be given in the alternative /CIDR format.  E.g., <group>/<masklen>.

       Here are the different configuration settings:

             default-route-distance <1-255>

             default-route-metric <1-1024>

             igmp-query-interval <1-65535>

             igmp-querier-timeout <8-65535>

             hello-interval <30-18724>

             phyint <address | ifname>
                   [disable | enable] [igmpv2 | igmpv3]
                   [dr-priority <1-4294967294>]
                   [ttl-threshold <1-255>] [distance <1-255>] [metric <1-1024>]
                   [altnet <network> [/<masklen> | masklen <masklen>]]
                   [scoped <network> [/<masklen> | masklen <masklen>]]

             bsr-candidate [address | ifname] [priority <number>]

             rp-candidate [address | ifname] [priority <0-255>] [time <10-16384>]
                   group-prefix <group>[/<masklen> | masklen <masklen>]
                    ...
                   group-prefix ...

             rp-address <address> [<group-addr>[/<masklen> | masklen <masklen]

             spt-threshold [rate <KBPS> | packets <NUM> | infinity] [interval <SEC>]

       By  default,  pimd  will  be activated on all multicast capable interfaces.  The phyint setting and the -N, --disable-vifs command line option control this behaviour.  More on the phyint interface
       configuration setting below.

       The default-route-distance option has nothing to do with the system default route, it is rather the default value for the unicast routing protocol's administrative distance.  It is used in PIM As‐
       sert elections to determine upstream routers.  Currently pimd cannot obtain the admin distance and metric from the unicast routing protocols, so a default routing protocol distance (the  RFC  con‐
       fusingly  refers  to  this  as metric prefererence) may be configured.  In a PIM Assert election, the router advertising the lowest assert preference will be selected as the forwarder and upstream
       router for the LAN.  Setting 101 should be sufficiently high so that asserts from Cisco or GateD routers are preferred over poor-little pimd.

       It is reccommended that distances be set such that metrics are never consulted.  However, default routing metrics may also be set using the default-route-metric option.  (Again, this  has  nothing
       to  do with the system default route.)  This item sets the cost for sending data through this router.  You want only PIM-SM data to go to this daemon; so once again, a high value is recommended to
       prevent accidental usage.  The preferred default value is 1024.  Both defaults can be overridden per phyint, so learned routes, or PIM Asserts use the phyint's values.

       Please also note that PIM Assert elections are not the same as the DR election.  The PIM Assert election determines the active multicast forwarder, whereas the DR election  determines  the  active
       PIM router.

       Two settings for IGMP behavior are available: igmp-query-interval and igmp-querier-timeout which are similar, but very different.  The former controls the interval between IGMP querys when elected
       as  querier,  the  latter  controls  the timeout for the elected querier -- before pimd decides to take over.  In IGMP the lowest numerical address in a LAN becomes the elected querier.  Obviously
       these settings must be handled with care.  The RFC recommends that the querier timeout is set to a robustness value times the query interval, plus have the query response time.  The  pimd  robust‐
       ness  value  for  IGMP  is  3  and the default query response time is 10 sec.  Since pimd v2.3.0 the default query interval is 12 sec, which makes the querier timeut default to 41 sec, but this is
       rounded off to 42 to honor the late Douglas Adams.

       The PIM Hello message interval can be tuned by changing the hello-interval setting.  Changing this value also affects the hold-time value included in Hello messages.  The hold-time  value  is  3.5
       times hello-interval.  The default value for the Hello interval is 30 sec.  Anything less than 30 sec is considered an "aggressive" setting and is unsupported.

       The  phyint option refers to a physical interface and must come after default-route-metric and default-route-distance.  Select the interface either by its IP address or interface name ifname (e.g.
       eth0).  If you just want to activate this interface with default values, you don't need to put anything else on the line.  However, there are some additional settings:
             •  disable: Do not send PIM-SM traffic through this interface nor listen for PIM-SM traffic from this interface.  Default: enable.  enable: Selectively enable which interfaces to send PIM-SM
                traffic through.  Useful with the -N command line option.
             •  igmpv2: Force interface to use IGMPv2, or
             •  igmpv3: Use IGMPv3, this is the default since v2.3.0.
             •  dr-priority <1-4294967294>: When there are multiple PIM routers on the same LAN the DR is usually elected based on the highest numerical IP address.  This setting can be used  to  control
                the  DR  Priority option in PIM Hellow messages, which by default otherwise is 1.  When the DR Priority option is advertised by all PIM routers on the same LAN the highest priority router
                wins the DR election, regardless of its IP.  If any router does not advertise the DR Priority option, or the same priority is advertised by more than one router, the protocol  falls  back
                to using the IP address.
             •  ttl-threshold <1-255>: The TTL threshold for multicast frames to be forwarded from this interface.  Default: 1
             •  distance <1-255>: Use this to override the default-route-distance (101) on this phyint in PIM Assert elections.
             •  metric <1-1024>: The cost of sending data through this interface.  Defaults to default-route-metric (1024) if not assigned.
             •  altnet  <network/len>:  Alternative  host(s)/network(s) to accept as locally attached multicast sources on a given interface. If a phyint is attached to multiple IP subnets, describe each
                additional subnet with the altnet keyword.
             •  scoped <network/len>: Optional scoping of multicast groups. This allows interfaces to be configured as an administrative boundary for the specified group(s). Multicast  streams  belonging
                to the scoped groups will not be forwarded.

       Add  one  phyint  line  per interface on this router.  If you don't do this, pimd will either be completely silent (if you provide the -N command line option), or simply assume that you want it to
       utilize all interfaces using default settings.

       Both the bsr-candidate (CBSR) and rp-candidate (CRP) settings are enabled in the default configuration.  Disabling them, by commenting them out in the config file, for all PIM capable routers is a
       bad idea.  When troubleshooting, ensure at least one bootstrap router (BSR) and at least one rendez-vous point (RP) in PIM-SM, is available.  Both settings share the following options, with prior‐
       ity being interpreted differently:

             •  address | ifname: Optional local IPv4 address, or interface name to acquire address from.  If both address and ifname is left out, pimd will default to the highest active IP address.
             •  priority <0-255>: How important this router is compared to others.  For CRP, the lower the value the more important the router is considered.  For BSR it is of course the exact  opposite:
                a higher value is preferred.  If the priority is left out pimd and Cisco IOS defaults to 0 for both, but the standard says 192 for RP.
             •  time <10-16383>: The number of seconds to wait between advertising this CRP.  The default value is 30 seconds.  Use a lower value for faster convergence.

             The group-prefix sub-setting to rp-candidate is the set of multicast groups that the CRP will advertise to other routers, if it wins an election:
                   •  group: A specific multicast group or network range this router will handle.
                   •  masklen: Optional number of groups, in prefix length format. Remember that a multicast address is a Class D and has a netmask of 240.0.0.0, which means its length is 4.

             Multiple lines of group-prefix may be given, but max number of records supported in pimd is 255.

       The  rp-address  setting  is for static rendezvous point (RP) configurations.  It defines the RP for a given group, or range or groups.  The argument can be either a unicast address or a multicast
       group, with an optional group address and netmask.  Default group and netmask is 224.0.0.0/16.  Note: all static RP's are announced with priority 1.

       The spt-threshold setting replaces two older configuration settings, switch_data_threshold and switch_register_threshold.  It controls the switch-over from the shared  tree  to  the  shortest-path
       source tree.  The default is to do the switch-over after the first packet, but only after 100 seconds.  If infinity is specified the shortest path switch-over is disabled.

SIGNALS
       pimd responds to the following signals:

       HUP   Restarts pimd.  The configuration file is reread every time this signal is evoked.
       TERM  Terminates execution gracefully (i.e. by sending good-bye messages to all neighboring routers).
       INT   The same as TERM.
       USR1  Dumps the internal state of VIFs and multicast routing tables to /var/run/pimd/pimd.dump.  See also the -r, --show-routes option above.

       For convenience in sending signals, pimd writes its process ID to /var/run/pimd.pid upon startup.
