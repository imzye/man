NAME
       monado-gui — GUI tool for configuring and testing Monado

SYNOPSIS
       monado-gui

DESCRIPTION
       monado-gui is a tool to configure, test, and debug Monado on a system.

       It  takes  no arguments, and spawns a main menu window with a number of buttons.  Some options may spawn a number of sub-windows.  These may be overlapping initially, and should be moved to reveal
       them all clearly.

       Calibrate
                Choosing "Calibrate" from the main menu will walk you through selecting a camera device and choosing calibration details.  You will need a calibration test target in a  "checkerboard"  or
                "asymmetric dots" pattern (see the OpenCV documentation for more information on these) printed very precisely in high contrast on a rigid surface.

       Debug Test
                Choosing  "Debug  Test" from the main menu will probe and start all devices, showing you debug information on many of them.  The debug views and controls available vary based on available
                devices.

NOTES
       The GUI available through "Debug Test" may also be available while running an OpenXR-based application using Monado, by setting the environment variable OXR_DEBUG_GUI to ON.

EXIT STATUS
       The monado-gui utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
