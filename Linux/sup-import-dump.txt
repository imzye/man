NAME
       sup-import-dump - import message state dump to Sup index

SYNOPSIS
       sup-import-dump [options] dumpfile

DESCRIPTION
       Imports message state previously exported by sup-dump into the index.  sup-import-dump operates on the index only, so the messages must have already been added using sup-sync.  If you need to recreate
       the index, see sup-sync --restore instead.

       Messages not mentioned in the dump file will not be modified.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Print message ids as they’re processed

       -i, --ignore-missing
              Silently skip over messages that are not in the index

       -w, --warn-missing
              Warn about messages that are not in the index, but continue

       -a, --abort-missing
              Abort on encountering messages that are not in the index (default)

       -t, --atomic
              Use transaction to apply all changes atomically

       -n, --dry-run
              Don’t actually modify the index.  Probably only useful with --verbose

       --version
              Show version information

       -h, --help
              Show help message
