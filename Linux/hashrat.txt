NAME
       hashrat - hashing tool supporting several hashes and recursivity

SYNOPSIS
       hashrat [options] [paths to hash]

       hashrat -c [options] [input file of hashes]

DESCRIPTION
       Hashrat  is a hash-generation utility that supports the md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, whirlpool, jh-224, jh256, jh-384 and jh-512 hash functions, and also the HMAC versions of those functions. It can
       output in traditional format (same as md5sum and shasum and the like) or its own format.

       Hashes can be output in octal, decimal, hexadecimal, uppercase hexadecimal and various types of base32 and base64.

       Hashrat also supports directory recursion, hashing entire devices, and generating a hash for an entire directory. It has a CGI mode that can be used as a web-page to lookup hashes.

              Truncate hashes to <length> bytes.

       -c     CHECK hashes against list from file (or stdin).

       -cf    CHECK hashes but only show failures.

       -C <dir>
              CHECK files under dir recursively against a list from file (or stdin). This can detect 'new' files

       -Cf <dir>
              CHECK files under dir recursively against a list from file (or stdin). This can detect 'new' files. Only show failures.

       -m     MATCH files from a list read from stdin.

       -lm    Read hashes from stdin, upload them to a memcached server (requires the -memcached option).

       -memcached <server>, -mcd <server>
              Specify memcached server. This option overrides reading list from stdin if used with -m, -c or -cf.

       -h <script>
              -hook <script> Script to run when a file fails CHECK mode, or is found in MATCH mode. Script is passed the filename as an argument. In 'find duplicates' mode a second file name (the  dupli‐
              cate) will be passed as the second argument.

       -color Use ANSI color codes on output when checking hashes.

       -S, -strict
              Strict mode: when checking, check file mtime, owner, group, and inode as well as its hash.

       -d     Dereference (follow) symlinks.

       -fs    Stay one filesystem.

       -dir   -dirmode DirMode: read all files in directory and create one hash for them (implies -r).

       -devmode
              DevMode: read from a file EVEN IF IT'S A DEVNODE.

       -lines Read lines from stdin and hash each line independently.

       -rl, -rawlines
              Read lines from stdin and hash each line independently, INCLUDING any trailing whitespace. This is compatible with 'echo text | md5sum'.

       -cgi   Run in HTTP CGI mode.

       -xdialog
              Run in 'xdialog' (zenity, yad or qarama) mode.

       -dialog-types
              Specify a list of dialog commands and use the first found on the system. Default is 'yad,zenity,qarma'.

       -iprefix <prefix>
              String to prefix all input before hashing

       -oprefix <prefix>
              Prefix to add to the front of output hashes

       -net   Treat  'file'  arguments  as  either  ssh or http URLs, and pull files over the network and then hash them (allows hashing of files on remote machines).  URLs are in the format ssh://[user‐
              name]:[password]@[host]:[port] or http://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port].

       -idfile <path>
              Path to a ssh private key file to use to authenticate INSTEAD OF A PASSWORD when pulling files via ssh.

       -xattr Use eXtended file ATTRibutes. In hash mode, store hashes in the file attributes. In check mode compare against hashes stored in file attributes.

       -txattr
              Use TRUSTED eXtended file ATTRibutes. In hash mode, store hashes in trusted file attributes. The trusted attributes can only be read and written by root. Under FreeBSD this  means  'SYSTEM'
              attributes.

       -cache Use hashes stored in user xattr if they're younger than the mtime of the file. This speeds up outputting hashes. When storing xattr hashes, do not update files that already have the correct
              hash.

       -u <types>
              Update.  In  checking  mode,  update hashes for the files as you go. The <types> is a comma-separated list of things to update, which can be xattr memcached or a file name. This will update
              these targets with the hash that was found at the time of checking.

       -hide-input
              When reading data from stdin in linemode, set the terminal to not echo characters, thus hiding typed input.

       -xsel  Update X11 clipboard and primary selections to the current hash. This works using Xterm command sequences. The xterm resource 'allowWindowOps' must be set to 'true' for this to work.

       -star-input
              When reading data from stdin in linemode replace characters with stars.

NOTES
       Hashrat can also detect if it's being run under any of the following names (e.g., via symlinks):

       md5sum Run with '-trad -md5'.

       shasum Run with '-trad -sha1'.

       sha1sum
              Run with '-trad -sha1'.

       sha256sum
              Run with '-trad -sha256'.

       sha512sum
              Run with '-trad -sha512'.

       jh224sum
              Run with '-trad -jh224'.

       jh256sum
              Run with '-trad -jh256'.

       jh384sum
              Run with '-trad -jh384'.

       jh512sum
              Run with '-trad -jh512'.

       whirlpoolsum
              Run with '-trad -whirl'.

       hashrat.cgi
              Run in web-enabled 'cgi mode'.

EXAMPLES
       hashrat
              Generate a md5 hash of data read from stdin  (default hash type is md5).

       hashrat -jh256
              Generate a jh-256 hash of data read from stdin.

       hashrat -sha256 -64
              Generate a sha-256 hash of data read from stdin, output with base64 encoding.

       hashrat -sha256 -64 -lines
              Read lines from stdin, and generate a sha-256 with base64 encoding FOR EVERY LINE. This strips any whitespace from the end of the line (including \r and/or \n line terminators).

       hashrat -md5 -trad -rawlines
              Read lines from stdin, and generate a md5 hash in traditional format for every line INCLUDING TRAILING WHITESPACE.  This is compatible with 'echo text | md5sum', where text is one line,  as
              echo adds a newline to the end of the text it outputs.

       hashrat -type sha256,whirl,md5 -64
              Generate a sha-256 hash of data read from stdin, then hash the result with whirlpool, then with md5.

       hashrat *
              Generate a list of hashes for files in the current directory (default hash type is md5).

       hashrat -r -sha1 * > hashes.sha1
              Generate a list of hashes for files in the current directory, AND ALL SUBDIRECTORIES, using sha1 hashing.

       cat hashes.sha1 | hashrat -c
              Check hashes listed in hashes.sha1.

       cat hashes.sha1 | hashrat -c -strict
              Check  hashes  listed in hashes.sha1. If hashes are NOT in traditional format than the -strict flag will cause hashrat to check the files uid, gid, size, mtime and inode and print a failure
              message if any of those don't match.

       cat hashes.sha1 | hashrat -cf
              Check hashes listed in hashes.sha1 but only output failures.

       cat APT1.md5 | hashrat -m -r /
              Read a list of hashes from stdin and search recursively for files matching them.

       cat APT1.md5 | hashrat -lm -memcached 127.0.0.1
              Read a list of hashes from stdin, and register them in a memcached server.

       hashrat -m -memcached 127.0.0.1 -r /
              Search recursively for files whose hashes are stored in a memcached server.

       hashrat -devmode -whirlpool -64 /dev/sda1
              Generate a whirlpool hash of the entire device /dev/sda1. Output result in base 64.

       hashrat -sha1 -net ssh:user:password@myhost/bin/*
              Generate sha1 hashes of files in /bin/* on the remote machine 'myhost'.

       hashrat -whirlpool -net http://myhost.com/webpage.html
              Generate whirlpool hash for the listed URL. Note, many webpages have dynamic content that changes every time, so this will only return the same hash over and over if the page is static  and
              doesn't change.

       hashrat -dups -r /home -u xattr
              Search for duplicate files under /home. Update hashes stored in filesystem attributes as you go.

USES FOR HASHRAT
       1)  Strong Passwords

       Hashrat  can be used to generate strong passwords for websites. So, you don't have to remember the strong password, if it be always regenerate with hashrat.  You need to remember a handful of mod‐
       erately decent passwords, i.e., things that I can't find by grepping in the '10,000 most popular passwords' list[1], and an additional personal pin. Now, you need to combine the website name,  one
       of passwords, and the personal pin, into a string and feed them into hashrat:

           $ echo "facebook.com password 1234" | hashrat -sha1 -64

       Obviously,  a good password isn't 'password' and a good pin isn't '1234', but you get the idea. This gives a 28-character string that should take "8.02 trillion centuries" to crack with a "massive
       cracking array", according to Steve Gibson's Password haystacks utility[2]. This is what I then use as my password. Unfortunately some websites won't take a 28-character password,  and  for  these
       you can truncate to the appropriate length (using the -n flag), but the results are still stronger than anything you could remember, and nothing needs storing on disk (as with password managers).

       There  are some dangers to using the 'echo' method shown above if you are on a shared machine, or if someone gets hold of your computer/harddrive. On a shared machine someone could type 'ps ax' to
       see all commands running, and if they time it right, they might see your command-line with your password in it. Another danger lies in using a shell (like bash) that will record  your  typed  com‐
       mands  so you can recall them later. Bash stores this information on disk in the file .bash_history, so if you use the 'echo' method shown above your password will be saved on disk. To combat this
       hashrat has line mode:

           $ hashrat -sha1 -64 -lines

       This reads lines from stdin, so type into hashrat and then press ENTER, and you'll be given the hash of the line you typed. By this method your password is neither visible in 'ps ax', nor is  ever
       stored on disk.

       A  -lines  will  produce  a different hash to the 'echo' method listed above, because it strips any trailing whitespace off the lines read. If you want strict compatibility with 'echo' (by default
       echo adds a newline to the end of the text to output) then use rawlines mode:

           $ hashrat -sha1 -64 -rawlines

       Finally, you can prevent shoulder-surfers seeing you type your password by using the -hide-input or -star-input options to hide what you type.

           [2] https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm

       2)  Watching for file changes

       Like md5sum/shasum etc, hashrat can be used to detect changes in files that might indicate malicious activity. For instance, in order to get early warning of malware like  cryptolocker  (that  en‐
       crypts  files  on  a  users disk, or on network shares, and then demands a ransom for file recovery) you can scatter about the disk a number of Canary files that should not change. You need record
       their hashes and regularly check them. If they change, you will know something is going on.

       Hashes generated by hashrat can be output to a file, or stored in extended file attributes, or in a memcached server.

           $ hashrat -sha256 -r . > /tmp/files.sha256

           $ hashrat -sha256 -r . -xattr

           $ hashrat -sha256 -r . -memcached

       Similarly these can then be used to check files later:

           $ cat /tmp/files.sha256 | hashrat -c -sha256

           $ hashrat -C . -sha256  -xattr

           $ hashrat -C /tmp -sha256  -memcached

       Note that -c checks only check the files in the supplied list. The -C flag instead checks all files in a directory (supplied on command line) and expects to find those in the list. This means that
       -C can find new files that aren't in the list, whereas -c can't.
       There is a slight difference between xattr/memcached checks and checks where a list is read from stdin. Currently when reading from stdin hashrat will ONLY check the files in the list. However, in
       -xattr and -memcached mode, it will check all files, outputting and error for those where no stored hash can be found. This is likely to change in the a future release, with the stdin method being
       brought into line with the others.

       3)  Finding files that match hashes

       Using the -m flag hashrat can be told to read a range of hashes from stdin, and then search for files matching those hashes. For Example:

           $ cat APT1-AppendixE-MD5s.txt | hashrat -r -m /usr

       The last command will search recursively under /usr for files with hashes matching those in APT1-AppendixE-MD5s.txt. The input on stdin must begin with a hash, anything written after the hash will
       be treated as a comment to be displayed if a file matching the hash is found.

       Hashtypes other than md5 can be used thusly:

           $ cat sha1-list.lst | hashrat -r -sha1 -m /usr

       Hashes can also be loaded into a memcached server, so that the same file list can be checked on a number of machines, without needing to store the hashlist on those machines. First you  need  load
       the hashes:

           $ cat APT1-AppendixE-MD5s.txt | hashrat -lm -memcached 192.168.1.5

       The last line loads the hashes to a memcached server at 192.168.1.5. You can then search against the memcached server by:

           $ hashrat -r -m -memcached 192.168.1.5 /usr

       4)  Find duplicate files

       Using the -dups flag (usually in combination with the -r recursive flag) hashrat can be set to search for duplicate files and output any found to stdout.

       5)  As an 'ls'

       Hashrat  outputs  a  file's name, type, mode, mtime, uid, gid and size, along with a hash. This allows it to be used as a kind of 'ls' by ftp style programs, listing all the details of a file, but
       with the added feature of a hash.

       6)  Hashing files on remote machines

       If run with the '-net' option, hashrat will treat paths starting with 'http://' or 'ssh://' differently, connecting to the target machine and pulling files off it  (hashrat  assumes  there  is  no
       hashing program on the remote machine, and that it must therefore download the files to hash them). For ssh paths wildcars are supported:

                 hashrat -net ssh://username:password@server/usr/bin/*

       7)  As a TOTP authenticator

       Hashrat can be used as a TOTP authenticator, and defaults to google-authenticator compatible codes.

                 hashrat -totp 3EK4LIB2553CUPA7DBXJMMKDCYTEA2IZA

HOOKSCRIPTS
         Hookscripts,  defined using the -h or -hook command-line options, are scripts that are run for each hashed item. -h and -hook options take an argument that is the path to the script. Hookscripts
       behave differently in different modes:

       Check Hashes mode.
              The hookscript is called if a file doesn't match its expected hash, or is not listed in the expected hashes. It is passed the path of the file.

       Locate files mode
              The hookscript is called if a file matches the hash to locate. It is passed the path of the file.

       Find duplicates mode
              The hookscript is called if a file is a duplicate of another file. It is passed the paths of both files.

CGI Mode
       If hashrat is run with the -cgi flag, or if it's run with a name of hashrat.cgi (either by renaming the hashrat executable, or via a symbolic link) it will output a webpage that  allows  users  to
       look up hashes over the web. This allows to look-up your strong passwords even if you don't have access to a local version of hashrat.

       CGI Mode can be configured using an options file. The file path is passed in the url, like this:
       hashrat.cgi?OptionsFile=/etc/hashrat.options

       If an options file is used, then CGI mode uses the options in the file as its defaults. The options file contains the following :

       HashType <type>      Type of hash to generate

       Encoding <type>      Type of encoding to use for outputted hash

       Line Ending <type>   Line ending to append to input text. This is for compatibility with command-line usage with "-rawlines". Options are "none", "lf", "crlf" or "cr", meaning "none", "newline",
       "carriage-return newline" and "carriage-return" respectively.

       OutputLength <len>   Crop output hash to length len "len"

       SegmentLength <len>  Break output up into segments of length "len"

       SegmentChar <char>   Separate output segments with character "char"

       NoOptions            Do not offer the user the options so they can change them. Just show an entry box to enter text.

       HideText             Hide inputted text (overrides any other config)

TOTP MODE
       Hashrat can be used as a TOTP (Time-based One Time Password) authenticator and defaults to google-authenticator compatible codes. The simplest use case is:

       hashrat -totp <secret>

       It's possible to change the hash, period/lifetime and number of digits in the TOTP code like so:

       hashrat -totp 3EK4LIB2553CUPA7DB -sha256 -period 90 -digits 8

CLIPBOARD OUTPUT
       Hashes  produced  in  standard-in  input  mode  and TOTP codes can be pushed to the system clipboard using the `-clip` option. This option first tries to find a command that can set the clipboard,
       searching for one of 'xsel', 'xclip' or 'pbcopy'. If it can't find any of these, it falls back to using xterm's built in clipboard setting method.

       Alternatively the `-xsel` option only attempts to use the xterm clipboard setting method.

       The default list of clipboard commands can be overridden using the `-clipcmd` option.

QRCODE OUTPUT
       Hashes produced in standard-in input mode and TOTP codes can be displayed as qrcodes using the `-qr` or `-qrcode` options. These options require the "qrencode" utility to be installed, and also an
       image viewer that can be used to display the qrcode image.

       By default hashrat searches for the following image viewers:

       imlib2_view,fim,feh,display,xv,phototonic,qimageviewer,pix,sxiv,qimgv,qview,nomacs,geeqie,ristretto,mirage,fotowall,links -g

       The default list of image viewers can be overridden using the `-viewcmd` option.

RENAME FILES
       The `-rename` option allows renaming files to include a hash in their filename. The filename format is `<name>-<hash>.<extn>`. For example:

       hashrat -p64 -md5 -rename main.c

       Will rename `main.c` to `main-gAmHI2oarRmpiXkE7MVK90.c`, where `gAmHI2oarRmpiXkE7MVK90` is it`s MD5 has encoded with the `p64` base-64 encoding scheme.

       The standard `-64` encoding scheme uses the `/` character, which is not allowed in a filename and results in renames failing. Thus the `-p64` or `-r64` encoding schemes should be used.

       Using the `-r` flag entire directories of files can be renamed in this manner:

       hashrat -p64 -md5 -rename -r myfiles

EXTENDED FILESYSTEM ATTRIBUTES
       Hashrat can use extended filesystem attributes where these are supported. This allows a hash to be stored in the filesystem metadata of the target file. This can then be used for checking  hashes,
       or  for  caching  hashes to produce faster output during hashing runs. There are two types of filesystem attribute, trusted attributes, which can only be set and read by root, and user attributes,
       which can be set and read by any user that has the appropriate permissions for the file.

       Hashes can be stored against files by using the -xattr option to set user attributes:

           $ hashrat -sha256 -r . -xattr

       And using the -txattr flag to set trusted attributes (you must be root to set trusted attributes):

           # hashrat -sha256 -r . -txattr

       When checking either flag can be used, but hashrat will always use trusted attributes when running as root, if those are available, otherwise it will fall back to user attributes.

           $ hashrat -c -sha256 -r . -xattr

       The -cache option allows using stored hashes rather than regenerating hashes. It only considers hashes stored in user attributes at current.

           $ hashrat -r . -cache

       This makes getting a report of hashes considerably faster, but it runs the risk that the hashes may not be accurate. Hashrat will only output a hash stored in file attributes if the  storage  time
       of the hash is younger than the modify time (mtime) of the file, however, this means an attacker could change the modify time of the file to hide changes they've made. Thus this feature should not
       be used for security checking purposes (but should be safe for uses like finding files that have changed and need to be backed up, for instance).
