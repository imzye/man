NAME
       hlins - insert url's into html documents

SYNOPSIS
       hlins [options] [infile]

DESCRIPTION
       hlins  is  a program that inserts hypertext links into html documents, according to one or several data bases associating addresses (url's) to names. hlins is designed for inserting links for per‐
       sons: It knows about abbreviations of first and middle names and tolerated dropping of the last part of a composite last name.

       If no file argument is given then input is taken from stdin; when no output option (see below) is given then output goes to stdout.

       For a complete description, see the documentation in html format.
