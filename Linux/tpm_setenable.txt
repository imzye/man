NAME
       tpm_setenable - change TPM enable states

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_setenable [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm_setenable reports the status of the TPM's flags regarding the enable state of the TPM.  This is the default behavior and also accessible via the --status option. Requesting a report of this status
       prompts for the owner password.  The --enable option changes the system's TPM to the enabled state (via the TPM_OwnerSetDisable API).  This operation prompts for the owner password and is persistent.
       The --disable option (via the TPM_OwnerSetDisable API) changes the system's TPM to the disabled state.  This operation prompts for the owner password and is persistent.  A disabled TPM is essentially
       off and does not allow a tpm_takeownership to occur.  The --force option overrides the owner password prompt and relies on physical presence for the operation authorization (via the TPM_PhysicalEnable
       and TPM_PhysicalDisable APIs).  The --enable, --disable, and --status options are mutually exclusive and the last one on the command line will be carried out.

       -h, --help
              Display command usage info.

       -v, --version
              Display command version info.

       -l, --log [none|error|info|debug]
              Set logging level.

       -u, --unicode
              Use TSS UNICODE encoding for passwords to comply with applications using TSS popup boxes

       -s, --status
              Report the status of flags regarding the TPM enable states.

       -e, --enable
              Make the TPM enabled.  Operation is persistent and  prompts for owner authorization.

       -d, --disable
              Make the TPM disabled.   Operation is persistent and prompts for owner authorization.

       -f, --force
              Overrides the prompt for owner authorization and uses physical presence to authorize the action.

       -z, --well-known
              Authenticate using 20 bytes of zeros as owner password (the default TSS Well Known Secret), instead of prompting for an owner password.
