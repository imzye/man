NAME
       mp3diags - find issues in MP3 files

SYNOPSIS
       mp3diags

DESCRIPTION
       MP3 Diags is a simple graphical application that allows end-users to identify issues with their MP3 files, fix some of them and make other changes, like adding track information.

       It looks at both the audio part (VBR info, quality, normalization) and the tags containing track information (ID3).

       MP3  Diags  provides  a tag editor, which can download album information (including cover art) from MusicBrainz and Discogs, as well as paste data from the clipboard, and a file renamer, which can
       rename groups of file automatically, based on their ID3 fields (artist, track number, album, genre, etc).

       MP3 Diags has been written with QT4 libraries, and after the installation the application is available from the Applications menu.
