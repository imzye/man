NAME
       irsimsend - Send simulated IR data.

SYNOPSIS
       irsimsend [-k keysym |-l listfile ] [other options] <file>

       irsimsend [-v |-h]

       irsimsend <configfile>

DESCRIPTION
       irsimsend  is a simple test tool which given a lircd configuration file
       will send all keys defined in that file, the  keys  listed  in  another
       file or a symbol defined on the command line.

       The  program  uses  the file driver to log all sent data (pulses/spaces
       durations) into a file 'simsend.out'. The symbols sent are  printed  on
       stdout.

OPTIONS
       -c, --count  <count>
           Repeat each sent signal <count> times.

       -U, --plugindir <path>
           Load  drivers  from  path,  a  ':' separated search path similar to
           $PATH.

       -l,--listfile  <path>
           Send symbols listed in file instead of just the symbols in the con‐
           fig  file. The file could either be listing a single key symbol per
           line, or have a  complete  code  string  like  000000000000a123  01
           KEY_POWER brand on each line.

       -k, --keysym
           Send a single key symbol defined in file.

       -s, --start-space <useconds>
           Send an initial space before sending data.

       -v , --version
           Print version and exit.

       -h , --help
           Print help message.

FILES
       ~/.cache/irsimsend.log
           Debug  log.  Setting  the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable relo‐
           cates this file to  $XDG_CACHE_HOME/irsimsend.log.  The  amount  of
           logging respects the LIRC_LOGLEVEL environment variable, defaulting
           to the debug value in the[lircd] section of lirc_options.conf.

SEE ALSO
       The documentation for lirc  is  maintained  as  html  pages.  They  are
       located under html/ in the documentation directory.
