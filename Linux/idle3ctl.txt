NAME
       idle3ctl - disable, get or set the idle3 timer on Western Digital HDD

SYNOPSIS
       idle3ctl [ flags ] [device] ..

DESCRIPTION
       idle3ctl  can  disable,  get and set the value of the infamous idle3 timer found on recent Western Digital Hard Disk Drives.  Idle3ctl can be used as an alternative to the official wdidle3.exe propri‐
       etary utility, without the need to reboot in a DOS environement.  Idle3ctl is an independant project, unrelated in any way to Western Digital Corp.

       THIS SOFTWARE IS EXPERIMENTAL, NOT WELL TESTED AND ACCESSES LOW LEVEL INFORMATION OF YOUR HARDDRIVE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

       --force

       -g100  get idle3 timer value as wdidle3 v1.00 would display it

       -g103  get idle3 timer value as wdidle3 v1.03 would display it

       -d     disable idle3 timer

       -s<value>
