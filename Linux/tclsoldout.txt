NAME
       TclSoldout — Markdown parser

SYNOPSIS
       package require TclSoldout [0.1.1]

       ::soldout::escape_html string

       ::soldout::mkd2html [-discount | -natext] markdown

       ::soldout::mkd2xhtml [-discount | -natext] markdown

DESCRIPTION
       The TclSoldout extension is a Tcl binding to libsoldout, a lightweight C library that can parse Markdown.

       The ::soldout::escape_html command replace '<', '>', '&' and '"' in the string with their HTML entities and return the modified text.

       The ::soldout::mkd2html command parse markdown text and return HTML (self-closing tags are rendered like this: <br>).

       The ::soldout::mkd2xhtml command parse markdown text and return XHTML (self-closing tags like: <br />).

       The options are as follows:

       -discount
               enable Discount extensions:

               •  image size specification, by appending "=(width)x(height)" to the link

               •  pseudo-protocols in links:

                  •  abbr:description for <abbr title="description">...</abbr>

                  •  class:name for <span class="name">...</span>

                  •  id:name for <span id="name">...</span>

                  •  raw:text for verbatim unprocessed text inclusion

               •  class blocks: blockquotes beginning with %class% will be rendered as a div of the given class(es)

               and PHP-Markdown-like tables.

       -natext
               enable Discount extensions and Natasha's own extensions:

               •  id attribute for headers, using the syntax id#Header text

               •  class attribute for paragraphs, by putting class name(s) between parenthesis at the very beginning of the paragraph

               •  <ins> and <del> spans, using respectively ++ and -- as delimiters (with emphasis-like restrictions, i.e. an opening delimiter cannot be followed by a whitespace, and a closing delimiter
                  cannot be preceded by a whitespace)

               •  plain <span> without attribute, using emphasis-like delimiter |
