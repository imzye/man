NAME
       rasls - list information on rasterfiles

SYNOPSIS
       rasls [-type] [-count] [-resolution] [-verbose] [-Version] [-ifmt file_format] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       For  each file rasls will generate a one line description of the rasterfile. Information provided includes the format type (Sun, HDF, etc.), the encoding (indexed, direct, etc.), resolution, and file‐
       name. Files that cannot be read as rasterfiles, are empty, are directories, or are otherwise unrecognizable are simply listed as such.

OPTIONS
       -type  Print the encoding type of the rasterfile. Currently this will be either indexed or direct.

       -count Print the number of frames in the raster file.

       -resolution
              Print the spatial resolution of a file in pixels.

       -help  Print help information.

       -verbose
              Print as much information as possible about each rasterfile. Information provided is a combination of format-independent and format-dependent parameters.

       -Version
              Print the version number.

       -ifmt format
              Specify the input file format.  format is one of the file name extensions discussed in ras_formats(5NCARG) (without the ".", e.g.  xwd).  When this option is specified file name extensions  are
              not necessary and are ignored if present.  All input files must have the same format.
