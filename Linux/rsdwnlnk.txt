RSDWNLNK(8)                Linux Programmer's Manual               RSDWNLNK(8)

NAME
       rsdwnlnk - User exit from the ROSE network.

SYNOPSIS
       rsdwnlnk <port> <call>

DESCRIPTION
       The  rdwnplnk program allows a user to leave the ROSE network using the
       standard pseudo-digipeating method. Recent Linux kernels are  aware  of
       this  form  of  operation and the ax25d program can create such connec‐
       tions. The normal mode of operation of a ROSE switch  is  to  have  one
       ROSE  address  (ie port) per physical AX.25 port.  Therefore ROSE users
       coming in on a given ROSE port will come out of  the  associated  AX.25
       port.

       To  use rsdwnlnk you need an entry in ax25d.conf to listen for incoming
       ROSE connections to any callsigns that are not matched by the more spe‐
       cific  ROSE entries. In the example below, I will be listening for ROSE
       connections on my ROSE port rs144, the exiting AX.25 connection will be
       via  the  associated  AX.25  port,  144,  using the callsign KE4GAJ-10.
       Please note that the callsign should be on the same line as the rest of
       the command, it may be wrapped onto the next line on your screen.

       #
       {* VIA rs144}
       NOCALL  * * * * * * L
       default * * * * * * - root /usr/sbin/rsdwnlnk rsdwnlnk 144 KE4GAJ-10
       #

       There  would  typically  be  one rsdwnlnk per ROSE port. The associated
       program for entering a ROSE network is rsuplnk.

       All errors generated by rsdwnlnk are written to the  system  debug  log
       file.
