SPI-CONFIG(1)                                                                                  User Commands                                                                                  SPI-CONFIG(1)

NAME
       spi-config - set or query SPI configuration.

SYNOPSIS
       spi-config options...

DESCRIPTION
       Set or query the configuration of a SPI port.

       -d, --device=DEVICE
              use the given Linux spidev character device.

       -q, --query
              print the current configuration.

       -m, --mode=[0-3]
              set the spi mode (see SPI MODES below).

       -l, --lsb={0,1}
              set LSB first (1) or MSB first (0).

       -b, --bits=[7...]
              set the number of bits per word.

       -s, --speed=FREQUENCY
              set clock frequency (in Hz).

       -r, --spirdy={0,1}
              set the SPI READY mode flag.

       -s, --wait
              block, keeping the file descriptor open. See WAIT OPTION below.

       -h, --help
              display the help screen and exit.

       -v, --version
              display the version number and exit.

   SPI MODES
       mode 0 low iddle level, sample on leading edge.

       mode 1 low iddle level, sample on trailing edge.

       mode 2 high iddle level, sample on leading edge.

       mode 3 high iddle level, sample on trailing edge.

   WAIT OPTION
       On  some  platforms,  the speed is reset to a default value when the file descriptor is closed.  To avoid this, one can use the -w option that keeps the file descriptor open. See also last example
       below.

EXAMPLES
       Get help:
              $ spi-config -h

       Query current configuration:
              $ spi-config --device=/dev/spidev0.0 -q

       Change clock frequency to 1 MHz:
              $ spi-config --device=/dev/spidev0.0 --speed=1000000

       Set a configuration and keep the device open:
              $ spi-config --wait --speed=1000000 & PID=$!

       Close device previously open:
              $ kill $PID
