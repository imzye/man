NAME
       "IO::Async::SSLStream" - read and write buffers around an SSL connection

DESCRIPTION
       This subclass of IO::Async::Stream provides support for using an SSL connection, as created by IO::Async::SSL's "SSL_connect" or "SSL_listen" extension methods. After one of these methods has
       provided a socket handle, it should be wrapped in an IO::Async::SSLStream object to provide the usual "on_read" callback.

       It provides no extra methods and consumes no extra configuration parameters; treat it the same as a regular "IO::Async::Stream" object.

       See the main IO::Async::SSL documentation for an example of its use.

BUGS
       •   Currently,  this  subclass does not completely handle the "autoflush" configure option. It is possible for the "SSL_write(3ssl)" call to fail with "EAGAIN" and "SSL_WANT_READ", indicating that
           it wishes to read (perhaps to obtain fresh keys from the server). In this case, the subclass will not correctly poll for readability and retry the write operation. This bug does not occur with
           regular "write" with "autoflush" turned off.
