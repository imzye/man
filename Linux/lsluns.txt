NAME
       lsluns - list LUNs discovered in the FC SAN through zfcp, or show encryption state of zfcp-attached LUNs

SYNOPSIS
       lsluns [-c busid] ...  [-p wwpn] ...
       lsluns -a [-c busid] ...  [-p wwpn] ...
       lsluns [-h] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is designed for environments with SCSI devices attached through the zfcp device driver.

       lsluns  lists all logical unit numbers (LUNs) discovered in the Fibre Channel (FC) Storage Area Network (SAN).  This causes extra SAN traffic for each target
       port WWPN.

       lsluns -a shows the encryption state of the attached LUNs.  This causes extra SAN traffic for each attached LUN.

       Limit the listing by specifying one or more adapters (FCP device bus-IDs) or target port WWPNs or both.

       For all other uses, such as listing attached LUNs or properties other than encryption, use other tools such as lszfcp -D or lsscsi  -tv  or  lszdev  zfcp-lun
       -ii.

   Details on lsluns without -a option
       Prerequisite
              Discovering LUNs only makes sense for NPIV-enabled FCP devices without zfcp automatic LUN scan. zfcp automatic LUN scan is available as of kernel ver‐
              sion 2.6.37, if not disabled with zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0.

              With available and enabled zfcp automatic LUN scan, the kernel already performs LUN discovery.

       Temporary LUN Attachment
              If not attached already, lsluns temporarily attaches LUN 0 (or if this fails the WLUN 0xc101000000000000) during runtime.   Do  not  terminate  lsluns
              with a signal. Signals interfere with the removal of temporarily attached LUNs.

       Storage Products
              Some  storage  products return a peripheral device type of 31==0x1f with peripheral qualifier 0 in a SCSI standard INQUIRY command for an unmapped FCP
              LUN 0. Examples are: IBM Storwize products, including IBM V7000, IBM V840, IBM V9000, and IBM SAN Volume Controller.  For lsluns  to  work  with  such
              storage  products, you must have a host mapping on the storage, which maps some volume to exported FCP LUN 0x0000000000000000 (Storwize host map prop‐
              erty "SCSI ID" 0) for each used FCP-device initiator WWPN. The volume can be a minimum-sized thin-provisioned shared stand-in volume.

OPTIONS
       -a, --active
              Show the encryption state of the attached LUNs. Encrypted devices are indicated with a bracketed X immediately following the LUN number.

       -c busid, --ccw=busid
              Filter LUNs by adapter with the specified FCP device bus-ID. This option can be specified multiple times. When used in conjunction with -p, only those
              LUNs are listed that also satisfy at least one of the -p constraints.

       -p wwpn, --port=wwpn
              Filter LUNs by target port with the specified WWPN. This option can be specified multiple times. When used in conjunction with -c, only those LUNs are
              listed that also satisfy at least one of the -c constraints.

       -h, --help
              Print help message and exit.

       -v, --version
              Display version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
       lsluns
              Lists all LUNs discovered in the FC SAN.

       lsluns -c 0.0.3922
              Lists all LUNs discovered in the FC SAN on adapter 0.0.3922.

       lsluns -p 0x5005123456789000
              Lists all LUNs discovered in the FC SAN on target port 0x5005123456789000.

       lsluns -c 0.0.3922 -c 0.0.fc00 -p 0x5005123456789000 -p 0x5005abcdefabc000
              Lists all LUNs discovered in the FC SAN on: adpater 0.0.3922 and port  0x5005123456789000,  adapter  0.0.3922  and  port  0x5005abcdefabc000,  adapter
              0.0.fc00 and port 0x5005123456789000, or adapter 0.0.fc00 and port 0x5005abcdefabc000.

       lsluns -a
              adapter = 0.0.3c02
                      port = 0x500507630300c562
                              lun = 0x401040a200000000(X)     /dev/sg0        Disk    IBM:2107900
                              lun = 0x401040a300000000        /dev/sg1        Disk    IBM:2107900

              Shows the encryption status of attached LUNs. A bracketed X suffixed to a LUN indicates that the device is encrypted.
