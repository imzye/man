NAME
       doctorj - Javadoc analyzer and spell-checker

SYNOPSIS
       doctorj [--emacs] [--warning=LEVEL] [--tabwidth=NUM]
               [--dictionaries=LIST] [--verbose] {FILE...}

DESCRIPTION
       doctorj is an application to analyze Javadoc comments against Java code, verifying its integrity and format. It also spell-checks Javadoc comments.

OPTIONS
       --emacs
              Whether to list violations in Emacs form, i.e., a single line of the form:

              8:48:9:4: An error occurred on this line.

              By default, violations are displayed in ``long form'', showing the context.

       --warning=LEVEL
              Sets  the warning level, which by default is -1, meaning that only errors are reported. A warning level of 0 means that Javadoc for public or abstract
              items (classes, interfaces, methods, constructors, and fields) will be checked. A warning level of 1 will result in the addition of checking  of  pro‐
              tected-access items; 2 is for package-access items, and 3 will check all items.

       --tabwidth=NUM
              Sets the number of spaces to use for alignment with tabs. By default, this value is 4.

       --dictionaries=LIST
              Sets  the  dictionaries  (word lists) to use for spell-checking. LIST is a comma-delimited string of paths to the word list files. By default, doctorj
              uses the word list at /usr/share/doctorj/words.LOCALE, where LOCALE is of the standard Java form.  doctorj  is  distributed  with  three  word  lists:
              words.en_CA (Canadian English), words.en_UK (United Kingdom English), and words.en_US (United States English).

       --verbose
              Produces debugging output. Note that this signficantly impedes performance.

       FILE   Specifies the files to check. If the argument specified is a directory, all files ending in ``.java'' under that directory will be analyzed.

EXAMPLES
       To check a single file:

              % doctorj String.java

       To check multiple files:

              % doctorj String.java StringBuffer.java Object.java

       To check all files below a directory:

              % doctorj /proj/app/src

       To run at the maximum warning level:

              % doctorj --warning=4 .

       To specify a different dictionary:

              % doctorj --dictionaries=/usr/share/dict/words .

CONFIGURATION
       $HOME/.doctorjrc

       The run-control file, of the form:

              emacs: true
              warning: 4
              tabwidth: 8
              dictionaries: /usr/share/dict/words,/home/me/etc/terms
              verbose: false

       Dictionary (word list) files contain one word per line, for example:

              adaxial
              cepaceous
              sabaton
              vespiaries
