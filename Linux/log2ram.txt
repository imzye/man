NAME
       log2ram - Redirects log file writes into RAM

SYNOPSIS
       log2ram {start|stop|write}

DESCRIPTION
       log2ram reduces wear on storage devices by redirecting any writes to
        /var/log/ into RAM with periodic flushes to the storage drive. This is
        useful when that storage device has a limited number of write cycles,
        such as an SD card.

OPTIONS
       start   Starts the log2ram service.

       stop    Stops the log2ram service.

       write   Syncs the log files from RAM to disk.
