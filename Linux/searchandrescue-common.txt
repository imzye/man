NAME
       SearchAndRescue - Air rescue flight simulator

SYNTAX
       SearchAndRescue [options] [GUI_options]

DESCRIPTION
       Helicopter  based  search  and  rescue  flight  simulator.  Pilot a variety of user editable rescue aircraft through customizeable missions and rescue victims in distress.  Uses OpenGL and glX for
       graphics, and for sound Ylib (deprecated as obsolete), SDL and SDL_Mixer (optional) and libjsw for joystick support (not available on all platforms).

OPTIONS
       --config <file>
              Load configuration from <file>.

       --rcfile
              Same as --config.

       -f     Same as --config.

       --control <type>
              Specify which controller to use at start up.  <type> can be keyboard (default) or joystick.

       -c     Same as --control.

       --hardware_rendering
              Use direct hardware rendering (default).

       --software_rendering
              Use software rendering instead of direct hardware rendering.

       --full_menu_redraw
              Always perform full (not partial) menu redraws (slow but required for certain accelerated video cards).

       --display <address>
              Specifies display address (UNIX/X version only).

       --font <name>
              Specifies the default font to use on GUI related outputs. Refer to your GUI manual for the proper font name formats.

       --geometry <WxH+X+Y>
              Specifies the geometry of the toplevel window, example "--geometry 640x480+100+120" to make the window 640 by 480 pixels in size and at coordinate position 100,120  (relative  to  the  root
              window/desktop).

       --fullscreen
              Specifies  to switch to full screen on startup, use this if and only if your GUI does not support manual switching to full screen. You may need to specify the --geometry argument to specify
              the size of the full screen resolution.

       --aspect_offset <coeff>
              Specifies a floating coefficient value to be applied to screen aspect calculations, example a value of -0.2 when your screen is 800 by 600 then the aspect would be 800/600 + (-0.2) =  1.333
              - 0.2 = 1.133.

       --recorder <address>
              Specifies recorder address (UNIX/Y version only).

       --nosound
              Do not connect to sound server at startup (overrides the value set in the configuration).

       --nomenubg
              No menu background images (speeds up the redrawing when in the menus).

       --console_quiet
              Do not print routine messages to stdout.

       --runtime_debug
              Print debugging runtime detection of various resources to stdout. This may help detect points of failure or crash during startup or exiting.

       --internal_debug
              Print debugging of internal runtime information (messy and terse) to stdout. This will only print debugging information about internal resources belonging to the program.

       --help Prints (this) help screen and exits.

       --version
              Prints version information and exits.
