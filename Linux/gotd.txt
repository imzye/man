GOTD-SECRETS.CONF(5)                                                                         File Formats Manual                                                                       GOTD-SECRETS.CONF(5)

NAME
       gotd-secrets.conf — gotd secrets file

DESCRIPTION
       gotd-secrets.conf contains authentication credentials for use with gotd(8) notifications.  This file must be owned by the root user and must not be readable by any other users.

       The file format is line-based, with one entry per line.  Comments can appear at the start of a line using a hash mark (‘#’), and extend to the end of the line.  Empty lines are ignored.

       Each entry consists of whitespace-separated tokens and defines a set of credentials.  Any credential parameters containing whitespace should be surrounded by single or double quotes.

       Each set of credentials must be given a label which can be used to refer to credentials in gotd.conf(5).  This label must be unique among all credentials of the same type.

       The supported credential types and their parameters are:

       auth label user user password password
               The auth type represents HTTP Basic Authentication credentials consisting of a user and a password.

       hmac label secret
               The hmac type represents shared secrets for use with HMAC signatures of HTTP request bodies.  A suitable secret can be generated with openssl(1) as follows:

                     $ openssl rand -base64 32

FILES
       /etc/gotd-secrets.conf
               Location of the gotd-secrets.conf configuration file.

EXAMPLES
       Define credentials for HTTP basic authentication and HMAC signatures:

             # /etc/gotd-secrets.conf
             auth mochi user "flan" password "super-strong-password!"
             hmac hacker q0tcl8QhjYs7U75MW/2rwB30CpdbAhONkfLGxFHm/+8=

       These credentials can be referenced in gotd.conf(5) as follows:

             # /etc/gotd.conf
             repository "openbsd/src" {
                     path "/var/git/src.git"
                     permit rw :hackers

                     notify {
                             url https://example.com/ci/ auth mochi hmac hacker
                     }
             }
