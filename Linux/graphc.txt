NAME
       graphc - Graphcap preprocessor for NCAR Graphics

SYNOPSIS
       graphc ascii-graphcap-name binary-graphcap-name

DESCRIPTION
       graphc converts an ascii-encoded graphcap, ascii-graphcap-name, into a binary-encoded graphcap, binary-graphcap-name.

       Binary encoded graphcaps are system dependent and should not be assumed to be portable across different system architectures.
