NAME
       seunshare  - Run cmd with alternate homedir, tmpdir and/or SELinux con‐
       text

SYNOPSIS
       seunshare [ -v ] [ -C ] [ -k ] [ -t tmpdir ] [ -h homedir ] [  -Z  con‐
       text ] -- executable [args]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  the  executable  within the specified context, using the alternate
       home directory and /tmp directory.  The seunshare command unshares from
       the  default  namespace,  then  mounts the specified homedir and tmpdir
       over the default homedir and /tmp. Finally it tells the kernel to  exe‐
       cute the application under the specified SELinux context.

       -h homedir
              Alternate  homedir  to be used by the application.  Homedir must
              be owned by the user.

       -t tmpdir
              Use alternate temporary directory to mount on /tmp.  tmpdir must
              be owned by the user.

       -C --capabilities
              Allow  apps  executed  within the namespace to use capabilities.
              Default is no capabilities.

       -k --kill
              Kill all processes with matching MCS level.

       -Z context
              Use alternate SELinux context while running the executable.
