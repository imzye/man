NAME
       flow-gen - Generate test flows

SYNOPSIS
       flow-gen [ -h ]  [ -b big|little ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -n count ]  [ -V version ]  [ -z z_level ]

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-gen utility generates a test pattern of flows in any of the currently supported export versions typically for debugging purposes.

OPTIONS
       -b big|little
              Byte order of output.

       -d debug_level
              Enable debugging.

       -h     Display help.

       -n count
              Generate count flows. Default 1000.

       -V version
              Generate version type exports. Supported versions are:

                  1    NetFlow version 1 (No sequence numbers, AS, or mask)
                  5    NetFlow version 5
                  6    NetFlow version 6 (5+ Encapsulation size)
                  7    NetFlow version 7 (Catalyst switches)
                  8.1  NetFlow AS Aggregation
                  8.2  NetFlow Proto Port Aggregation
                  8.3  NetFlow Source Prefix Aggregation
                  8.4  NetFlow Destination Prefix Aggregation
                  8.5  NetFlow Prefix Aggregation
                  8.6  NetFlow Destination (Catalyst switches)
                  8.7  NetFlow Source Destination (Catalyst switches)
                  8.8  NetFlow Full Flow (Catalyst switches)
                  8.9  NetFlow ToS AS Aggregation
                  8.10 NetFlow ToS Proto Port Aggregation
                  8.11 NetFlow ToS Source Prefix Aggregation
                  8.12 NetFlow ToS Destination Prefix Aggregation
                  8.13 NetFlow ToS Prefix Aggregation
                  8.14 NetFlow ToS Prefix Port Aggregation
                  1005 Flow-Tools tagged version 5

       -z z_level
              Configure compression level to  z_level. 0 is disabled (no compression), 9 is highest compression.

EXAMPLES
       Generate a test pattern of 1000 version 5 flows and send them in the Cisco NetFlow packet format to 10.0.0.1 port 9500.

       flow-gen -V5 | flow-send 0/10.0.0.1/9500

BUGS
       The test pattern may change between releases.
