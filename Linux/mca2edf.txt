NAME
       mca2edf - Convert SPEC file format files to EDF format

SYNOPSIS
       mca2edf [OPTIONS] [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       X-ray  maps were stored at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility as a set of images in ESRF Data Format (EDF). The image rows being associated to points of a horizontal sample scan and the image
       columns to the spectrum channels.

       This tool allows one to convert a set of files wrapped by the PyMca Toolkit as SPEC file format, and therefore without sample position information, to European Synchrotron Radiation Facility data for‐
       mat (EDF).

       Its  usefulness  is nowdays somehow limited because recent PyMca developements allow to reshape nspectra x nchannels datasets in the tools making use of the shape information (pymcaroitool, pymcapost‐
       batch).

EXAMPLES
       mca2edf
           Open a dialog to select input files, output directory and the
           number of spectra on each horizontal row.

       mca2edf --outdir=/tmp --mcastep=2 *.mca
           Convert all the .mca files in current directory to a set of EDF
           files containing two spectra. The output is placed in /tmp

       mca2edf --outdir=/tmp --mcastep=2 --listfile=input_file
           Same as before but applied to all the files listed in input_file.
           Each line of input_file must contain a valid file name.
