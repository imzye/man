NAME
       fiologparser_hist.py - Calculate statistics from fio histograms

SYNOPSIS
       fiologparser_hist.py [options] [clat_hist_files]...

DESCRIPTION
       fiologparser_hist.py  is  a  utility  for converting *_clat_hist* files
       generated by fio into a CSV of latency  statistics  including  minimum,
       average, maximum latency, and selectable percentiles.

EXAMPLES
       $ fiologparser_hist.py *_clat_hist*
       end-time, samples, min, avg, median, 90%, 95%, 99%, max
       1000, 15, 192, 1678.107, 1788.859, 1856.076, 1880.040, 1899.208, 1888.000
       2000, 43, 152, 1642.368, 1714.099, 1816.659, 1845.552, 1888.131, 1888.000
       4000, 39, 1152, 1546.962, 1545.785, 1627.192, 1640.019, 1691.204, 1744
       ...

OPTIONS
       --help Print these options.

       --buff_size=int
              Number  of  samples  to  buffer into numpy at a time. Default is
              10,000.  This can be adjusted to help performance.

       --max_latency=int
              Number of seconds of data to process at a time. Defaults  to  20
              seconds, in order to handle the 17 second upper bound on latency
              in histograms reported by fio. This should be increased  if  fio
              has been run with a larger maximum latency. Lowering this when a
              lower maximum latency is  known  can  improve  performance.  See
              NOTES for more details.

       -i, --interval=int
              Interval  at which statistics are reported. Defaults to 1000 ms.
              This should be set a minimum of the value for  log_hist_msec  as
              given to fio.

       --noweight
              Do  not  perform  weighting of samples between output intervals.
              Default is False.

       -d, --divisor=int
              Divide statistics by this value. Defaults to 1.  Useful  if  you
              want  to  convert  latencies from milliseconds to seconds (divi‐
              sor=1000).

       --warn Enables warning messages printed to stderr,  useful  for  debug‐
              ging.

       --group_nr=int
              Set  this  to  the value of FIO_IO_U_PLAT_GROUP_NR as defined in
              stat.h if fio has been recompiled. Defaults to 19,  the  current
              value used in fio. See NOTES for more details.

       --percentiles=str
              Pass  desired  list  of  comma or colon separated percentiles to
              print.  The default is "90.0:95.0:99.0",  but  min,  median(50%)
              and max percentiles are always printed

       --usbin
              Use  to  indicate  to parser that histogram bin latencies values
              are in microseconds.  The default is  to  use  nanoseconds,  but
              histogram logs from fio versions <= 2.99 are in microseconds.

       --directions=str
              By  default,  all directions (e.g read and write) histogram bins
              are combined producing one 'mixed' result.  To produce  indepen‐
              dent  directional results, pass some combination of ´rwtm´ char‐
              acters with the --directions=rwtm option.   A  ´dir´  column  is
              added indicating the result direction for a row.

NOTES
       end-times  are  calculated  to  be uniform increments of the --interval
       value given, regardless of when  histogram  samples  are  reported.  Of
       note:

              Intervals with no samples are omitted. In the example above this
              means "no statistics from 2 to 3 seconds" and "39 samples influ‐
              enced the statistics of the interval from 3 to 4 seconds".

              Intervals  with a single sample will have the same value for all
              statistics

       The number of samples is unweighted, corresponding to the total  number
       of samples which have any effect whatsoever on the interval.

       Min  statistics  are  computed using value of the lower boundary of the
       first bin (in increasing bin order) with non-zero samples in it.  Simi‐
       larly for max, we take the upper boundary of the last bin with non-zero
       samples in it.  This is semantically identical to taking  the  0th  and
       100th  percentiles with a 50% bin-width buffer (because percentiles are
       computed using mid-points of the bins).  This  enforces  the  following
       nice properties:

              min <= 50th <= 90th <= 95th <= 99th <= max

              min  and max are strict lower and upper bounds on the actual min
              / max seen by fio  (and  reported  in  *_clat.*  with  averaging
              turned off).

       Average statistics use a standard weighted arithmetic mean.

       When  --noweights  option  is false (the default) percentile statistics
       are computed using the weighted percentile method  as  described  here:
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile#Weighted_percentile.       See
       weights() method for details on how weights are computed for individual
       samples.  In  process_interval()  we  further multiply by the height of
       each bin to get weighted histograms.

       We convert files given on the command line, assumed to be fio histogram
       files, An individual histogram file can contain the histograms for mul‐
       tiple different r/w directions  (notably  when  --rw=randrw).  This  is
       accounted for by tracking each r/w direction separately. In the statis‐
       tics reported we ultimately merge *all* histograms (regardless  of  r/w
       direction).

       The  value  of  *_GROUP_NR  in  stat.h (and *_BITS) determines how many
       latency bins fio outputs when histogramming is enabled. Namely for  the
       current  default  of  GROUP_NR=19,  we  get  1,216  bins with a maximum
       latency of approximately 17 seconds. For certain applications this  may
       not  be  sufficient.  With  GROUP_NR=24 we have 1,536 bins, giving us a
       maximum latency of 541 seconds (~ 9 minutes). If you expect your appli‐
       cation  to  experience latencies greater than 17 seconds, you will need
       to recompile fio with a larger GROUP_NR, e.g. with:

              sed -i.bak 's/^#define FIO_IO_U_PLAT_GROUP_NR 190#define FIO_IO_U_PLAT_GROUP_NR 24/g' stat.h
              make fio

       Quick reference table for the max latency corresponding to  a  sampling
       of values for GROUP_NR:

              GROUP_NR | # bins | max latency bin value
              19       | 1216   | 16.9 sec
              20       | 1280   | 33.8 sec
              21       | 1344   | 67.6 sec
              22       | 1408   | 2  min, 15 sec
              23       | 1472   | 4  min, 32 sec
              24       | 1536   | 9  min, 4  sec
              25       | 1600   | 18 min, 8  sec
              26       | 1664   | 36 min, 16 sec

       At  present  this program automatically detects the number of histogram
       bins in the log files, and adjusts the bin latency values  accordingly.
       In  particular  if  you use the --log_hist_coarseness parameter of fio,
       you get output files with a number of bins according to  the  following
       table (note that the first row is identical to the table above):

              coarse \ GROUP_NR
                      19     20    21     22     23     24     25     26
                 -------------------------------------------------------
                0  [[ 1216,  1280,  1344,  1408,  1472,  1536,  1600,  1664],
                1   [  608,   640,   672,   704,   736,   768,   800,   832],
                2   [  304,   320,   336,   352,   368,   384,   400,   416],
                3   [  152,   160,   168,   176,   184,   192,   200,   208],
                4   [   76,    80,    84,    88,    92,    96,   100,   104],
                5   [   38,    40,    42,    44,    46,    48,    50,    52],
                6   [   19,    20,    21,    22,    23,    24,    25,    26],
                7   [  N/A,    10,   N/A,    11,   N/A,    12,   N/A,    13],
                8   [  N/A,     5,   N/A,   N/A,   N/A,     6,   N/A,   N/A]]

       For other values of GROUP_NR and coarseness, this table can be computed
       like this:

              bins = [1216,1280,1344,1408,1472,1536,1600,1664]
              max_coarse = 8
              fncn = lambda z: list(map(lambda x: z/2**x if z % 2**x == 0 else nan, range(max_coarse + 1)))
              np.transpose(list(map(fncn, bins)))

       If you have not adjusted GROUP_NR for your (high latency)  application,
       then  you will see the percentiles computed by this tool max out at the
       max latency bin value as in the first table above,  and  in  this  plot
       (where  GROUP_NR=19  and  thus we see a max latency of ~16.7 seconds in
       the red line):
