NAME
       xferfaxlog - HylaFAX activity log

DESCRIPTION
       The file etc/xferfaxlog contains information about inbound and outbound activities.  The file contains one line per inbound or outbound call (except for facsimile documents retrieved by polling in
       which  case  multiple entries may be present for a single call).  If the modem config setting LogCalls is set to true, then the file also contains one line per received call.  Lines are fixed-for‐
       mat, tab-separated ASCII strings.

       Each record of a facsimile transmission is of the form:
            date SEND commid modem jobid jobtag sender ``dest-number'' ``CSI'' params #pages jobtime conntime ``reason'' <null> <null> <null> ``owner'' ``dcs''

       A facsimile reception record is of the form:
            date RECV commid modem fax.tif <null> fax ``local-number'' ``TSI'' params #pages jobtime conntime ``reason'' ``CallID1'' ``CallID2'' ``CallID3...CallIDn'' <null> ``dcs''

       Each inbound call record is of the form:
            date CALL commid modem <null> <null> fax ``local-number'' <null> 0 0 jobtime conntime ``reason'' ``CallID1'' ``CallID2'' ``CallID3..CallIDn'' <null> ``dcs''

       Each facsimile document retrieved by polling has a record of the form:
            date POLL commid modem jobid jobtag sender ``dest-number'' ``TSI'' params #pages jobtime conntime ``reason'' <null> <null> <null>

       An alphanumeric pager request has a record of the form:
            date PAGE commid modem jobid jobtag sender ``dest-number'' ``<null>'' 0 0 jobtime conntime ``reason'' <null> <null> ``owner''

       The following describes the fields in the above records:

       date          The date and time of the transaction in the format MM/DD/YY HH:MM , where MM is the numeric month, DD the numeric day, YY the last two digits of the year, and HH:MM is  the  time  in
                     24-hour format.

       commid        The communication identifier for the call.

       modem         The device identifier for the modem that was used to do the send or receive.

       jobid         The job number for outbound calls.

       jobtag        The client-specified job tag for outbound calls.

       fax.tif       The associated recvq fax TIFF file for the event.

       sender        The sender/receiver's electronic mailing address (facsimile receptions are always attributed to the ``fax'' user).

       dest-number   The phone number dialed for outgoing calls.

       TSI           The Transmitter Subscriber Identification string (as received) for incoming calls.

       CSI           The Caller Subscriber Identification string of the remote machine (as reported) for outgoing calls.

       local-number  The local phone number on which the data was received.

       params        The negotiated facsimile session parameters used for transferring data encoded as described below.

       #pages        The total number of pages transferred.

       jobtime       The duration of the session; in the format HH:MM:SS.  This time includes setup overhead and any time spent cleaning up after a call.

       conntime      The time spent on the phone; in the format HH:MM:SS.  This should be the time used by the PTT to calculate usage charges.

       reason        A string that indicates if any problem occurred during the session.

       CIDName       The received CIDName value for the session.

       CIDNumber     The received CIDNumber value for the session.

       owner         The login name of the job owner.

       dcs           The T.30 DCS string that was used in the facsimile communication.

       Note  that  fields may have embedded blanks.  Session parameters are encoded as a decimal number that contains a packed set of Class 2 session parameter values.  The format is: 2 bits for vertical
       resolution, 3 bits for signalling rate, 3 bits for page width, 2 bits for page length, 2 bits for data format, 1 bit for ECM use, 1 bit of BF use, and 3 bits for the min scanline time.   The  page
       counts are always integral numbers.  Partial pages that are to be retransmitted are not included in the page count.

       The simple ASCII format was designed to be easy to process with programs like awk(1).

NOTES
       The sender field does not necessarily represent the submitter's actual identity.  For example, it reflects the value given by the sendfax(8) ``-f'' option.  Be cautious that this field is not uti‐
       lized for auditing if the fax user base is not trusted.

BUGS
       The date format will ``break'' in the year 2000.  Information should be recorded on a per-page basis for facsimile communications.
