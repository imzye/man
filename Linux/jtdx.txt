NAME
       rigctld-jtdx - Hamlib 3 rigctld server.

SYNOPSIS
       rigctld-jtdx [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       jtdx uses a version of the hamlib CAT control library. This library is heavily modified over the current release version of hamlib. If a jtdx user wishes to use the hamlib network rig server
       rigctld to remotely control their transceiver; then this special version of rigctld should be used since that too has the modified hamlib code embedded with it.
