NAME
       jack_capture - A program for recording anything from jack

SYNOPSIS
       jack_capture [options]
       bar [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jack_capture command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       jack_capture is a cli program for recording any audio signal from jack to audio audio formats supported by libsndfile library (wav, aiff, ogg, flac, wavex, au, etc.)

       For more info about libsndfile see http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/api.html#open

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -b, --bitdepth n
              is by default FLOAT. It can be set to either 8, 16, 24 or 32. (for relevant formats)

       -c, --channels n
              is by default 2.

       -p, --port port
              is by default set to the two first physical outputs. The "port" argument can be specified more than once.

       -d, --duration s
              Recording is stopped after "s" seconds.

       -z, --leading-zeros n
              "n" is the number of zeros to in the autogenerated filename.  (-z 2 -> jack_capture_001.wav, and so on.) (default is 1)

       -f, --format format
              Selects fileformat provided by libsndfile.  See http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/api.html#open (Default is wav for 1 or 2 channels, and wavex for more than 2.)

       -pf, --print-formats
              Prints all sound formats provided to sndfile to screen and then exits.

       -v, --version
              Prints out version.

       -s, --silent
              Suppress some common messages printed to the terminal.

       -V, --verbose]
              Prints some extra information to the terminal.

       -mp3, --mp3
              Writes to an mp3 file using liblame (LAME). (the --format option has no effect using this option)

       -mp3q, --mp3-quality n
              Selects mp3 quality provided by liblame. n=0 is best, n=9 is worst. Default n is 2. (0 uses the most amount of CPU, 9 uses the least)

       -mp3b, --mp3-bitrate n
              Selects mp3 bitrate (in kbit/s). Default is set by liblame. (currently 128)

       -ws, --write-to-stdout
              Writes 16 bit little endian to stdout. (the --format option, the --mp3 option, and some others have no effect using this option)

       -dm, --disable-meter
              Disable console meter

       -hbu, --hide-buffer-usage
              Disable buffer usage.

       -dc, --disable-console
              Disable console updates. Same as "-dm -hbu".

       -lm, --linear-meter
              Use linear scale for the console meter (default is dB scale)

       -dBr, --dB-meter-reference
              Specify reference level for dB meter. (default=0)

       -mb, --meterbridge
              Start up meterbridge to monitor recorded sound.

       -mt, --meterbridge-type
              Specify type. vu (default), ppm, dpm, jf or sco.

       -mr, --meterbridge-reference
              Specify reference level for meterbidge.

       -jt, --jack-transport
              Start program, but do not start recording until jack transport has started rolling. When jack transport stops, the recording is stopped, and the program ends.

       -jtm, --jack-transport-multi
              Similar to --jack-transport, but do not end program when jack transport stops. Instead, record to a new file when jack_transport start rolling again. (not implemented yet)

       -B, --bufsize s
              Initial/minimum buffer size in seconds. Default is 8 seconds for mp3 files, and 4 seconds for all other formats.

       -MB, --maxbufsize
              Maximum buffer size in seconds. jack_capture will allocate. Default is 40. (Buffer is automatically increased during

       -fn, --filename
              Specify filename. (It's usually easier to set last argument instead)
