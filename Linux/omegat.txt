NAME
       omegat — Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) tool

SYNOPSIS
       omegat

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the omegat command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the html format; see below.

       omegat is actually a wrapper which launches sun's java implementation and loads OmegaT's class. OmegaT is a program that assists translators by maintaining a translation memory.

OPTIONS
       There are no documented options.

SEE ALSO
       java (1).

       The programs are documented fully by OmegaT User Manual available via the OmegaT help system.

       On Debian systems, the documentation can also be found in /usr/share/doc/omegat/html.
