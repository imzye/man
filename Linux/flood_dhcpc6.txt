NAME
       flood_dhcpc6

SYNOPSIS
       flood_dhcpc6 [-n|-N] [-1] [-d domain-name] interface [dhcpserver]

       DHCP client flooder. Use to deplete the IP address pool a DHCP6 server is offering. Note: if the pool is very large, this is rather senseless. :-)

       By  default  the  link-local IP MAC address is random, however this won't work in some circumstances. -n will use the real MAC, -N the real MAC and link-local address. -1 will only solicate an address
       but not request it.  If -N is not used, you should run parasite6 in parallel.  Use -d to force DNS updates, you must specify a domain name.
