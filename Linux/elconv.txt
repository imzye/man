NAME
       elconv - conversion program for ELOG messages

SYNOPSIS
       elconv [ -v ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Electronic Logbook ELOG can be used to store and retrieve messages
       through a Web interface. Depending on the configuration, the ELOG  sys‐
       tem can host one or more logbooks which are stored in separate sections
       on the server.  elconv is a support tool which converts the  ELOG  mes‐
       sages in old format to the current format. Basically you simply run el‐
       conv in the directory where all the `*.log' files  live.  If  you  have
       several directories with log files, you run it once in each directory.

OPTIONS
       elconv accepts the following option:

       -v     verbose output

SEE ALSO
       elog(1), elogd(8).

       The  full  documentation  for ELOG is maintained as an html manual. You
       can reach it from the package document directory.
