NAME
       sendfax - submit a facsimile job for transmission

SYNOPSIS
       sendfax [ options ] [ files...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       sendfax  submits  one  or more facsimile transmission requests to a HylaFAX facsimile server.  Requests are normally processed immediately, although they may also be queued for transmission at a later
       time using a syntax identical to the at(1) command.  For each job that is queued, sendfax prints a job identifier and a job group identifier on the standard output.  A job identifier is the  token  by
       which  jobs  are  identified  within HylaFAX; job group identifiers are used to reference a set of jobs that have been submitted at the same time.  Job and job group identifiers can be supplied to the
       faxrm(1) command to remove the jobs or to the faxalter(1) command to alter job parameters.

       Facsimile are made from the concatenation of a cover page (see below) and one or more files specified on the command line.  If no files are supplied on the command line, sendfax will  read  data  from
       the standard input unless polling is requested.  Cover pages are distinguished for the purpose of generating ``continuation cover pages'' on the server; these are makeup cover pages that are automati‐
       cally generated if a job fails after sending the original user-specified cover page.

       sendfax passes POSTSCRIPT® and TIFF documents directly through to the fax server for transmission, and attempts to convert other file formats to either POSTSCRIPT or TIFF.  In normal operation sendfax
       automatically  converts ASCII-text, troff(1) output, Portable Document Format (PDF), and Silicon Graphics format images for transmission.  Support for other file formats can be easily added through an
       extensible file typing and conversion facility; see typerules(5).  Note that since TIFF Class F documents are processed directly it is simple to forward a received facsimile.

       By default sendfax will generate a cover page for each facsimile that is to be transmitted.  This cover page is created by the ancillary faxcover(1) program using information deduced by sendfax and by
       information supplied on the command line.  Automatic cover page generation may be suppressed with the -n option.

       In addition to sending documents, sendfax can be used to poll a remote facsimile machine to retrieve waiting documents.  If the -p option is specified, a polling request will be submitted to each des‐
       tination.  If a poll request is made in conjunction with the transmission of documents, the poll request will take place after the documents are transmitted.  Documents retrieved by  polling  are  re‐
       turned to the requestor by electronic mail and may be viewed with a suitable viewer program.

       One  or  more  destinations must be specified on the command line using the -d option.  A destination is the dialing string to use to contact the remote fax machine.  Phone numbers may include non-al‐
       phanumeric characters for readability—only alphanumerics, ``+'' (for denoting a country code), and ``#'' (for denoting a subaddress) are significant in placing a call.  Alphabetic characters are auto‐
       matically mapped to their numeric key equivalents: ``abcABC'' to ``2'', ``defDEF'' to ``3'', etc.  Dialing prefixes, such as ``1'' and ``011'' (for long distance calling in the United States) need not
       be included if an unambiguous number is specified.  Examples of unambiguous phone numbers are:
              +31.77.594.131      to call the Netherlands
              +14159657824        to call California
              9657824             to make a local call
              1-215-356-1666      to call Pennsylvania from within the US
       Non-numeric strings, such as ``*70'' (to defeat call waiting), may be included in the destination phone number.  Whether or not they are stripped from the string used to dial the destination  fax  ma‐
       chine is dependent on the dialstring rules configured for use on the server; c.f.  hylafax-config(5) and dialrules(5).

       A destination may also be specified as user@fax-number.  In this case the user string will be passed to faxcover as the identity of the recipient.  Note that multi-word names must be enclosed in quote
       marks; for example, ``Sam Leffler@+1.415.555.1212''.

       The order of options on the command line is significant.  Each fax to be transmitted is assigned the current value of parameters specified on the command line; e.g. whether or not to generate a  cover
       page.  This means that options that specify parameters for a particular destination must precede the dialstring specified with the -d option.  For example,

              sendfax -n -d 5551212 /etc/passwd

       submits a fax to 5551212 that has no cover page while

              sendfax -d 5551212 -n /etc/passwd

       submits the same fax but with the default cover page handling.  Note also that parameter values persist across -d options so the following

              sendfax -n -d 5551212 -d 5551313 /etc/network

       submits two facsimile, both of which have no cover page.

OPTIONS
       -1          Transmit facsimile documents using 1-D MH compression.  By default HylaFAX will use the optimal compression scheme supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device.

       -2          Transmit  facsimile documents using 2-D MR compression, if possible.  By default HylaFAX will use the optimal compression scheme supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile
                   device.

       -3          Transmit facsimile documents using 2-D MMR compression, if possible.  By default HylaFAX will use the optimal compression scheme supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile
                   device.

       -a time     Schedule  transmission  up  to  one year in advance at the indicated time.  Time is specified in the format: ``HH:MM [AM|PM] | now [+ N period | month DD | dayofweek ]´´ where month can be
                   Jan(uary), Feb(ruary), Mar(ch), Apr(il), May, Jun(e), Jul(y), Aug(ust), Sep(tember), Oct(ober), Nov(ember), or Dec(ember); period can be minute(s), hour(s), day(s), week(s),  or  month(s);
                   dayofweek can be Mon(day), Tue(sday), Wed(nesday), Thu(rsday), Fri(day), Sat(urday), Sun(day); e.g. ``now + 30 minutes´´ to schedule transmission 30 minutes in the future.  Trailing infor‐
                   mation in the time field (such as YYYY) is ignored.  By default, sendfax schedules facsimile for immediate delivery.  Time should be given in the user's local time.

       -A          Archive the job on the server according to the bin/archive script when the job is done.

       -b speed    Transmit facsimile documents using a signalling rate that is constrained to be at least speed bits/second.  If the specified speed is greater than the transmitting modem or receiver is ca‐
                   pable  of,  it  is reduced to the highest possible speed both devices support.  If a negotiated signalling rate greater than or equal to speed cannot be negotiated then the job is aborted.
                   Possible speeds are: 2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200, 21600, 24000, 26400, 28800, 31200, and 33600.  By default HylaFAX will use the fastest possible rate  supported  by
                   the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device.

       -B speed    Try  to  transmit  facsimile  documents  using the desired signalling rate.  Possible speeds are: 2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200, 21600, 24000, 26400, 28800, 31200, and
                   33600.  If the specified speed is greater than the transmitting modem or receiver is capable of, it is reduced to the highest possible speed both devices support.  By default HylaFAX  will
                   use  the  fastest  possible rate supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device (unless restricted by other server configuration); this option can be used to reduce the
                   speed.  Note that international calls are frequently more reliable when transmissions are restricted to 9600 bits/second.  For Class 1/1.0 devices, if the specified speed  is  not  greater
                   than 14400 then V.34 will not be attempted, and if the specified speed is 9600 or 7200 then V.29 will be assumed in lieu of V.17.

       -c comments Pass comments to the faxcover(1) program for inclusion in the comments field of any generated cover page.

       -C file     Pass file to the faxcover(1) program for use as the cover page template.

       -D          Enable notification by electronic mail when the facsimile has been delivered.  By default HylaFAX will notify the submitter only if there is a problem with a job.

       -d destination
                   Create a job to transmit the supplied documents to a facsimile machine at the indicated destination.  If the destination is of the form ``user@phone-number#subaddress'' then any cover page
                   will show user as the intended recipient, and the remote system will be supplied the subaddress value (i.e. for routing) provided that the sending modem and the  receiving  system  support
                   it.

       -E          Disable use of the Error Correction Mode (ECM) when transmitting page data. Setting ECM to false will limit the maximum speed to 14400 bps.  By default HylaFAX will attempt to use ECM when
                   both the transmitting modem and receiving device support it.  Note that international calls are sometimes faster when ECM is disabled.  Beware also that some modems  and/or  facsimile  de‐
                   vices do not properly implement ECM causing transmission failures.

       -f from     Use from as the identity of the facsimile sender.  Otherwise the sender is the user that invoked sendfax.  The sender is an account name to which the HylaFAX software should direct notifi‐
                   cation messages.  The from identity may be a fullblown ``From:'' line, e.g.  e.g. ``Joe Blow <joe@foo.com>'' and ``joe@foo.com (Joe Blow)'' are acceptable.  If no host-part is specified in
                   the from string the local hostname is used.  This option is useful when sendfax is invoked on behalf of another user, such as in the implementation of an electronic mail to fax gateway.

       -F format   Use  the  specified  format  when imaging tag lines on outgoing pages.  Consult the description of the TagLineFormat parameter in hylafax-config(5) for an explanation of how to construct a
                   format string.

                   Note that many locales require that proper identification appear on all transmitted facsimile; when using this facility one should always include proper identification (e.g. a  phone  num‐
                   ber) in the imaged taglines.

       -G          Enable usage of any extended resolutions supported by the receiver.  -G supersedes the usage of any -l or -m options.  Beware that increased resolution will increase transmission time.

       -h [modem@]host[:port]
                   Force  the  jobs  to  be processed on a specific host and, optionally, using a particular modem.  The host may be either a symbolic name or a network address.  If no -h option is supplied,
                   sendfax uses the FAXSERVER environment variable to identify the HylaFAX server to which the jobs should be directed.  If no server is specified then sendfax attempts to contact a server on
                   the local host.  If no modem is specified, the job will be submitted to any available modem.

       -i identifier
                   Use  the  identifier  string  in  any  notification  messages instead of the usual job identifier number.  This option is useful for applications that cross reference notification messages
                   against job submissions.

       -I time     If a job must be requeued because of a communication failure schedule the retry according to the specified time.  Times are given in seconds.  Minutes, hours, and  days  can  be  specified
                   with ``min'', ``hour'', and ``day'' suffixes, respectively.  By default HylaFAX reschedules jobs using retry times that depend on the manner in which the job failed; this interface permits
                   a user to override this algorithm and specify a single fixed retry time for all communication failures.

       -k time     Kill the job if it does not complete in the indicated time.  The time is specified using notation identical to the -a option.  Note that the time is relative to the  time  of  the  initial
                   time-to-send.  The default kill time is ``now + 3 hours'' (three hours from the time the job is first processed).  To retry for an hour, ``now +1 hour'' could be used.

       -l          Transmit the facsimile at a vertical resolution of 98 lines/inch; otherwise known as low resolution.

       -m          Transmit the facsimile at a vertical resolution of 196 lines/inch; otherwise known as medium resolution or fine mode.

       -M mst      Transmit  facsimile  documents  using the specified minimum scanline time.  Possible times are: 0ms, 5ms, 10ms2, 10ms, 20ms2, 20ms, 40ms2, and 40ms.  If the specified time is less than the
                   transmitting modem or receiver is capable of, it is increased to the lowest possible time both devices support.  By default HylaFAX will use the  lowest  possible  time  supported  by  the
                   transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device (unless restricted by other server configuration).  This option is mostly useful for debugging.

       -n          Suppress the automatic generation of a cover page for subsequent facsimile.  Note that polling requests do not receive a cover page unless they are combined with the transmission of one or
                   more files.

       -N          Do not notify the sender by electronic mail when the facsimile has been delivered or requeued.

       -o owner    Specify the fax owner login name, replacing any FAXUSER environment variable that may be set for the same purpose.  If neither is specified, the user's current login name is used.

       -p          Poll each destination for any available documents.  If a poll request is made together with document transmission, the poll operation is done after the documents  are  transmitted.   Docu‐
                   ments received by polling are returned to the sender by electronic mail.

       -P priority Assign the specified scheduling priority to subsequent jobs.  A priority is an integer value in the range [0-255].  Lower values result in higher priority processing.  By default, each job
                   is assigned 127 for an initial scheduling priority.  If a job's priority is greater than bulk faxes then the job's priority is raised (numerically  lowered)  for  each  failed  attempt  to
                   transmit  so  that  retransmit  attempts  are  done ahead of newly submitted jobs.  In the case of bulk faxes (numerically higher than 190), then the job's priority is lowered (numerically
                   raised) for each failed attempt to transmit so that the whole of the bulk-queued jobs will be attempted before any are retried.  The priority may also be specified as one of the  following
                   symbolic names: default or normal (127), bulk or junk (191), low (190), or high (63).

       -R          Enable  notification  by  electronic mail when the facsimile has been delivered and when it is requeued for retransmission.  By default HylaFAX will notify the submitter only if there is a
                   problem with a job.

       -r regarding
                   Pass regarding to the faxcover(1) program as the value of the ``Re:'' field of any generated cover page.

       -s size     Set the page size to use for the transmitted facsimile.  Facsimile are normally imaged with a system-default page size (usually letter-size pages, 8.5" by 11", for sites in North America).
                   Alternate page sizes are specified symbolically using either the name or abbreviation of an entry in the pagesizes(5) database; e.g.  a3 (ISO A3), a4 (ISO A4), a5 (ISO A5), a6 (ISO A6), b4
                   (ISO B4), na-let (North American Letter), us-leg (American Legal), us-led (American Ledger), us-exe (American Executive), jp-let (Japanese Letter), and jp-leg  (Japanese  Legal).   Compar‐
                   isons are case-insensitive and any match of a substring of the full page-size name is sufficient; e.g. ``legal'' would match ``American Legal''.

                   Note  that  it  may  not be permissible to image into the full page area; the guaranteed reproducible area for a page is typically inset.  Also, note that while arbitrary page sizes can be
                   specified through the page size database, only a limited set of page dimensions are supported by the Group 3 facsimile protocol.  Thus if an odd-size facsimile is submitted  for  transmis‐
                   sion it may not be possible to determine if it can be sent until the fax server establishes communication with the remote facsimile machine.

       -S tsi      Pass tsi to the server as the suggested sender identification to be used, for example, in tagline imaging and fax protocol.

       -t tries    Make  no  more  than tries attempts to send the facsimile.  By default, HylaFAX will terminate a job if 3 consecutive attempts to send a particular page fail, or it appears the receiver is
                   not a facsimile machine.  Otherwise HylaFAX places no limit on the number of attempts to send a facsimile, instead terminating a job if it is not completed within a kill time  timeout  in‐
                   terval.   Note  that a try is a call in which carrier is established and the facsimile protocol is commenced; this is contrasted with a call attempt that might have failed because the line
                   was busy.  Use ``-1'' to indicate that no tries value should be specified to the server.

       -T maxdials Make no more than maxdials calls in attempting to send the facsimile.  By default, HylaFAX will redial 12 times before killing a job.  Use ``-1'' to indicate that no maxdials value  should
                   be specified to the server.

       -U voice-no Pass voice-no to the faxcover(1) program as the sender's voice number.

       -V voice-no Pass voice-no to the faxcover(1) program as the destination person's voice number.

       -w          Wait for the job to complete before ending the sendfax session.  If this option is used, the sendfax process will not terminate until the job is completed.

       -W fax-no   Pass fax-no to the faxcover(1) program as the sender's fax number.

       -x company  Pass company to the faxcover(1) program as the destination company name.

       -X company  Pass company to the faxcover(1) program as the sender's company name.

       -y location Pass location to the faxcover(1) program as the destination company's location.

       -Y location Pass location to the faxcover(1) program as the sender's company location.

       -z filename Read  destinations from filename which contains a list of the destinations formatted identically as destinations for the -d option, one per line.  Usage of this option is similar to the -d
                   option and may be done in conjunction with other -d and -z options.

       -v          Print information on the standard output about each conversion and cover sheet generation operation it does.  If -v is specified twice, the protocol between sendfax and  the  hfaxd  server
                   process that does the submission work on the remote machine is also displayed.

       -Z range    Specify that only certain pages of the fax should actually be transmitted.  The range is in a comma-seperated list of ranges in the form of A[-B][,....].  The range is specified agains the
                   resulting document to be faxed, excluding any cover pages.  So if you have more than one document, make sure to account for them, and exclude the cover pages in  the  range  specification.
                   Cover pages will always be faxed, so a fax with a coverpage and 2 5 page documents with a range specified of of 1,3,10 will fax the cover page, and pages 1, 3, and 10 of the combined docu‐
                   ments (page 1 and 3 from the first document, and page 5 of the second document).

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

       The configuration parameters are explained below.  Certain configuration parameters, notably those for setting strings on automatically generated cover pages, are defined mainly for use by  other  Hy‐
       laFAX programs that share common code used by sendfax.

       AutoCoverPage   Control whether or not a cover page is automatically generated for each job.  (Equivalent to the -n option.)

       ChopThreshold   The amount of white space, in inches, that must be present at the bottom of a page before HylaFAX will attempt to truncate the page transmission.

       CoverCmd        The absolute pathname of the program to use to generate cover pages.  The default cover sheet program is /usr/bin/faxcover.

       Cover-Comments  The comments string to pass to the cover sheet program when auto-generating cover pages.

       Cover-Company   The to-company name string to pass to the cover sheet program when auto-generating cover pages.

       Cover-Location  The to-company location string to pass to the cover sheet program when auto-generating cover pages.

       Cover-Regarding The regarding string to pass to the cover sheet program when auto-generating cover pages.

       Cover-Template  The absolute pathname of a cover sheet template file to use in auto-generating cover pages.

                       The from-location string to pass to the cover sheet program when auto-generating cover pages.

       Cover-From-Voice
                       The from-voice number string to pass to the cover sheet program when auto-generating cover pages.

       Cover-From-Fax  The from-fax number string to pass to the cover sheet program when auto-generating cover pages.

       DateFormat      The strftime(3) format string to pass to the cover page command when auto-generating cover pages.

       DesiredEC       Which type of the optional Error Correct Mode (ECM) to use when transmitting facsimile.  0 to disable, 1 for 64-byte ECM, and 2 for 256-byte ECM (default).

       DesiredMST      The desired minimum scanline time to use when transmitting facsimile.  (Equivalent to the -M option.)

       DesiredSpeed    The desired signalling rate to the use when transmitting facsimile.  (Equivalent to the -B option.)

       DialRules       The  name  of  the file containing the dialstring processing rules to when preparing an externally visible representation of the dialstring (e.g. to strip credit card numbers).  By de‐
                       fault this is /etc/hylafax/dialrules.

       From            The sender's identity.  (Equivalent to the -f option.)

       Host            The host to contact for service.  (Equivalent to the -h option.)

       HRes            The horizontal resolution to use when transmitting facsimile.  (NB: this currently has no effect.)

       KillTime        The expiration time to assign to each job.  (Equivalent to the -k option.)

       MailAddr        The electronic mail address to direct notification messages from the server.  If this string is specified without an ``@hostname'' part then the local hostname  will  automatically  be
                       appended.  (Equivalent to the -f option.)

       MaxDials        The maximum number of times to dial the phone for each job.  (Equivalent to the -T option.)

       MaxTries        The maximum number of times to retry sending a job.  (Equivalent to the -t option.)

       MinSpeed        The minimum acceptable signalling rate to use when transmitting facsimile.  (Equivalent to the -b option.)

       Modem           The modem to use on the server.  (Equivalent to the -h option.)

       Notify          Control  the email notification messages from the server.  This string may be one of ``done'', ``none'', ``requeued'' or ``default'' with an optionally preceding ``when '' (e.g. ``when
                       done'').  Note that ``when requeued'' implies ``when done''.  (Equivalent to the -D, -R, and -N options.)

       PageChop        Control page chop handling when transmitting facsimile.  This string may be one of ``none'', ``all'', or ``last' to have no pages chopped, all pages chopped,  or  only  the  last  page
                       chopped; respectively.  Page chopping is controlled by the ChopThreshold parameter.

       PageLength      Set the transmitted page length in millimeters.

       PageSize        Set the page dimensions according to an entry in the pagesizes(5) database.  (Equivalent to the -s option.)

       PageWidth       Set the transmitted page width in millimeters.

       PassiveMode     Whether or not to use passive mode in communication with the server.

       Port            The network port to contact for service.  (Equivalent to the -h option.)

       Priority        The scheduling priority to assign to each job.  (Equivalent to the -P option.)

       Protocol        The name of the communication protocol to use when contacting a server.  (Equivalent to the FAXSERVICE environment variable.)

       SendTime        The time to send jobs.  (Equivalent to the -a option.)

       TagLine         The tagline format string to use when transmitting facsimile.  (Equivalent to the -F option.)

       TypeRules       The name of the file containing file type conversion rules.  By default this is /etc/hylafax/typerules.

       Verbose         Control protocol tracing.  (Equivalent to the -vv option.)

       VRes            Set the vertical resolution in lines/inch to use when transmitting facsimile.  (Equivalent to the -m and -l options.)

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following messages are generated because of problems encountered on the local machine.

       Could not call server.  The facsimile server on the remote machine did not respond.

       No input data; transmission aborted.  No data was supplied (typically on the standard input).  No facsimile will be sent.

       Error converting data; command was  %s."  A data conversion operation failed; the shell command that was used is printed.

       Can  not convert %s.  Data needed to be converted for transmission, but the required conversion rule was not located.  This may indicate that the HylaFAX software was incorrectly installed; or perhaps
       that an NFS-mounted directory is temporarily unavailable.

       %s: Can not determine file type.  sendfax was unable to deduce the type of the file.

       %s: Not a regular file.  The file is something other than a regular file; for example, a directory.

       The following messages may be printed by sendfax.  These messages describe problems encountered by the server process on the remote machine.  This list is incomplete; other messages may  be  generated
       by the server under unusual circumstances.
