MAP(1)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               MAP(1)

NAME
       map - An utility to map texts from and to unicode

SYNOPSIS
        map - recode from and to various character sets.
              Reads from STDIN, writes to STDOUT.
        usage: map [--from cset] [--to cset] < input.txt > output.txt

        from s  Encoding of input files (default "ISO-8859-1")
        list    Lists available character sets and their alias names.
        to   s  Encoding of output files (default "ISO-8859-1")

DESCRIPTION
       Maps text from one character set representation to another. This work
       is actually long time very well done by "recode", but unfortunately
       recode does not support Unicode and eastern asia character sets. But,
       if you have pure 8 bit things to do, recode will still be the best
       solution.

       Examples:

       Conversion from ISO-8859-1 to Unicode:

        map --to unicode < iso-8859-1.txt > unicode.txt

       Conversion from GB2312 to CP936:

        map --from cp936 --to GB2312 < gb2312.txt > cp936.txt

       Conversion from CP850 to Unicode:

        map --from cp850 --to unicode < cp850.txt > unicode.txt
