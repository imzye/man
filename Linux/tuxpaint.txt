DESCRIPTION
       tuxpaint-import  is  a  simple  shell script which uses some NetPBM (pnm(5)) tools (anytopnm, pnmscale and pnmtopng) along with date(1) to convert an arbitrary image file (e.g., a JPEG, GIF, etc.)
       into a PNG(5) file which can be used by the drawing program Tux Paint (tuxpaint(1)) and places it in the user's Tux Paint saved-files directory ($HOME/.tuxpaint/saved/).
