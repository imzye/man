       persalys - uncertainty treatment and variabilities management software

SYNOPSIS
       persalys

DESCRIPTION
       Persalys  is  a  GUI dedicated to the treatment of uncertainty and the management of variabilities. The software is a tool between the computer simulation, probabilistic analyses and the data sci‐
       ences.

       Persalys allows one to:

       - create mathematical models: analytical, coupling with an external model (finite elements, ...), FMU

       - analyse the variability of your parameters thanks to many methods and visualisation tools

       - statistically analyse your measuring data, infer probability distributions or create metamodels.
