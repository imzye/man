NAME
       dhex_searchlog — search log file for dhex

DESCRIPTION
       Searchlogs for dhex(1) are stored in searchlog files. This manpage describes the format of those files.

   EXAMPLE
       A typical searchlog file looks like this:
       ‘#DHEX SEARCHLOG’
       ‘#VERSION 0’
       ‘#Search was for d0 0f af fe’
       ‘#lines are all in hex’
       ‘0000000000002385’
       ‘0000000000002e21’
       ‘0000000000006acb’
       ‘0000000000006b8b’
       ‘000000000000cd27’

OPTIONS
       In the example above, the file has two sections: A comment section, and an offset section.

   Comments
       Comments are indicated with a '#' character. Everything afterwards in a line is being ignored when parsing the file

   Offset section
       Offsets  are  64  bit addresses presented as hexadecimal values. It is the offset where the searchstring occurred as result when the searchlog was written.  And it is also where the next search is
       being conducted when reading the searchlog.

BUGS
       Report bugs to <dettus@dettus.net>.  Make sure to include DHEX somewhere in the subject.
