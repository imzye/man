NAME
       alevt - X11 Teletext browser

SYNOPSIS
       alevt [options]

DESCRIPTION
       alevt is an X11 program for browsing and searching Teletext pages received by a compatible decoder (at the moment, bttv).

OPTIONS
       A summary of command line options is included below.  The X11 user interface is described in the built-in manual.

       -display display
           Where to display the windows.  Default: $DISPLAY.

       -geometry geometry
           Specifies the size and position of the windows.  Default: 41x25.

       -vbi device
           Use the given device name.  Default: /dev/vbi, /dev/vbi0, /dev/video0, /dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0 tried in this order.

       -finetune -4..4|auto
           Try some fine tuning if you have a lot of decoding errors (these lightning symbols).  This allows fine tuning of the decoder circuit.  The pre finetune behaviour was -finetune 0.  Default: 1.

       [-parent] ppp[.ss]
           Open a new window with the page number given by ppp and an optional subpage index given by ss.

           The -parent keyword is just for completeness and not normally used.  The page number alone is sufficient.  Default: 900.

       -child ppp[.ss]
           Open a new child window with the page number given by ppp and an optional subpage index given by ss.  About the concept of parent and child windows see the built-in manual.

       -erc/-noerc
           Enables/disables the error reduction code which substitutes errors on a page by data from a previously received one.  Enabled by default.

       -bell/-nobell
           Enables/disables the error bell.  Normally enabled.

       -charset latin-1|latin-2|koi8-r|iso8859-7
           Selects the character set to use.  Characters not present in the selected set are replaced by similar looking symbols.  (default: latin-1)

       -progname name
           Specifies the program name if using the DVB interface.

       -pid pid
           Specifies the teletext PID if using the DVB interface.

       --help
           Show summary of options.

       --version
           Show version of program.

       The  order  of options is important!  Each page number opens a new window with the previously given geometry, device, and display.  For example, to open two windows on the local display and one on
       display foo:0 you would start it with:

              alevt 100 300 -display foo:0 100

       Or, one window from /dev/vbi0 and one from /dev/vbi1 (untested *g*):

              alevt -vbi /dev/vbi0 100 -vbi /dev/vbi1 100

       The -child options requires a parent window.  So, it must be preceded by a parent or another child window.

       When saving pages alevt asks for a format string.  Look at alevt-cap(1).  The chapter Format Specifiers gives an explanation.

       alevt has no support to set or change the TV channel.  This should be done with another (not supplied) program like xawtv or set-tv from the xawtv package.  Maybe in the future  there  will  be  a
       more sophisticated method in bttv to switch channels etc with a dedicated tuner application.  But, at the moment, you have to live with it...

       The -progname or -pid option specifies the program or teletext PID if using the DVB interface.

       If neither of these two options is used, alevt outputs informations about the currently accessible streams and uses the first of these PIDs as default. This output contains the PIDs and names that
       can be used as an input for the -progname or -pid option in the context of the currently chosen TV channel.

FILES
       /dev/vbi*

       /dev/dvb/adapter*/demux*

EXAMPLES
       Select the teletext stream by the PID hex value:

              alevt -vbi /dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0 -pid 0x0237

       Select the teletext stream by the PID decimal value:

              alevt -vbi /dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0 -pid 567

       Select the teletext stream by the program name:

              alevt -vbi /dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0 -progname ´kabel eins´
