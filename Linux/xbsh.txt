NAME
       xbsh - BeanShell: A Java scripting environment (windowed version).

SYNOPSIS
       xbsh [-classpath path] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       BeanShell  is a small, embeddable, Java source interpreter with object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell executes standard Java statements and expressions, in addition to obvious
       scripting commands and syntax. You can also script objects as simple method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript(tm).

       xbsh starts the windowed version of BeanShell.

OPTIONS
       The program xbsh optionally takes a -classpath option which sets the value of the CLASSPATH environment variable to the specified path before starting the BeanShell.  This option  is  mainly  provided
       for compatibility with JDE (Java Development Environment for Emacs).

       In addition, a file to be executed may be given as argument to xbsh.

SEE ALSO
       bsh - the command-line version of BeanShell.

       More documentation on BeanShell can be found in /usr/share/doc/bsh-doc/ if the bsh-doc package is installed.
