NAME
       lpf - lpd filter for nroff output

SYNOPSIS
       lpf -w width -l length

DESCRIPTION
       lpf  is a filter which reads the output of nroff and converts lines with ^H's to overwritten lines.  Thus this works like ul(1) but is much better: it can handle more than 2 overwrites and it is writ‐
       ten with some style.

NOTES
       This program was designed long ago, and is not much if any use today.

BUGS
       lpf will send itself the STOP signal when it encounters the character sequence `\031\1'.
