NAME
       jmeters - multichannel audio level meters for Jack Audio Connection Kit.

SYNOPSIS
       jmeters [options][labels]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jmeters

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       jmeters uses the same pixmaps as meterbridge. The main difference to meterbridge is that jmeters has the correct ballistics for both the VU and the PPM.

       jmeters offers VU, PPM, BBC, DIN and stereo versions of PPM, BBC, DIN . The stereo versions have two indicator needles on the same scale.

       jmeters offers also correlation meters matching the VU, BBC and DIN styles, most of them in different sizes and shapes.
