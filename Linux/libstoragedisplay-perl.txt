NAME
       storage2dot - analyse and generate a graphical view of a machine storage

SYNOPSIS
       storage2dot [OPTIONS]

         Options:
           --remote|-r MACHINE   collect data on MACHINE (through SSH)
           --collect-only|-c     generate plain data instead of dot file
           --data|-d FILE        use FILE as data source
           --output|-o FILE      write output into FILE
           --record-file FILE    record shell commandsinto FILE [for tests]
           --replay-file FILE    collect data from FILE [for tests]
           --help|-h             brief documentation
           --man                 full documentation

       This program can be used to collect data about the storage state from local or remote machines (through SSH) and use them to generate a DOT graphic representing them.

OPTIONS
       --remote MACHINE
               Collect storage data on MACHINE (through SSH). By default, local storage data are collected (without SSH).

       --collect-only
               By default, a DOT file is generated from the storage data. With this option, the program do not create the DOT file but only output the raw collected data for later analyze.

       --data FILE
               In order to generate the DOT file, use the provided data. FILE must have been created with the help of the previous option. No new data are collected when this option is used.

       --output FILE
               Write generated data (DOT by default) into FILE instead of the standard output.

       --record-file FILE
               Write shell commands (and their output) that are used to collect data into FILE. This is mainly used for reproducibility during tests.

       --replay-file FILE
               Use information from FILE instead of running real shell commands in order to collect data. FILE must be This is mainly used for reproducibility during tests.

       --help  Print a brief help message and exits.

       --man   Prints the manual page and exits.

EXAMPLES
       storage2dot -o state.dot
               Generate a DOT file representing the state of the storage on the local machine.

       storage2dot -r host -o state.dot
               Generate  a  DOT file representing the state of the storage on the remote host machine. Only perl (and its standard modules) are required on the remote machine. Of course, a SSH account is
               also required.

       storage2dot -c -o state.data
               Just collect data on current machine without generating a DOT file.  Only perl (and its standard modules) are required on the current machine.

       storage2dot --data state.data -o state.dot
               Generate a DOT file representing the state of the storage recorded in the state.data file. Extra perl modules are required for this command.

       dot -Tpdf state.dot > state.pdf
               Generate a PDF from the DOT file using dot(1).
