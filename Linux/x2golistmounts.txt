NAME
       x2golistmounts - List Mounted Shares for an X2Go Session

SYNOPSIS
       x2golistmounts [<session_id>]

DESCRIPTION
       x2golistmounts returns a list of mounted client-side folders or devices for X2Go session <session_id>.

       If this commands get evoked inside an X2Go session, the <session_id> parameter can be omitted (and the env var $X2GO_SESSION will be used instead).

       x2golistmounts is run with normal user privileges and it is used by X2Go clients to render a list of SSHFS mounts for a given X2Go sessions.

RETURN VALUES
       A line-by-line list of mounted shares is returned by x2golistmounts. Each line consists of two mount point attribute fields separated by the pipe symbol (,,|'').

       The meanings of these mount point attributes are:

         field 01: <sshfs_target_host_ip>
         field 02: <mount_point_path_on_server>

       As exitcode x2golistmounts always returns 0.
