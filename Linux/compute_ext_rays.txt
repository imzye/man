NAME
       compute_ext_rays - compute extreme rays of a tropical cone

DESCRIPTION
       Computes the extreme rays of a tropical cone given by a system of tropically affine inequalities.

ARGUMENTS
       -numerical-data
              Set the type of numerical data used by the algorithm, one of: ocaml_int, ocaml_float, ocaml_big_int, ocaml_big_rat, zarith_int, and zarith_rat.

       -min-plus
              Use the min-plus semiring instead of the default max-plus semiring.

       -no-ordering
              The constraints are not dynamically ordered during the execution.

       -polymake-output
              Output under polymake format.  Takes an argument, corresponding to a list c_1,...,c_p of coordinates on which the result is projected.

       -bounding-box
              Set a bounding box, specified as a list (separated by commas) of triples (c:l:u), where c is the index of a coordinate, and l and u are lower and upper bounds (-infinity/+infinity are allowed).

       -help, --help
              Display this list of options.
