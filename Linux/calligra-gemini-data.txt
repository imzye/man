NAME
       camlmix - preprocessor which converts text with embedded OCaml

SYNOPSIS
       camlmix [Options...] files...

DESCRIPTION
       camlmix  processes text templates with embedded OCaml code to generate text again. From one or several input files it generates an OCaml text generation pro‐
       gram and executes this to obtain the result.  Using option -fun one can also convert the text template into an OCaml text generation function.

OPTIONS
       -o output
              write the generated text into file output

       -c     Only generate the text generation program, don't execute it.  By default, the program is called lastfile.ml when lastfile is the last file argument.

       -co file
              specify the name of the text generation program

       -fun   generate OCaml code for text generation function from the input (see ADVANCED USAGE below)

       -e ocamlc
              set the name of the OCaml executable

       -clean remove the text generation program after execution

       -insert ocaml_code
              insert ocaml_code at the beginning of the text generation program

       -remix try a conversion to the camlremix syntax

       -version
              print version and exit

       -help | --help
              print help and exit (this man page was written from the output of -help)

BASIC USAGE
       Text enclosed with ## markers is considered as a block of OCaml code. It can be any kind of toplevel expressions such as definitions or application of print‐
       ing functions:

              This is ocaml version ## print Sys.ocaml_version ##

       If the OCaml code starts with = then it is interpreted as an expression of type string that will printed like the rest of the text:

              This is ocaml version ##= Sys.ocaml_version ##

       The text block are printed together with the evaluated OCaml pieces using the print function. Include ### to print ##.

       White space can be controlled with ##.  and .##:

       ##.    don't print white space occurring on the left

       .##    don't print white space up to and including the first newline, following to the right.

ADVANCED USAGE
   Directives
       Blocks of code that start with the @ character (possibly preceded by spaces) are directives for Camlmix. There are two directives.  include inserts a camlmix
       file, and skip skips the next block. For instance

              Hello ## @include "world.mlx"; skip .## ## let x = 123 ##!

   Conversion into a text generation function for dynamic rendering
       The -fun option, used in combination with -c and often -co produces an OCaml source file which provides a function render with the following signature:

              val render : ?print:(string -> unit) -> 'a -> unit

       The polymorphic argument is called param in the generated code and can be used to pass runtime arguments into the render function. The print function is used
       to set the initial value of Camlmix.printer (see below). It's default value is:

                     fun s -> print_string s; flush stdout

   Runtime hooks
       The  text generation program, which camlmix generates, contains a module Camlmix at the beginning, which can be used in code blocks. This module has the fol‐
       lowing signature.

           module Camlmix : sig

               val source : string ref

               val line : int ref

               val char : int ref
                      Location of the first character of the current block in its source file. Line and character numbers count from 1. These references are updated
                      by camlmix at the beginning of each block.

               val printer : (string -> unit) ref
                      function for printing text blocks

               val print_with : (string -> unit) -> unit
                      print_with f causes the next text block to be printed with f instead of the current printer. Its behavior is undefined if it is called several
                      times in the same code block.

               val print_if : bool -> unit
                      print_if cond prints the next text block only if condition cond is true. It uses print_with internally.

           end
