NAME
       probalign - Align sequences in MFAFILE(s) and print result to standard output

DESCRIPTION
       PROBALIGN  Version 1.4 (Nov 2010) aligns multiple protein sequences and prints to the standard output. Written by Satish Chikkagoudar and Usman Roshan using code from PROBCONS version 1.1 (written
       by Chuong Do) and based upon probA (written by Ulrike Muckstein).

       PROBALIGN 1.4 comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.  See the README file for details.

   Usage:
              probalign [OPTION]... [MFAFILE]...

   Description:
              Align sequences in MFAFILE(s) and print result to standard output

       -clustalw

              use CLUSTALW output format instead of MFA

       -v, --verbose

              report progress while aligning (default: off)

       -a, --alignment-order

              print sequences in alignment order rather than input order (default: off)

       -T, -temperature

              Sets the thermodynamic temperature parameter

              (default: 5 (for protein data mode), 1 ( for nucleotide data mode)).

       -score_matrix, --score_matrix

              Sets the type of scoring matrix used to calculate the posterior probabilities (default: gonnet_160, representing gonnet 160, refer README for details)

       -go, --gap-open

              This option can be used to specify the gap open parameter. The default for Gonnet 160 (protein) is 22 and nucleotide (simple matrix) is 4.

       -ge, --gap-extension

              This option can be used to specify the gap extension parameter. The default for Gonnet 160 (protein) is 1 and nucleotide (simple matrix) is 0.25.

       -nuc

              Specify this option to indicate that inputted sequences are nucleotide sequences

       -prot

              Specify this option to indicate that inputted sequences are protein sequences [DEFAULT]

       -showPP

              Outputs the posterior probabilities of alignment columns as a new sequence named Posterior Probabilities (The probability values are scaled to be between integers between 0 and 9).
