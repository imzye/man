NAME
       ltx2unitxt - convert LaTeX source fragment to plain (Unicode) text or simple html

SYNOPSIS
       ltx2unitxt [-c CONFIG] [-o OUTPUT] [--html] [...] [INFILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Convert  the  LaTeX  source in INFILE (or standard input) to plain text using Unicode code points for accents and other special characters; or, optionally, output HTML with simple translations for
       font changes and url commands.

       Common accent sequences, special characters, and simple markup commands are translated, but there is no attempt at completeness. Math, tables, figures, sectioning, etc., are  not  handled  in  any
       way, and mostly left in their TeX form in the output. The translations assume standard LaTeX meanings for characters and control sequences; macros in the input are not considered.

       The  input can be a fragment of text, not a full document, as the purpose of this script was to handle bibliography entries and abstracts (for the ltx2crossrefxml script that is part of the cross‐
       refware package).  Patches to extend this script are welcome. It uses the LaTeX::ToUnicode Perl library for the conversion; see its documentation for details.

       Conversion is currently done line by line, so TeX constructs that cross multiple lines are not handled properly. If it turns out to be useful, conversion could be done by paragraph instead.

       The config file is read as a Perl source file. It can define a function `LaTeX_ToUnicode_convert_hook()' which will be called early; the value it returns (which must be a string) will then be sub‐
       ject to the standard conversion.

       For an example of using this script and associated code, see the TUGboat processing at https://github.com/TeXUsersGroup/tugboat/tree/trunk/capsules/crossref.
