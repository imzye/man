NAME
       makexvpics - create xv-compatible thumbnails

SYNOPSIS
       makexvpics [ -fhRv ] picture_file_or_dir [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Makexvpics creates/updates xv/zgv/Gimp-compatible thumbnails for picture files such as GIFs, JPEGs, etc. It may be useful if you want a non-interactive way of keeping such files up to date.

       The formats currently supported are GIF, JPEG, PNG, PBM/PGM/PPM, mrf, BMP, TGA, and PCX.

OPTIONS
       -f     force thumbnails to be updated. Ordinarily they're only updated if no thumbnail exists or if the picture file is newer.

       -h     give usage help.

       -R     recurse into subdirectories.

       -v     be verbose - echo names (or rather, `basename's) of files which are being updated.

BUGS
       It's pretty slow.
