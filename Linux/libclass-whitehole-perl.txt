NAME
       Class::WhiteHole - base class to treat unhandled method calls as errors

SYNOPSIS
         package Bar;

         # DBI inherits from DynaLoader which inherits from AutoLoader
         # Bar wants to avoid this accidental inheritance of AutoLoader.
         use base qw(Class::WhiteHole DBI);

DESCRIPTION
       Its possible to accidentally inherit an AUTOLOAD method.  Often this will happen if a class somewhere in the chain uses AutoLoader or defines one of their own.  This can lead to confusing error
       messages when method lookups fail.

       Sometimes you want to avoid this accidental inheritance.  In that case, inherit from Class::WhiteHole.  All unhandled methods will produce normal Perl error messages.

BUGS & CAVEATS
       Be sure to have Class::WhiteHole before the class from which you're inheriting AUTOLOAD in the ISA.  Usually you'll want Class::WhiteHole to come first.

       If your class inherits autoloaded routines this class may cause them to stop working.  Choose wisely before using.

       White holes are only a hypothesis and may not really exist.
