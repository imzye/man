       Infile must be a Microsoft Word file. The script first calls the `antiword' program, so you must have this installed on your machine.  `antiword' is called with `-x db', which causes the output to
       be in docbook format. This is piped to `xml2brl'. The output file from `xml2brl' contains much of the formatting, including emphasis, of the word file.
