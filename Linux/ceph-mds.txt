NAME
       ceph-mds - ceph metadata server daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-mds -i <ID> [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-mds  is the metadata server daemon for the Ceph distributed file system. One or more instances of ceph-mds collectively manage the file system namespace, coordinating access to the shared OSD
       cluster.

       Each ceph-mds daemon instance should have a unique name. The name is used to identify daemon instances in the ceph.conf.

       Once the daemon has started, the monitor cluster will normally assign it a logical rank, or put it in a standby pool to take over for another daemon that crashes. Some of the specified options can
       cause other behaviors.

OPTIONS
       -f, --foreground
              Foreground: do not daemonize after startup (run in foreground). Do not generate a pid file. Useful when run via ceph-run(8).

       -d     Debug mode: like -f, but also send all log output to stderr.

       --setuser userorgid
              Set uid after starting.  If a username is specified, the user record is looked up to get a uid and a gid, and the gid is also set as well, unless --setgroup is also specified.

       --setgroup grouporgid
              Set gid after starting.  If a group name is specified the group record is looked up to get a gid.

       -c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
              Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.

       -m monaddress[:port]
              Connect to specified monitor (instead of looking through ceph.conf).

       --id/-i ID
              Set ID portion of the MDS name. The ID should not start with a numeric digit.

       --name/-n TYPE.ID
              Set the MDS name of the format TYPE.ID. The TYPE is obviously 'mds'.  The ID should not start with a numeric digit.

AVAILABILITY
       ceph-mds is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at https://docs.ceph.com for more information.
