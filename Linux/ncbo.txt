DESCRIPTION
       ncbo  subtracts  variables in file_2 from the corresponding variables (those with the same name) in file_1 and stores the results in file_3.  Variables in file_2 are broadcast to conform to the corre‐
       sponding variable in file_1 if necessary.  Broadcasting a variable means creating data in non-existing dimensions from the data in existing dimensions.  For example,  a  two  dimensional  variable  in
       file_2  can  be  subtracted  from a four, three, or two (but not one or zero) dimensional variable (of the same name) in file_1.  This functionality allows the user to compute anomalies from the mean.
       Note that variables in file_1 are not broadcast to conform to the dimensions in file_2.  Thus, ncbo, the number of dimensions, or rank, of any processed variable in file_1  must  be  greater  than  or
       equal to the rank of the same variable in file_2.  Furthermore, the size of all dimensions common to both file_1 and file_2 must be equal.

       When  computing  anomalies  from  the  mean it is often the case that file_2 was created by applying an averaging operator to a file with the same dimensions as file_1, if not file_1 itself.  In these
       cases, creating file_2 with ncra rather than ncwa will cause the ncbo operation to fail.  For concreteness say the record dimension in file_1 is time.  If file_2 were created by averaging file_1  over
       the  time dimension with the ncra operator rather than with the ncwa operator, then file_2 will have a time dimension of size 1 rather than having no time dimension at all In this case the input files
       to ncbo, file_1 and file_2, will have unequally sized time dimensions which causes ncbo to fail.  To prevent this from occurring, use ncwa to remove the time dimension  from  file_2.   An  example  is
       given below.

       ncbo  will  never  difference  coordinate  variables or variables of type NC_CHAR or NC_BYTE.  This ensures that coordinates like (e.g., latitude and longitude) are physically meaningful in the output
       file, file_3.  This behavior is hardcoded.  ncbo applies special rules to some NCAR CSM fields (e.g., ORO).  See NCAR CSM Conventions for  a  complete  description.   Finally,  we  note  that  ncflint
       (ncflint netCDF File Interpolator) can be also perform file subtraction (as well as addition, multiplication and interpolation).

EXAMPLES
       Say files 85_0112.nc and 86_0112.nc each contain 12 months of data.  Compute the change in the monthly averages from 1985 to 1986:
              ncbo 86_0112.nc 85_0112.nc 86m85_0112.nc

       The  following examples demonstrate the broadcasting feature of ncbo.  Say we wish to compute the monthly anomalies of T from the yearly average of T for the year 1985.  First we create the 1985 aver‐
       age from the monthly data, which is stored with the record dimension time.
              ncra 85_0112.nc 85.nc
              ncwa -O -a time 85.nc 85.nc
       The second command, ncwa, gets rid of the time dimension of size 1 that ncra left in 85.nc.  Now none of the variables in 85.nc has a time dimension.  A quicker way to accomplish this is to  use  ncwa
       from the beginning:
              ncwa -a time 85_0112.nc 85.nc
       We are now ready to use ncbo to compute the anomalies for 1985:
              ncbo -v T 85_0112.nc 85.nc t_anm_85_0112.nc
       Each of the 12 records in t_anm_85_0112.nc now contains the monthly deviation of T from the annual mean of T for each gridpoint.

       Say  we wish to compute the monthly gridpoint anomalies from the zonal annual mean.  A zonal mean is a quantity that has been averaged over the longitudinal (or x) direction.  First we use ncwa to av‐
       erage over longitudinal direction lon, creating xavg_85.nc, the zonal mean of 85.nc.  Then we use ncbo to subtract the zonal annual means from the monthly gridpoint data:
              ncwa -a lon 85.nc xavg_85.nc
              ncbo 85_0112.nc xavg_85.nc tx_anm_85_0112.nc
       Assuming 85_0112.nc has dimensions time and lon, this example only works if xavg_85.nc has no time or lon dimension.

       As a final example, say we have five years of monthly data (i.e., 60 months) stored in 8501_8912.nc and we wish to create a file which contains the twelve month seasonal cycle of the  average  monthly
       anomaly  from  the five-year mean of this data.  The following method is just one permutation of many which will accomplish the same result.  First use ncwa to create the file containing the five-year
       mean:
              ncwa -a time 8501_8912.nc 8589.nc
       Next use ncbo to create a file containing the difference of each month's data from the five-year mean:
              ncbo 8501_8912.nc 8589.nc t_anm_8501_8912.nc
       Now use ncks to group the five January anomalies together in one file, and use ncra to create the average anomaly for all five Januarys.  These commands are embedded in a shell loop so  they  are  re‐
       peated for all twelve months:
              foreach idx (01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12)
              ncks -F -d time,,,12 t_anm_8501_8912.nc foo.
              ncra foo. t_anm_8589_.nc
              end
       Note that ncra understands the stride argument so the two commands inside the loop may be combined into the single command
              ncra -F -d time,,,12 t_anm_8501_8912.nc foo.
       Finally, use ncrcat to concatenate the 12 average monthly anomaly files into one twelve-record file which contains the entire seasonal cycle of the monthly anomalies:
              ncrcat t_anm_8589_??.nc t_anm_8589_0112.nc
