DESCRIPTION
       Minimap is a tool to efficiently find multiple approximate mapping positions between two sets of long sequences, such as between reads and reference genomes, between genomes and between long noisy
       reads. Minimap has an indexing and a mapping phase. In the indexing phase, it collects all minimizers of a large batch of target sequences in a hash table; in the mapping phase, it identifies good
       clusters of colinear minimizer hits. Minimap does not generate detailed alignments between the target and the query sequences. It only outputs the approximate start  and  the  end  coordinates  of
       these clusters.

OPTIONS
   Indexing options
       -k INT    Minimizer k-mer length [15]

       -w INT    Minimizer window size [2/3 of k-mer length]. A minimizer is the smallest k-mer in a window of w consecutive k-mers.

       -I NUM    Load  at  most  NUM  target bases into RAM for indexing [4G]. If there are more than NUM bases in target.fa, minimap needs to read query.fa multiple times to map it against each batch of
                 target sequences.  NUM may be ending with k/K/m/M/g/G.

       -d FILE   Dump minimizer index to FILE [no dump]

       -l        Indicate that target.fa is in fact a minimizer index generated by option -d, not a FASTA or FASTQ file.

   Mapping options
       -f FLOAT  Ignore top FLOAT fraction of most occurring minimizers [0.001]

       -r INT    Approximate bandwidth for initial minimizer hits clustering [500]. A minimizer hit is a minimizer present in both the target and query sequences. A minimizer hit cluster is  a  group  of
                 potentially colinear minimizer hits between a target and a query sequence.

       -m FLOAT  Merge initial minimizer hit clusters if FLOAT or higher fraction of minimizers are shared between the clusters [0.5]

       -c INT    Retain a minimizer hit cluster if it contains INT or more minimizer hits [4]

       -L INT    Discard a minimizer hit cluster if after colinearization, the number of matching bases is below INT [40]. This option mainly reduces the size of output. It has little effect on the speed
                 and peak memory.

       -g INT    Split a minimizer hit cluster at a gap INT-bp or longer that does not contain any minimizer hits [10000]

       -T INT    Mask regions on query sequences with SDUST score threshold INT; 0 to disable [0]. SDUST is an algorithm to identify low-complexity subsequences. It is not enabled by default. If SDUST is
                 preferred, a value between 20 and 25 is recommended. A higher threshold masks less sequences.

       -S        Perform all-vs-all mapping. In this mode, if the query sequence name is lexicographically larger than the target sequence name, the hits between them will be suppressed; if the query se‐
                 quence name is the same as the target name, diagonal minimizer hits will also be suppressed.

       -O        Drop a minimizer hit if it is far away from other hits (EXPERIMENTAL). This option is useful for mapping long chromosomes from two diverged species.

       -x STR    Changing  multiple  settings based on STR [not set]. It is recommended to apply this option before other options, such that the following options may override the multiple settings modi‐
                 fied by this option.

                 ava10k  for PacBio or Oxford Nanopore all-vs-all read mapping (-Sw5 -L100 -m0).

   Input/output options
       -t INT    Number of threads [3]. Minimap uses at most three threads when collecting minimizers on target sequences, and uses up to INT+1 threads when mapping (the extra thread is for I/O, which is
                 frequently idle and takes little CPU time).

       -V        Print version number to stdout

OUTPUT FORMAT
       Minimap outputs mapping positions in the Pairwise mApping Format (PAF). PAF is a TAB-delimited text format with each line consisting of at least 12 fields as are described in the following table:

       When the alignment is available, column 11 gives the total number of sequence matches, mismatches and gaps in the alignment; column 10 divided by column 11 gives the alignment identity. As minimap
       does not generate detailed alignment, these two columns are approximate. PAF may optionally have additional fields in the SAM-like typed key-value format. Minimap writes the  number  of  minimizer
       hits in a cluster to the cm tag.
