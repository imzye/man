NAME
       oregano - GNOME application for schematic capture of electrical circuits

SYNOPSIS
       oregano

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page briefly documents oregano.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       oregano is an application for schematic capture and printing of electrical circuits.  It can also be used for simulation if you have NG-Spice or Gnucap.

BUGS
       This is under active development and things might not work as expected.  Regarding backwards compatibility, when opening oregano 0.23 files some wires  might
       be out of place, and the probes will not be present.

       Undo, redo has not yet been implemented.

SEE ALSO
       oregano  includes  online  help,  found  in  the  Help  menu  of  the  program.   Relevant  documentation  included  with  the  source  can  also be found in
       /usr/share/doc/oregano/
