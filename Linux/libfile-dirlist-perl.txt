NAME
       File::DirList - provide a sorted list of directory content

       Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
           use File::DirList;
           #
           my @list = File::DirList::list('.', 'dn', 1, 0);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to get a list of directory content.  It is a simple wrapper around DirHandle and sort()

       The module has two methods:

       "list($dirName, $sortMode, $noLinks, $hideDotFiles, $showSelf)"
           Produces a list, accepting 5 parameters:

           $dirName
               Name of the directory to list

           $sortMode
               Describes how list should be sorted.

               This is a string containing the following symbols, with uppercase representing the reverse sort:

               "d" or "D"
                   "Directory" sort. 'd' means all the directories will precede files, 'D' means reverse.

               "n" or "N"
                   Sort by file (or subdirectory) name.

               "i" or "I"
                   Same as 'n' but case insensitive.

               "m" or "M"
                   Sort by modification time.

               "c" or "C"
                   Sort by creation time.

               "a" or "A"
                   Sort by access time.

               "s" or "S"
                   Sort by size.

               $sortMode  is  interpreted  from  left  to  right.  If  the first comparison produces an equal result next one is used. For example, string "'din'" produces a list with all the directories
               preceding files, directories and files are sorted by name case insensitively, with lowercase letters preceding upper case.

           $noLinks
               If "true" symbolic links will not be examined. Set it on platforms without symlink support.

           $hideDotFiles
               If "true" 'dot' files will not be reported.

           $showSelf
               If "true" '.' directory entry will be reported.

           Returned value is an array reference, sorted as described by $sortMode.

           Array elements are array references representing an item.

           The individual item's array contains 17 elements:

           "[0..12]"
               Result of stat() for this item. For valid symbolic links, the stat of the target item is returned.

           "[13]"
               Name of the item.

           "[14]"
               Is item a directory? Contains 0 for non-directory items, 1 for directories, 2 for '..', 3 for '.'.  Used by "d or D" sorting.

           "[15]"
               Is item a link? 0 for non-links, 1 for valid links, "-1" for invalid links.

           "[16]"
               Link target. "undef" for non-links, target path for links.

           [15] and [16] are set to non-link if $examineLinks is "false".

       "sortList($list, $sortMode)"
           Used to re-sort a list produced by "list()"

           Parameters are

           $lis
               Reference to a list produced by "list()"

           $sortMode
               Sorting rules.

           Return value is similar to "list()"

   EXPORT
       None by default
