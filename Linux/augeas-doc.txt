NAME
     mute — use aumix to mute and un-mute sound output

SYNOPSIS
     This command does not take any command-line arguments.

DESCRIPTION
     mute is a small script that uses aumix to conveniently mute and un-mute sound. If sound is currently not muted, running mute will save your current settings to
     ~/.aumixrc (or /etc/aumixrc if you are root) and mute the sound.  Running mute again will restore the settings.

BUGS
     The current ~/.aumixrc or /etc/aumixrc will be overwritten.
