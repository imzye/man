       1  Compile a textual representation of a BCT into a binary image.

       2  Generate an entire boot image from a previously compiled BCT and a bootloader binary.

   Platforms supported
       •      Tegra20

       •      Tegra30

       •      Tegra114

       •      Tegra124

       •      Tegra132

       •      Tegra210

COMMANDS
       -gbct  Generate the new bct file from the given config file.

       -h, --help, -?
              Print help text and exit.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Output debugging information.

       -oodm_data
              Specify the odm_data value (in hex).

       -t, --tegra NN
              Select target device.  Must be one of: 20, 30, 114, 124, 132, 210.

       -s, --ssoc tegraNN
              Select target device.  Must be one of: tegra20, tegra30, tegra114, tegra124, tegra32, tegra210.

       -u --update
              Copy input image data and update bct configs into new image file

EXAMPLES
       To generate a bct file from a text description obtained either through bct_dump(1) or cbootimage-configs:

       $ cbootimage -gbct -t124 PM375_Hynix_2GB_H5TC4G63AFR_RDA_924MHz.bct.cfg PM375_Hynix_2GB_H5TC4G63AFR_RDA_924MHz.bct
       New BCT file PM375_Hynix_2GB_H5TC4G63AFR_RDA_924MHz.bct has been successfully generated!

       To generate a boot image file including the newly generated bct:
       cbootimage -t124 jetson-tk1-emmc.img.cfg jetson-tk1-emmc.img
       Image file jetson-tk1-emmc.img has been successfully generated!

RETURN VALUE
       If any error occurs a non zero exit status is returned.
