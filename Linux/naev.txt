NAME
       Naev - A 2D space trading and combat game.

SYNOPSIS
       naev [OPTIONS] [DATA]

DESCRIPTION
       Naev is a space trading and combat game, inspired by Escape Velocity.

       Played from a top-down perspective with isometric sprites, the player is free to explore the galaxy as they see fit, trading or pirating their way to a vast fortune.

       Naev  is  set  in a futuristic science fiction environment, in which the player finds himself in the wake of a massive galactic cataclysm which erupted from the Sol system and destroyed everything
       within tens of light years, resulting in a massive, volatile nebula.
