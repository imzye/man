              [-q MINQUAL] [--headtrim HEADTRIM] [--tailtrim TAILTRIM] [-u]

       -l MINLEN, --minlen MINLEN
              Exclude reads shorter than this length. Default: 0

       -q MINQUAL, --minqual MINQUAL
              Minimum quality score to retain a read. Default: 10

       --headtrim HEADTRIM
              Trim x bases from beginning of each read. Default: 0

       --tailtrim TAILTRIM
              Trim x bases from end of each read. Default: None
