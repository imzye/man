NAME
       pathological - A puzzle game involving paths and marbles

SYNOPSIS
       pathological [ -h | --help ] [ -cb ] [ -f ] [ -s ] [ -q ] [ highscores-file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Pathological  is  an  enriched  clone  of  the  game  "Logical"  by Rainbow Arts.  To solve a level, fill each wheel with four balls of matching color.  Various board elements such as teleporters,
       switches, filters, etc., make the game interesting and challenging.  New levels can be created using your favorite text editor.  For more information, see the website:

       -cb    Enable special graphics for color-blind people.
