NAME
       jlex - lexical analyser generator for Java(tm)

SYNOPSIS
       jlex specfile

DESCRIPTION
       JLex takes the language specification in specfile and generates Java(tm) source code for a lexical analyser corresponding to the specification.

       The  lexical  analyzer source code is placed in a file whose name is the name of the JLex specification file, with the string ".java" added to the end.  For example, if the JLex specification file
       is called foo.lex, the lexical analyzer source code file that JLex produces will be called foo.lex.java.)

       The resulting lexical analyzer source code should be compiled with a Java compiler.  This produces a lexical analyzer class file, which can then be used in your application.  If the  default  set‐
       tings have not been changed, the lexical analyzer class will be called Yylex and the class files will named Yylex.class and Yytoken.class.
