preproc(1)                  General Commands Manual                 preproc(1)

NAME
       preproc

SYNOPSIS
       preproc  [-h]  [--no-break-on-failure] [--debug] [-e <varname>=<value>]
       [-s PATH] [-C path]

DESCRIPTION
       Simple text preprocessor implementing a very basic templating language.
       You  can use {{{ <bash_code> }}} tags in a text file and then pipe con‐
       tent of that file to preproc. preproc will replace  each  of  the  tags
       with  stdout of <bash_code> and print the final renderred result to its
       own stdout. NOTE: You need to trust input files that you pass  to  pre‐
       proc.  Running  preproc  on an unknown file is equivalent of running an
       unknown script on your computer.

OPTIONS
       --no-break-on-failure
              Normally, preproc will immediately stop processing as soon as an
              error is encountered. This switch changes the behavior.

       --debug
              Print each encountered tag and its env during input processing.

       -e <varname>=<value>, --env <varname>=<value>
              set  a  variable  into  macro  processing  environment,  e.g. -e
              VAR=VALUE.

       -s PATH, --source PATH
              sources given file into macro  processing  environment.  May  be
              used multiple times.

       -C path
              Directory to operate in.
