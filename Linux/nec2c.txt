NAME
       nec2c - Translation of the NEC2 FORTRAN source code to the C language

SYNOPSIS
       nec2c [/-i<input-file-name>] [/-o<output-file-name>][/-hv]

DESCRIPTION
       The  translation was performed mostly "by hand" and a lot of modifications to the original program were introduced in order to modernize the NEC2 and to remove as many built-in limitations as pos‐
       sible. The attendant SOMNEC program was also translated to C and incorporated in nec2c as a function so that Sommerfeld ground solutions are a part of the program.

OPTIONS
       The -i option is always needed and it specifies the name of the input file. The -o switch is optional and it specifies the output file name.  If not used, a name for the output  file  is  made  by
       stripping  any  extensions  from  the  input file name and adding a ".out" extension, e.g.  nec2c -i yagi.nec will cause nec2c to read yagi.nec as the input file and produce yagi.out as the output
       file.

       -i input filename
           Input File Name

       -o output filename
           Output File Name

       -h
           Print usage information and exit

       -v
           Print nec2c version number and exit
