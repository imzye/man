       reverse_markdown - transform HTML into Markdown

SYNOPSIS
       reverse_markdown [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       reverse_markdown  transforms  HTML  into  Markdown. It supports all the established tags and can be extended to handle new ones too. It can deal with nested lists, inline and block code and block‐
       quotes.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported.

       -u mode, --unknown_tags mode
              Define how to handle unknown tags.

              Supported modes are: pass_through (include unknown tags in result), drop (remove tag and its content from output), bypass (ignore the unknown tag but try to convert its content)  and  raise
              (raise an error).

       -g bool, --github_flavored bool
              Use GitHub flavoured Markdown. The default is false.
