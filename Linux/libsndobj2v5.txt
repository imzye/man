        ...
        $sess = new SNMP::Session(DestHost => localhost, Community => public);
        $val = $sess->get('sysDescr.0');
        ...

        ...
        $vb = new SNMP::Varbind();
        do {
           $val = $sess->getnext($vb);

        SNMP::initMib(); # assuming mib is not already loaded
        print "$SNMP::MIB{sysDescr}{description}\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Note: The perl SNMP 5.0 module which comes with net-snmp 5.0 and higher is different than previous versions in a number of ways.  Most importantly, it
       behaves like a proper net-snmp application and calls init_snmp properly, which means it will read configuration files and use those defaults where
       appropriate automatically parse MIB files, etc.  This will likely affect your perl applications if you have, for instance, default values set up in your
       snmp.conf file (as the perl module will now make use of those defaults).  The documentation, however, has sadly not been updated yet (aside from this note),
       nor is the read_config default usage implementation fully complete.

       The basic operations of the SNMP protocol are provided by this module through an object oriented interface for modularity and ease of use.  The primary class
       is SNMP::Session which encapsulates the persistent aspects of a connection between the management application and the managed agent. Internally the class is
       implemented as a blessed hash reference. This class supplies 'get', 'getnext', 'set', 'fget', and 'fgetnext' method calls. The methods take a variety of
       input argument formats and support both synchronous and asynchronous operation through a polymorphic API (i.e., method behaviour varies dependent on args
       passed - see below).

SNMP::Session
       $sess = new SNMP::Session(DestHost => 'host', ...)

       The following arguments may be passed to new as a hash.

   Basic Options
       DestHost
           Hostname or IP address of the SNMP agent you want to talk to.  Specified in Net-SNMP formatted agent addresses.  These addresses typically look like one
           of the following:

             localhost
             tcp:localhost
             tls:localhost
             tls:localhost:9876
             udp6:[::1]:9876
             unix:/some/path/to/file/socket

           Defaults to 'localhost'.

       Version
           SNMP version to use.

           The default is taken from library configuration - probably 3 [1, 2 (same as 2c), 2c, 3].

       Timeout
           The number of micro-seconds to wait before resending a request.

           The default is '1000000'

       Retries
           The number of times to retry a request.

           The default is '5'

       RetryNoSuch
           If enabled NOSUCH errors in 'get' pdus will be repaired, removing the varbind in error, and resent - undef will be returned for all NOSUCH varbinds, when
           set to '0' this feature is disabled and the entire get request will fail on any NOSUCH error (applies to v1 only)

           The default is '0'.

   SNMPv3/TLS Options
       OurIdentity
           Our X.509 identity to use, which should either be a fingerprint or the filename that holds the certificate.

       TheirIdentity
           The remote server's identity to connect to, specified as either a fingerprint or a file name.  Either this must be specified, or the hostname below along
           with a trust anchor.

       TheirHostname
           The remote server's hostname that is expected.  If their certificate was signed by a CA then their hostname presented in the certificate must match this
           value or the connection fails to be established (to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks).

       TrustCert
           A trusted certificate to use as trust anchor (like a CA certificate) for verifying a remote server's certificate.  If a CA certificate is used to
           validate a certificate then the TheirHostname parameter must also be specified to ensure their presented hostname in the certificate matches.

   SNMPv3/USM Options
       SecName
           The SNMPv3 security name to use (most for SNMPv3 with USM).

           The default is 'initial'.

       SecLevel
           The SNMPv3 security level to use [noAuthNoPriv, authNoPriv, authPriv] (v3)

           The default is 'noAuthNoPriv'.

       SecEngineId
           The SNMPv3 security engineID to use (if the snmpv3 security model needs it; for example USM). The format is as a string without the leading '0x'.  So if
           snmptrapd.conf has "-e 0x8000000001020304", use "SecEngineId => '8000000001020304'".

           The default is <none>, security engineID and it will be probed if not supplied (v3)

       ContextEngineId
           The SNMPv3 context engineID to use.

           The default is the <none> and will be set either to the SecEngineId value if set or discovered or will be discovered in other ways if using TLS (RFC5343
           based discovery).

       Context
           The SNMPv3 context name to use.

           The default is '' (an empty string)

       AuthProto
           The SNMPv3/USM authentication protocol to use [MD5, SHA].

           The default is 'MD5'.

       AuthPass
           The SNMPv3/USM authentication passphrase to use.

           default <none>, authentication passphrase

       PrivProto
           The SNMPv3/USM privacy protocol to use [DES, AES].

           The default is 'DES'.

       PrivPass
           The SNMPv3/USM privacy passphrase to use.

           default <none>, privacy passphrase (v3)

       AuthMasterKey
       PrivMasterKey
       AuthLocalizedKey
       PrivLocalizedKey
           Directly specified SNMPv3 USM user keys (used if you want to specify the keys instead of deriving them from a password as above).

   SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c Options
       Community
           For SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, the clear-text community name to use.

           The default is 'public'.

   Other Configuration Options
       VarFormats
           default 'undef', used by 'fget[next]', holds an hash reference of output value formatters, (e.g., {<obj> => <sub-ref>, ... }, <obj> must match the <obj>
           and format used in the get operation. A special <obj>, '*', may be used to apply all <obj>s, the supplied sub is called to translate the value to a new
           format. The sub is called passing the Varbind as the arg

       TypeFormats
           default 'undef', used by 'fget[next]', holds an hash reference of output value formatters, (e.g., {<type> => <sub-ref>, ... }, the supplied sub is called
           to translate the value to a new format, unless a VarFormat mathces first (e.g., $sess->{TypeFormats}{INTEGER} = \&mapEnum(); although this can be done
           more efficiently by enabling $SNMP::use_enums or session creation param 'UseEnums')

       UseLongNames
           defaults to the value of SNMP::use_long_names at time of session creation. set to non-zero to have <tags> for 'getnext' methods generated preferring
           longer Mib name convention (e.g., system.sysDescr vs just sysDescr)

       UseSprintValue
           defaults to the value of SNMP::use_sprint_value at time of session creation. set to non-zero to have return values for 'get' and 'getnext' methods
           formatted with the libraries snprint_value function. This will result in certain data types being returned in non-canonical format Note: values returned
           with this option set may not be appropriate for 'set' operations (see discussion of value formats in <vars> description section)

       UseEnums
           defaults to the value of SNMP::use_enums at time of session creation. set to non-zero to have integer return values converted to enumeration identifiers
           if possible, these values will also be acceptable when supplied to 'set' operations

       UseNumeric
           defaults to the value of SNMP::use_numeric at time of session creation. set to non-zero to have <tags> for get methods returned as numeric OID's rather
           than descriptions.  UseLongNames will be set so that the full OID is returned to the caller.

       BestGuess
           defaults to the value of SNMP::best_guess at time of session creation. this setting controls how <tags> are parsed.  setting to 0 causes a regular
           lookup.  setting to 1 causes a regular expression match (defined as -Ib in snmpcmd) and setting to 2 causes a random access lookup (defined as -IR in
           snmpcmd).

       NonIncreasing
           defaults to the value of SNMP::non_increasing at time of session creation. this setting controls if a non-increasing OID during bulkwalk will causes an
           error. setting to 0 causes the default behaviour (which may, in very badly performing agents, result in a never-ending loop).  setting to 1 causes an
           error (OID not increasing) when this error occur.

       ErrorStr
           read-only, holds the error message assoc. w/ last request

       ErrorNum
           read-only, holds the snmp_err or staus of last request

       ErrorInd
           read-only, holds the snmp_err_index when appropriate

       Private variables:

       DestAddr
           internal field used to hold the translated DestHost field

       SessPtr
           internal field used to cache a created session structure

       RemotePort
           Obsolete.  Please use the DestHost specifier to indicate the hostname and port combination instead of this paramet.

   SNMP::Session methods
       $sess->update(<fields>)
           Updates the SNMP::Session object with the values fields passed in as a hash list (similar to new(<fields>)) (WARNING! not fully implemented)

       $sess->get(<vars> [,<callback>])
           do SNMP GET, multiple <vars> formats accepted.  for syncronous operation <vars> will be updated with value(s) and type(s) and will also return retrieved
           value(s). If <callback> supplied method will operate asynchronously

       $sess->fget(<vars> [,<callback>])
           do SNMP GET like 'get' and format the values according the handlers specified in $sess->{VarFormats} and $sess->{TypeFormats}

       $sess->getnext(<vars> [,<callback>])
           do SNMP GETNEXT, multiple <vars> formats accepted, returns retrieved value(s), <vars> passed as arguments are updated to indicate next lexicographical
           <obj>,<iid>,<val>, and <type>

           Note: simple string <vars>,(e.g., 'sysDescr.0') form is not updated. If <callback> supplied method will operate asynchronously

       $sess->fgetnext(<vars> [,<callback>])
           do SNMP GETNEXT like getnext and format the values according the handlers specified in $sess->{VarFormats} and $sess->{TypeFormats}

       $sess->set(<vars> [,<callback>])
           do SNMP SET, multiple <vars> formats accepted.  the value field in all <vars> formats must be in a canonical format (i.e., well known format) to ensure
           unambiguous translation to SNMP MIB data value (see discussion of canonical value format <vars> description section), returns snmp_errno. If <callback>
           supplied method will operate asynchronously

       $sess->getbulk(<non-repeaters>, <max-repeaters>, <vars>)
           do an SNMP GETBULK, from the list of Varbinds, the single next lexico instance is fetched for the first n Varbinds as defined by <non-repeaters>. For
           remaining Varbinds, the m lexico instances are retrieved each of the remaining Varbinds, where m is <max-repeaters>.

       $sess->bulkwalk(<non-repeaters>, <max-repeaters>, <vars> [,<callback>])
           Do a "bulkwalk" of the list of Varbinds.  This is done by sending a GETBULK request (see getbulk() above) for the Varbinds.  For each requested variable,
           the response is examined to see if the next lexico instance has left the requested sub-tree.  Any further instances returned for this variable are
           ignored, and the walk for that sub-tree is considered complete.

           If any sub-trees were not completed when the end of the responses is reached, another request is composed, consisting of the remaining variables.  This
           process is repeated until all sub-trees have been completed, or too many packets have been exchanged (to avoid loops).

           The bulkwalk() method returns an array containing an array of Varbinds, one for each requested variable, in the order of the variable requests.  Upon
           error, bulkwalk() returns undef and sets $sess->ErrorStr and $sess->ErrorNum.  If a callback is supplied, bulkwalk() returns the SNMP request id, and
           returns immediately.  The callback will be called with the supplied argument list and the returned variables list.

           Note: Because the client must "discover" that the tree is complete by comparing the returned variables with those that were requested, there is a
           potential "gotcha" when using the max-repeaters value.  Consider the following code to print a list of interfaces and byte counts:

               $numInts = $sess->get('ifNumber.0');
               ($desc, $in, $out) = $sess->bulkwalk(0, $numInts,
                             [['ifDescr'], ['ifInOctets'], ['ifOutOctets']]);

               for $i (0..($numInts - 1)) {
                   printf "Interface %4s: %s inOctets, %s outOctets\n",
                             $$desc[$i]->val, $$in[$i]->val, $$out[$i]->val;
               }

           This code will produce *two* requests to the agent -- the first to get the interface values, and the second to discover that all the information was in
           the first packet.  To get around this, use '$numInts + 1' for the max_repeaters value.  This asks the agent to include one additional (unrelated)
           variable that signals the end of the sub-tree, allowing bulkwalk() to determine that the request is complete.

       $results = $sess->gettable(<TABLE OID>, <OPTIONS>)
           This will retrieve an entire table of data and return a hash reference to that data.  The returned hash reference will have indexes of the OID suffixes
           for the index data as the key.  The value for each entry will be another hash containing the data for a given row.  The keys to that hash will be the
           column names, and the values will be the data.

           Example:

             #!/usr/bin/perl

             use SNMP;
             use Data::Dumper;

             my $s = new SNMP::Session(DestHost => 'localhost');

             print Dumper($s->gettable('ifTable'));

           On my machine produces:

             $VAR1 = {
                       '6' => {
                                'ifMtu' => '1500',
                                'ifPhysAddress' => 'PV',
                                # ...
                                'ifInUnknownProtos' => '0'
                              },
                       '4' => {
                                'ifMtu' => '1480',
                                'ifPhysAddress' => '',
                                # ...
                                'ifInUnknownProtos' => '0'
                              },
                       # ...
                      };

           By default, it will try to do as optimized retrieval as possible.  It'll request multiple columns at once, and use GETBULK if possible.  A few options
           may be specified by passing in an OPTIONS hash containing various parameters:

           noindexes => 1
               Instructs the code not to parse the indexes and place the results in the second hash.  If you don't need the index data, this will be faster.

           columns => [ colname1, ... ]
               This specifies which columns to collect.  By default, it will try to collect all the columns defined in the MIB table.

           repeat => COUNT
               Specifies a GETBULK repeat COUNT.  IE, it will request this many varbinds back per column when using the GETBULK operation.  Shortening this will
               mean smaller packets which may help going through some systems.  By default, this value is calculated and attempts to guess at what will fit all the
               results into 1000 bytes.  This calculation is fairly safe, hopefully, but you can either raise or lower the number using this option if desired.  In
               lossy networks, you want to make sure that the packets don't get fragmented and lowering this value is one way to help that.

           nogetbulk => 1
               Force the use of GETNEXT rather than GETBULK.  (always true for SNMPv1, as it doesn't have GETBULK anyway).  Some agents are great implementers of
               GETBULK and this allows you to force the use of GETNEXT operations instead.

           callback => \&subroutine
           callback => [\&subroutine, optarg1, optarg2, ...]
               If a callback is specified, gettable will return quickly without returning results.  When the results are finally retrieved the callback subroutine
               will be called (see the other sections defining callback behaviour and how to make use of SNMP::MainLoop which is required for this to work).  An
               additional argument of the normal hash result will be added to the callback subroutine arguments.

               Note 1: internally, the gettable function uses it's own callbacks which are passed to getnext/getbulk as appropriate.

               Note 2: callback support is only available in the SNMP module version 5.04 and above.  To test for this in code intending to support both versions
               prior to 5.04 and 5.04 and up, the following should work:

                 if ($response = $sess->gettable('ifTable', callback => \&my_sub)) {
                     # got a response, gettable doesn't support callback
                     my_sub($response);
                     $no_mainloop = 1;
                 }

               Deciding on whether to use SNMP::MainLoop is left as an exercise to the reader since it depends on whether your code uses other callbacks as well.

       $sess->get_sec_engine_id
           Returns the security engine ID for the current session, whether probed or provided by the client, in hex format suitable for the SecEngineId parameter
           when creating a session in the future. Returns undef if we have not had not had any contact with the remote agent yet.

       $sess->get_context_engine_id
           Like get_sec_engine_id, but for the context engine ID (ContextEngineId).

SNMP::TrapSession
       $sess = new SNMP::Session(DestHost => 'host', ...)

       supports all applicable fields from SNMP::Session (see above)

   SNMP::TrapSession methods
       $sess->trap(enterprise, agent, generic, specific, uptime, <vars>)
               $sess->trap(enterprise=>'.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021', # or 'ucdavis' [default]
                           agent => '127.0.0.1', # or 'localhost',[dflt 1st intf on host]
                           generic => specific,  # can be omitted if 'specific' supplied
                           specific => 5,        # can be omitted if 'generic' supplied
                           uptime => 1234,       # dflt to localhost uptime (0 on win32)
                           [[ifIndex, 1, 1],[sysLocation, 0, "here"]]); # optional vars
                                                                        # always last

       trap(oid, uptime, <vars>) - v2 format
               $sess->trap(oid => 'snmpRisingAlarm',
                           uptime => 1234,
                           [[ifIndex, 1, 1],[sysLocation, 0, "here"]]); # optional vars
                                                                        # always last

Acceptable variable formats:
       <vars> may be one of the following forms:

       SNMP::VarList
           represents an array of MIB objects to get or set, implemented as a blessed reference to an array of SNMP::Varbinds, (e.g., [<varbind1>, <varbind2>, ...])

       SNMP::Varbind
           represents a single MIB object to get or set, implemented as a blessed reference to a 4 element array; [<obj>, <iid>, <val>, <type>].

           <obj>
               one of the following forms:

               1)  leaf identifier (e.g., 'sysDescr') assumed to be unique for practical purposes

               2)  fully qualified identifier (e.g., '.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr')

               3)  fully qualified, dotted-decimal, numeric OID (e.g., '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1')

           <iid>
               the dotted-decimal, instance identifier. for scalar MIB objects use '0'

           <val>
               the SNMP data value retrieved from or being set to the agents MIB. for (f)get(next) operations <val> may have a variety of formats as determined by
               session and package settings. However for set operations the <val> format must be canonical to ensure unambiguous translation. The canonical forms
               are as follows:

               OBJECTID
                   dotted-decimal (e.g., .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1)

               OCTETSTR
                   perl scalar containing octets

               INTEGER
                   decimal signed integer (or enum)

               NETADDR
                   dotted-decimal

               IPADDR
                   dotted-decimal

               COUNTER
                   decimal unsigned integer

               COUNTER64
                   decimal unsigned integer

               GAUGE
                   decimal unsigned integer

               UINTEGER
                   decimal unsigned integer

               TICKS
                   decimal unsigned integer

               OPAQUE
                   perl scalar containing octets

               NULL
                   perl scalar containing nothing

           <type>
               SNMP data type (see list above), this field is populated by 'get' and 'getnext' operations. In some cases the programmer needs to populate this field
               when passing to a 'set' operation. this field need not be supplied when the attribute indicated by <tag> is already described by loaded Mib modules.
               for 'set's, if a numeric OID is used and the object is not currently in the loaded Mib, the <type> field must be supplied

       simple string
           light weight form of <var> used to 'set' or 'get' a single attribute without constructing an SNMP::Varbind.  stored in a perl scalar, has the form
           '<tag>.<iid>', (e.g., 'sysDescr.0'). for 'set' operations the value is passed as a second arg. Note: This argument form is not updated in get[next]
           operations as are the other forms.

Acceptable callback formats
       <callback> may be one of the following forms:

       without arguments
           \&subname
           sub { ... }
       or with arguments
           [ \&subname, $arg1, ... ]
           [ sub { ... }, $arg1, ... ]
           [ "method", $obj, $arg1, ... ]

       callback will be called when response is received or timeout occurs. the last argument passed to callback will be a SNMP::VarList reference. In case of
       timeout the last argument will be undef.

       &SNMP::MainLoop([<timeout>, [<callback>]])
           to be used with async SNMP::Session calls. MainLoop must be called after initial async calls so return packets from the agent will be processed.  If no
           args supplied this function enters an infinite loop so program must be exited in a callback or externally interrupted. If <timeout(sic)

       &SNMP::finish()
           This function, when called from an SNMP::MainLoop() callback function, will cause the current SNMP::MainLoop() to return after the callback is completed.
           finish() can be used to terminate an otherwise-infinite MainLoop.  A new MainLoop() instance can then be started to handle further requests.

SNMP package variables and functions
       $SNMP::VERSION
           the current version specifier (e.g., 3.1.0)

       $SNMP::auto_init_mib
           default '1', set to 0 to disable automatic reading of the MIB upon session creation. set to non-zero to call initMib at session creation which will
           result in MIB loading according to Net-SNMP env. variables (see man mib_api)

       $SNMP::verbose
           default '0', controls warning/info output of SNMP module, 0 => no output, 1 => enables warning/info output from SNMP module itself (is also controlled by
           SNMP::debugging - see below)

       $SNMP::use_long_names
           default '0', set to non-zero to enable the use of longer Mib identifiers. see translateObj. will also influence the formatting of <tag> in varbinds
           returned from 'getnext' operations. Can be set on a per session basis (UseLongNames)

       $SNMP::use_sprint_value
           default '0', set to non-zero to enable formatting of response values using the snmp libraries snprint_value function. can also be set on a per session
           basis (see UseSprintValue) Note: returned values may not be suitable for 'set' operations

       $SNMP::use_enums
           default '0',set non-zero to return values as enums and allow sets using enums where appropriate. integer data will still be accepted for set operations.
           can also be set on a per session basis (see UseEnums)

       $SNMP::use_numeric
           default to '0',set to non-zero to have <tags> for 'get' methods returned as numeric OID's rather than descriptions.  UseLongNames will be set so that the
           entire OID will be returned.  Set on a per-session basis (see UseNumeric).

       $SNMP::best_guess
           default '0'.  This setting controls how <tags> are parsed.  Setting to 0 causes a regular lookup.  Setting to 1 causes a regular expression match
           (defined as -Ib in snmpcmd) and setting to 2 causes a random access lookup (defined as -IR in snmpcmd).  Can also be set on a per session basis (see
           BestGuess)

       $SNMP::save_descriptions
           default '0',set non-zero to have mib parser save attribute descriptions. must be set prior to mib initialization

       $SNMP::debugging
           default '0', controls debugging output level within SNMP module and libsnmp

           1.  enables 'SNMP::verbose' (see above)

           2.  level 1 plus snmp_set_do_debugging(1)

           3.  level 2 plus snmp_set_dump_packet(1)

       $SNMP::dump_packet
           default '0', set [non-]zero to independently set snmp_set_dump_packet()

       SNMP::register_debug_tokens()
           Allows to register one or more debug tokens, just like the -D option of snmpd.  Each debug token enables a group of debug statements. An example:
           SNMP::register_debug_tokens("tdomain,netsnmp_unix");

%SNMP::MIB
       a tied hash to access parsed MIB information. After the MIB has been loaded this hash allows access to to the parsed in MIB meta-data(the structure of the
       MIB (i.e., schema)). The hash returns blessed references to SNMP::MIB::NODE objects which represent a single MIB attribute. The nodes can be fetched with
       multiple 'key' formats - the leaf name (e.g.,sysDescr) or fully/partially qualified name (e.g., system.sysDescr) or fully qualified numeric OID. The returned
       node object supports the following fields:

       objectID
           dotted decimal fully qualified OID

       label
           leaf textual identifier (e.g., 'sysDescr')

       subID
           leaf numeric OID component of objectID (e.g., '1')

       moduleID
           textual identifier for module (e.g., 'RFC1213-MIB')

       parent
           parent node

       children
           array reference of children nodes

       nextNode
           next lexico node (BUG!does not return in lexico order)

       type
           returns application type (see getType for values)

       access
           returns ACCESS (ReadOnly, ReadWrite, WriteOnly, NoAccess, Notify, Create)

       status
           returns STATUS (Mandatory, Optional, Obsolete, Deprecated)

       syntax
           returns 'textualConvention' if defined else 'type'

       textualConvention
           returns TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

       TCDescription
           returns the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION's DESCRIPTION field.

       units
           returns UNITS

       hint
           returns HINT

       enums
           returns hash ref {tag => num, ...}

       ranges
           returns array ref of hash ref [{low => num, high => num}, ...]

       description
           returns DESCRIPTION ($SNMP::save_descriptions must be set prior to MIB initialization/parsing)

       reference
           returns the REFERENCE clause

       indexes
           returns the objects in the INDEX clause

       implied
           returns true if the last object in the INDEX is IMPLIED

MIB Functions
       &SNMP::setMib(<file>)
           allows dynamic parsing of the mib and explicit specification of mib file independent of environment variables. called with no args acts like initMib,
           loading MIBs indicated by environment variables (see Net-SNMP mib_api docs). passing non-zero second arg forces previous mib to be freed and replaced
           (Note: second arg not working since freeing previous Mib is more involved than before).

       &SNMP::initMib()
           calls library init_mib function if Mib not already loaded - does nothing if Mib already loaded. will parse directories and load modules according to
           environment variables described in Net-SNMP documentations.  (see man mib_api, MIBDIRS, MIBS, MIBFILE(S), etc.)

       &SNMP::addMibDirs(<dir>,...)
           calls library add_mibdir for each directory supplied. will cause directory(s) to be added to internal list and made available for searching in subsequent
           loadModules calls

       &SNMP::addMibFiles(<file>,...)
           calls library read_mib function. The file(s) supplied will be read and all Mib module definitions contained therein will be added to internal mib tree
           structure

       &SNMP::loadModules(<mod>,...)
           calls library read_module function. The module(s) supplied will be searched for in the current mibdirs and and added to internal mib tree structure.
           Passing special <mod>, 'ALL', will cause all known modules to be loaded.

       &SNMP::unloadModules(<mod>,...)
           *Not Implemented*

       &SNMP::translateObj(<var>[,arg,[arg]])
           will convert a text obj tag to an OID and vice-versa.  Any iid suffix is retained numerically.  Default behaviour when converting a numeric OID to text
           form is to return leaf identifier only (e.g.,'sysDescr') but when $SNMP::use_long_names is non-zero or a non-zero second arg is supplied it will return a
           longer textual identifier.  An optional third argument of non-zero will cause the module name to be prepended to the text name (e.g.
           'SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr').  When converting a text obj, the $SNMP::best_guess option is used.  If no Mib is loaded when called and $SNMP::auto_init_mib is
           enabled then the Mib will be loaded. Will return 'undef' upon failure.

       &SNMP::getType(<var>)
           return SNMP data type for given textual identifier OBJECTID, OCTETSTR, INTEGER, NETADDR, IPADDR, COUNTER GAUGE, TIMETICKS, OPAQUE, or undef

       &SNMP::mapEnum(<var>)
           converts integer value to enumertion tag defined in Mib or converts tag to integer depending on input. the function will return the corresponding integer
           value *or* tag for a given MIB attribute and value. The function will sense which direction to perform the conversion. Various arg formats are supported

           $val = SNMP::mapEnum($varbind);
               where $varbind is SNMP::Varbind or equiv.  note: $varbind will be updated

           $val = SNMP::mapEnum('ipForwarding', 'forwarding');
           $val = SNMP::mapEnum('ipForwarding', 1);

Exported SNMP utility functions
       Note: utility functions do not support async operation yet.

       &snmp_get()
           takes args of SNMP::Session::new followed by those of SNMP::Session::get

       &snmp_getnext()
           takes args of SNMP::Session::new followed by those of SNMP::Session::getnext

       &snmp_set()
           takes args of SNMP::Session::new followed by those of SNMP::Session::set

       &snmp_trap()
           takes args of SNMP::TrapSession::new followed by those of SNMP::TrapSession::trap

Trouble Shooting
       If problems occur there are number areas to look at to narrow down the possibilities.

       The first step should be to test the Net-SNMP installation independently from the Perl5 SNMP interface.

       Try running the apps from the Net-SNMP distribution.

       Make sure your agent (snmpd) is running and properly configured with read-write access for the community you are using.

       Ensure that your MIBs are installed and enviroment variables are set appropriately (see man mib_api)

       Be sure to remove old net-snmp installations and ensure headers and libraries from old CMU installations are not being used by mistake.

       If the problem occurs during compilation/linking check that the snmp library being linked is actually the Net-SNMP library (there have been name conflicts
       with existing snmp libs).

       Also check that the header files are correct and up to date.

       Sometimes compiling the Net-SNMP library with 'position-independent-code' enabled is required (HPUX specifically).

       If you cannot resolve the problem you can post to comp.lang.perl.modules or net-snmp-users@net-snmp-users@lists.sourceforge.net

       please give sufficient information to analyze the problem (OS type, versions for OS/Perl/Net-SNMP/compiler, complete error output, etc.)

       Apologies to any/all who's patch/feature/request was not mentioned or included - most likely it was lost when paying work intruded on my fun. Please try
       again if you do not see a desired feature. This may actually turn out to be a decent package with such excellent help and the fact that I have more time to
       work on it than in the past.
