NAME
       stap-exporter - systemtap-prometheus interoperation mechanism

SYNOPSIS
       stap-exporter [ OPTIONS ]

DESCRIPTION
       stap-exporter  runs a set of systemtap scripts and relays their procfs outputs to remote HTTP clients on demand.  This makes systemtap scripts directly usable as individual prometheus exporters.  This
       is assisted by a set of macros provided in the prometheus.stpm tapset file.

OPTIONS
       The stap-exporter program supports the following options.

       -p --port PORT
              Listen to the specified TCP port for HTTP requests. Port 9900 is used by default.

       -k --keepalive KEEPALIVE
              Scripts that run longer than KEEPALIVE seconds beyond the last request are shut down.  There is no timeout by default, so once started, scripts are kept running.

       -s --scripts SCRIPTS
              Search the directory SCRIPTS for *.stp files to be exposed.  The default is given in the stappaths.7 man page.

       -h --help
              Print help message.

OPERATION
       Upon startup, stap-exporter searches the directory specified by the -s directory for files named *.stp.  The name of each file becomes available as a URL component for subsequent  GET  HTTP  requests.
       For  example,  when  an  HTTP  client  asks for /foo.stp, and the foo.stp script (executable / shell-script) was known, then it is spawned with additional stap options to set a module name.  This pre‐
       dictable module name makes it possible for stap-exporter to transcribe a procfs file from that running script to HTTP clients.

       After a configurable period of disuse (-k or --keepalive option), a systemtap script is terminated.  It will be restarted again if a client requests.

       All files whose name includes the substring autostart are started immediately (and restarted if they stop), rather than on-demand.  These are excluded from keepalive considerations.  Scripts that  may
       be too slow to start or wish to report long-term statistics are candidates for this treatment.

EXAMPLE
       Suppose that example.stp contains the following script.  It counts read syscalls on a per-thread & per-cpu basis.

              global arr%

              probe syscall.read {
                  arr[tid(), cpu()]++
              }

              probe prometheus {
                  @prometheus_dump_array2(arr, "count", "tid", "cpu")
              }

       The  prometheus_dump_array  macros  are used to produce metrics from an array.  Systemtap provides a prometheus_dump_arrayN macro for all N from 1 to 8.  The first argument of the macros represents an
       array with N-element keys.  The second argument represents the name of the metric. The remaining N arguments represent the names of the metric's labels.

       One may launch stap-exporter as root, or equivalent stapdev privileges, then after a brief delay, use any web client to fetch data:

              # stap-exporter -p 9999 -k 60 -c . &

              $ curl http://localhost:9999/example.stp
              Refresh page to access metrics.  [...]

              $ curl http://localhost:9999/example.stp
              count{tid="12614",cpu="0"} 9
              count{tid="12170",cpu="3"} 107
              count{tid="1802",cpu="0"} 33687
              count{tid="12617",cpu="1"} 99
              [...]

       The same URL may be added to a Prometheus server's scrape_config section, or a Performance Co-Pilot pmdaprometheus config.d directory, to collect this data into a monitoring system.

SAFETY AND SECURITY
       The stap-exporter server does not enforce any particular security mechanisms.  Therefore, deployment in an untrusted environment needs to consider:

       script selection
              Since systemtap scripts are run under the privileges of the stap-exporter process (probably root), the system administrator must select only safe & robust scripts.  Check the scripts  installed
              by default before activating the service.  Scripts cannot take input from the web clients.

       TCP/IP firewalling
              Since stap-exporter exposes the selected TCP/HTTP port to all interfaces on the host, it may be necessary to add a firewall.  It is unlikely to be appropriate to expose such a service to an un‐
              trusted network.

       HTTP filtering
              Since stap-exporter exposes the configured systemtap scripts to all HTTP clients without authentication, it may be necessary to protect it from abuse even on mostly trusted networks.   An  HTTP
              proxy may be used to impose URL- or client- or usage- or authentication-dependent filters.

       HTTPS  Since stap-exporter speaks only plain HTTP, an HTTP proxy may be used to support HTTPS secure protocols.
