NAME
       unw_set_caching_policy -- set unwind caching policy

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libunwind.h>

       int unw_set_caching_policy(unw_addr_space_t as, unw_caching_policy_t policy);

DESCRIPTION
       The unw_set_caching_policy() routine sets the caching policy of address space as to the policy specified by argument policy.  The policy argument can take one of three possible values:

       UNW_CACHE_NONE
               Turns off caching completely. This also implicitly flushes the contents of all caches as if unw_flush_cache() had been called.

       UNW_CACHE_GLOBAL
               Enables  caching  using  a  global  cache  that  is  shared  by  all  threads.  If  global caching is unavailable or unsupported, libunwind may fall back on using a per-thread cache, as if
              UNW_CACHE_PER_THREAD had been specified.

       UNW_CACHE_PER_THREAD
               Enables caching using thread-local caches. If a thread-local caching are unavailable or unsupported, libunwind may fall back on using a global cache, as if UNW_CACHE_GLOBAL had been speci‐
              fied.

       If caching is enabled, an application must be prepared to make appropriate calls to unw_flush_cache() whenever the target changes in a way that could affect the  validity  of  cached  information.
       For example, after unloading (removing) a shared library, unw_flush_cache() would have to be called (at least) for the address-range that was covered by the shared library.

       For address spaces created via unw_create_addr_space(3libunwind), caching is turned off by default. For the local address space unw_local_addr_space, caching is turned on by default.

RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, unw_set_caching_policy() returns 0.  Otherwise the negative value of one of the error-codes below is returned.

THREAD AND SIGNAL SAFETY
       unw_set_caching_policy() is thread-safe but not safe to use from a signal handler.

ERRORS
       UNW_ENOMEM
               The desired caching policy could not be established because the application is out of memory.
