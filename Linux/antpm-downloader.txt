DESCRIPTION
       antpm-downloader is a small command-line utility to retrieve information (sports tracks, etc.) from Garmin GPS products over the wireless ANT-FS protocols. Currently supported devices are the Forerun‐
       ner 310XT. It is expected that the Forerunner 60, Forerunner 610, Forerunner 910XT, FR70 and Swim models work, but user feedback is required.

LINUX USER'S GUIDE
       Make sure you're using the latest released version of ANT+minus.

       Make sure that the cp210x kernel module is loaded: "sudo modprobe cp210x". Verify by looking at non-empty output of "lsmod | grep cp210x".

       Make sure that the USB2ANT stick is connected to the machine.

       Make sure cp210x driver was assigned to your USB2ANT. Verify by "dmesg | grep tty" and look for a line similar to: "[ 3274.854726] usb 6-2: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0".  Also  make  sure
       "ls /dev/ttyUSB*" lists your device node.

       Your  user  must be able to access the /dev/ttyUSB0 device. This can be achieved e.g. by the installing the http://antpm.googlecode.com/git/scripts/80-ant-stick.rules udev rule into /etc/udev/rules.d.
       Restart udev. Verify by "cat /dev/ttyUSB0".

       Install the antpm binary package.

       Enable "pairing mode" on your watch.

       Bring your watch to ~50cm from the USB2ANT stick. Sometimes avoiding the proximity of a WiFi network helps.

       Run antpm-downloader on your machine. This will attempt connecting to the watch and pair with it first.

       During pairing, you have to click "Yes" on the watch to complete pairing.

       Afterwards all activity information from the watch is downloaded to your machine. This can take some time.

       The downloaded files are stored on your machine to the folder ConfigFolder/*device-id*/*current-date-time* (where ConfigFolder equals $XDG_CONFIG_HOME which usually points to  $HOME/.config/antpm/  or
       $ANTPM_DIR/ if that is set).

       The 310XT stores all information in .fit files. These files can describe waypoints/tracks/activities.

       To   convert  the  downloaded  .fit  files  to  a  more  commonly  used  .gpx  format,  issue  the  command  "antpm-fit2gpx  -F  ConfigFolder/*device-id*/*current-date-time*"  e.g.  "antpm-fit2gpx  -F
       ~/.config/antpm/4531082473/2013_03_26_10_58_19". This will populate the given folder with .gpx files.

HOW TO SUBMIT A BUG-REPORT
       Please open a bug report at http://code.google.com/p/antpm

       In your report please include:

              The log of the program in question (usually saved under ~/.config/antpm)?

              What steps will reproduce the problem?

              What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

              What version of ANT+minus are you using? On what operating system? Is it pre-built of from sources?

              What GPS are you trying to use? What firmware version?

WINDOWS USER'S GUIDE
       Make sure that the USB2ANT stick is connected to the machine.

       Install the libusb driver by running "3rd_party/libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0/driver_installer/inf-wizard.exe"

DEVICES
       Wireless ANT communications happens over a USB2ANT dongle. Under Linux the dongle is driven by cp210x kernel module, and presented to user-space as a USB serial port, /dev/ttyUSBxxx where  xxx  is  an
       integer. The dongle is typically carrying the USB vendor id/product id pair of 0fcf/1004 or 0fcf/1008. Recent Linux systems employ udev to handle device nodes and permissions, thus appropriate

FILES
       /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.ko
              Kernel driver module for USB2ANT dongle.

       /dev/ttyUSBxxx
              Serial device created for dongle.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/antpm ($HOME/.config/antpm)
              Default config folder (downloaded content is also stored here).

       ANTPM_DIR
              The ANTPM_DIR environment variable is honored to override the default config folder.
