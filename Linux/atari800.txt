              If this option is not given, the user will be asked to choose the cartridge type when the emulator starts.

       -cart2 filename
              Insert piggyback cartridge (CART or raw format).  This works only if the first cartridge is a pass-through (currently only SpartaDOS X 64KB and 128KB types).

       -cart2-type 0 .. 160
              Select type of the cartridge inserted with the -cart2 option.  When inserting a raw ROM image its type cannot be detected automatically, and must be provided with this option.   The  avail‐
              able values are the same as for the -cart-type option above.

       -cart-autoreboot
              Automatically  reboot after cartridge inserting/removing (this is the default setting).  This does not apply to the piggyback cartridge - inserting or removing it never causes automatic re‐
              boot.

       -no-cart-autoreboot
              Disable automatic reboot after cartridge inserting/removing.

       -run filename
              Run Atari program (EXE, COM, XEX, BAS, LST)

       -state filename
              Load saved-state file

       -tape filename
              Attach cassette image (CAS format or raw file)

       -boottape filename
              Attach cassette image and boot it

       -tape-readonly
              Set the attached cassette image as read-only.

       -1400  Emulate the Atari 1400XL

       -xld   Emulate the Atari 1450XLD

       -bb    Emulate the CSS Black Box

       -mio   Emulate the ICD MIO board

       -nopatch
              Normally the OS is patched giving very fast I/O.  This options prevents the patch from being applied so that the OS accesses the serial port hardware directly.  This  option  will  probably
              never be needed since programs that access the serial hardware should work even if the OS has been patched.

       -nopatchall
              Don't patch OS at all, H:, P: and R: devices won't work

       -H1 path
              Set path for H1: device

       -H2 path
              Set path for H2: device

       -H3 path
              Set path for H3: device

       -H4 path
              Set path for H4: device

       -Hpath path
              Set path for Atari executables on the H: device

       -hreadonly
              Enable read-only mode for H: device

       -hreadwrite
              Disable read-only mode for H: device

       -devbug
              Put debugging messages for H: and P: devices in log file

       -rtime Enable R-Time 8 emulation

       -nortime
              Disable R-Time 8 emulation

       -rdevice [dev]
              Enable R: device.  If dev is specified then it's used as host serial device name (e.g.  /dev/ttyS0 on linux).  If there is no dev specified then R: is directed to network.

              Don't exit the emulator after playback finishes.

       -refresh
              Controls  screen  refresh rate.  A numerical value follows this option which specifies how many emulated screen updates are required before the actual screen is updated.  This value effects
              the speed of the emulation: A higher value results in faster CPU emulation but a less frequently updated screen.

       -ntsc-artif mode, -pal-artif mode
              Set emulation mode of video artifacts in NTSC or PAL, respectively. The available values for mode are:

                     Simple emulation of NTSC composite video artifacts. Fast but inaccurate.
              ntsc-new
                     Improved emulation of NTSC artifacts. May look better than ntsc-old.
              ntsc-full
                     Full emulation of NTSC artifacts. Rather slow and available only in 16- and 32-bit video modes.
              pal-simple
                     Simple emulation of PAL chroma blending, without composite artifacts. Fast but inaccurate.

              Set tint only for NTSC or PAL, respectively

       -ntsc-colordelay n
              Set GTIA color delay for NTSC system.  This emulates adjusting the potentiometer existing at the bottom of Atari computers, which adjusts hues of colors produced by the computer.

       -pal-colordelay n
              Set GTIA color delay for PAL system.

       -paletten filename, -palettep filename

       -paletten-adjust, -palettep-adjust
              Apply colour adjustments (brightness, contrast etc.) to the loaded NTSC/PAL palette (by default the loaded palette is displayed unmodified).

       -screenshots pattern
              Set filename pattern for screenshots.  Use to override the default pattern of atari###.png which produces atari000.png, atari001.png etc. filenames.  Hashes are replaced with  raising  num‐
              bers.  Existing files are overwritten only if all the files defined by the pattern exist.

       -showspeed
              Show percentage of actual speed

       -sound Enable sound

       -nosound
              Disable sound

       -dsprate freq
              Set sound output frequency in Hz.  The default is 44100 Hz.

       -stereo
              Enable stereo sound

       -nostereo
              Disable stereo sound

       -audio16
              Set sound output format to 16-bit

       -audio8
              Set sound output format to 8-bit

       -aname pattern
              Set  filename  pattern for audio recordings.  Use to override the default pattern of atari###.wav which produces atari000.wav, atari001.wav etc. filenames.  Hashes are replaced with raising
              numbers.

              Note that WAV format files can support all audio codecs, including MP3, but many programs assume WAV files contain only PCM audio.

              If MP3 support was enabled when compiling the emulator, and MP3 audio is selected using the -acodec mp3 option below, the default pattern will be atari###.mp3 to save in MP3 format files.

       -acodec auto|pcm|mp3|mulaw|pcm_mulaw|adpcm|adpcm_ima_wav|adpcm_yahama|adpcm_ms
              Select the audio codec used when saving to AVI or WAV files. Some codecs are lossy, meaning they reduce storage space while attempting to sound as close as possible to the original audio.

              auto   The default.  Use the codec that provides the best audio quality, which is PCM.
              pcm    Use uncompressed pulse-code modulated (PCM) samples. Lossless. Produces very large audio files.
              mp3    Use MP3 encoding. Lossy; only available with 16-bit audio, and provides the best possible quality of all the lossy codecs while also using the least storage  space.   This  codec  is
                     only available if MP3 support is enabled when compiling the emulator.
              mulaw  Use mu-law encoding. Lossy; only available with 16-bit audio, and provides 2x reduction in size from PCM samples. Comparible acoustic quality to a 192kbps MP3 file.
              pcm_mulaw
                     Sames as mulaw, included to match ffmpeg codec name.
              adpcm  Use  the  best adaptive dynamic pulse-code modulated (ADPCM) codec. Lossy; all ADCPM codecs provide 4x reduction in size over PCM samples. Comparible acoustic quality to a 64kbps MP3
                     file.
              adpcm_ima_wav
                     Use the DVI IMA ADPCM algorithm. This seems to perform better on POKEY waveforms than other ADPCM algorithms and will be used when adpcm is selected.
              adpcm_yamaha
                     Use the Yamaha ADPCM algorithm.
              adpcm_ms
                     Use the Microsoft ADPCM algorithm.

       -ab kbps
              Set the bitrate in kbps of the MP3 codec. The default is 128, and can range between 8 and 320. Higher numbers mean better quality at the cost of increased file size.

       -ar freq
              Set the output sample rate in Hz of the MP3 codec. The default is the same sample rate as set by the -dsprate option. Only a limited set of choices are available: 8000, 11025, 12000, 16000,
              22050, 24000, 32000, 44100 and 48000.  As with bitrate, higher numbers mean better quality and larger files.

       -aq num
              Set the MP3 audio compression algorithm quality 0-9 (default 4). 0 means reduced quality but fast, 9 uses the slowest algorithms to try to increase quality.  Does not affect storage space.

       -snd-buflen ms
              Set length of the hardware sound buffer in milliseconds.  Setting to 0 (the default) causes the length to be set automatically.  Higher values increase  sound  latency.   Automatic  setting
              should be OK in most cases.

       -snddelay ms
              Set sound latency in milliseconds.  Increase it if you experience gaps of silence during sound playback.

       -vname pattern
              Set  filename  pattern for video recordings.  Use to override the default pattern of atari###.avi which produces atari000.avi, atari001.avi etc. filenames.  Hashes are replaced with raising
              numbers.

       -vcodec auto|rle|msrle|png|zmbv|uzmbv
              Select the video codec used to store image frames in AVI video recordings.  All video codecs use lossless compression.

              auto   The default.  Use the codec that provides the best average compression ratio which is zmbv if available, otherwise rle.
              rle    Use run-length encoding (RLE) for very good compression of video frames. This codec is always available.
              msrle  Sames as rle, included to match ffmpeg codec name.
              png    Use PNG image compression for moderate compression of video frames. This codec is only available if PNG support was compiled into the emulator.
              zmbv   Use Zip Motion Blocks Video (ZMBV) for the best compression of video frames.  This codec is only available if support for the zlib compression library was compiled into the emulator.
              uzmbv  Uncompressed Zip Motion Blocks Video is only available when compiled without the zlib compression library.

       -showstats
              Show elapsed recording time and file size on screen during recording of video or audio.

       -no-showstats
              Don't show multimedia statistics during recording of video or audio

       -keyint num
              Set the keyframe interval to one keyframe every num frames (default is 50 for PAL, 60 for NTSC). The RLE and ZMBV codecs use keyframes and inter-frames, which encode full frames and differ‐
              ences between frames, respectively. Inter-frames are typically much smaller than full frames, but most video players can only seek to keyframes.

       -compression-level num
              Set compression level 0-9 (default 6) PNG or zlib compression used in the emulator. Zero means no compression and larger numbers correspond to higher compression and smaller image sizes, at
              the cost of increased time to generate the compressed image. This affects both screenshots and the video codec.

   Curses Options
       -left  Use columns 0 to 39

       -central
              Use columns 20 to 59

       -right Use columns 40 to 79

       -wide1 Use columns 0 to 79.  In this mode only the even character positions are used.  The odd locations are filled with spaces.

       -wide2 Use columns 0 to 79.  This mode is similar to -wide1 except that the spaces are in reverse video if the previous character was also in reverse video.

   Falcon Options
       -interlace x
              Generate Falcon screen only every x frame

       -videl Direct VIDEL programming (Falcon/VGA only)

              Double the screen size on NOVA

       -delta Delta screen output (differences only)

       -joyswap
              Swap joysticks

   Java NestedVM Options
       -scale n
              Scale width and height by n

   SDL Options
       -fullscreen
              Start in fullscreen mode.  The default resolution is 336x240 and can be later changed.

       -windowed
              Start in a window (the default).

       -rotate90
              Rotate display (useful for devices with 240x320 screen).

       -no-rotate90
              Don't rotate display (the default).

       -fs-width number-of-pixels
              Host horizontal resolution for fullscreen.

       -fs-height number-of-pixels
              Host vertical resolution for fullscreen.

       -win-width number-of-pixels
              Set horizontal size of the window.  The window can be later resized manually.

       -win-height number-of-pixels
              Set vertical size of the window.  The window can be later resized nanually.

       -bpp number-of-bits
              Sets image color depth when OpenGL acceleration is disabled.  Accepted values are: 0 (use desktop depth; this is the default), 8, 16 and 32.  Depending on the type of graphics hardware, the
              fullscreen setting and current desktop bit depth, either of the values might give the best performance.  Note that with bit depth set to 16 emulation of colors is slightly less accurate.

       -vsync Synchronize the display with the monitor's vertical retrace, to remove image tearing artifacts.  This improves display quality, but may be not available depending on the current wideo  mode
              (fullscreen/windowed),  the  chosen SDL_VIDEODRIVER and type of graphics hardware.  Synchronization is available for some SDL videodrivers (directx, dga) but not for others.  In OpenGL this
              option has no effect - vertical synchronization must be instead enabled in the video hardware driver's settings, if available.

       -no-vsync
              Disable synchronization with monitor's vertical retrace (the default).

       -horiz-area narrow|tv|full|number
              Set amount of visible screen horizontally:

              narrow Shows 320 pixels.
              tv     The default.  Shows area visible on a standard TV (336 pixels).
              full   Shows full overscan area (384 pixels).
              number An exact horizontal size can be set by providing a number between 160 and 384.

       -vertical-area short|tv|full|number
              Set amount of visible screen vertically:

              short  Shows 200 pixels.
              tv     The default.  Shows area visible on a typical TV (224 or 240 pixels, depending on current TV system).
              full   Shows full overscan area, which can be up to 300 pixels in case of the XEP80.
              number An exact number of visible scanlines can be set by providing a number between 100 and 300.

              Note that when displaying output of an XEP80 or Austin Franklin 80 column card, the tv setting will crop the top and bottom parts of text area, just like a real TV does - in such case  set‐
              ting the option to full would be more appriopriate.

       -horiz-shift number
              When  the  visible  horizontal  area is not set to full, this option specifies the screen's area that will be visible.  Values higher than 0 will cause showing more of the right side of the
              screen, while values lower than 0 will cause showing more of the left side.  The default is 0 (no shift).  -vert-shift number Analogically to -horiz-shift: when the visible vertical area is
              not set to full, this option specifies the screen's area that will be visible.  Values higher than 0 will cause showing more of the bottom part of the screen, while values lower than 0 will
              cause showing more of the top part.  The default is 0 (no shift).

       -stretch none|integral|full|number
              Choose method of stretching the image to fit the screen/window area:

              none   The image won't be stretched at all.
              integral
                     The default.  The image will fit the screen/window but will be stretched only by an integral multiplier.  This setting allows for nice output when using scanlines in low screen reso‐
                     lutions.
              full   The screen will fit the entire screen/window area.  This setting looks best in high screen resolutions.
              number A custom multiplier (floating point number) can be also provided to precisely set the amount of stretching.

       -fit-screen width|heightWhen -stretch is set to integral or full, this parameter
              controls how the stretching is performed with relation to window/screen size:

              width  Fits the image's width while allowing it to be cropped vertically.
              height Fits the image's height while allowing it to be cropped horizontally.
              both   The default.  Fit both the image's width and height, avoiding cropping.

       -image-aspect none|square-pixels|real
              Choose how the image's aspect ratio should be maintained when stretching:

              none   Causes the image to be stretched without restriction to fit the screen/window area fully.
              square-pixels
                     The default.  Causes the image to be stretched by the same amount horizontally and vertically, maintaining square pixels.  In low screen resolutions  this  setting  may  produce  the
                     nicest result.
              real   Recreates the aspect ratio of a real TV display (pixels are not square), but only if the -host-aspect-ratio option is set correctly.

       -host-aspect-ratio auto|x:y
              Set  the  aspect ratio of the host monitor on which the emulator's display is placed.  Allowed values are auto for autodetection, or ratios like 4:3, 16:9, 1.25:1 ...  This value is used to
              properly maintain image's aspect ratio when having -image-aspect set to real.  The default value is auto.  Note that host aspect ratio detection works as expected only if the desktop  reso‐
              lution matches aspect ratio of the display device (in other words, display pixels are square).  If, for example, desktop resolution is 800x600 on a 16:9 monitor, autodetection will fail and
              host aspect ratio will have to be set manually, by measuring physical width and height of the monitor and setting the parameter to width:height.

       -80column
              Shows output of an 80 column hardware, when it is available (the default).  This parameter has effect only if an 80 column hardware is activated, using one of the parameters -af80, -proto80
              or -af80.

       -no-80column
              Deactivates showing output of an 80 column hardware.

       -nojoystick
              Do not initialize SDL joysticks

       -joy0hat
              Use hat of joystick 0 rather than the axis for joystick movement.

       -joy1hat
              Use hat of joystick 1 rather than the axis for joystick movement.

       -joy2hat
              Use hat of joystick 2 rather than the axis for joystick movement.

       -joy3hat
              Use hat of joystick 3 rather than the axis for joystick movement.

       -joy0 path-to-device
              Define path to device used in LPTjoy 0. Available on linux-ia32 only.

       -joy1 path-to-device
              Define path to device used in LPTjoy 1. Available on linux-ia32 only.

       -ntsc-filter-preset composite|svideo|rgb|monochrome
              Use one of predefined NTSC filter adjustments.

       -ntsc-sharpness n
              Set sharpness of the NTSC filter.

       -ntsc-resolution n
              Set resolution of the NTSC filter.

       -ntsc-artifacts n
              Set artifacts of the NTSC filter.

       -ntsc-fringing n
              Set fringing of the NTSC filter.

       -ntsc-bleed n
              Set bleed of the NTSC filter.

       -ntsc-burstphase n
              Set burst phase of the NTSC filter.  This changes colors of artifacts.  The best values are 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5.

       -scanlines n
              Set  visibility  of scanlines (0..100).  Scanlines are only visible when the screen's or window's vertical size is at least 480 (more precisely, at least twice the number of scanlines given
              in -vert-area).

       -scanlinesint
              Enable scanlines interpolation (looks nicer).

       -no-scanlinesint
              Disable scanlines interpolation (in software modes may give better performance).

       -video-accel
              Use OpenGL hardware acceleration for displaying and stretching of the emulator's display.  Using OpenGL improves performance.

       -no-video-accel
              Don't use OpenGL hardware acceleration (the default).

       -pixel-format bgr16|rgb16|bgra32|argb32
              Choose format of texture data when OpenGL acceleration is enabled.  Depending on the type of the graphics hardware, either of the values might give the best  performance.   Note  that  with
              pixel format set to bgr16 or rgb16, emulation of colors is slightly less accurate.

       -pbo   Use Pixel Buffer Objects when OpenGL acceleration is enabled (the default).  PBOs are available on newer graphics hardware and when used, substantially improve emulator's performance.  How‐
              ever in rare cases (some Intel on-board chips) using PBOs may actually descrease perfromance.

       -no-pbo
              Don't use Pixel Buffer Objects when OpenGL acceleration is used.

       -bilinear-filter
              Enable bilinear filtering of the screen in OpenGL modes.

       -no-bilinear-filter
              Disable bilinear filtering in OpenGL modes (the default).

       -opengl-lib path
              Provide a custom OpenGL shared library.  If not given, Atari800 will use a default system-specific library (typically opengl32.dll or libGL.so).

       -proto80
              Emulate a prototype 80 column board for the 1090

       -xep80 Emulate the XEP80

       -xep80port n
              Use XEP80 on joystick port n

       -af80  Emulate the Austin Franklin 80 column daughterboard for Atari 800.

       -volume 0..100
              Sets global volume of Atari 800.

   X11 Options
       -small Run the emulator in a small window where each Atari 800 pixel is represented by one X Window pixel

       -large Runs the emulator in a large window where each Atari 800 pixel is represented by a 2x2 X Window rectangle. This mode is selected by default.

       -huge  Runs the emulator in a huge window where each Atari 800 pixel is represented by a 3x3 X Window rectangle.

       -clip_x number-of-pixels
              Set left offset for clipping

       -clip_width number-of-pixels
              Set the width of the clipping-area

       -clip_y number-of-pixels
              Set top offset for clipping

       -clip_height number-of-pixels
              Set the height of the clipping-area

AUDIO RECORDING
       Audio can be recorded to WAV format sound files or as the audio track of AVI format multimedia files (described in the next section). A choice of audio codecs is available, some using  lossy  com‐
       pression to reduce file size as compared to uncompressed audio. All lossy codecs require 16 bit sample sizes using the -audio16 option.

       The term "lossy" means the recorded sound is not bit-for-bit identical to the output of the emulator. Each codec provides a different method to reduce size, possibly reducing the audio quality. In
       practice,  the  audio produced by these codecs is not perceptibly worse than lossless encoding when using sample rates of 44.1kHz or 48kHz. However, the possibility exists that recompressing lossy
       audio (for instance by uploading to YouTube) could reduce quality.

       The only lossless codec provided is the pulse-code modulation (PCM) codec, which simply stores the raw data generated by the POKEY emulation. This takes the most space of any codec,  but  provides
       the best possible audio quality. The sample size is specified by the -audio16 or -audio8 options. This is the recommended codec unless extremely long recording times are desired. See the tables in
       the VIDEO RECORDING section below.

       The  MP3  codec is the best choice of a lossy codec, as paramaters can be tuned to generate high quality audio for different situations. An audio bitrate of 128kbps (the -ab 128 option) results in
       high quality audio at about an 8x reduction in storage space over PCM audio. The MP3 codec is a compile-time option, and will be included automatically if the libmp3lame library  is  found  during
       compilation.

       The remaining lossy codecs should not be considered unless the MP3 codec is not available. In most cases they produce reasonable quality, without many audible artifacts to the casual listener. But
       the algorithms were originally designed for compressing speech over telephone lines and they can produce audio distortion in some instances.

       The  mu-law codec uses a logarithmic scale to convert 16 bit samples into 8 bits of data, resulting in half the size of 16 bit PCM audio. This codec does not work with 8 bit audio. Waveform analy‐
       sis shows the acoustic quality is similar to a 192kbps MP3 file, although the MP3 is half the size. Surprisingly, in many cases the acoustic quality of mu-law can be better than 8 bit PCM  samples
       even though it takes the same storage space.

       Adaptive  differential  pulse-code modulation (ADPCM) encodes differences between successive 16 bit audio samples into 4 bits, therefore the output is one quarter of the size of the PCM codec. The
       acoustic quality is similar to a 64kbps MP3 file, although the MP3 is 3x smaller. Audio distortio may be audible under certain conditions, like high volume square waves.

VIDEO RECORDING
       atari800 is capable of recording the emulated video and audio to AVI format multimedia files. A choice of lossless video codecs is available, while audio is stored with  any  of  the  lossless  or
       lossy codecs as described above. To record without sound, specify the -nosound option.

       The most efficient video codec is the Zip Motion Block Video (ZMBV) codec.  This codec uses keyframes and inter-frames, and achieves its high compression because inter-frames use motion estimation
       when calculating differences to the previous frame. It is a compile-time option when building the emulator, and is the default if available. There is an uncompressed variant that is available when
       compiled without zlib; see the note below.

       The  Run-Length  Encoding  (RLE) video codec also uses keyframes and inter-frames.  Its inter-frame compression is not as efficient as ZMBV, but still produces high compression in cases where only
       small parts of the screen change between frames.  This codec is always available and is the default if compressed ZMBV is not available.

       The PNG video codec has moderate compression because it uses only keyframes.  It is useful in certain cases if the ZMBV codec is not available. It is a compile-time option when building the emula‐
       tor.

       Uncompressed ZMBV is typically inferior to RLE and PNG and is not recommended in general. There are a few limited instances (like detailed scrolling backgrounds) where uncompressed ZMBV will  out‐
       perform  RLE  or PNG, and for that reason it is made available as the uzmbv codec when compiled without zlib. For testing purposes when compiled with zlib, uncompressed ZMBV video can be generated
       with the -compression-level 0 command line argument.

               [1] Twitter only accepts mp4 files using the h264 video
                   codec and the aac audio codec. The avi files produced
                   by atari800 must be transcoded with an application like
                   FFmpeg or Handbrake. Videos are limited to 2 minutes and
                   20 seconds.

               [2] VLC recognizes and plays PNG-encoded video, but decodes the
                   video incorrectly resulting in garbled images.

       Currently there is a limit of 4GB for video size. The maximum recording time for this size limit depends on many factors. Some examples can be seen in the tables below:
