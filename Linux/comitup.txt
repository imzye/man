NAME
       comitup.conf - Comitup configuration file format

   DESCRIPTION
       The comitup.conf file configures the wifi management service comitup(8).  It is located in the /etc/ directory.

   PARAMETERS
       • ap_name:  By default, comitup will create a hotspot named comitup-<nnn>, publish an avahi-daemon(8) host entry for comitup-<nnn>, and establish an mdns identity for comitup-<nnn>.local.  Setting
         this parameter will change the comitup string with one of the users choosing.  If the configuration variable contains an <nnn> string, with between one and four “n’s”, it will be replaced with a
         persistent, random number.  Similarly, the string <hostname> is replaced with the computer’s hostname.

         For the Avahi Service Discovery publication to work correctly, the name should be ASCII, with no special characters or white space.

       • ap_password: If this parameter is defined in the configuration file, then the comitup hotspot will require that any connection to the hotspot be authenticated, using this password.

       • web_service: This defines a user web service to be controlled by comitup.  This service will be disabled in the HOTSPOT state in preference of the comitup web service, and will be enabled in the
         CONNECTED state.  This should be the name of the systemd web service, such as apache2.service or nginx.service.  This defaults to a null string, meaning no service is controlled.

       • service_name: This defines the mdns service name advertised by comitup.  This defaults to “comitup”, and will be advertised as “_comitup._tcp”.

       • enable_appliance_mode: By default, comitup will use multiple wifi interfaces, if available, to connect to the local hotspot and to the internet simultaneously.  Setting this to  something  other
         than “true” will limit comitup to the first wifi interface.

       • external_callback:

         The  path  to  an  external script that is called on comitup state changes.  It will include a single argument, either `HOTSPOT', `CONNECTING', or `CONNECTED'.  The script will run as the owning
         user and group.

       • primary_wifi_device;

         Override the default choice for the primary WiFi device to use.

       • verbose:

         Set to `1' (or `yes' or `true') to enable more verbose logging.

       • enable_nuke:

         Set to `1' (or `yes' or `true') to enable a hardware-based factory reset function.  This will cause all WiFi connection settings to be deleted.  On a Raspberry Pi, short out pins 39  and  40  on
         the GPIO header for three seconds to invoke.  The green LED will flash three times to indicate success.

         This capability is also availble via comitup-cli and the D-BUS interface.

       • ipv6_link_local;

         Set  to  `1'  to  force  Comitup to create only “link-local” IPv6 addresses for the upstream WiFi connection, affording a higher level of protection for that link.  “link-local” addresses cannot
         route to the Internet.  Delete existing connections after changing the value of this parameter.
