NAME
       seqstat - show statistics and format for a sequence file

SYNOPSIS
       seqstat [options] seqfile

DESCRIPTION
       seqstat reads a sequence file seqfile and shows a number of simple statistics about it.

       The  printed  statistics include the name of the format, the residue type of the first sequence (protein, RNA, or DNA), the number of sequences, the total number of residues, and the average and range
       of the sequence lengths.

OPTIONS
       -a     Show additional verbose information: a table with one line per sequence showing name, length, and description line.  These lines are prefixed with a * character to enable easily  grep'ing  them
              out and sorting them.

       -h     Print brief help; includes version number and summary of all options, including expert options.

       -B     (Babelfish).  Autodetect  and read a sequence file format other than the default (FASTA). Almost any common sequence file format is recognized (including Genbank, EMBL, SWISS-PROT, PIR, and GCG
              unaligned sequence formats, and Stockholm, GCG MSF, and Clustal alignment formats). See the printed documentation for a complete list of supported formats.

EXPERT OPTIONS
       --informat <s>
              Specify that the sequence file is in format <s>, rather than the default FASTA format.  Common examples include Genbank, EMBL, GCG, PIR, Stockholm, Clustal, MSF, or PHYLIP; see the printed doc‐
              umentation for a complete list of accepted format names.  This option overrides the default expected format (FASTA) and the -B Babelfish autodetection option.

       --quiet
              Suppress the verbose header (program name, release number and date, the parameters and options in effect).
