NAME
       Catalyst::Helper - Bootstrap a Catalyst application

SYNOPSIS
         catalyst.pl <myappname>

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used by catalyst.pl to create a set of scripts for a new catalyst application. The scripts each contain documentation and will output help on how to use them if called incorrectly
       or in some cases, with no arguments.

       It also provides some useful methods for a Helper module to call when creating a component. See "METHODS".

SCRIPTS
   _create.pl
       Used to create new components for a catalyst application at the development stage.

   _server.pl
       The catalyst test server, starts an HTTPD which outputs debugging to the terminal.

   _test.pl
       A script for running tests from the command-line.

   _cgi.pl
       Run your application as a CGI.

   _fastcgi.pl
       Run the application as a fastcgi app. Either by hand, or call this from FastCgiServer in your http server config.

HELPERS
       The "_create.pl" script creates application components using Helper modules. The Catalyst team provides a good number of Helper modules for you to use. You can also add your own.

       Helpers are classes that provide two methods.

           * mk_compclass - creates the Component class
           * mk_comptest  - creates the Component test

       So when you call "scripts/myapp_create.pl view MyView TT", create will try to execute Catalyst::Helper::View::TT->mk_compclass and Catalyst::Helper::View::TT->mk_comptest.

       See Catalyst::Helper::View::TT and Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema for examples.

       All helper classes should be under one of the following namespaces.

           Catalyst::Helper::Model::
           Catalyst::Helper::View::
           Catalyst::Helper::Controller::

   COMMON HELPERS
       •   Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema - DBIx::Class models

       •   Catalyst::Helper::View::TT - Template Toolkit view

       •   Catalyst::Helper::Model::LDAP

       •   Catalyst::Helper::Model::Adaptor - wrap any class into a Catalyst model

       NOTE

       The helpers will read author name from /etc/passwd by default.  To override, please export the AUTHOR variable.

METHODS
   mk_compclass
       This  method  in  your  Helper  module  is called with $helper which is a Catalyst::Helper object, and whichever other arguments the user added to the command-line. You can use the $helper to call
       methods described below.

       If the Helper module does not contain a "mk_compclass" method, it will fall back to calling "render_file", with an argument of "compclass".

   mk_comptest
       This method in your Helper module is called with $helper which is a Catalyst::Helper object, and whichever other arguments the user added to the command-line. You  can  use  the  $helper  to  call
       methods described below.

       If the Helper module does not contain a "mk_compclass" method, it will fall back to calling "render_file", with an argument of "comptest".

   mk_stuff
       This  method  is called if the user does not supply any of the usual component types "view", "controller", "model". It is passed the $helper object (an instance of Catalyst::Helper), and any other
       arguments the user typed.

       There is no fallback for this method.

INTERNAL METHODS
       These are the methods that the Helper classes can call on the <$helper> object passed to them.

   render_file ($file, $path, $vars, $perms)
       Render and create a file from a template in DATA using Template Toolkit. $file is the relevant chunk of the __DATA__ section, $path is the path to the file, $vars is the  hashref  as  expected  by
       Template Toolkit and $perms are desired permissions (or system defaults if not set).

   get_file ($class, $file)
       Fetch  file  contents  from  the  DATA  section.  This is used internally by "render_file".  $class is the name of the class to get the DATA section from.  __PACKAGE__ or ( caller(0) )[0] might be
       sensible values for this.

   mk_app
       Create the main application skeleton. This is called by catalyst.pl.

   mk_component ($app)
       This method is called by create.pl to make new components for your application.

   mk_dir ($path)
       Surprisingly, this function makes a directory.

   mk_file ($file, $content)
       Writes content to a file. Called by "render_file".

   next_test ($test_name)
       Calculates the name of the next numbered test file and returns it.  Don't give the number or the .t suffix for the test name.

   get_sharedir_file
       Method for getting a file out of share/

   render_file_contents
       Process a Template::Toolkit template.

   render_sharedir_file
       Render a template/image file from our share directory

NOTE
       The helpers will read author name from /etc/passwd by default.  To override, please export the AUTHOR variable.
