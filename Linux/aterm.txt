NAME
       aterm (Afterstep XVT) - a VT102 emulator for the X window system

SYNOPSIS
       aterm [options] [-e command [ args ]]

DESCRIPTION
       aterm,  version  1.0.0,  is  a colour vt102 terminal emulator, based on
       rxvt 2.4.8 with Alfredo Kojima´s additions of  fast  transparency,  in‐
       tended as an xterm(1) replacement for users who do not require features
       such as Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability.  As
       a result, aterm uses much less swap space -- a significant advantage on
       a machine serving many X sessions.

       It was created with AfterStep Window Manger users in mind, but  is  not
       tied to any libraries, and can be used anywhere.

OPTIONS
       The  aterm  options  (mostly a subset of xterm´s) are listed below.  In
       keeping with the smaller-is-better philosophy, options  may  be  elimi‐
       nated or default values chosen at compile-time, so options and defaults
       listed may not accurately reflect the version installed on your system.

       Note that aterm permits the resource name to be used as  a  long-option
       (--/++  option)  so  the potential command-line options are far greater
       than those listed.  For example: `aterm --loginShell --color1 Orange´.

       -help, --help
              Print out a message describing available options.

       -version, --version
              Print out a version with/without list of available options.

       -display displayname
              Attempt to open a window on the named X display  (-d  still  re‐
              spected).   In the absence of this option, the display specified
              by the DISPLAY environment variable is used.

       -geometry geom
              Window geometry (-g still respected); resource geometry.

       -rv|+rv
              Turn on/off simulated reverse video; resource reverseVideo.

       -bg colour
              Window background colour; resource background.

       -fg colour
              Window foreground colour; resource foreground.

       -pixmap: file[;geom]
              Specify image file for the background and also optionally  spec‐
              ify geometry of the image to be cut out of original image, to be
              used as background, with a geometry string.  Note you  may  need
              to  add  quotes to avoid special shell interpretation of the `;´
              in the command-line; resource backgroundPixmap.

       -mst: name
              Specify the name of the Afterstep MyStyle to be used as the base
              of  aterm´s  look.  ForeColor,  BackColor, Font, BackPixmap (all
              texture options) will be used from  MyStyle  definition,  unless
              some  other  command  line option is specifyed for the same set‐
              ting.  For example -fn  will  override  MyStyle  Font.  This  is
              available  only  if  used  with AfterStep 1.9.28 or later and if
              compiled with AfterStep libraries support (  --enable-afterstep-
              lib).  resource MyStyle.

       -tr|+tr
              Turn  on/off  pseudo  transparency mode. In this mode aterm will
              use part of root background as it´s  own  background,  emulating
              see-through effect; resource transparent.

       -trsb|+trsb
              Turn on/off pseudo transparent scrollbar. Works the same as -tr;
              resource transpscrollbar.

       -tint color
              Turn on pseudo transparency background tinting. Tinting  can  be
              done fast and slow way. In fast way it will be done by combining
              of background color with tinting color using  logical  function.
              This  function  defaults  to  AND,  and  it can be changed using
              -tinttype option - see below.   In  general  solid  colors  like
              Blue, Red, Green, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow are good, but you should
              experiment with it for each background you have.   True  tinting
              is  more memory and CPU hungry - tinted copy of background image
              will be created every time you move/resize window. It alows  for
              more  smooth  tinting thou.  You need to build it with --enable-
              transparency=yes or --enable-background-imageyes option,  to  be
              able to use this feature.  resource tinting.

       -sh amount
              This  option  allows  for darkening/lightening of the background
              image amount is the %value of the desired brightness, where  100
              is  the  original.   if  amount is less then 100 - image will be
              darkened.  if amount is less then 0 or more  then  100  -  image
              will  be  lightened.   Lightening can cause some strange looking
              effects if applied on bright image.  This option causes aterm to
              create  shaded/lightened copy of the background - it´s more mem‐
              ory cosuming as the result. It does not  make  much  difference,
              though,  if  applied  on  non transparent background image.  re‐
              source shading.

       -fade amount
              This option allows for darkening/lightening of colors when aterm
              is  loosing  focus.  amount is the %value of the desired bright‐
              ness, where 100 is the original.  if amount is less then  100  -
              colors  will be darkened.  if amount is less then 0 or more then
              100 - colors will  be  lightened.   Lightening  can  cause  some
              strange  looking  effects if applied on bright colors.  This op‐
              tion causes aterm to use more colors, as the result it  is  dis‐
              abled  by default. Use --enable-fading ./configure option to en‐
              able it.  resource fading.

       -bgtype type
              Specify type of the transformation to be performed on background
              image.  Possible  types are : tile - plain vanilla tiling of the
              image.  scale - original image will be  scaled  to  the  aterm´s
              size,  every  time  you  resize window.  scalev - original image
              will be scaled to the aterm´s height only, every time you resize
              window.   scaleh  - original image will be scaled to the aterm´s
              width only, every time you resize window.  center - original im‐
              age  will  be  centered  in aterm´s window.  notile - background
              color will be padded to image´s right/bottom to make it the same
              size as window is.  notileh - background color will be padded to
              image´s right to make it the same width as window is.  notilev -
              background color will be padded to image´s bottom to make it the
              same height as window is.       cut - aterm background  will  be
              cut  out  of the source image, as if this source image was tiled
              across the root window. The portion of the image that  lies  un‐
              derneath  of window will be used.   If AfterStep Pager, asetroot
              or Esetroot where used to set the root image, then  this  option
              can  be  used  in  conjunction with -tr option.  In this case it
              will do mentioned transformations to the root pixmap.   and  use
              it as aterm´s background.  resource backgroundType.

       -txttype type
              Allows  you to specify logical function to be used when display‐
              ing text. That will cause aterm to logically combine  text  with
              background  pixels.  That only works with transparent background
              and background image. Possible values  are  :  and,  andReverse,
              andInverted, xor, or, nor, invert, equiv, invert, orReverse, or‐
              Inverted, nand; resource textType.

       -tinttype type
              Allows you to specify logical function to be used  when  tinting
              transparent  background. That will cause aterm to logically com‐
              bine text with background pixels. NOTE:  If  shading  option  is
              used,  or  background image is specifyed - true type will always
              be used.  That works with bpth transparent background and  back‐
              ground image.  Possible values are :

              Fast  tinting  options  : and, andReverse, andInverted, xor, or,
              nor, invert, equiv, invert, orReverse, orInverted, nand,

              Slow tinting: true - will do "true" tinting -  that  means  that
              background  pixel´s RGB components will be decreased proportion‐
              aly to the RGB components of specified tinting  color;  resource

              the termcap(5) database and should have li# and co# entries; re‐
              source termName.

       -e command [arguments]
              Run the command with its command-line  arguments  in  the  aterm
              window; also sets the window title and icon name to be the base‐
              name of the program being executed if neither -title (-T) nor -n
              are  given on the command line.  If this option is used, it must
              be the last on the command-line.  If there is no -e option  then
              the  default  is to run the program specified by the SHELL envi‐

RESOURCES (available also as long-options)
       aterm accepts application defaults set in  XAPPLOADDIR/aterm  (compile-
       time  defined:  usually /etc/X11/Xresources/aterm) and resources set in
       ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources.  Note that  when  reading  X  resources,
       aterm  recognizes  two  class  names:  XTerm and Aterm.  The class name
       XTerm allows resources common to both aterm and xterm to be easily con‐
       figured,  while  the class name Aterm allows resources unique to aterm,
       notably colours and key-handling, to be shared between different  aterm
       configurations.   If no resources are specified, suitable defaults will
       be used.  Command-line arguments can be used to override resource  set‐
       tings.  The following resources are allowed:

       geometry: geom
              Create  the window with the specified X window geometry [default
              80x24]; option -geometry.

       background: colour
              Use the specified colour as the window´s background colour  [de‐
              fault White]; option -bg.

       foreground: colour
              Use  the specified colour as the window´s foreground colour [de‐
              fault Black]; option -fg.

       colorn: colour
              Use the specified colour for the colour value n, where 0-7  cor‐
              responds  to low-intensity (normal) colours and 8-15 corresponds
              to high-intensity (bold =  bright  foreground,  blink  =  bright
              background)  colours.   The  canonical  names  are  as  follows:
              0=black, 1=red, 2=green, 3=yellow,  4=blue,  5=magenta,  6=cyan,
              7=white, but the actual colour names used are listed in the COL‐
              ORS AND GRAPHICS section.

       colorBD: colour
              Use the specified colour to display  bold  characters  when  the
              foreground colour is the default.

       colorUL: colour
              Use  the  specified colour to display underlined characters when
              the foreground colour is the default.

       cursorColor: colour
              Use the specified colour for the cursor.  The default is to  use
              the foreground colour; option -cr.

       cursorColor2: colour
              Use the specified colour for the colour of the cursor text.  For
              this to take effect, cursorColor must also  be  specified.   The
              default is to use the background colour.

       reverseVideo: boolean
              True:  simulate  reverse  video  by  foreground  and  background
              colours; option -rv, False: regular  screen  colours  [default];
              option +rv.  See note in COLORS AND GRAPHICS section.

       scrollColor: colour
              Use the specified colour for the scrollbar [default #B2B2B2].

       troughColor: colour
              Use  the  specified  colour for the scrollbar´s trough area [de‐
              fault #969696].

       backgroundPixmap: file[;geom]
              Use the specified image file, and cut the area defined by geome‐
              try string out of it.

       MyStyle: name
              Specify the name of the Afterstep MyStyle to be used as the base
              of aterm´s look. ForeColor,  BackColor,  Font,  BackPixmap  (all
              texture  options)  will  be used from MyStyle definition, unless
              some other command line option is specifyed for  the  same  set‐
              ting.   For  example  resource  font will override MyStyle Font.
              This is available only if used with AfterStep  1.9.28  or  later
              and  if compiled with AfterStep libraries support ( --enable-af‐
              terstep-lib).

       transparent
              Turn on/off pseudo transparency mode. In this  mode  aterm  will
              use  part  of  root background as it´s own background, emulating
              see-through effect;

       tinting: color
              Turn on pseudo transparency background tinting. Tinting  can  be
              done fast and slow way. In fast way it will be done by combining
              of background color with tinting color using  logical  function.
              This  function  defaults  to  AND,  and  it can be changed using
              -tinttype option - see below.   In  general  solid  colors  like
              Blue, Red, Green, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow are good, but you should
              experiment with it for each background you have.   True  tinting
              is  more memory and CPU hungry - tinted copy of background image
              will be created every time you move/resize window. It alows  for

              transparency=yes or --enable-background-image=yes option, to  be
              able to use this feature.

       -shading: amount
              This  option  allows  for darkening/lightening of the background
              image amount is the %value of the desired brightness, where  100
              is  the  original.   if  amount is less then 100 - image will be
              darkened.  if amount is less then 0 or more  then  100  -  image
              will  be  lightened.   Lightening can cause some strange looking
              effects if applied on bright image.  This option causes aterm to
              create  shaded/lightened copy of the background - it´s more mem‐
              ory cosuming as the result. It does not  make  much  difference,
              though, if applied on non transparent background image.

       backgroundType: type
              Specify type of the transformation to be performed on background
              image. Possible types are : tile - plain vanilla tiling  of  the
              image.   scale  -  original  image will be scaled to the aterm´s
              size, every time you resize window.   scalev  -  original  image
              will be scaled to the aterm´s height only, every time you resize

              cut out of the source image, as if this source image  was  tiled
              across  the  root window. The portion of the image that lies un‐

              or  Esetroot  where used to set the root image, then this option
              can be used in conjunction with -tr option.   In  this  case  it
              will  do  mentioned transformations to the root pixmap.  and use
              it as aterm´s background.

       textType: type
              Allows you to specify logical function to be used when  display‐
              ing  text.  That will cause aterm to logically combine text with
              background pixels. That only works with  transparent  background
              and  background  image.  Possible  values are : and, andReverse,
              andInverted, xor, or, nor, invert, equiv, invert, orReverse, or‐
              Inverted, nand.

       tintingType type
              Allows  you  to specify logical function to be used when tinting
              transparent background. That will cause aterm to logically  com‐
              bine  text  with  background  pixels. NOTE: If shading option is
              used, or background image is specifyed - true type  will  always
              be  used.  That works with bpth transparent background and back‐
              ground image.  Possible values are :

              Fast tinting options : and, andReverse,  andInverted,  xor,  or,
              nor, invert, equiv, invert, orReverse, orInverted, nand,

              Slow  tinting:  true  - will do "true" tinting - that means that
              background pixel´s RGB components will be decreased  proportion‐
              aly to the RGB components of specified tinting color.

              The string to send when the backspace key is pressed.  If set to
              DEC  or  unset  it  will  send Delete (code 127) or, if shifted,
              Backspace (code 8) - which can be reversed with the  appropriate
              DEC private mode escape sequence.

       deletekey: string
              The  string  to  send when the delete key (not the keypad delete
              key) is pressed.  If unset it will send the sequence  tradition‐
              ally associated with the Execute key.

       cutchars: string
              The  characters  used as delimiters for double-click word selec‐
              tion.  The built-in default:
              BACKSLASH `"´&()*,;<=>?@[]{|}

       keysym.sym: string
              Associate string with keysym sym (0xFF00 - 0xFFFF).  It may con‐
              tain escape values (\a: bell, \b: backspace, \e, \E: escape, \n:
              newline, \r: return, \t: tab, \000:  octal  number)  or  control
              characters  (^?: delete, ^@: null, ^A ...) and may enclosed with
              double quotes so that it can start or end with whitespace.   The
              intervening  resource  name keysym. cannot be omitted.  This re‐
              source is only available when compiled with KEYSYM_RESOURCE.

THE SCROLLBAR
       Lines of text that scroll off the top of the  aterm  window  (resource:
       saveLines)  and  can  be  scrolled  back using the scrollbar or by key‐
       strokes.  The normal aterm scrollbar has arrows and  its  behaviour  is
       fairly intuitive.  The xterm-scrollbar is without arrows and its behav‐
       iour mimics that of xterm. When build with  --enable-next-scroll  aterm
       will  have  NeXT-ish scrollbars. They look nicer and easier in use, but
       have slightly larger size. Their look and size can be tweaked  at  com‐
       pile time by modifying parameters in rxvt.h.

       Scroll  down  with  Button1 (xterm-scrollbar) or Shift-Next.  Scroll up
       with Button3 (xterm-scrollbar) or Shift-Prior.  Continuous scroll  with
       Button2.

MOUSE REPORTING
       To  temporarily  override  mouse reporting, for either the scrollbar or
       the normal text selection/insertion, hold either the Shift or the  Meta
       (Alt) key while performing the desired mouse action.

       If  mouse  reporting  mode  is active, the normal scrollbar actions are
       disabled -- on the assumption that we are using a  fullscreen  applica‐
       tion.   Instead,  pressing  Button1 and Button3 sends ESC[6~ (Next) and
       ESC[5~ (Prior), respectively.  Similarly, clicking on the up  and  down
       arrows sends ESC[A (Up) and ESC[B (Down), respectively.

TEXT SELECTION AND INSERTION
       The  behaviour  of text selection and insertion mechanism is similar to
       xterm(1).

       Selection:
              Left click at the beginning of the region, drag to  the  end  of
              the region and release; Right click to extend the marked region;
              Left double-click to select a word; Left triple-click to  select
              the entire line.

       Insertion:
              Pressing and releasing the Middle mouse button (or Shift-Insert)
              in an aterm window causes the current text selection to  be  in‐
              serted as if it had been typed on the keyboard.

CHANGING FONTS
       You  can change fonts on-the-fly, which is to say cycle through the de‐
       fault font and others of  various  sizes,  by  using  Shift-KP_Add  and
       Shift-KP_Subtract.   Or,  alternatively  (if  enabled)  with  Alt-> and
       Alt-<, where the actual key can  be  selected  using  resources  small‐
       font_key/bigfont_key.

LOGIN STAMP
       aterm  tries  to write an entry into the utmp(5) file so that it can be
       seen via the who(1) command, and can accept messages.   To  allow  this
       feature, aterm must be installed setuid root on some systems.

COLORS AND GRAPHICS
       If  graphics  support was enabled at compile-time, aterm can be queried
       with ANSI escape sequences and can address individual pixels instead of
       text  characters.   Note  the graphics support is still considered beta
       code.

       In addition to the default foreground and background colours, aterm can
       display up to 16 colours (8 ANSI colours plus high-intensity bold/blink
       versions of the same).  Here is  a  list  of  the  colours  with  their
       rgb.txt names.

       color0         (black)              = Black
       color1         (red)                = Red3
       color2         (green)              = Green3
       color3         (yellow)             = Yellow3
       color4         (blue)               = Blue3
       color5         (magenta)            = Magenta3
       color6         (cyan)               = Cyan3
       color7         (white)              = AntiqueWhite
       color8         (bright black)       = Grey25
       color9         (bright red)         = Red
       color10        (bright green)       = Green
       color11        (bright yellow)      = Yellow
       color12        (bright blue)        = Blue
       color13        (bright magenta)     = Magenta
       color14        (bright cyan)        = Cyan
       color15        (bright white)       = White
       foreground                          = Black
       background                          = White

       It  is  also possible to specify the colour values of foreground, back‐
       ground, cursorColor, cursorColor2, colorBD, colorUL as a  number  0-15,
       as   a   convenient   shorthand   to   reference  the  colour  name  of
       color0-color15.

       Note that -rv ("reverseVideo: True") simulates reverse video by  always
       swapping  the  foreground/background  colours.   This is in contrast to
       xterm(1) where the colours are only swapped if they have not  otherwise
       been specified.  For example,

       aterm -fg Black -bg White -rv
              would  yield  White  on  Black, while on xterm(1) it would yield
              Black on White.

ENVIRONMENT
       aterm sets the environment variables  TERM,  COLORTERM  and  COLORFGBG.
       The  environment  variable WINDOWID is set to the X window id number of
       the aterm window and it also uses and  sets  the  environment  variable
       DISPLAY to specify which display terminal to use.  aterm uses the envi‐
       ronment variables ATERMPATH, then RXVTPATH and finally PATH to find XPM
       files.

FILES
       /etc/utmp
              System file for login records.

       /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt
              Color names.

SEE ALSO
       xterm(1), sh(1), resize(1), X(1), pty(4), tty(4), utmp(5)

       Cursor change support is not yet implemented.

       Click-and-drag doesn´t work with X11 mouse report overriding.

       Graphics support is fairly crude.
