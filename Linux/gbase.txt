NAME
       gbase - small numeric base converter

SYNOPSIS
       gbase [options]

DESCRIPTION
       gbase converts numbers between bases 2 (binary), 8 (octal), 10 (decimal), 16 (hexadecimal).

       If you specify a number on the command line (preceded by a switch to describe the base the number is in) the program will display that number in the four bases on the console and exit.
       You can also specify the -s switch which will allow you to enter/display signed numbers. (This allows the use of a - (minus) before a decimal number).

       Just  running  the  program  without any switches will display the main window. There are four entry boxes, corresponding to each of the four bases. You can type into any of these boxes and the others
       will update automagically. The program will ignore any characters that are not allowed for that particular base. It will only allow a - (minus) at the start of a decimal number, if the  signed  option
       is on.

OPTIONS
       --help Display a short help screen and exit

       --version
              Print version number and exit

       -s     Treat the number as a signed value

       -d decimal number
              Print this decimal number in all bases

       -h hex number
              Print this hexadecimal number in all bases

       -o octal number
              Print this octal number in all bases

       -b binary number
              Print this binary number in all bases
