NAME
       klystrack - make C64/NES/Amiga-style chiptunes

SYNOPSIS
       klystrack [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the klystrack command.

       klystrack is a tracker for making C64/NES/Amiga-style chiptunes on a modern platform.  It can be used to create audio for games.

FEATURES
       Sound
       Additive synthesis with filters (think SID, Atari, NES etc.)
       Hard sync and ring modulation (like SID)
       FM synthesis (think Adlib, MSX, OPL2 etc.)
       Wavetable for samples or custom waveforms to be used in synthesis (think Amiga, SNES)
       Built-in wave generator and editor
       Programmable instruments not limited to simple arpeggios
       Sequencer Tracker with free positioning of patterns
       Pattern transpose
       Pattern length is not fixed

       Effects Stereo chorus
       SNES-style multitap echo
       Bit crusher/decimator
       Export Own custom format with a tiny playback library to be used in games, demos etc.
       Export as .WAV
       Export each track as separate .WAV's
       Export wavetable items as .WAV's (use klystrack to create one-cycle waveforms for other synths!)
       Import Import .WAV's to use as samples
       Import Protracker and FT2 modules
       Import C64 SID files (Rob Hubbard player)
