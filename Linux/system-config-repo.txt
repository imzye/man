NAME
       system-config-repo - Yum repository GUI interface

SYNOPSIS
       system-config-repo [repo]

       [repo] is the name of a yum repository file, by default interpreted relative to /etc/yum.repos.d.

EXAMPLE
           $ system-config-repo fedora.repo

       Displays info on the Fedora release repositories.

DESCRIPTION
       system-config-repo  provides  a  graphical  interface  to a single configuration file in /etc/yum.repos.d. Using the GUI a user can enable/disable the repository, view the package list and inspect the
       signing key used inclusive fingerprint.

DATA SOURCES
       To gather more info, application checks if there is a package with information (summary, description, icon, etc.) on the repository file.  The first check is if the repository is owned by  a  package.
       If  this  fails,  application tries to locate a package which requires the repository file. In any case, in order to be used a package must provide "repo-gui" to be used. If no package is found it de‐
       faults to "Default".

       The  package found this way is used as <package> in the following.

       The gui gathers data from different sources to provide info on the package.  In priority it uses:

       •  Data in the directory /usr/share/system-config-repo/repos/<package>.  Description, summary etc are represented as files named description.txt, summary .txt etc. A file named icon.png  is  displayed
          if present.

       •  The appdata file /usr/share/appdata/<package>.appdata.xml. This file contains possibly localized description and summary.

       •  The rpm database provides a non-localized version of summary and description.

       •  The path  /usr/share/system-config-repo/Default contains last resort default values.

RESTRICTED OPERATION
       A  repository  file  which  is  writable by current user is updated directly.  If the repo file is not writeable, an attempt to update it using sudo(8) is done. The package installs a sudo config file
       which allow all members of the wheel group to update the repository file.
