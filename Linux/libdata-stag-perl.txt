STAG-PARSE(1p)                                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                      STAG-PARSE(1p)

NAME
       stag-parse - parses a file and fires events (e.g. sxpr to xml)

SYNOPSIS
         # convert XML to IText
         stag-parse -p xml -w itext file1.xml file2.xml

         # use a custom parser/generator and a custom writer/generator
         stag-parse -p MyMod::MyParser -w MyMod::MyWriter file.txt

DESCRIPTION
       script wrapper for the Data::Stag modules

       feeds in files into a parser object that generates nestarray events, and feeds the events into a handler/writer class

ARGUMENTS
       -p|parser FORMAT
           FORMAT is one of xml, sxpr or itext, or the name of a perl module

           this is the class that parsers the input file(s) and generates stag events

           xml assumed as default

       -w|writer FORMAT
           FORMAT is one of xml, sxpr or itext, or the name of a perl module

           this is the class that catches the events thrown by the parser; it can be any class, but the class is typically a writer

           xml assumed as default

       -o|out FILE
           the writer will use this file (defaults to STDOUT)

       -e|errf FILE
           file to store parse error handler output

       -errhandler FORMAT/MODULE
           FORMAT is one of xml, sxpr or itext, or the name of a perl module

           all parse error events go to this module

       -r|root NODE_NAME
           if this is specified, NODE_NAME becomes the root of the stag tree, and anything that was previously the root is placed below this.

           this happens automatically if more than one file is parsed (because there can only be one tree root)

       -color
           Works only if the output handler is able to provide ASCII-colors (currently supported for itext and xml)
