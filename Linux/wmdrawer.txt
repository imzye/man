NAME
       wmdrawer — a dockapp providing a drawer to launch applications

SYNOPSIS
       wmdrawer [-c, --configfile=FILE [-n, --instancename=NAME]]  [-w, --windowed]  [-h, --help]  [-v, --version]

DESCRIPTION
       wmdrawer is a dock application (dockapp) that provides a drawer (retractable button bar) to conveniently launch applications.

       The drawer is retractable and animated.

       Several columns of buttons can been defined in the drawer.

       The configuration file is automatically reloaded if it changes.

       Multiple instances of the program can run at the same time.

       The buttons can be highlighted under the mouse cursor.

       A tooltip can be defined for each button.

       The drawer can be transparent (need SHAPE extension).

       Ability to launch several apps at once from the drawer.  By holding down the key Shift or by using mouse buttons middle or right instead of left, you can keep the drawer opened.

       Adjustable  behaviors: dock's image (logo), dock's width and height (for both min=12, max=128), automatic/manual opening and closing of the drawer, timeout value in milliseconds if automatic clos‐
       ing selected, drawer's opening direction and animation speed, mouse cursor type in the drawer, drawer's pseudo-transparency, icons' background image (only if transparency  isn't  activated),  but‐
       tons'  size  (min=12,  max=128),  buttons'  highlight  type  (0:none, 1:target, 2:shading), image used as highlight (target type only), color and darkening level for highlight (shading type only),
       drawer's border size, buttons' tooltips and tooltips' font
