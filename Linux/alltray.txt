NAME
       AllTray - Dock any program into the system tray.

SYNOPSIS
       alltray [program] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       With  AllTray you can dock any application with no native tray icon (like Evolution, Thunderbird, Terminals) into the system tray. A high-light feature is that a click on the "close" button will mini‐
       mize back to system tray. It works well with Gnome, KDE, XFCE 4*, Fluxbox* and WindowMaker*. Xmms is supported in particular.

       Click-Mode: Only run alltray and click on the window you would like to dock.  (Abort with <c>)
