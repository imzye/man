NAME
       goby - Sequencing data and results analysis tool

SYNOPSIS
       goby <mem> <mode> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Goby provides facilities to manage sequencing data and ease the implementation of data analysis pipelines.

MANDATORY INFORMATION
       <mem>  Human-readable amount of memory to allocate to Goby e.g. could be 1m, 145m, 3g, ...

OPTIONS
       mode-specific-options
              Each of the above modes has specific options. The complete list of options for a given mode <mode> can be get by running

               goby 100m <mode>

              which returns a complete list of options for running the mode <mode> as well as a description of what this mode provides.
