NAME
       Preview - General purpose image viewer for GNUstep

SYNOPSIS
       Preview

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the Preview command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       Preview  is an application that can be used to display images. It is designed to be easy to use and will support all GNUstep features (images design support, pasteboard/services, printint and lay‐
       out...). It tries to follow the NeXTSTEP spirit.

SEE ALSO
       GNUstep(7), open(1).
