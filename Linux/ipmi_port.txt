NAME
       ipmi_port - a daemon to bind RMCP port 623 to prevent portmap from using it

SYNOPSIS
       ipmi_port [-bx]

DESCRIPTION
       This  ipmi_port  service starts and binds port 623, then sleeps forever, so that the portmap service will not try to reuse port 623, which it otherwise might try to do.  Since the IPMI firmware snoops
       the NIC channel and grabs any traffic destined for RMCP port 623, any application in the OS which tried to use port 623 would fail.

OPTIONS
       Command line options are described below.

       -b     Background mode.  Convert to a daemon and run in background.  Without specifying this option, ipmi_port will run in foreground.

       -x     Causes eXtra debug messages to be displayed.
