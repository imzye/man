NAME
       x42-scope - JACK/LV2 Oscilloscope

SYNOPSIS
       x42-scope

DESCRIPTION
       x42-scope is a four channel oscilloscope for use with the JACK Audio Connection Kit.

       It is equivalent to using the 'http://gareus.org/oss/lv2/sisco#4chan' LV2 plugin except that it is a standalone version, not depending on any LV2-host.

       x42-scope/SiSco  implements  a classic oscilloscope display with time on the X-axis and signal level on the Y-axis.  The minimum time-scale is 50 micro-seconds per grid, yielding a maximum resolu‐
       tion of 960kHz at 48SPS.

USAGE
       x42-scope takes no options. It can be closed by sending a SIGTERM (CTRL+C) on the command-line of by closing the window.  All control elements are operated in using the mouse:

       Click+Drag
              left/down: decrease, right/up: increase value. Hold the Ctrl key to increase sensitivity.

       Shift+Click
              reset to default value

       Scroll-wheel
              up/down by 1 step (smallest possible adjustment for given setting). Rapid continuous scrolling increases the step-size.

       Detailed documentation of operational can be found at http://x42.github.io/sisco.lv2/
