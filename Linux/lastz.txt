NAME
       lastz - pairwise aligning DNA sequences

       lastz_D - pairwise aligning DNA sequences with double-float scoring

DESCRIPTION
       LASTZ  is a drop-in replacement for BLASTZ, and is backward compatible with BLASTZ’s command-line syntax. That is, it supports all of BLASTZ’s options but also has additional ones, and may produce
       slightly different alignment results.

OPTIONS
       target[[start..end]]
              spec/file containing target sequence (fasta, fastq, nib, 2bit or hsx);  [start..end] defines a subrange of the file (use --help=files for more details)

       query[[start..end]]
              spec/file containing query sequences;  if absent, queries come from stdin (if needed)

       --self the target sequence is also the query (this replaces the query file)

       --seed=match<length>
              use a word with no gaps instead of a seed pattern

       --[no]transition[=2]
              allow one or two transitions in a seed hit (by default a transition is allowed)

       --step=<length>
              set step length (default is 1)

       --strand=both
              search both strands

       --strand=plus
              search + strand only (matching strand of query spec)

       --strand=minus
              search - strand only (opposite strand of query spec) (by default both strands are searched)

       --ambiguous=n[,<penalty>] treat N as an ambiguous nucleotide
              (by default N is treated as a sequence splicing

              character)

       --ambiguous=iupac[,<penalty>] treat any ambiguous IUPAC-IUB character as a
              completely ambiguous nucleotide (by default any sequence file with B,D,H,K,M,R,S,V,W,Y

              is rejected)

       --[no]gfextend
              perform gap-free extension of seed hits to HSPs (by default extension is performed)

       --[no]chain
              perform chaining

       --chain=<diag,anti>
              perform chaining with given penalties for diagonal and anti-diagonal (by default no chaining is performed)

       --[no]gapped
              perform gapped alignment (instead of gap-free) (by default gapped alignment is performed)

       --notrivial
              do not output a trivial self-alignment block if the target and query happen to be identical

       --scores=<file>
              read substitution scores from a file (default is HOXD70)

       --match=<R>,<P>
              scores are +R/-P for match/mismatch

       --gap=<open,extend>
              set gap open and extend penalties (default is 400,30)

       --xdrop=<score>
              set x-drop threshold (default is 10*sub[A][A])

       --ydrop=<score>
              set y-drop threshold (default is open+300extend)

       --noxtrim
              if x-drop extension encounters end of sequence, don't trim back to peak score (use this for short reads)

       --noytrim
              if y-drop extension encounters end of sequence, don't trim back to peak score (use this for short reads)

       --hspthresh=<score>
              set threshold for high scoring pairs (default is 3000) ungapped extensions scoring lower are discarded <score> can also be a percentage or base count

       --exact=<length>
              set threshold for exact matches if specified, exact matches are found rather than high scoring pairs (replaces --hspthresh)

       --inner=<score>
              set threshold for HSPs during interpolation (default is no interpolation)

       --gappedthresh=<score> set threshold for gapped alignments
              gapped extensions scoring lower are discarded <score> can also be a percentage or base count (default is to use same value as --hspthresh)

       --[no]entropy
              involve entropy in filtering high scoring pairs (default is "entropy")

       --nomirror
              don't report mirror-image alignments when using --self (default is to skip processing them, but recreate them in the output)

       --allocate:traceback=<bytes>
              space for trace-back information (default is 80.0M)

       --masking=<count>
              mask any position in target hit this many times zero indicates no masking (default is no masking)

       --identity=<min>[..<max>] filter alignments by percent identity
              0<=min<=max<=100;  blocks (or HSPs) outside min..max are discarded (default is no identity filtering)

       --coverage=<min>[..<max>] filter alignments by percentage of query covered
              0<=min<=max<=100;  blocks (or HSPs) outside min..max are discarded (default is no query coverage filtering)

       --output=<file>
              specify output alignment file;  otherwise alignments are written to stdout

       --format=<type>
              specify output format; one of lav, axt, maf, cigar, rdotplot, text or general (use --help=formats for more details) (by default output is LAV)

       --rdotplot=<file>
              create an output file suitable for plotting in R.

       --progress=<n>
              report processing of every nth query

       --version
              report the program version and quit

       --help list all options

       --help=files
              list information about file specifiers

       --help=formats
              list information about output file formats

       --help=shortcuts
              list blastz-compatible shortcuts

       --help=defaults
              list scoring defaults for your current settings

       --help=yasra
              list yasra-specific shortcuts
