NAME
       Sys::Info::Driver::Linux::OS::Distribution - Linux distribution probe

VERSION
       version 0.7911

SYNOPSIS
           use Sys::Info::Driver::Linux::OS::Distribution;
           my $distro = Sys::Info::Driver::Linux::OS::Distribution->new;
           my $name   = $distro->name;
           if( $name ) {
               my $version = $distro->version;
               print "you are running $distro, version $version\n";
           }
           else {
               print "distribution unknown\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple module that tries to guess on what linux distribution we are running by looking for release's files in /etc.  It now looks for 'lsb-release' first as that should be the most
       correct and adds ubuntu support.  Secondly, it will look for the distro specific files.

       It currently recognizes slackware, debian, suse, fedora, redhat, turbolinux, yellowdog, knoppix, mandrake, conectiva, immunix, tinysofa, va-linux, trustix, adamantix, yoper, arch-linux, libranet,
       gentoo, ubuntu and redflag.

       It has function to get the version for debian, suse, redhat, gentoo, slackware, redflag and ubuntu(lsb). People running unsupported distro's are greatly encouraged to submit patches.
