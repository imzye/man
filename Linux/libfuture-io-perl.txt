NAME
       "Future::IO::ImplBase" - base class for "Future::IO" implementations

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a few utility methods that may help writing actual Future::IO implementation classes. It is entirely optional; implementations are not required to use it.

CLASS METHODS
   APPLY
          __PACKAGE__->APPLY;

       Attempts to set the value of the $Future::IO::IMPL variable to the name of the calling package.

DEFAULT METHODS
       These methods are provided based on lower-level functionality that the implementing class should provide.

   accept
       Implemented by wrapping "ready_for_read", as "sysread" uses.

   alarm
       Implemented by wrapping "sleep".

   connect
       Implemented by wrapping "ready_for_write", as "syswrite" uses.

   sysread
       Requires a lower-level method

          $f = $class->ready_for_read( $fh );

       which should return a Future that completes when the given filehandle may be ready for reading.

   syswrite
       Requires a lower-level method

          $f = $class->ready_for_write( $fh );

       which should return a Future that completes when the given filehandle may be ready for writing.
