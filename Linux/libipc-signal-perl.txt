NAME
       IPC::Signal - Utility functions dealing with signals

SYNOPSIS
           $number = sig_num $name;
           $name   = sig_name $number;

           sig_translate_setup;
           $number = $Sig_num{$name};
           $name   = $Sig_name[$number];

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains utility functions for dealing with signals.

       Nothing is exported by default.

       sig_num chopped-signal-name
           Returns the signal number of the signal whose name (sans "SIG") is chopped-signal-name, or undef if there is no such signal.

           This function is prototyped to take a single scalar argument.

       sig_name signal-number
           Returns the chopped signal name (like "HUP") of signal number signal-number, or undef if there is no such signal.

           This function is prototyped to take a single scalar argument.

       sig_translate_setup
           If  you want to use the @Sig_name and %Sig_num variables directly you must call sig_translate_setup to initialize them.  This isn't necessary if you only use the function interfaces sig_name()
           and sig_num().

           This function is prototyped to take no arguments.

       %Sig_num
           A hash with chopped signal name keys (like "HUP") and integer signal number values.

       @Sig_name
           An array mapping signal numbers to chopped signal names (like "HUP").
