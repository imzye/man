NAME
       xcb_poly_point -

SYNOPSIS
       #include <xcb/xproto.h>

   Request function

       xcb_void_cookie_t xcb_poly_point(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t coordinate_mode, xcb_drawable_t drawable, xcb_gcontext_t gc, uint32_t points_len, const xcb_point_t *points);

REQUEST ARGUMENTS
       conn      The XCB connection to X11.

       coordinate_mode
                 One of the following values:

                 XCB_COORD_MODE_ORIGIN
                           Treats all coordinates as relative to the origin.

                 XCB_COORD_MODE_PREVIOUS
                           Treats all coordinates after the first as relative to the previous coordinate.

DESCRIPTION
RETURN VALUE
       Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If you want to handle errors directly with xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_poly_point_checked. See xcb-requests(3) for details.

ERRORS
       This request does never generate any errors.
