NAME
       princeprocessor - standalone password candidate generator using the PRINCE algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       princeprocessor [options] [<] wordlist

DESCRIPTION
       The princeprocessor is a password candidate generator and can be thought of as an advanced combinator attack. Rather than taking as input two different wordlists and then outputting all the possi‐
       ble  two  word  combinations  though, princeprocessor only has one input wordlist and builds "chains" of combined words. These chains can have 1 to N words from the input wordlist concatenated to‐
       gether.

       * Startup:

       -V,  --version
              Print version

       -h,  --help
              Print help

       * Misc:

       --keyspace
              Calculate number of combinations

       * Optimization:

       --pw-min=NUM
              Print candidate if length is greater than NUM

       --pw-max=NUM
              Print candidate if length is smaller than NUM

       --elem-cnt-min=NUM
              Minimum number of elements per chain

       --elem-cnt-max=NUM
              Maximum number of elements per chain

       --wl-dist-len
              Calculate output length distribution from wordlist

       --wl-max=NUM
              Load only NUM words from input wordlist or use 0 to disable

       -c,  --dupe-check-disable
              Disable dupes check for faster initial load

       --save-pos-disable
              Save the position for later resume with -s

       * Resources:

       -s,  --skip=NUM
              Skip NUM passwords from start (for distributed)

       -l,  --limit=NUM
              Limit output to NUM passwords (for distributed)

       * Files:

       -o,  --output-file=FILE
              Output-file

       * Amplifier:

       --case-permute
              For each word in the wordlist that begins with a letter generate a word with the opposite case of the first letter
