NAME
       ikidns - ikiwiki-hosting dns helper

SYNOPSIS
       ikidns subcommand options

DESCRIPTION
       Each web server needs to be able to update the DNS when a site is brought up on it. They do so by talking to the master DNS server, using nsupdate(1) and a key.

       ikidns handles management of the keys, and configures the master DNS server to accept them for each configured toplevel domain name.

FILES
       /etc/bind/$domain/db/zonefile  is  the zone file for a domain. A stub file will be generated from a template if it doesn't exist, but probably needs to be configured. As nsupdate(1) is used to add
       subdomains, bind will first add them to a journal file, and later update this file to list them.

       /etc/ikiwiki-hosting/ikiwiki-hosting.conf is the config file read by default.

       /etc/ikiwiki-hosting/templates/ holds templates of bind config and zone files

EXAMPLES
        scp $(ikidns createkey $newserver) $newserver:/etc/ikiwiki-hosting/keys/dns/

        ikidns setupbind
