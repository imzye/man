NAME
       usage: - Utility to manage outputs of a Wayland compositor

SYNOPSIS
       wlr-randr [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Command line interface which allows setting the size, scale,  orientation of the output for a screen.
       This utility requires the compositor to implement the wlr output management protocol.
       Currently, only wlroots based compositor support this protocol.

OPTIONS
       --help Print out a summary of the usage and exit.

       --dryrun
              Performs all the actions specified except that no changes are made.

       --output <name>
              Selects an output to reconfigure. This option must be set when making changes to the output using below options.

       --on   Enables the output.

       --off  Disables the output.

       --mode | --custom-mode <width>x<height>[@<refresh>Hz]
              Set output resolution and, optionally, refresh rate.

       --pos <x>,<y>
              Position the output within the screen using pixel coordinates. In case reflection or rotation is applied, the translation is applied after the effects.

       --transform normal|90|180|270|flipped|flipped-90|flipped-180|flipped-270
              Transform the output by rotating it following the provided value.

       --scale <factor>
              Changes the dimensions of the output picture. Values superior to 1 will lead to a compressed screen (screen dimension bigger than the dimension of the output mode), and values below 1 leads
              to a zoom in on the output.
