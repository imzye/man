NAME
       matchbox-desktop - a desktop application launcher for resource-limited systems

SYNOPSIS
       matchbox-desktop [options]

DESCRIPTION
       matchbox-desktop  uses  the  desktop  background to provide an application launcher. It reads the standard desktop entry specification files also used by GNOME and KDE to discover the applications
       available on the system.

       Matchbox is a base environment for the X Window System running on non-desktop embedded platforms such as handhelds, set-top boxes, kiosks and anything else for which screen space, input mechanisms
       or system resources are limited.
