NAME
       sslsplit.conf - Configuration file for SSLsplit

DESCRIPTION
       The file sslsplit.conf configures SSLsplit, sslsplit(1).

FILE FORMAT
       The  file  consists of comments and options with arguments. Each line which starts with a hash (#) symbol is ignored by the parser. Options and arguments are of the form Option Argument. The argu‐
       ments are of the following types:

       BOOL   Boolean value (yes/no).

       STRING String.

DIRECTIVES
       When an option is not used (hashed or doesn't exist in the configuration file) sslsplit takes a default action. If an option does not have a command line equivalent, -o opt=val option can be  used
       to override it on the command line.
