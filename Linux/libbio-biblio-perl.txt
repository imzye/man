NAME
       bp_biblio - bioperl client for accessing and querying a bibliographic repository

VERSION
       version 1.70

SYNOPSIS
       Usage:

         bp_biblio [vh]
         bp_biblio [bcFgOpq]         [-l <URL>]
         bp_biblio [abcdDeFknmOpqrs] [-l <URL>] -i <collection-ID>
         bp_biblio [abcdDeFknmOpqrs] [-l <URL>] - -find <keywords> \
                [-attrs <attrs>]...
         bp_biblio [Vq]              [-l <URL>]
         bp_biblio [FOq]             [-f <filename>]

DESCRIPTION
       A client showing how to use Bio::Biblio module, a module for accessing and querying a bibliographic repository.  It also shows how to use modules Bio::Biblio::IO::medlinexml
       Bio::Biblio::IO::medline2ref which converts XML MEDLINE citations into a simple hash table and into full Perl objects.

       It has many options in order to cover as many methods as possible.  Because of that, it can be also used as a fully functional command-line client for querying repository and retrieving citations
       from it.

OPTIONS
   What service to contact:
         -l <URL> ... a location where a Bibliographic Query service is
                      provided as a WebService
                      (default: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/openbqs/services/MedlineSRS)

   What query collection to use:
       Some options do not need to specify a collection, some do.

         -i <collection_id>  ... the collection ID can be obtained in a
                                 previous invocation by specifying argument
                                 '-p' (print ID)
         -find <keywords> [-attrs <attrs>]
                             ... create a collection from citations
                                 containing given keywords - either in all
                                 default attributes, or only in the given
                                 attributes;

                                 it is possible to repeat it, for example:
                                    -find brazma -attrs authors -find -study
                                 (the repetitions refine previous results)
                                 both <keywords> and <attrs> may be
                                 comma-delimited multi-values;
                                 note that '-find' must be separated from
                                 the rest of options by '-';

                                 note that this script is a bit stupid
                                 regarding quoted keywords, or keywords
                                 containing commans... TBD better

         what XML format is used for citations:
         -Fm     ... MEDLINE (default)
         -Fp     ... PubMed

   What to do (with the query collection):
         -g <id>    ... get citation <id>
         -c         ... get count (a number of citations)
         -p         ... print collection ID (which may be used in the next
                        invocation as an '-i' argument); it implies also '-k'
         -b         ... print citations in a non-XML format (TBD)

       Other options can be used only on a sub-collection - which can be obtained directly by specifying '-i' argument, or indirectly by specifying one or more queries by '-find' arguments:

         -d         ... get all citation IDs
         -n         ... get next citation
         -m [<how_many>] ... get 'how_many' more
         -r         ... reset iteration to the first citation in the collection
                        (now you can use '-n' or '-m' again)
         -a         ... get all citations - as an array
         -s         ... as '-a' but get it as one string
         -e         ... check if given collection exists and has more citations
         -k         ... keep resulting collection persistent (makes sense only
                        when collection IDs are being printed otherwise you
                        would not know how to contact the persistent collection
                        next time)
         -D         ... destroy given collection (makes sense together with '-i')

       Options specifying output format of the results:

         -Ox        ... output in XML format (default)
         -Oo        ... output as Biblio objects
         -Or        ... output as a raw hashtable

         The options above can be used also for converting an XML MEDLINE
         local file without using any SOAP connection at all;

         -f <filename> ... an XML file to be read and converted

       Options dealing with controlled vocabularies:

         -Vn                  ... get all vocabulary names
         -Vv::<name>          ... get all values from vocabulary <name>
         -Va::<name>          ... get everything from vocabulary <name>
         -Vd::<name>::<value> ... get description of <value>
                                  from vocabulary <name>
         -Ve::<name>::<value> ... return 1 if <value> exists
                                  in vocabulary <name>

       And the remaining options:

         -h  ... get help
         -v  ... get version
         -q  ... be quiet (less verbose)

EXAMPLES
         bp_biblio - -find Java -attrs abstract -find perl

       Several separate invocations sharing the same query collection:

         bp_biblio -p -q - -find Brazma,Robinson > b.tmp
         bp_biblio -i `cat b.tmp` -d
         MEDLINE2005/10693778
         MEDLINE2005/10977099
         MEDLINE2005/11726920
         MEDLINE2005/12225585
         MEDLINE2005/12227734
         bp_biblio -i `cat b.tmp` -g 10693778
         <MedlineCitation Status="Completed">
          ...
         </MedlineCitation>

         bp_biblio -i `cat b.tmp` -e
         Exists: 1       Has next: 1

         bp_biblio -i `cat b.tmp` -D
         Destroyed OK.

         bp_biblio -i `cat b.tmp` -e
         Exists: 0       Has next: 0

       Access to controlled vocabularies:

         bp_biblio -Vn

         repository_subsets
         MEDLINE2005/*/citation_subset

         bp_biblio -Vv::MEDLINE2005/JournalArticle/properties
         AllText
         ID
         PMID
         ISSN
         ...

       Converting local XML MEDLINE file:

         bp_biblio -g 10693778 > a_file.xml
         bp_biblio -f a_file.xml -Oo   ... to Perl objects
         bp_biblio -f a_file.xml -Or   ... as a raw hash

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
         HTTPPROXY = <HTTP proxy server>

       Use this if you use this script on a machine which needs to access remote HTTP targets via a proxy server.  For example:

         export HTTPPROXY=http://128.243.220.41:3128
         bp_biblio -c
