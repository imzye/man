NAME
       sbuild-qemu-update - sbuild-update analog for QEMU images

SYNOPSIS
       sbuild-qemu-update [-h] [--snapshot] [--arch=ARCH] [--noexec] IMAGE

DESCRIPTION
       sbuild-qemu-update boots a QEMU VM using IMAGE and then runs apt-get in it, performing update, dist-upgrade, clean and autoremove. It can optionally create a snapshot before updating.

       The  architecture is auto-guessed by stripping any file suffix and then splitting the image name on dashes ``-'', and finally by looking for a Debian architecture name. sid-amd64.img, amd64-tempo‐
       rary.image or even just amd64 would all be assumed to be amd64 images, but not amd64.rebuild-tests.img. If this guesses wrong, use the --arch option.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show this help message and exit.

       --snapshot
              Create a snapshot of the image before changing it. Useful for reproducibility purposes.

       --arch=ARCH
              Architecture to use (instead of attempting to auto-guess).

       --timeout=SECS
              Maximum time to wait for command to finish with expected result. Mostly relevant for foreign architectures, where apt-get update can take quite a while. Default: 600s.

       --noexec
              Don't actually do anything. Just print the command string that would be executed, and then exit.

       --boot=auto,bios,efi,ieee1275,none
              How to boot the image. Default is BIOS on amd64 and i386, EFI on arm64 and armhf, and IEEE1275 on ppc64el.

EXAMPLES
       $ sbuild-qemu-update unstable-autopkgtest-amd64.img

       This will update the image unstable-autopkgtest-amd64.img in the current directory. If no such file exists there, then $IMAGEDIR/unstable-autopkgtest-amd64.img is tried.

ENVIRONMENT
       If $IMAGEDIR is unset, then ~/.cache/sbuild is used.
