NAME
       MooseX::Role::WithOverloading - (DEPRECATED) Roles which support overloading

VERSION
       version 0.17

SYNOPSIS
           package MyRole;
           use MooseX::Role::WithOverloading;

           use overload
               q{""}    => 'as_string',
               fallback => 1;

           has message => (
               is       => 'rw',
               isa      => 'Str',
           );

           sub as_string { shift->message }

           package MyClass;
           use Moose;
           use namespace::autoclean;

           with 'MyRole';

           package main;

           my $i = MyClass->new( message => 'foobar' );
           print $i; # Prints 'foobar'

DESCRIPTION
       MooseX::Role::WithOverloading allows you to write a Moose::Role which defines overloaded operators and allows those overload methods to be composed into the classes/roles/instances it's compiled
       to, where plain Moose::Roles would lose the overloading.

       Starting with Moose version 2.1300, this module is no longer necessary, as the functionality is available already. In that case, "use MooseX::Role::WithOverloading" behaves identically to "use
       Moose::Role".

DEPRECATION NOTICE
       This module is marked as deprecated, as starting with Moose version 2.1300, the functionality provided here is now built-in to Moose. You only need to use this module if you are using an older
       Moose (but please upgrade!).
