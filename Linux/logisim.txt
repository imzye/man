NAME
       logisim - a graphical tool for designing and simulating logic circuits

SYNOPSIS
       logisim

DESCRIPTION
       logisim  is  an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. With its simple toolbar interface and simulation of circuits as you build them, it is simple enough to facili‐
       tate learning the most basic concepts related to logic circuits. With the capacity to build larger circuits from smaller subcircuits, and to draw bundles of wires with a single mouse drag, Logisim
       can be used (and is used) to design and simulate entire CPUs for educational purposes.
