NAME
       dropbearkey - create private keys for the use with dropbear(8) or dbclient(1)

SYNOPSIS
       dropbearkey -t type -f file [-s bits] [-y]

DESCRIPTION
       dropbearkey  generates a RSA, DSS, or ECDSA format SSH private key, and saves it to a file for the use with the Dropbear client or server.  Note that some SSH implementations use the term "DSA" rather
       than "DSS", they mean the same thing.

OPTIONS
       -t type
              Type of key to generate.  Must be one of rsa ecdsa or dss.

       -f file
              Write the secret key to the file file. For client authentication ~/.ssh/id_dropbear is loaded by default

       -s bits
              Set the key size to bits bits, should be multiple of 8 (optional).

       -y     Just print the publickey and fingerprint for the private key in file.

NOTES
       The program dropbearconvert(1) can be used to convert between Dropbear and OpenSSH key formats.

       Dropbear does not support encrypted keys.

EXAMPLE
       generate a host-key:
        # dropbearkey -t rsa -f /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key

       extract a public key suitable for authorized_keys from private key:
        # dropbearkey -y -f id_rsa | grep "^ssh-rsa " >> authorized_keys
