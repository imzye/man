NAME
       angband - is a graphical dungeon adventure game in the vein of rogue

SYNOPSIS
       angband [options] [-- suboptions]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page explains the Debian package angband .  Angband is a single-player, graphical dungeon adventure game using textual characters to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the
       inhabitants  therein, in the vein of rogue, hack, nethack, and moria.  Angband 4.2.5 is an official stable release incorporating all the changes and improvements added since the last official sta‐
       ble release ( Angband 4.2.4).

       This version of Angband has been compiled with ncurses and the X Windowing system and SDL2 front-ends, and hence can be played on a virtual console as well as under X.  In the  latter  cases,  the
       game can use multiple windows.

GETTING STARTED
       To  start  with,  you  can  just  say angband -uTest, and that creates a save file with the file name ~/.angband/Angband/save/<UID>.Test.  The best place to get help is the program itself; help is
       reached by the command ?  and presents a menu of choices.

       Program options can be set  using the = command. To see what the various options mean, access the List of Options help menu with the ?  command.
