Crypt::PBKDF2::Hash::HMACSHA3(3pm)                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                  Crypt::PBKDF2::Hash::HMACSHA3(3pm)

NAME
       Crypt::PBKDF2::Hash::HMACSHA3 - HMAC-SHA3 support for Crypt::PBKDF2 using Digest::SHA

VERSION
       version 0.161520

DESCRIPTION
       Uses Digest::HMAC and Digest::SHA3 "sha3_256"/"sha3_384"/"sha3_512" to provide the HMAC-ShA3 family of hashes for Crypt::PBKDF2.

       This could be done with Crypt::PBKDF2::Hash::DigestHMAC instead, but it seemed nice to have a uniform interface to HMACSHA*.
