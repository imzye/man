VFS_GLUSTERFS_FUSE(8)                                                                   System Administration tools                                                                   VFS_GLUSTERFS_FUSE(8)

NAME
       vfs_glusterfs_fuse - Utilize features provided by GlusterFS

SYNOPSIS

       vfs objects = glusterfs_fuse

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(8) suite.

       GlusterFS (http://www.gluster.org) is an Open Source clustered file system capable of scaling to several peta-bytes. With its FUSE based native client, GlusterFS is available as a POSIX compliant
       file system and can hence be shared by Samba without additional steps.

       The vfs_glusterfs_fuse VFS module provides an enhanced way to access a Gluster filesystem using a Gluster FUSE mount. It provides support for the get_real_filename VFS call which enhances file
       access performance by avoiding multiple expensive case folding lookup calls to detect the appropriate case of an existing filename.

       Furthermore, this module implements a substitute file-id mechanism. The default file-id mechanism is not working correctly for gluster fuse mount re-exports, so in order to avoid data loss, users
       exporting gluster fuse mounts with Samba should enable this module.

       This module can be combined with other modules, but it should be the last module in the vfs objects list. Modules added to this list to the right of the glusterfs entry may not have any effect at
       all.

CONFIGURATION
       A basic configuration looks like this.

                     [share]
                     vfs objects = glusterfs_fuse
                     path = /absolute/path_of_fusemount

       Note that vfs_glusterfs_fuse requires a Gluster mount. For accessing glusterfs directly over the GFAPI library please use the vfs_glusterfs module.

OPTIONS
       This module does currently have no further options.
