NAME
       slogencrypt - Encrypt existing plain text log files using the syslog-ng secure logging environment

SYNOPSIS
       slogencrypt [options] [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       The slogencrypt is used to encrypt plain text log file using an existing secure logging environment. Using this utility, log files obtained from a previous installation of syslog-ng or another logging
       system can be transferred to a secure logging environment. The order of the log entries is preserved. Encrypting plain text log files using an existing secure logging environment, requires the current
       encryption key to be supplied in order to preserve consistency.

       General call sequence: slogencrypt -k <key file> -m <MAC file> <new key file> <new MAC file> <plain text log> <output file> [counter]

ARGUMENTS
       new key file
           The file that will contain the new current encryption key after successful encryption.

       new MAC file
           The file receiving the new current message authentication code (MAC) of the secure encrypted destination after encryption. In case an existing file is supplied, new entries will be appended.

       input log file
           The plain text log file that will be encrypted using the secure logging environment.

       output log file
           The file that will contain the encrypted log entries from the supplied plain text log file after encryption.

       counter
           The current log entry counter of the secure encrypted destination after encryption. This is required if the log entries to be encrypted will be appended to an existing secure encrypted
           destination.

OPTIONS
       --key-file or -k
           The current host key from the system where the encryption will be performed.

       --mac-file or -m
           The current MAC file from the system where the encryption will be performed.

       --help or -h
           Display a help message.
