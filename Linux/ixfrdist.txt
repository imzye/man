IXFRDIST(1)              PowerDNS Authoritative Server             IXFRDIST(1)

NAME
       ixfrdist - An IXFR/AXFR-only server that re-distributes zones

SYNOPSIS
       ixfrdist [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       ixfrdist  transfers  zones  from  an authoritative server and re-serves
       these zones over AXFR and IXFR.  It checks the SOA serial for all  con‐
       figured domains and downloads new versions to disk.

       When  a  SOA  query comes in and the client's address is allowed by the
       ACL, ixfrdist responds with the latest SOA for the zone it  has.   This
       query can be followed up with an IXFR or AXFR query, which will then be
       served to the client.  Should an IXFR be served, ixfrdist will condense
       all differences it has for the domain into one IXFR.

       ixfrdist  is  configured  with  a  configuration  file  in YAML format.
       Please see ixfrdist.yml(5) for information.
