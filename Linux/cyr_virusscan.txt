CYR_VIRUSSCAN(8)                  Cyrus IMAP                  CYR_VIRUSSCAN(8)

NAME
       cyr_virusscan - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Scan for viruses using configured virus scanner or manage infected mes‐
       sages using search criteria.

SYNOPSIS
       cyr_virusscan [ -C config-file ] [ -s imap-search-string ] [ -r [ -n] ] [-v] [ mboxpattern1 ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       cyr_virusscan can be used to invoke an  external  virus  scanner  (cur‐
       rently  only  ClamAV is supported) to scan specified IMAP mailboxes. If
       no mboxpattern is given, cyr_virusscan works on all mailboxes.

       Alternately, with the -s option, the IMAP SEARCH string will be used as
       a  specification of messages which are assumed to be infected, and will
       be treated as such.  The virus scanner is not invoked. Useful  for  re‐
       moving messages without a distinct signature, such as Phish.

       A table of infected messages will be output.

       To remove infected messages, use the -r flag. Infected messages will be
       expunged from the user's mailbox.

       With the notify flag, -n, notifications will be appended to  the  inbox
       of the mailbox owner, containing message digest information for the af‐
       fected mail.  This flag only works in combination with -r.  The notifi‐
       cation   message  can  by  customised  by  template,  for  details  see
       Notifications below.

       cyr_virusscan can be configured to  run  periodically  by  cron(8)  via
       crontab(5) or your preferred method (i.e. /etc/cron.hourly), or by mas‐
       ter(8) via the EVENTS{} section in cyrus.conf(5).

       cyr_virusscan reads its configuration options out of the  imapd.conf(5)
       file unless specified otherwise by -C.

       Note  that Cyrus does not ship with any virus scanners: you need to in‐
       stall one separately to make use of it with Cyrus.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -n     Notify  mailbox  owner of deleted messages via email.  This flag
              is only operable in combination with -r.

       -r     Remove infected messages.

       -s imap-search-string
              Rather than scanning for viruses, messages matching  the  search
              criteria will be treated as infected.

       -v     Produce more verbose output

NOTIFICATIONS
       When  the -n flag is provided, notifications are sent to mailbox owners
       when infected messages are  removed.   One  notification  is  sent  per
       owner, containing a digest of each message that was deleted from any of
       their mailboxes.

       The default notification subject is "Automatically deleted mail", which
       can   be   overridden   by  setting  virusscan_notification_subject  in
       imapd.conf(5) to a UTF-8 value.

       Each infected message will be described according to the following tem‐
       plate:

       The following message was deleted from mailbox '%MAILBOX%'
       because it was infected with virus '%VIRUS%'

           Message-ID: %MSG_ID%
           Date: %MSG_DATE%
           From: %MSG_FROM%
           Subject: %MSG_SUBJECT%
           IMAP UID: %MSG_UID%

       To  use  a custom template, create a UTF-8 file containing your desired
       text and using the same %-delimited substitutions as above, and set the
       virusscan_notification_template option in imapd.conf(5) to its path.

       The  notification message will be properly MIME-encoded at delivery. Do
       not pre-encode the template file or the subject!

       When cyr_virusscan starts up,  if  notifications  have  been  requested
       (with  the  -n flag), a basic sanity check of the template will be per‐
       formed prior to initialising the antivirus engine.  If it appears  that
       the  resultant  notifications  would  be undeliverable for some reason,
       cyr_virusscan will exit immediately with an  error,  rather  than  risk
       deleting messages without notifying.

EXAMPLES
       cyr_virusscan
          Scan  all  mailboxes,  printing report on the screen.  Do not remove
          infected messages.

       cyr_virusscan -r -n user/bovik
          Scan mailbox user/bovik, removing infected messages and append noti‐
          fications to Bovik's inbox.

       cyr_virusscan -r -n -s 'SUBJECT "Fedex"' user/bovik
          Search  mailbox user/bovik for messages which have Fedex in the sub‐
          ject line, removing them all, and appending notifications to Bovik's
          inbox.
