NAME
       butteraugli - measuring perceived differences between images

SYNOPSYS
       butteraugli {image1.(png|jpg|jpeg)} {image2.(png|jpg|jpeg)} [heatmap.ppm]

DESCRIPTION
       Butteraugli is a project that estimates the psychovisual similarity of two images. It gives a score for the images that is reliable in the domain of barely noticeable differences. Butteraugli not
       only gives a scalar score, but also computes a spatial map of the level of differences.

       One of the main motivations for this project is the statistical differences in location and density of different color receptors, particularly the low density of blue cones in the fovea. Another
       motivation comes from more accurate modeling of ganglion cells, particularly the frequency space inhibition.
