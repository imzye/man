NAME
       ur - command-line interface to UR

DESCRIPTION
       The ur command is the entry point for a suite of tools to create and manage a module tree of UR classes, data sources, and views.

       It also includes launchers for some built-in services.

SUB-COMMANDS
       See the help on specific sub-commands for details.

        init      NAMESPACE [DB]      initialize a new UR app in one command
        define    ...                 define namespaces, data sources and classes
        describe  CLASSES-OR-MODULES  show class properties, relationships, meta-data
        update    ...                 update parts of the source tree of a UR namespace
        list      ...                 list objects, classes, modules
        sys       ...                 service launchers
        test      ...                 tools for testing and debugging

DEVELOPMENT
   PWD
       Running this WITHIN the source tree of a UR namespace will automatically "use lib" your tree.

       A message will appear to STDERR when this occurs.  See the <above> module for context-sensitive library usage info.

   MAC SOFTWARE MODULE API
       Looking for the docs on UR.pm on a Mac?

       Try "perldoc UR.pm" or "man UR".  On some systems (Mac), perldoc will show this page for both "perldoc ur" and also "perldoc UR" due to filesystem case insensitivity.
