NAME
       Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Clustalw - Object for the calculation of a multiple sequence alignment from a set of unaligned sequences or alignments using the Clustalw program

VERSION
       version 1.7.4

SYNOPSIS
         #  Build a clustalw alignment factory
         @params = ('ktuple' => 2, 'matrix' => 'BLOSUM');
         $factory = Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Clustalw->new(@params);

         #  Pass the factory a list of sequences to be aligned.
         $inputfilename = 't/data/cysprot.fa';
         $aln = $factory->align($inputfilename); # $aln is a SimpleAlign object.
         # or
         $seq_array_ref = \@seq_array;
         # where @seq_array is an array of Bio::Seq objects
         $aln = $factory->align($seq_array_ref);

         # Or one can pass the factory a pair of (sub)alignments
         #to be aligned against each other, e.g.:
         $aln = $factory->profile_align($aln1,$aln2);
         # where $aln1 and $aln2 are Bio::SimpleAlign objects.

         # Or one can pass the factory an alignment and one or more unaligned
         # sequences to be added to the alignment. For example:
         $aln = $factory->profile_align($aln1,$seq); # $seq is a Bio::Seq object.

         # Get a tree of the sequences
         $tree = $factory->tree(\@seq_array);

         # Get both an alignment and a tree
         ($aln, $tree) = $factory->run(\@seq_array);

         # Do a footprinting analysis on the supplied sequences, getting back the
         # most conserved sub-alignments
         my @results = $factory->footprint(\@seq_array);
         foreach my $result (@results) {
           print $result->consensus_string, "\n";
         }

         # There are various additional options and input formats available.
         # See the DESCRIPTION section that follows for additional details.

DESCRIPTION
       Note: this DESCRIPTION only documents the Bioperl interface to Clustalw.  Clustalw, itself, is a large & complex program - for more information regarding clustalw, please see the clustalw
       documentation which accompanies the clustalw distribution. Clustalw is available from (among others) ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/. Clustalw.pm has only been tested using version 1.8 of
       clustalw.  Compatibility with earlier versions of the clustalw program is currently unknown. Before running Clustalw successfully it will be necessary: to install clustalw on your system, and to
       ensure that users have execute privileges for the clustalw program.

   Helping the module find your executable
       You will need to enable Clustalw to find the clustalw program. This can be done in (at least) three ways:

        1. Make sure the clustalw executable is in your path so that
           which clustalw
           returns a clustalw executable on your system.

        2. Define an environmental variable CLUSTALDIR which is a
           directory which contains the 'clustalw' application:
           In bash:

           export CLUSTALDIR=/home/username/clustalw1.8

           In csh/tcsh:

           setenv CLUSTALDIR /home/username/clustalw1.8

        3. Include a definition of an environmental variable CLUSTALDIR in
           every script that will use this Clustalw wrapper module, e.g.:

           BEGIN { $ENV{CLUSTALDIR} = '/home/username/clustalw1.8/' }
           use Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Clustalw;

       If you are running an application on a webserver make sure the webserver environment has the proper PATH set or use the options 2 or 3 to set the variables.

   How it works
       Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Clustalw is an object for performing a multiple sequence alignment from a set of unaligned sequences and/or sub-alignments by means of the clustalw program.

       Initially, a clustalw "factory object" is created. Optionally, the factory may be passed most of the parameters or switches of the clustalw program, e.g.:

         @params = ('ktuple' => 2, 'matrix' => 'BLOSUM');
         $factory = Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Clustalw->new(@params);

       Any parameters not explicitly set will remain as the defaults of the clustalw program.  Additional parameters and switches (not available in clustalw) may also be set.  Currently, the only such
       parameter is "quiet", which when set to a non-zero value, suppresses clustalw terminal output. Not all clustalw parameters are supported at this stage.

       By default, Clustalw output is returned solely in a the form of a Bio::SimpleAlign object which can then be printed and/or saved in multiple formats using the AlignIO.pm module. Optionally the raw
       clustalw output file can be saved if the calling script specifies an output file (with the clustalw parameter OUTFILE).  Currently only the GCG-MSF output file formats is supported.

       Not all parameters and features have been implemented yet in Perl format.

       Alignment parameters can be changed and/or examined at any time after the factory has been created.  The program checks that any parameter/switch being set/read is valid.  However, currently no
       additional checks are included to check that parameters are of the proper type (eg string or numeric) or that their values are within the proper range.  As an example, to change the value of the
       clustalw parameter ktuple to 3 and subsequently to check its value one would write:

         $ktuple = 3;
         $factory->ktuple($ktuple);
         $get_ktuple = $factory->ktuple();

       Once the factory has been created and the appropriate parameters set, one can call the method align() to align a set of unaligned sequences, or call profile_align() to add one or more sequences or
       a second alignment to an initial alignment.

       Input to align() may consist of a set of unaligned sequences in the form of the name of file containing the sequences. For example,

         $inputfilename = 't/data/cysprot.fa';
         $aln = $factory-E<gt>align($inputfilename);

       Alternately one can create an array of Bio::Seq objects somehow

         $str = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file=> 't/data/cysprot.fa', -format => 'Fasta');
         @seq_array =();
         while ( my $seq = $str->next_seq() ) {push (@seq_array, $seq) ;}

       and pass the factory a reference to that array

         $seq_array_ref = \@seq_array;
         $aln = $factory->align($seq_array_ref);

       In either case, align() returns a reference to a SimpleAlign object which can then used (see Bio::SimpleAlign).

       Once an initial alignment exists, one can pass the factory additional sequence(s) to be added (ie aligned) to the original alignment.  The alignment can be passed as either an alignment file or a
       Bio:SimpleAlign object.  The unaligned sequence(s) can be passed as a filename or as an array of BioPerl sequence objects or as a single BioPerl Seq object.  For example (to add a single sequence
       to an alignment),

         $str = Bio::AlignIO->new(-file=> 't/data/cysprot1a.msf');
         $aln = $str->next_aln();
         $str1 = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file=> 't/data/cysprot1b.fa');
         $seq = $str1->next_seq();
         $aln = $factory->profile_align($aln,$seq);

       In either case, profile_align() returns a reference to a SimpleAlign object containing a new SimpleAlign object of the alignment with the additional sequence(s) added in.

       Finally one can pass the factory a pair of (sub)alignments to be aligned against each other.  The alignments can be passed in the form of either a pair of alignment files or a pair of
       Bio:SimpleAlign objects. For example,

         $profile1 = 't/data/cysprot1a.msf';
         $profile2 = 't/data/cysprot1b.msf';
         $aln = $factory->profile_align($profile1,$profile2);

       or

         $str1 = Bio::AlignIO->new(-file=> 't/data/cysprot1a.msf');
         $aln1 = $str1->next_aln();
         $str2 = Bio::AlignIO->new(-file=> 't/data/cysprot1b.msf');
         $aln2 = $str2->next_aln();
         $aln = $factory->profile_align($aln1,$aln2);

       In either case, profile_align() returns a reference to a SimpleAlign object containing an (super)alignment of the two input alignments.

       For more examples of syntax and use of Clustalw, the user is encouraged to look at the script Clustalw.t in the t/ directory.

       Note: Clustalw is still under development. Various features of the clustalw program have not yet been implemented.  If you would like that a specific clustalw feature be added to this perl contact
       bioperl-l@bioperl.org.

       These can be specified as parameters when instantiating a new Clustalw object, or through get/set methods of the same name (lowercase).

EXAMPLE
       You will need to have installed clustalw and to ensure that Clustalw.pm can find it.  This can be done in different ways (bash syntax):

         export PATH=$PATH:/home/peter/clustalw1.8

       or define an environmental variable CLUSTALDIR:

         export CLUSTALDIR=/home/peter/clustalw1.8

       or include a definition of an environmental variable CLUSTALDIR in every script that will use Clustal.pm:

         BEGIN {$ENV{CLUSTALDIR} = '/home/peter/clustalw1.8/'; }

       We are going to demonstrate 3 possible applications of Clustalw.pm:

       1.  Test effect of varying clustalw alignment parameter(s) on resulting alignment

       2.  Test effect of changing the order that sequences are added to the alignment on the resulting alignment

       3.  Test effect of incorporating an "anchor point" in the alignment process

       Before we can do any tests, we need to set up the environment, create the factory and read in the unaligned sequences.

                                all tests (ie default = '123')
          -param <str>   :  Parameter to be varied in example 1. Any clustalw parameter
                            which takes inteer values can be varied (default = 'ktuple')
          -start <int>   :  Initial value for varying parameter in example 1 (default = 1)
          -stop <int>    :  Final value for varying parameter (default = 3)
          -regex   <str> :  Regular expression for 'anchoring' alignment in example 3
                            (default = $regex)
          -ext <int>     :  Distance regexp anchor should be extended in each direction
                            for local alignment in example 3   (default = 30)

         In addition, any valid Clustalw parameter can be set using the syntax
         "parameter=>value" as in "ktuple=>3"

         So a typical command lines might be:
          > clustalw.pl -param=pairgap -start=2 -stop=3 -do=1 "ktuple=>3"
         or
          > clustalw.pl -ext=10 -regex='W[AST]F' -do=23 -in='t/cysprot1a.fa'

PARAMETER FOR ALIGNMENT COMPUTATION
   KTUPLE
        Title       : KTUPLE
        Description : (optional) set the word size to be used in the alignment
                      This is the size of exactly matching fragment that is used.
                      INCREASE for speed (max= 2 for proteins; 4 for DNA),
                      DECREASE for sensitivity.
                      For longer sequences (e.g. >1000 residues) you may
                      need to increase the default

   TOPDIAGS
        Title       : TOPDIAGS
        Description : (optional) number of best diagonals to use
                      The number of k-tuple matches on each diagonal
                      (in an imaginary dot-matrix plot) is calculated.
                      Only the best ones (with most matches) are used in
                      the alignment.  This parameter specifies how many.
                      Decrease for speed; increase for sensitivity.

   WINDOW
        Title       : WINDOW
        Description : (optional) window size
                      This is the number of diagonals around each of the 'best'
                      diagonals that will be used.  Decrease for speed;
                      increase for sensitivity.

   PAIRGAP
        Title       : PAIRGAP
        Description : (optional) gap penalty for pairwise alignments
                      This is a penalty for each gap in the fast alignments.
                      It has little affect on the speed or sensitivity except
                      for extreme values.

   FIXEDGAP
        Title       : FIXEDGAP
        Description : (optional) fixed length gap penalty

   FLOATGAP
        Title       : FLOATGAP
        Description : (optional) variable length gap penalty

   MATRIX
        Title       : MATRIX
        Default     : PAM100 for DNA - PAM250 for protein alignment
        Description : (optional) substitution matrix used in the multiple
                      alignments. Depends on the version of clustalw as to
                      what default matrix will be used

                      PROTEIN WEIGHT MATRIX leads to a new menu where you are
                      offered a choice of weight matrices. The default for
                      proteins in version 1.8 is the PAM series derived by
                      Gonnet and colleagues. Note, a series is used! The
                      actual matrix that is used depends on how similar the
                      sequences to be aligned at this alignment step
                      are. Different matrices work differently at each
                      evolutionary distance.

                      DNA WEIGHT MATRIX leads to a new menu where a single
                      matrix (not a series) can be selected. The default is
                      the matrix used by BESTFIT for comparison of nucleic
                      acid sequences.

   TYPE
        Title       : TYPE
        Description : (optional) sequence type: protein or DNA. This allows
                       you to explicitly override the programs attempt at
                       guessing the type of the sequence.  It is only useful
                       if you are using sequences with a VERY strange
                       composition.

   OUTPUT
        Title       : OUTPUT
        Description : (optional) clustalw supports GCG or PHYLIP or PIR or
                       Clustal format.  See the Bio::AlignIO modules for
                       which formats are supported by bioperl.

   OUTFILE
        Title       : OUTFILE
        Description : (optional) Name of clustalw output file. If not set
                       module will erase output file.  In any case alignment will
                       be returned in the form of SimpleAlign objects

   TRANSMIT
        Title       : TRANSMIT
        Description : (optional) transitions not weighted.  The default is to
                       weight transitions as more favourable than other
                       mismatches in DNA alignments.  This switch makes all
                       nucleotide mismatches equally weighted.
