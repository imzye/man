NAME
       Method::Autoload - Autoloads methods from a list of packages into the current package

SYNOPSIS
         package MyPackage;
         use base qw{Method::Autoload}

DESCRIPTION
       The Method::Autoload base class package is used to autoload methods from a list of packages where you may not know what methods are available until run time.  A good use of this package is
       programming support for user contributed packages or user contributed plugins.

USAGE
         use MyPackage;
         my $object=MyPackage->new(%hash);    #provides new and initialize methods
         $object->pushPackages("My::Bar");    #appends to "packages" array
         $object->unshiftPackages("My::Foo"); #prepends to "packages" array

         use MyPackage;
         my $object=MyPackage->new(packages=>["My::Foo", "My::Bar"]);
         $object->foo; #from My::Foo
         $object->bar; #from My::Bar

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
         my $object=MyPackage->new(%hash);
         my $object=MyPackage->new(package=>["My::Package1", "My::Package2"]);

   initialize
METHODS PUBLIC
   packages
       Returns the current list of packages in the "packages" array.

         my @package=$object->packages; #()
         my $package=$object->packages; #[]

   pushPackages
       Pushes packages on to the "packages" array.

         $object->pushPackages("My::Bar");
         $object->pushPackages(@packages);

   unshiftPackages
       Unshifts packages on to the "packages" array.  Use this if you want to override a "default" package.  Please use with care.

         $object->unshiftPackages("My::Foo");
         $object->unshiftPackages(@packages);

   autoloaded
       Returns a hash of autoloaded methods and the classes that they came from.

         my %hash=$object->autoloaded; #()
         my $hash=$object->autoloaded; #{}

METHODS PRIVATE
   DESTROY ("Global" method)
       We define DESTROY in this package so that it does not call AUTOLOAD but you may overload this method in your package, if you need it.

   AUTOLOAD ("Global" method)
       AUTOLOAD is a "global" method.  Please review the limitations on inheriting this method.

   autoload
         my $subref=$object->autoload($class, $method);
