NAME
       signaltest - signal roundtrip test software

SYNOPSIS
       signaltest  [ -a|--affinity NUM] [ -b|--backtrace USEC ] [-D|--duration TIME] [-h|--help] [--json FILENAME] [-l|--loops LOOPS ] [-p|--prio PRIO] [-q|--quiet] [-S|--smp] [-t|--threads NUM] [-m|--mlock‐
       all ] [-v|--verbose ]

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ('--').

       -a, --affinity[=PROC-SET]
              Run threads on the set of processors given by PROC-SET.  If PROC-SET is not specified, all processors will be used.  Threads will be assigned to processors in the set in  numeric  order,  in  a
              round-robin fashion.
              The  set  of  processors  can  be  specified  as A,B,C, or A-C, or A-B,D-F, and so on*.  The ! character can be used to negate a set.  For example, !B-D means to use all available CPUs except B
              through D.  The cpu numbers are the same as shown in the processor field in /proc/cpuinfo.  See numa(3) for more information on specifying CPU sets.  * Support for  CPU  sets  requires  libnuma
              version >= 2.  For libnuma v1, PROC-SET, if specified, must be a single CPU number.

       -b, --breaktrace=USEC
              Send break trace command when latency > USEC

       -D, --duration=TIME
              Specify a length for the test run.
              Append 'm', 'h', or 'd' to specify minutes, hours or days.

       --help
              display usage information

       --json=FILENAME
              Write final results into FILENAME, JSON formatted.

       -l, --loops=LOOPS
              Number of loops: default=0 (endless)

       -p, --priority=PRIO
              Priority of highest priority thread

       -q, --quiet
              print a summary only on exit

       -S, --smp
              Set options for standard testing on SMP systems. Equivalent to using the options: "-t -a" as well keeping any specified priority equal across all threads

       -t, --threads=NUM
              number of threads: default=2

       -m, --mlockall
              lock current and future memory allocations

       -v, --verbose
              output values on stdout for statistics
              format: n:c:v n=tasknum c=count v=value in us
