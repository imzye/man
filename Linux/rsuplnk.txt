RSUPLNK(8)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                RSUPLNK(8)

NAME
       rsuplnk - User entry into the ROSE network.

SYNOPSIS
       rsuplnk [-q] <port>

DESCRIPTION
       The  rsuplnk  program allows a user to gain entry into the ROSE network
       using the standard pseudo-digipeating method. Recent Linux kernels  are
       aware  of  this  form of operation and the ax25d program can listen for
       such connections. The normal mode of operation of a ROSE switch  is  to
       have  one  ROSE  address  (ie port) per physical AX.25 port.  Therefore
       ROSE users coming in on a given AX.25 port will appear as if they  come
       from  the  associated  ROSE port. This is the reason for the need for a
       ROSE port as an argument.

       To use rsuplnk you need an entry in ax25d.conf to listen  for  incoming
       connections. In the example below, I will be listening for ROSE connec‐
       tions on my AX.25 port 144 using the callsign KE4GAJ-10  and  the  ROSE
       port associated with the AX.25 port is rs144.

       #
       [KE4GAJ-10* VIA 144]
       NOCALL  * * * * * * L
       default * * * * * * - root /usr/sbin/rsuplnk rsuplnk rs144
       #

       There  would  typically  be one rsuplnk per user access AX.25 port. The
       associated program for exiting a ROSE network is rsdwnlnk.

       All errors generated by rsuplnk are written to  the  system  debug  log
       file.

OPTIONS
       -q      Supresses  the  messages  generated  by rsuplnk when making the
               connection.

FILES
       /etc/ax25/rsports
