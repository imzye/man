SYNOPSIS
       e_axfilter [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       e_axfilter 2.6-DEBUG "Floral Guranse"

       This  program  applies  SinE-like goal-directed filters to a problem specification (a set of clauses and/or formulas) to generate reduced problem specifications that are easier to handle for a theorem
       prover, but still are likely to contain all the axioms necessary for a proof (if one exists).

       In default mode, the program reads a problem specification and an (optional) filter specification, and produces one reduced output file for each filter given. Note that while all standard  input  for‐
       mats  (LOP,  TPTP-2  and TPTP-3 are supported, output is only and automatically in TPTP-3. Also note that unlike most of the other tools in the E distribution, this program does not support pipe-based
       input and output, since it uses file names generated from the input file name and filter names to store the different result files

OPTIONS
       -h

       --help

              Print a short description of program usage and options.

       -V

       --version

              Print the version number of the prover. Please include this with all bug reports (if any).

       -v

       --verbose[=<arg>]

              Verbose comments on the progress of the program. This technical information is printed to stderr. The short form or the long form without the optional argument is equivalent to --verbose=1.

       -o <arg>

       --output-file=<arg>

              Redirect output into the named file (this affects only some output, as most is written to automatically generated files based on the input and filter names.

       -s

       --silent

              Equivalent to --output-level=0.

       -l <arg>

       --output-level=<arg>

              Select an output level, greater values imply more verbose output.

       -f <arg>

       --filter=<arg>

              Specify the filter definition file. If not set, the system will uses the built-in default.

       -S

       --seed-symbols[=<arg>]

              Enable artificial seeding of the axiom selection process and determine which symbol classes should be used to generate different sets.The argument is a string of letters,  each  indicating  one
              class  of  symbols to use. 'p' indicates predicate symbols, 'f' non-constant function symbols, and 'c' constants. Note that this will create potentially multiple output files for each activated
              symbols. The short form or the long form without the optional argument is equivalent to --seed-symbols=p.

       --seed-subsample[=<arg>]

              Subsample from the set of eligible seed symbols. The argument is a one-character designator for the method ('m' uses the symbols that occur in the most input formulas, 'l' uses the symbols that
              occur in the least number of formulas, and 'r' samples randomly), followed by the number of symbols to select. The option without the optional argument is equivalent to --seed-subsample=r1000.

       -m

       --seed-method[=<arg>]

              Specify  how  to select seed axioms when artificially seeding is used.The argument is a string of letters, each indicating one method to use. The letters are: 'l': use the syntactically largest
              axiom in which the seed symbol occurs.  'd': use the most diverse axiom in which the seed symbol occurs, i.e. the symbol with the largest set of different symbols.  'a': use all axioms in which
              the  seed symbol occurs.  For 'l' and 'd', if there are multiple candidates, use the first one.If the option is not set, 'a' is assumed. The short form or the long form without the optional ar‐
              gument is equivalent to --seed-method=lda.

       -d

       --dump-filter

              Print the filter definition in force.

       --lop-in

              Set E-LOP as the input format. If no input format is selected by this or one of the following options, E will guess the input format based on the first token. It will  almost  always  correctly
              recognize TPTP-3, but it may misidentify E-LOP files that use TPTP meta-identifiers as logical symbols.

       --lop-format

              Equivalent to --lop-in.

       --tptp-in

              Parse TPTP-2 format instead of E-LOP (but note that includes are handled according to TPTP-3 semantics).

       --tptp-format

              Equivalent to --tptp-in.

       --tptp2-in

              Synonymous with --tptp-in.

       --tptp2-format

              Synonymous with --tptp-in.

       --tstp-in

              Parse  TPTP-3  format  instead of E-LOP (Note that TPTP-3 syntax is still under development, and the version in E may not be fully conforming at all times. E works on all TPTP 6.3.0 FOF and CNF
              input files (including includes).

       --tstp-format

              Equivalent to --tstp-in.

       --tptp3-in

              Synonymous with --tstp-in.

       --tptp3-format

              Synonymous with --tstp-in.
