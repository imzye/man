PRAYER.CF(5)                                                           BSD File Formats Manual                                                          PRAYER.CF(5)

NAME
     prayer.cf — main Prayer configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     prayer.cf is the configuration file of prayer(8) and prayer-session(8).

SYNTAX
     For the most part, prayer.cf consists of option = value pairs, but some configuration items are more complex. All values may be enclosed in double quotes,
     which are stripped. Quotes must be used if a value contains a ‘#’ character. Otherwise, everything following it is treated as a comment.  Any line can be
     folded using a ‘\’ character at the end of the line; any linear white space at the beginning of the next line is removed.

     Simple options can be of the following types:

     string  No particular restrictions.

     path    A file or directory name. The configuration parser expands occurences of a few macros in settings of this type. See prefix and var_prefix below.

     boolean
             The following forms are interpreted as true: ‘true’, ‘t’, and ‘1’.  The following forms are interpreted as false: ‘false’, ‘nil’, ‘0’.  Capitalisation
             does not matter.

     number  An integer number (sequence of digits 0-9), optionally immediately followed by a single letter ‘K’, causing the number to be multiplied by 1024, or ‘M’
             multiplying it by 1024 · 1024.

     time    An integer number (sequence of digits 0-9) of seconds, optionally immediately followed by a single case-insignificant letter ‘s’, which has no effect,
             ‘m’, causing the number to be multiplied by 60, ‘h’, multiplying it by 60 · 60, or ‘d’, for a multiple of 24 · 60 · 60.

     perm    A file permission mode; an octal number of exactly four digits, where the first digit must be 0.

OPTIONS
     prefix (string), var_prefix (string)
             The values of these options can be referred to as $prefix (or ${prefix}), and $var_prefix (or ${var_prefix}), respectively, in settings of type path in
             the rest of the file.

             Default: none. Need to be set only if referenced later.

     prayer_user (string), prayer_uid (number)
             User name or ID to setuid(2) to if started as root. Either, but not both, must be set and must not specify uid 0.  Default: none.

     prayer_group (string), prayer_gid (number)
             Group name or ID to setgid(2) to if we start off as root. In addition, prayer calls initgroups(3) if prayer_user is set.  Default: none.

     prayer_background (boolean)
             Run prayer as background process. If true, prayer will return as soon as valid configuration is found.  Default: true

     file_perms (perm)
             Create mode for new files.  Default: 0640 if prayer_uid or prayer_user is set, otherwise 0644.

     directory_perms (perm)
             Create mode for new directories.  Default: 0750 if prayer_uid or prayer_user is set, otherwise 0755.

     check_directory_perms (boolean)
             Check existing directories under ${var_prefix}?

   Mail server settings
     imapd_server (string)
             Specifies the default IMAP server(s) using libc-client syntax:

                   host[:port][/flag[/flag]...]

             Multiple server specifications can be listed, separated by commas. Common flags are:
             /ssl    Use SSL-on-connect (on port 993 by default).
             /tls    Force use of TLS (using STARTTLS on the normal IMAP port) to encrypt the session. Recommended if the server is remote, since otherwise a down‐
                     grade attack is possible.
             /notls  Don't issue STARTTLS even if the server supports it. Recommended if the server is localhost.
             /novalidate-cert
                     Don't check the integrity of the server certificate.
             For the full list of flags, see naming.txt.gz in the current libc-client package.

     imapd_user_map (path)
             CDB lookup map overriding default imapd_server location. For information on CDB, see
             •   http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html
             •   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_Data_Base

     prefs_folder_name (string)
             Name of Prayer user preferences folder on IMAP server.

     use_namespace (boolean)
             Use IMAP NAMESPACE command to find personal_hierarchy and hiersep.  Default: true.

     personal_hierarchy (string)
             If not supplied by NAMESPACE.  Default: "".

     hiersep (string)
             If not supplied by NAMESPACE.  Default: "/".

     dualuse (boolean)
             Hint to Prayer that new mailboxes are dual use (i.e. can contain both mail and inferior mailboxes). Things will mostly work if dualuse set to false on
             a server which supports it, but people will be unable to create children of newly created mailboxes without refreshing the view.

             Default: false.

     sieved_server (string)
             Talk to Cyrus timsieved using MANAGESIEVE protocol. Syntax is similar to imapd_server, except the only recognised flag is /ssl.

     sieved_user_map (path)
             Can be used to provide individualised imapd_server settings in the form of a CDB file.

     sieved_timeout (time)
             Default timsieved timeout is 10 minutes

   Mail domain configuration
     local_domain
             Define a valid local domain, and optionally the valid local parts in that domain.  This is a special directive that can appear multiple times and does
             not use an equals sign:

             local_domain domain [map]

             Without map, local_domain simply defines a domain which will appear on the list visible to user preferences. With map, it also defines a list a CDB map
             file which defines valid entries in that domain; used for personal name expansion and checking for valid addresses: The keys are the valid local parts
             and the values are the corresponding full names of the users.

             Default: A single entry which corresponds to default_domain.

     return_path_domain (string)
             Domain used in the return address given to sendmail(8).  Default: the default domain.

     filter_domain_pattern (string)
             A filter pattern which is equivalent to, or at least approximates the list of local domains.  Default: the default domain.

     hostname (string)
             Hostname is the canonical name for this particular system, used in session and icon URLs which are generated by Prayer. This is derived automatically
             using gethostname(2) and gethostbyname(3) if no value is provided. However, there are situations, especially involving SSL certificates, where the de‐
             fault hostname may not be appropriate. The special value ‘__UNDEFINED__’ here means the startup script or command line must provide a hostname using a
             --config-option override or via the environment variable PRAYER_HOSTNAME.  This is just a safeguard for systems which use DNS round robining to dis‐
             tribute load across a number of machines.

     hostname_service (string)
             Host name common for all Prayer installations part of the same webmail service. (Only) useful for large installations using DNS round robin for load
             balancing (example: webmail.hermes.cam.ac.uk is an alias for webmail[123].hermes.cam.ac.uk). This setting is used for two things: The user is redi‐
             rected to this hostname after logging out, and HTTP requests are sanity checked against it in addition to the canonical hostname.

             Default: none

     fix_from_address (boolean)
             suppresses the From address option from the Preferences and Roles screens.  Default: false.

     lookup_rpasswd (path)
             Path to a CDB file that maps arbitrary search keys to colon- or comma-separated lists of user names.  Note: Keys must be lowercase; Prayer converts
             search strings to lowercase in order to provide case-insensitive lookup.

     lookup_rusername (path)
             Path to a second CDB file that maps arbitrary search keys to colon- or comma-separated lists of user names.

             If the user enters a valid and existing username according to getpwnam(3), Prayer does not search these first two CDB files, but skips directly to the
             second stage of looking up user information.

     lookup_username (path)
             Path to a CDB file that maps usernames to records consisting of the user's “registered name” and his/her affiliation (department), separated by a ver‐
             tical bar (‘|’).  Additionally, if a second vertical bar follows, the account is regarded as cancelled.

             When presenting the search results, the usernames found are combined with the default_domain to form email addresses. It is not possible at this time
             to let users search for addresses in more than one domain using this facility.

     lookup_fullname (path)
             Path to a CDB file that maps usernames to “display names”, possibly provided by the users themselves in some way. The display name of a user is used
             together with the email address in recipient fields

             Note that all four lookup options must be set to valid CDB files for the local lookup to work, but more than one option may conceivably point to the
             same file.

     ldap_server (string)
             Name or address of LDAP server.

     ldap_base_dn (string)
             Base DN to search. After binding anonymously, Prayer performs a one-level-scope search for entries with surname or mail attributes containing the
             search string. The following attributes are fetched and presented:
             •   uid
             •   displayName
             •   cn (“registered name”)
             •   ou (“affiliation”)
             •   mail
             •   telephoneNumber

     ldap_timeout (time)
             Search timeout.  Default: 30s.

   HTTP and other frontend settings
     use_http_port, use_https_port
             Define a single HTTP[S] port to bind to.  You can define an arbitary list of ports of both kinds by using a series of separate use_http_port and
             use_https_port directives, with one port on each line. Syntax:

                   use_http_port [interface:]port
                   use_https_port [interface:]port

             interface can be an IP (v4 or v6) address or a hostname. If provided, it is passed to getaddrinfo(3) for resolution, and the first resulting address is
             used to bind to. Otherwise, prayer(8) binds to port on all interfaces.

     ssl_default_port (number)
             Prayer will put a warning on the login page for HTTP connections if both HTTP and HTTPS sessions are available. This will provide a link to the SSL
             version of the service, defaulting to port 443 or failing that the first defined HTTPS port. ssl_default_port overrides the built in logic.

             Should be rarely required now that Prayer automatically derives an appropriate port if none is provided here.

     ssl_cert_file (path)
             Locatation of SSL certificate file (only used if SSL ports defined).  Required if we are going to provide SSL services.

     ssl_privatekey_file (path)
             Location of SSL private key file (only used if SSL ports defined).  Required if we are going to provide SSL services.

     ssl_rsakey_lifespan (time)
             Master server will regenerate shared RSA key at this interval.  Default: 15m.

     ssl_rsakey_freshen (time)
             RSA key remains fresh in child process for this long after first actual use.  Default: 15m.

     ssl_session_timeout (time)
             SSL session cache TTL.  Default: 0 (SSL session cache not used). prayer-ssl-prune(8) should be run periodically to purge any stale session data from
             the DBD database.

     egd_socket (path)
             Path to entropy gathering daemon socket. If provided, it will be used in place of or in addition to /dev/urandom

     contact_email (string)
             System administrator email address.  This setting is currently not used. If you want to display support information to your users, customise the tem‐
             plates.

     fatal_dump_core (boolean)
             Dump core on fatal() error.  Default: false.

     log_debug (boolean)
             Enable somewhat more verbose logging, mainly in relation to SSL.  Default: false.

     fix_client_ipaddr (boolean)
             Client must connect from consistent IP addresses. May be useful as a security measure in LAN environments. Painful for dialup users whose connections
             may drop out.  Default: false.

     gzip_allow_nets (string), gzip_deny_nets (string)
             prayer-session(8) gzip-compresses pages sent to clients if:
             1.   gzip compression enabled at compile time,
             2.   use_gzip is set in user preferences,
             3.   User agent is known to support Content-Encoding: gzip,
             4.   User agent asks for Content-Encoding: gzip or x-gzip,
             5.   IP address of client appears in gzip_allow_nets or IP address of client does not appear in gzip_deny_nets.

             The format of these options is a sequence of ipaddr[/masklen] items, separated by colons and whitespace (to allow for IPv6 addresses to be parsed
             easily). If masklen is omitted, the item is interpreted as a full host address.

     log_name_nets (string)
             A network list in the same format as gzip_allow_nets above. To avoid delay when a user logs in, prayer-session(8) only performs a reverse lookup of the
             remote address if matches this list.  Default: empty; no reverse lookup are performed.

     limit_vm (number)
             Virtual memory limit imposed on each process to stop runaway process killing system. See setrlimit(2).  Default: no limit.

     http_max_method_size (number)
             Prayer should in theory be able to cope with input of arbitrary size. In practice however, the incoming request has to be stored somewhere and without
             limits an attacker may exhaust available memory, causing a denial of service attack.

             This sets the maximum size of the initial line of an HTTP request.  Default: no limit.

     http_max_hdr_size (number)
             Maximum for headers associated with this request.

     http_max_body_size (number)
             Maximum for HTTP payload. This is the most significant one in normal use.

     draft_att_single_max (number)
             Maximum size of a single attachment when composing a mail.  Default: 0 (unlimited).

     draft_att_total_max (number)
             Maximum size of all attachments.  Default: 0 (unlimited).

     http_min_servers (number)
             Minimum number of preforked prayer(8) HTTP servers. The master process forks new slave processes whenever the number of idle slaves falls below this
             number, unless the total number of slaves would exceed http_max_servers.  Default: 4.

     http_max_servers (number)
             Maximum number of preforked prayer(8) HTTP servers (active and idle). The master process does not, however, enforce any maximum number of idle slave
             processes; they have to terminate voluntarily by timing out or serving the maximum number of connections.  Default: 64.

     http_max_connections (number)
             Maximum number of connections that each frontend server will process.  Default: 0 (no limit).

     http_timeout_idle (time)
             Timeout for (dirty) spare server waiting for another HTTP connection.  Default: 30s.

     http_timeout_icons (time)
             Timeout for HTTP connection that last served static content.  Default: 10s.

     http_timeout_session (time)
             Timeout for HTTP connection that last served a session URL or has not served anything yet.  Default: 60s.

     http_cookie_use_port (boolean)
             Present HTTP cookies to browser as “username:port=value” rather than “username=value”.  Allows simultaneous login sessions from a single client
             browser.  However can leave a trail of cookies behind. Probably don't want this in the long term, it's here for experimentation purposes only at the
             moment.

     icon_expire_timeout (time)
             The amount of time in the future to set the HTTP Expires: field for static content. Default: 7d.  (In contrast sessions URLs expire immediately:
             Browsers really shouldn't be trying to cache this stuff, especially when it is coming in over HTTPS).

   Session specific configuration
     session_idle_time (time)
             Session switches to idle mode after this much time: connections to IMAP and accountd servers are shut down.  Default: 0 (idle mode disabled).

     session_timeout (time)
             Session terminates after this much idle time.  ‘0’ means session never times out.  Default: 4h.

     session_timeout_compose (time)
             Session terminates after this much idle time instead when the last command was ‘compose’ or ‘sieve’.  It should probably not be set lower than
             session_timeout.  Default: 0 (always use the same timeout).

     stream_ping_interval (time)
             Ping INBOX, Other, and Draft streams at this interval.  Default: 5m.

     stream_checkpoint (boolean)
             Use CHECKPOINT instead of PING to “ping” streams. Default: true.

     stream_misc_timeout (time)
             Shut down Postponed, Preferences and Transfer streams entirely after this much idle time, but only if idle mode doesn't beat us to it.  Default: 0
             (disabled).

     log_ping_interval (time)
             stat(2) log files at this interval to see if target file has been renamed or removed.  ‘0s’ means stat() log file every time something is logged.
             Default: 5m.

     db_ping_interval (time)
             Interval at which to re-read CDB files containing the local domain.  Default: 30m.

     recips_max_msg (number)
             Maximum number of recipients per message.  Default: 0 (unlimited).

     recips_max_session (number)
             Maximum number of recipients per session. Automatically creates file in sending_block_dir if limit reached and that is defined.  Default: 0
             (unlimited).

     sending_allow_dir (path)
             Create empty file named user in this directory to disable recips_max_session for that user.

     sending_block_dir (path)
             Create empty file named user in this directory to disable outgoing email for that user (automatic defense against phishing attacks).

   Display specific configuration
     login_banner (string)
             Used in the <title> and heading of the login page Default: "Webmail Service Login".

     login_service_name (string)
             Used in the <title> and elsewhere to refer to the webmail system after the user has logged in. Default: "Prayer".

     login_template (string)
             Template to use on the login screen.

     login_insert1_path (path)
             Optional file to include in login page template (as $login_insert1).

     login_insert2_path (path)
             Optional file to include in login page template (as $login_insert2).

     motd_path (path)
             File to use as the part of the login page immediately following the login form.

     ssl_encouraged (boolean)
             If the user connects over unencrypted HTTP, do not show the login form on the start (/) page. A link to /login, where the form is still displayed, is
             still provided. Default: false. Ignored if ssl_redirect or ssl_required is true.

     ssl_redirect (boolean)
             If the user connects over unencrypted HTTP, return a ‘302’ redirect to the default SSL port. Only the start (/) page is redirected and it may be
             possible to switch between http and https after loggin in, subject to cookie rules.

             Default: false.

     ssl_required (boolean)
             Return a ‘403 Forbidden’ error if the user tries to access anything over unencrypted HTTP.  ssl_redirect still has effect, however.

     list_addr_maxlen (number)
             The maximum number of characters to show from addresses on the mailbox list screen.  Default: 30.

     list_subject_maxlen (number)
             The maximum number of characters to show from the subject on the mailbox list screen.  Default: 30.

     change_max_folders (number)
             The maximum number of folders allowed in the quick folder change dropdown list. If there would be too many folders, the quick list is disabled alto‐
             gether. Only folders that are expanded in the folder view are included.

             Default: 20.

     template_path (path)
             Path to uncompiled template sets (directories).  Default: "../templates" (relative to tmp_dir).

     template_set (string)
             Template set to use.  Default: "xhtml_strict".

     template_use_compiled (boolean)
             Use the compiled-in templates, ignoring template_path.  Default: true.

     theme   Define themes and their colors.  Semi-deprecated; Colours set with this directive are only used by the xhtml_transitional template set. The
             xhtml_strict template set, as well as the login screen, use CSS instead. It is still necessary to tell Prayer which themes are available, however.

             Syntax:

                   theme name description description
                   theme name element colour
                   theme name element colour
                   ...

             description is the label shown in the theme dropdown lists on the General Preferences page.

             element is one of fgcolor, fgcolor_link, bgcolor, bgcolor_banner, bgcolor_row1, bgcolor_row2, bgcolor_status, bgcolor_status_none, fgcolor_quote1,
             fgcolor_quote2, fgcolor_quote3, and fgcolor_quote4.  The first three are not used by any standard template set, but are available.  Please study the
             templates to understand how the rest are used.

             colour is any valid HTML %Color value. Remember that strings containing hash marks need to be quoted.

     theme_default_main (string)
             The name of the default theme.

     theme_default_main (string)
             The name of the default theme in help mode.

     use_ispell_language
             Ispell languages that we want to support, with some descriptive text for the preferences screen. Syntax:

                   use_ispell_language wordlist description

             Example:

                   use_ispell_language british "British English"

   Paths etc.
     aspell_path (path)
             Location of Aspell Binary (takes precedence over ispell_path).

     bin_dir (path)
             Location of Prayer binaries (prayer(8) and prayer-session(8)).  Default: none. Must be set.
