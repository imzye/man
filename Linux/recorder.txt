NAME
       RECORDER, RECORDER_DEFINE, RECORDER_DECLARE - Declare and define buffers to record events

SYNOPSIS
       #include <recorder/recorder.h>

       #define RECORDER(recname, recsize, rechelp) ...
       #define RECORDER_DEFINE(recname, recsize, rechelp) ...
       #define RECORDER_DECLARE(recname) ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  RECORDER()  macro defines a buffer named recname to store up to recsize events for use by the record(3) function. The rechelp string is self-documentation describing the events stored in the buf‐
       fer.  This self-documentation can be displayed by activating the help trace, see recorder_set_trace(3).

       The RECORDER_DECLARE() macro declares an event recorder, and can be used in header files.

       The RECORDER_DEFINE() macro is an alias for RECORDER(), the intention being that you would use RECORDER() for event recorders that are local to a file, or a RECORDER_DECLARE()  (in  the  header  file)
       paired with RECORDER_DEFINE() (in a non-header file) for event recorders that are shared across multiple translation units.

       These macros should be used at file scope, i.e. where a function definition or global variable is allowed.

       Each recorder is associated with a trace value which is an integer value that can be read using RECORDER_TRACE(3).  See recorder_trace_set(3).

EXAMPLES
       The program below records its input arguments, and crashes if passed crash as the first command-line argument.

           #include <recorder/recorder.h>
           #include <string.h>

           RECORDER(program_args, 32, "Program command-line arguments");
           int main(int argc, char **argv)
           {
               int a;
               recorder_dump_on_common_signals(0, 0);
               for (a = 0; a < argc; a++)
                   record(program_args, "Argument %d is %+s", a, argv[a]);

               if (argc >= 2 && strcmp(argv[1], "crash") == 0)
               {
                   char *ptr = NULL;
                   strcpy(ptr, argv[1]);
               }
           }

       When a crash occurs, previously recorded events are printed out on the console.

       The  program  below is an instrumented version of the classical recursive Fibonacci computation. It uses several recorders corresponding to different types of events, and activates warnings and errors
       in a way that can be configured by setting an environment variable.

           #include <recorder/recorder.h>
           #include <string.h>
           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>

           RECORDER(fib_main,    32, "Loops in fib function");
           RECORDER(fib_loops,   32, "Loops in fib function");
           RECORDER(fib_warning, 32, "Warnings in fib function");
           RECORDER(fib_error,   32, "Errors in fib function");

           int fib(int n)
           {
               if (n <= 1) {
                   if (n < 0)
                       record(fib_error, "fib is undefined for negative value %d", n);
                   return n;
               }
               record(fib_loops, "Computing fib(%d)", n);
               int result = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
               record(fib_loops, "Computed fib(%d) = %d", n, result);
               return result;
           }

           int main(int argc, char **argv)
           {
               int a;
               recorder_dump_on_common_signals(0, 0);
               recorder_trace_set(".*_warning=35 .*_error");
               recorder_trace_set(getenv("FIB_TRACES"));
               for (a = 1; a < argc; a++) {
                   int n = atoi(argv[a]);
                   if (n >= RECORDER_TRACE(fib_warning))
                       record(fib_warning, "Computing for %d may take a while", n);
                   printf("fib(%d) = %d0, n, fib(n));
                   if (n >= RECORDER_TRACE(fib_warning))
                       record(fib_warning, "Computation for %d finally completed", n);
               }
           }

       This program will produce an output similar to the following:

           % fib 1 2 3 4 10 20 30 35 10 40 -1
           fib(1) = 1
           fib(2) = 1
           fib(3) = 2
           fib(4) = 3
           fib(10) = 55
           fib(20) = 6765
           fib(30) = 832040
           [2714667 0.177725] fib_warning: Computing for 35 may take a while
           fib(35) = 9227465
           [32575370 1.859156] fib_warning: Computation for 35 finally completed
           fib(10) = 55
           [32575547 1.859171] fib_warning: Computing for 40 may take a while
           fib(40) = 102334155
           [363735828 20.527882] fib_warning: Computation for 40 finally completed
           [363735829 20.527887] fib_error: fib is undefined for negative value -1
           fib(-1) = -1
       The first column in trace outputs is the number of events that were recorded. THe second column is the time in seconds since the program started.

       The same program can also be run with additional tracing or warnings, for example:

           % FIB_TRACES="recorder_location fib_loops fib_warning=3" /tmp/fib 3 4
           /tmp/fib.c:33:[82 0.000496] fib_warning: Computing for 3 may take a while
           /tmp/fib.c:18:[83 0.000561] fib_loops: Computing fib(3)
           /tmp/fib.c:18:[84 0.000570] fib_loops: Computing fib(2)
           /tmp/fib.c:20:[85 0.000575] fib_loops: Computed fib(2) = 1
           /tmp/fib.c:20:[86 0.000581] fib_loops: Computed fib(3) = 2

           /tmp/fib.c:20:[93 0.000625] fib_loops: Computed fib(3) = 2
           /tmp/fib.c:18:[94 0.000664] fib_loops: Computing fib(2)
           /tmp/fib.c:20:[95 0.000707] fib_loops: Computed fib(2) = 1
           /tmp/fib.c:20:[96 0.000724] fib_loops: Computed fib(4) = 3
           fib(4) = 3
           /tmp/fib.c:36:[97 0.000741] fib_warning: Computation for 4 finally completed

BUGS
       Incorrect use of the macros generally results in nonsensical compiler diagnostics.
