NAME
       smp_ena_dis_zoning - invoke ENABLE DISABLE ZONING SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_ena_dis_zoning [--disable] [--ena-dis=ED] [--expected=EX] [--help] [--hex] [--interface=PARAMS] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--save=SAV] [--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) ENABLE DISABLE ZONING function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the --sa=SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface,
       the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between HBAs if there are  multiple
       present.

       If neither --disable nor --ena-dis=ED options are given then enable zoning (i.e. "--ena-dis=1") is assumed.

       This  function  does  not  change  the state of the current zoning enabled flag (as seen in the REPORT GENERAL response). Such a state change will occur on a subsequent invocation of the ZONE ACTIVATE
       function.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -d, --disable
              set the 'enable disable zoning' field in the SMP request to 2 which will disable zoning.

       -e, --ena-dis=ED
              set the 'enable disable zoning' field in the SMP request. ED may take these values: 0 for no change, 1 for enable zoning (default) and 2 for disable zoning. If this option and the --disable op‐
              tion are both given then they cannot contradict one another.

       -E, --expected=EX
              set  the  'expected  expander  change  count' field in the SMP request.  The value EX is from 0 to 65535 inclusive with 0 being the default value. When EX is greater than zero then if the value
              doesn't match the expander change count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when the request arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a function result of "invalid expander change
              count" in the response.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. The mpt interface needs this option and it will typically be an expander's SAS address. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS addresses are
              shown in hexadecimal.  To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -S, --save=SAV
              set the 'save' field in the SMP request. SAV may take these values: 0 for updating the shadow values (default), 1 for updating the saved values, 2 for updating shadow values  and  if  available
              the saved values, 3 for updating both saved and shadow values.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP ENABLE DISABLE ZONING function was introduced in SAS-2 .
