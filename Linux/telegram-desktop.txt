DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents how to run Telegram Desktop, official Telegram client.

OPTIONS
       Although the program is primarily a GUI application, it understands various command line arguments, some of them are described in the present document.

       -autostart
              Apply automatic start. It works if only auto-starting is allowed in settings and the app is not locked by a passcode. Telegram will start minimized in
              the system tray if the corresponding checkbox has been set.

       -startintray
              Do not show the main window, just start in the system tray. Useful for automatic unconditional launching.

       -cleanup
              Remove an autostart shortcut effectively disabling the feature then exit.

       -debug Run in debug mode immediately. See full logs in working directory or in standard location at ~/.local/share/TelegramDesktop/DebugLogs.

       -scale INT
              Set initial interface scale factor. Possible values are measured in percents from 75 up to 300 inclusive. The application remembers last used value.

       -workdir PATH
              Change current working directory to specified path before start. All Telegram data will be stored encrypted in  this  folder.  It  must  exist  before
              start. You can pass this option to partition different app instances that run in parallel.

       URI    Specify Telegram link in tg:// scheme. Double dash is mandatory. This is for opening chats by t.me site.

       There are also some other hidden options not intended for direct use.
