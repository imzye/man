NAME
       techtalk-pse - superior technical demonstration software

SYNOPSIS
        cd /path/to/talk/; techtalk-pse

        techtalk-pse /path/to/talk/

DESCRIPTION
       Tech Talk "Platinum Supreme Edition" (PSE) is Linux Presentation Software designed by technical people to give technical software demonstrations to other technical people.  It is designed to be simple
       to use (for people who know how to use an editor and the command line) and powerful, so that you can create informative, technically accurate and entertaining talks and demonstrations.

       Tech Talk PSE is good at opening editors at the right place, opening shell prompts with preloaded history, compiling and running things during the demonstration, displaying text, photos, figures and
       video.

       Tech Talk PSE is bad at slide effects, chart junk and bullet points.

       This manual page covers all the documentation you will need to use Tech Talk PSE.  The next section covers running the tool from the command line.  After that there is a "TUTORIAL" section to get you
       started.  Then there is a detailed "REFERENCE" section.  Finally there is a discussion on "WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK".

RUNNING THE TOOL FROM THE COMMAND LINE
       Tech Talk PSE talks are just directories containing "*.html", "*.sh" (shell script) and "*.term" (terminal) files:

        0010-introduction.html
        0500-demonstration.sh
        0600-command-line.term
        9900-conclusion.html

       The filenames that Tech Talk PSE considers to be slides have to match the regular expression:

        ^(\d+)(?:-.*)\.(html|sh|term)$

       (any other file or subdirectory is ignored).  Shell scripts and terminal files must be executable.

   DISPLAYING AN EXISTING TALK
       To display or run a talk, change into the directory containing all those files and run the "techtalk-pse" command:

        cd /path/to/talk/; techtalk-pse

       You can also run "techtalk-pse" without changing directory, instead specifying the path to the talk:

        techtalk-pse /path/to/talk/

   OPTIONS
       --help
           Display brief help and exit.

       --last
           Start at the last slide.

           You cannot use this with the -n / --start option.

       -n SLIDE | --start SLIDE
           Start at the named slide.  SLIDE is the shortest unique prefix of the slide name, so to start at a slide named 00010-introduction.html, you could use -n 00010 or -n 00010-intro, or give the full
           filename -n 00010-introduction.html.

           The default is to start at the first slide in the talk.

       --verbose
           Display verbose messages, useful for debugging or tracing what the program is doing.

       --version
           Display version number and exit.

TUTORIAL
   START WRITING A TALK
       [Before you start writing your real talk, I urge you to read "WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK" below].

       To start your talk, all you have to do is to make a new directory somewhere:

        mkdir talk
        cd talk

       A tech talk consists of HTML files ("slides") and shell scripts.  The filenames must start with a number, followed optionally by a description, followed by the extension (".html", ".sh" or ".term").
       So to start our talk with two slides:

        echo "This is the introduction" > 0010-introduction.html
        echo "This is the second slide" > 0020-second.html

       To run it, run the command from within the talk directory:

        techtalk-pse

       Any other file in the directory is ignored, so if you want to add Makefiles, version control files etc, just go ahead.

   TIPS FOR WRITING HTML
       You may have your own techniques and tools for writing HTML, so this section is just to share my ideas.  I start every HTML file with a standard stylesheet and Javascript header:

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css"/>
        <script src="code.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

       That just ensures that I can put common styling instructions for all my slides in a single file ("style.css"), and I have one place where I can add all Javascript, if I need to use any ("code.js").

       BACKGROUNDS, FONTS AND LOGOS

       To add a common background and font size to all slides, put this in "style.css":

        body {
            font-size: 24pt;
            background: url(background-image.jpg) no-repeat;
        }

       To add a logo in one corner:

        body {
            background: url(logo.jpg) top right no-repeat;
        }

       SCALING AND CENTERING

       Scaling slide text and images so that they appear at the same proportionate size for any screen resolution can be done using Javascript.  (See
       <https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/window.innerHeight>).

       If you want to center text horizontally, use CSS, eg:

        p.center {
            text-align: center;
        }

       To center text vertically, CSS3 is supposed to offer a solution some time, but while you're waiting for that try <http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center#vertical>.

       PREVIEWING HTML

       I find it helpful to have Firefox open to display the HTML files and styles as I edit them.  Just start firefox in the talk directory:

        firefox file://$(pwd) &

       When you edit an HTML file, click the Firefox reload button to immediately see your changes.

       Tech Talk PSE uses WebKit embedding to display HTML.  HTML is standardized enough nowadays that what you see in Firefox and other browsers should be the same as what Tech Talk PSE displays.  WebKit-
       based browsers (Chrome, Safari) should be identical.

   CREATING FIGURES
       Use your favorite tool to draw the figure, convert it to an image (in any format that the Mozilla engine can display) and include it using an "<img>" tag, eg:

        <img src="fig1.gif">

       Suitable tools include: Inkscape, XFig, GnuPlot, GraphViz, and many TeX tools such as PicTex and in particular TikZ.

   EMBEDDING VIDEOS, ANIMATIONS, ETC.
       Using HTML 5, embedding videos in the browser is easy.  See: <https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_Firefox>

       For animations, you could try Haxe <http://haxe.org/> which has a Javascript back-end.  There are many other possibilities.

       If you are sure that the venue will have an internet connection, why not embed a YouTube video.

   DISPLAYING EXISTING WEB PAGES
       Obviously you could just have an HTML file that contains a redirect to the public web page:

        <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=http://www.example.com/">

       However if you want your talk to work offline, then it's better to download the web page in advance, eg. using Firefox's "Save Page As -> Web Page, complete" feature, into the talk directory, then
       either rename or make a symbolic link to the slide name:

        ln -s "haXe - Welcome to haXe.html" 0010-haxe-homepage.html

   TIPS FOR WRITING SHELL SCRIPTS
       Make sure each "*.sh" or "*.term" file you write is executable, otherwise Tech Talk PSE won't be able to run it.  (The program gives a warning if you forget this).

       The difference between "*.sh" (shell script) and "*.term" (a terminal script) is that a shell script runs any commands, usually graphical commands, whereas a terminal script runs in a full screen
       terminal.

       A good idea is to start each script by sourcing some common functions.  All my scripts start with:

        #!/bin/bash -
        source functions

       where "functions" is another file (ignored by Tech Talk PSE) which contains common functions for setting shell history and starting a terminal.

       In "functions", I have:

        # -*- shell-script -*-

        # Place any local environment variables required in 'local'.
        if [ -f local ]; then source local; fi

        export PS1="$ "

        export HISTFILE=$talkdir/history

        rm -f $HISTFILE
        touch $HISTFILE

        add_history ()
        {
            echo "$@" >> $HISTFILE
        }

        terminal ()
        {
            # Make $HISTFILE unwritable so the shell won't update it
            # when it exits.
            chmod -w $HISTFILE

            # Execute a shell.
            bash --norc "$@"
        }

       By initializing the shell history, during your talk you can rapidly recall commands to start parts of the demonstration just by hitting the Up arrow.  A complete terminal script from one of my talks
       would look like this:

        #!/bin/bash -
        source functions
        add_history guestfish -i debian.img
        terminal

       This is just a starting point for your own scripts.

REFERENCE
   ORDER OF FILES
       Tech Talk PSE displays the slides in the directory in lexicographic order (the same order as "LANG=C ls -1").  Only files matching the following regexp are considered:

        ^(\d+)(?:-.*)\.(html|sh|term)$

       For future compatibility, you should ensure that every slide has a unique numeric part (ie. don't have "0010-aaa.html" and "0010-bbb.html").  This is because in future we want to have the ability to
       display multiple files side by side.

       Also for future compatibility, don't use file names that have an uppercase letter immediately after the numeric part.  This is because in future we want to allow placement hints using filenames like
       "0010L-on-the-left.html" and "0010R-on-the-right.html".

   BASE URL AND CURRENT DIRECTORY
       The base URL is set to the be the directory containing the talk files.  Thus you should use relative paths, eg:

        <img src="fig1.gif">

       You can also place assets into subdirectories, because subdirectories are ignored by Tech Talk PSE, eg:

        <img src="images/fig1.gif">

       When running shell scripts, the current directory is also set to be the directory containing the talk files, so the same rules about using relative paths apply there too.

       The environment variable $talkdir is exported to scripts and it contains the absolute path of the directory containing the talk files.  When a script is run, the current directory is the same as
       $talkdir, but if your script changes directory (eg. into a subdirectory containing supporting files) then it can be useful to use $talkdir to refer back to the original directory.

WHAT MAKES A GOOD TALK
       I like what Edward Tufte writes, for example his evisceration of PowerPoint use at NASA here: <http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB>

       However it is sometimes hard to translate his ideas into clear presentations, and not all of that is the fault of the tools.  Here are my thoughts and rules on how to deliver a good talk.

       First, most important rule: Before you start drawing any slides at all, write your talk as a short essay.

       This is the number one mistake that presenters make, and it is partly a tool fault, because PowerPoint, OpenOffice, even Tech Talk PSE, all open up on an initial blank slide, inviting you to write a
       title and some bullet points.  If you start that way, you will end up using the program as a kind of clumsy outlining tool, and then reading that outline to your audience.  That's boring and a waste
       of time for you and your audience.  (It would be quicker for them just to download the talk and read it at home).

       Secondly: How long do you want to spend preparing the talk?  A good talk, with a sound essay behind it, well thought out diagrams and figures, and interesting demonstrations, takes many hours to
       prepare.  How many hours?  I would suggest thinking about how many hours of effort your audience are putting in.  Even just 20 people sitting there for half an hour is 10 man-hours of attention, and
       that is a very small talk, and doesn't include all the extra time and hassle that it took to get them all in one place.

       I don't think you can get away with spending less than two full days preparing a talk, if you want to master the topic and draw up accurate slides.  Steve Jobs was reputed to spend weeks preparing his
       annual sales talk to the Apple faithful.

       Thirdly: Now that you're going to write your talk as an essay, what should go in the slides?  I would say that you should consider delivering the essay, not the slides, to people who don't make the
       talk.  An essay can be turned into an article or blog posting, whereas even "read-out-the-bullet-point" slides have a low information density, large size, and end-user compatibility problems (*.pptx
       anyone?).

       What, then, goes on the slides?  Anything you cannot just say: diagrams, graphs, videos, animations, and of course (only with Tech Talk PSE!) demonstrations.

       Lastly: Once you've got your talk as an essay and slides, practice, practice and practice again.  Deliver the talk to yourself in the mirror, to your colleagues.  Practice going backwards and forwards
       through the slides, using your actual laptop and the software so you know what to click and what keys to press.  Partly memorize what you are going to say (but use short notes written on paper if you
       need to).
