NAME
       irtext2udp - Convert pulse/space text data to binary UDP driver format

SYNOPSIS
       irtext2udp [-r resolution] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       irtext2udp  is  a  filter converting pulse/space printable data such as
       generated by mode2(1) to the binary format used by the LIRC udp driver.

       The file argument is a textfile with pulse/space data.  If  not  given,
       standard  input  is  used.  Lines  not starting with space or pulse are
       silently ignored.

       The normal usage pattern is to combine irtext2udp with  standard  tools
       such as ncat(1) or socat(1) to send the binary data to a lircd instance
       using the udp driver.

OPTIONS
       -r, --resolution  <resolution>
           Udp packages are measured in ticks. The  length  of  each  tick  is
           defined  by  the  resolution.  The default value is 61, computed as
           1000000/16384 and corresponding to 1/16384 seconds. This is derived
           from old designs using a 32 kHz clock.

       -v , --version
           Print version and exit.

       -h , --help
           Print help message.

EXAMPLES
       Using  ncat(1)   or socat(1) to send data to a lircd instance using the
       udp driver listening on the default udp port 8765 on localhost:

           irtext2udp < input-file | nc --udp localhost 8765

           irtext2udp < input-file | socat STDIN UDP:localhost:8765
