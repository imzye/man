NAME
       haproxy-lua - haproxy-lua Documentation

HAPROXY LUA RUNNING CONTEXTS
       The Lua code executed in HAProxy can be processed in 2 main modes. The first one is the initialisation mode, and the second is the runtime mode.

       • In the initialisation mode, we can perform DNS solves, but we cannot perform socket I/O. In this initialisation mode, HAProxy still blocked during the execution of the Lua program.

       • In  the  runtime mode, we cannot perform DNS solves, but we can use sockets.  The execution of the Lua code is multiplexed with the requests processing, so the Lua code seems to be run in block‐
         ing, but it is not the case.

       The Lua code is loaded in one or more files. These files contains main code and functions. Lua has 8 execution contexts.

       1. The Lua file body context. It is executed during the load of the Lua file in the HAProxy [global] section with the directive lua-load. It is executed in initialisation mode. This section is use
          for configuring Lua bindings in HAProxy.

       2. The Lua init context. It is a Lua function executed just after the HAProxy configuration parsing. The execution is in initialisation mode. In this context the HAProxy  environment  are  already
          initialized.  It  is useful to check configuration, or initializing socket connections or tasks. These functions are declared in the body context with the Lua function core.register_init(). The
          prototype of the function is a simple function without return value and without parameters, like this: function fcn().

       3. The Lua task context. It is a Lua function executed after the start of the HAProxy scheduler, and just after the declaration of the task with the Lua function core.register_task(). This context
          can be concurrent with the traffic processing. It is executed in runtime mode. The prototype of the function is a simple function without return value and without parameters, like  this:  func‐
          tion fcn().

       4. The action context. It is a Lua function conditionally executed. These actions are registered by the Lua directives "core.register_action()". The prototype of the Lua called function is a func‐
          tion with doesn't returns anything and that take an object of class TXN as entry. function fcn(txn).

       5. The  sample-fetch  context.  This  function takes a TXN object as entry argument and returns a string. These types of function cannot execute any blocking function. They are useful to aggregate
          some of original HAProxy sample-fetches and return the result. The prototype of the function is function string fcn(txn). These functions can be registered with  the  Lua  function  core.regis‐
          ter_fetches(). Each declared sample-fetch is prefixed by the string "lua.".

          NOTE:
             It is possible that this function cannot found the required data in the original HAProxy sample-fetches, in this case, it cannot return the result. This case is not yet supported

       6. The converter context. It is a Lua function that takes a string as input and returns another string as output. These types of function are stateless, it cannot access to any context. They don't
          execute  any  blocking function.  The call prototype is function string fcn(string). This function can be registered with the Lua function core.register_converters(). Each declared converter is
          prefixed by the string "lua.".

       7. The filter context: It is a Lua object based on a class defining filter callback functions. Lua filters are registered using core.register_filter(). Each declared  filter  is  prefixed  by  the
          string "lua.".

       8. The event context: Inside a function that handles events subscribed through core.event_sub() or Server.event_sub().

HAPROXY LUA HELLO WORLD
       HAProxy configuration file (hello_world.conf):

          global
             lua-load hello_world.lua

          listen proxy
             bind 127.0.0.1:10001
             tcp-request inspect-delay 1s
             tcp-request content use-service lua.hello_world

       HAProxy Lua file (hello_world.lua):

          core.register_service("hello_world", "tcp", function(applet)
             applet:send("hello world\n")
          end)

       How to start HAProxy for testing this configuration:

          ./haproxy -f hello_world.conf

       On other terminal, you can test with telnet:

          #:~ telnet 127.0.0.1 10001
          hello world

USAGE OF LOAD PARAMETERS
       HAProxy  lua-load(-per-thread)  directives allow a list of parameters after the lua file name. These parameters are accessible through an array of args using this code local args = table.pack(...)
       in the body of loaded file.

       Below, a new version of the hello world using load parameters

       HAProxy configuration file (hello_world.conf):

          global
             lua-load hello_world.lua "this is not an hello world"

          listen proxy
             bind 127.0.0.1:10001
             tcp-request inspect-delay 1s
             tcp-request content use-service lua.hello_world

       HAProxy Lua file (hello_world.lua):

          local args = table.pack(...)

          core.register_service("hello_world", "tcp", function(applet)
             applet:send(args[1] .. "\n")
          end)

       class core()
              The "core" class contains all the HAProxy core functions. These function are useful for the controlling of the execution flow, registering hooks, manipulating global maps or ACL, ...

              "core" class is basically provided with HAProxy. No require line is required to uses these function.

              The "core" class is static, it is not possible to create a new object of this type.

       core.get_info()
              context: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

              Returns HAProxy core information. We can find information like the uptime, the pid, memory pool usage, tasks number, ...

              This information is also returned by the management socket via the command "show info". See the management socket documentation for more information about the content of these variables.

       core.register_action(name, actions, func[, nb_args])
              context: body

              Register a Lua function executed as action. All the registered action can be used in HAProxy with the prefix "lua.". An action gets a TXN object class as input.

              Arguments

                     • name (string()) -- is the name of the action.

                     • actions (table()) -- is a table of string describing the HAProxy actions facilities where to expose the new action. Expected  facilities   are:  'tcp-req',  'tcp-res',  'http-req',

              The prototype of the Lua function used as argument is:

          function(txn [, arg1 [, arg2]])

          •

            txn (TXN class): this is a TXN object used for manipulating the
                   current request or TCP stream.

          • argX: this is argument provided through the HAProxy configuration file.

          Here, an example of action registration. The action just send an 'Hello world' in the logs.

          core.register_action("hello-world", { "tcp-req", "http-req" }, function(txn)
             txn:Info("Hello world")
          end)
          This example code is used in HAProxy configuration like this:

          frontend tcp_frt
            mode tcp
            tcp-request content lua.hello-world

          frontend http_frt
            mode http
            http-request lua.hello-world
          A second example using arguments

          function hello_world(txn, arg)
             txn:Info("Hello world for " .. arg)
          end
          core.register_action("hello-world", { "tcp-req", "http-req" }, hello_world, 2)
          This example code is used in HAProxy configuration like this:

          frontend tcp_frt
            mode tcp

          It must return the filter to use or nil to ignore it. Here, an example of filter registration.

          core.register_filter("my-filter", MyFilter, function(flt, args)
             flt.args = args -- Save arguments
             return flt
          end)
          This example code is used in HAProxy configuration like this:

          frontend http
            mode http
            filter lua.my-filter arg1 arg2 arg3

          see    Filter()

       core.register_service(name, mode, func)
              context: body

              Register a Lua function executed as a service. All the registered services can be used in HAProxy with the prefix "lua.". A service gets an object class as input according with the required
              mode.

              The prototype of the Lua function used as argument is:

          function(applet)

          • applet  applet   will  be  a  AppletTCP  class  or  a AppletHTTP class. It depends the type of registered applet. An applet registered with the 'http' value for the mode parameter will gets a
            AppletHTTP class. If the mode value is 'tcp', the applet will gets a AppletTCP class.

          WARNING:
              Applets of type 'http' cannot be called from 'tcp-' rulesets. Only the 'http-' rulesets are authorized, this means that is not possible to call a HTTP applet from a proxy in tcp  mode.  Ap‐
              plets of type 'tcp' can be called from anywhere.

          Here, an example of service registration. The service just send an 'Hello world' as an http response.

          core.register_service("hello-world", "http", function(applet)
             local response = "Hello World !"
             applet:set_status(200)
             applet:add_header("content-length", string.len(response))
             applet:add_header("content-type", "text/plain")
             applet:start_response()
             applet:send(response)
          end)

              NOTE:
                 This function is not optimal due to systematic Map reference lookup.  It is recommended to use Patref.set() instead.

       core.sleep(int seconds)
              context: task, action

              The core.sleep() functions stop the Lua execution between specified seconds.

              Arguments

                     • data (any()) -- Return some data for the caller. It is useful with sample-fetches and sample-converters.

              Immediately  stops  the current Lua execution and returns to the caller which may be a sample fetch, a converter or an action and returns the specified value (ignored for actions and init).
              It is used when the LUA process finishes its work and wants to give back the control to HAProxy without executing the remaining code. It can be seen as a multi-level "return".

       core.wait([milliseconds])
              context: task, action

              Give back the hand at the HAProxy scheduler. Unlike core.yield() the task will not be woken up automatically to resume as fast as possible.  Instead, it will wait for an event to  wake  the
              task. If milliseconds argument is provided then the Lua excecution will be automatically resumed passed this delay even if no event caused the task to wake itself up.

              Arguments

                     • milliseconds (integer()) -- automatic wakeup passed this delay. (optional)

       core.yield()
              context: task, action

              Give back the hand at the HAProxy scheduler. It is used when the LUA processing consumes a lot of processing time. Lua excecution will be resumed automatically (automatic reschedule).

       core.parse_addr(address)
              context: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

              Arguments

                     • network -- is a string describing an ipv4 or ipv6 address and optionally its network length, like this: "127.0.0.1/8" or "aaaa::1234/32".

              Returns
                     a userdata containing network or nil if an error occurs.

              Parse ipv4 or ipv6 addresses and its facultative associated network.

       core.match_addr(addr1, addr2)
              context: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

              Arguments

                     • addr1 -- is an address created with "core.parse_addr".

                     • addr2 -- is an address created with "core.parse_addr".

              Returns
                     boolean, true if the network of the addresses match, else returns false.

              Match two networks. For example "127.0.0.1/32" matches "127.0.0.0/8". The order of network is not important.

       core.tokenize(str, separators[, noblank])
              context: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

              This  function  is  useful  for tokenizing an entry, or splitting some messages.  :param string str: The string which will be split.  :param string separators: A string containing a list of
              separators.  :param boolean noblank: Ignore empty entries.  :returns: an array of string.

              For example:

          local array = core.tokenize("This function is useful, for tokenizing an entry.", "., ", true)
          print_r(array)
          Returns this array:

          (table) table: 0x21c01e0 [
              1: (string) "This"
              2: (string) "function"
              3: (string) "is"
              4: (string) "useful"
              5: (string) "for"
              6: (string) "tokenizing"
              7: (string) "an"
              8: (string) "entry"
          ]

       core.event_sub(event_types, func)
              context: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

              Register a function that will be called on specific system events.

              Arguments

                     • event_types (array()) -- array of string containing the event types you want to subscribe to

                     • func (function()) -- is the Lua function called when one of the subscribed events occur.

              Returns
                     A EventSub class object.

              See    Server.event_sub().

              List of available event types :
                 SERVER Family:

                     • SERVER_ADD: when a server is added

                     • SERVER_DEL: when a server is removed

                     • SERVER_DOWN: when a server state goes from UP to DOWN

                     • SERVER_UP: when a server state goes from DOWN to UP

                     • SERVER_STATE: when a server state changes

                     • SERVER_ADMIN: when a server administrative state changes

                     • SERVER_CHECK: when a server's check status change is reported.  Be careful when subscribing to this type since many events might be generated.

                 NOTE:
                     Use SERVER in event_types to subscribe to all server events types at once. Note that this should only be used for testing purposes since a single event source could result in  multi‐
                     ple events types being generated.  (e.g.: SERVER_STATE will always be generated for each SERVER_DOWN or SERVER_UP)

              The prototype of the Lua function used as argument is:

          function(event, event_data, sub, when)

          • event (string): the event type (one of the event_types specified when subscribing)

          • event_data: specific to each event family (For SERVER family, a ServerEvent class object)

          • sub: class to manage the subscription from within the event (a EventSub class object)

          • when:  timestamp  corresponding to the date when the event was generated.  It is an integer representing the number of seconds elapsed since Epoch.  It may be provided as optional argument to
            os.date() lua function to convert it to a string according to a given format string.

          WARNING:
              The callback function will only be scheduled on the very same thread that performed the subscription.

              Moreover, each thread treats events sequentially. It means that if you have, let's say SERVER_UP followed by a SERVER_DOWN in a short timelapse, then the cb function will  first  be  called
              with SERVER_UP, and once it's done handling the event, the cb function will be called again with SERVER_DOWN.

              This is to ensure event consistency when it comes to logging / triggering logic from lua.

              Your  lua  cb  function  may yield if needed, but you're pleased to process the event as fast as possible to prevent the event queue from growing up, depending on the event flow that is ex‐
              pected for the given subscription.

              To prevent abuses, if the event queue for the current subscription goes over a certain amount of unconsumed events, the subscription will pause itself automatically for as long as it  takes
              for your handler to catch up.  This would lead to events being missed, so an error will be reported in the logs to warn you about that.  This is not something you want to let happen too of‐
              ten, it may indicate that you subscribed to an event that is occurring too frequently or/and that your callback function is too slow to keep up the pace and you should review it.

              If you want to do some parallel processing because your callback functions are slow: you might want to create subtasks from lua using core.register_task() from within your callback function
              to perform the heavy job in a dedicated task and allow remaining events to be processed more quickly.

       Server.event_sub(sv, event_types, func)
              Register  a  function  that will be called on specific server events.  It works exactly like core.event_sub() except that the subscription will be performed within the server dedicated sub‐
              scription list instead of the global one.  (Your callback function will only be called for server events affecting sv)

              See core.event_sub() for function usage.

              A key advantage to using Server.event_sub() over core.event_sub() for servers is that Server.event_sub() allows you to be notified for servers events of a single server  only.   It  removes
              the needs for extra filtering in your callback function if you only care about a single server, and also prevents useless wakeups.

              For  instance,  if  you want to be notified for UP/DOWN events on a given set of servers, it is recommended to perform multiple per-server subscriptions since it will be more efficient that
              doing a single global subscription that will filter the received events.  Unless you really want to be notified for servers events of ALL servers of course, which could make sense given you
              setup but should be avoided if you have an important number of servers as it will add a significant load on your haproxy process in case of multiple servers state change in a  short  amount
              of time.

              NOTE:
                 You may also combine core.event_sub() with Server.event_sub().

                 Also, don't forget that you can use core.register_task() from your callback function if needed. (ie: parallel work)

              Here is a working example combining core.event_sub() with Server.event_sub() and core.register_task() (This only serves as a demo, this is not necessarily useful to do so)

          core.event_sub({"SERVER_ADD"}, function(event, data, sub)
            -- in the global event handler
            if data["reference"] ~= nil then
              print("Tracking new server: ", data["name"])
              data["reference"]:event_sub({"SERVER_UP", "SERVER_DOWN"}, function(event, data, sub)
                -- in the per-server event handler
                if data["reference"] ~= nil then
                  core.register_task(function(server)
                    -- subtask to perform some async work (e.g.: HTTP API calls, sending emails...)
                    print("ASYNC: SERVER ", server:get_name(), " is ", event == "SERVER_UP" and "UP" or "DOWN")
                  end, data["reference"])
                end
              end)
            end
          end)
          In  this  example, we will first track global server addition events.  For each newly added server ("add server" on the cli), we will register a UP/DOWN server subscription.  Then, the callback
          function will schedule the event handling in an async subtask which will receive the server reference as an argument.

       Listener.get_stats(ls)
              Returns server statistics.

              Arguments

                     • ls (class_listener()) -- A Listener class which indicates the manipulated listener.

              For a server going DOWN: it is the number of pending server connections that are requeued to the backend (such connections will be redispatched to any server that is suitable  according  to
              the configured load balancing algorithm).

              For a server doing UP: it is the number of pending connections on the backend that may be redispatched to the server according to the load balancing algorithm that is in use.

       class ServerEventAdmin()

       This class contains additional info related to SERVER_ADMIN event.

       ServerEventAdmin.cause
              Printable admin state change cause. Might be empty.

       ServerEventAdmin.new_admin
              New server admin state due to the admin change.

              It is an array of string containing a composition of following values:

                     • "MAINT": server is in maintenance mode

                     • "FMAINT": server is in forced maintenance mode (MAINT is also set)

                     • "IMAINT": server is in inherited maintenance mode (MAINT is also set)

                     • "RMAINT": server is in resolve maintenance mode (MAINT is also set)

                     • "CMAINT": server is in config maintenance mode (MAINT is also set)

                     • "DRAIN": server is in drain mode

                     • "FDRAIN": server is in forced drain mode (DRAIN is also set)

                     • "IDRAIN": server is in inherited drain mode (DRAIN is also set)

       ServerEventAdmin.old_admin
              Previous server admin state prior to the admin change.

              Values are presented as in new_admin, but they should differ.  (Comparing old and new helps to find out the change(s))

       ServerEventAdmin.requeued
              Same as ServerEventState.requeued but when the requeue is due to the server administrative state change.

       class Queue()
              This class provides a generic FIFO storage mechanism that may be shared between multiple lua contexts to easily pass data between them, as stock Lua doesn't provide easy methods for passing
              data between multiple coroutines.

              inter-task example:

          -- script wide shared queue
          local queue = core.queue()

          -- master task
          core.register_task(function()
            -- send the date every second
            while true do
              queue:push(os.date("%c", core.now().sec))
              core.sleep(1)
            end
          end)

          -- worker task
          core.register_task(function()
            while true do
              -- print the date sent by master
              print(queue:pop_wait())
            end
          end)
          Of course, queue may also be used as a local storage mechanism.

          Use core.queue() to get a new Queue object.

       Queue.alarm()
              context: task, action, service

              Sets  a  wakeup alarm on the current Lua context so that when new data becomes available on the Queue, the current Lua context is woken up automatically. It can be combined with core.wait()
              to wait for Queue events.

              Arguments

                     • queue (class_queue()) -- A Queue class to the current queue

       Queue.size(queue)
              This function returns the number of items within the Queue.

              Arguments

                     • queue (class_queue()) -- A Queue class to the current queue

       Queue.push(queue, item)
              This function pushes the item (may be of any type) to the queue.  Pushed item cannot be nil or invalid, or an error will be thrown.

              Arguments

                     • queue (class_queue()) -- A Queue class to the current queue

              Returns
                     boolean true for success and false for error

       Queue.pop(queue)
              This function immediately tries to pop an item from the queue.  It returns nil of no item is available at the time of the call.

              Arguments

                     • queue (class_queue()) -- A Queue class to the current queue

              Returns
                     the item at the top of the stack (any type) or nil if no items

       Queue.pop_wait(queue)
              context: task

              This is an alternative to pop() that may be used within task contexts.

              The call waits for data if no item is currently available. This may be useful when used in a while loop to prevent cpu waste.

              Note that this requires yielding, thus it is only available within contexts that support yielding (mainly task context).

              Arguments

                     • queue (class_queue()) -- A Queue class to the current queue

              Returns
                     the item at the top of the stack (any type) or nil in case of error

       class Concat()
              This class provides a fast way for string concatenation. The way using native Lua concatenation like the code below is slow for some reasons.

          str = "string1"
          str = str .. ", string2"
          str = str .. ", string3"
          For each concatenation, Lua: - allocates memory for the result, - catenates the two string copying the strings in the new memory block, - frees the old memory block containing the string  which
          is no longer used.

          This process does many memory move, allocation and free. In addition, the memory is not really freed, it is just marked as unused and waits for the garbage collector.

          The Concat class provides an alternative way to concatenate strings. It uses the internal Lua mechanism (it does not allocate memory), but it doesn't copy the data more than once.

          On my computer, the following loops spends 0.2s for the Concat method and 18.5s for the pure Lua implementation. So, the Concat class is about 1000x faster than the embedded solution.

          for j = 1, 100 do
            c = core.concat()
            for i = 1, 20000 do
              c:add("#####")
            end
          end

          for j = 1, 100 do
            c = ""
            for i = 1, 20000 do
              c = c .. "#####"
            end
          end

       Concat.add(concat, string)
              This function adds a string to the current concatenated string.

              Arguments

                     • concat (class_concat()) -- A Concat class which contains the currently built string.

                     • string (string()) -- A new string to concatenate to the current built string.

       Concat.dump(concat)
              This function returns the concatenated string.

              Arguments

                     • concat (class_concat()) -- A Concat class which contains the currently built string.

              Returns
                     the concatenated string

       class Fetches()
              This class contains a lot of internal HAProxy sample fetches. See the HAProxy "configuration.txt" documentation for more information.  (chapters 7.3.2 to 7.3.6)

              WARNING:
                 some sample fetches are not available in some context. These limitations are specified in this documentation when they're useful.

              See    TXN.f

              See    TXN.sf

              Fetches are useful to:

              • get system time,

              • get environment variable,

              • get random numbers,

              • know backend status like the number of users in queue or the number of connections established,

              • get client information like ip source or destination,

              • deal with stick tables,

              • fetch established SSL information,

              • fetch HTTP information like headers or method.

          function action(txn)
            -- Get source IP
            local clientip = txn.f:src()
          end

       class Converters()
              This class contains a lot of internal HAProxy sample converters. See the HAProxy documentation "configuration.txt" for more information about her usage. Its the chapter 7.3.1.

              See    TXN.c

              See    TXN.sc

              Converters provides stateful transformation. They are useful to:

              • convert input to base64,

              • apply hash on input string (djb2, crc32, sdbm, wt6),

              • format date,

              • json escape,

              • extract preferred language comparing two lists,

              • turn to lower or upper chars,

              • deal with stick tables.

       class Channel()
              context: action, sample-fetch, convert, filter

              HAProxy  uses  two buffers for the processing of the requests. The first one is used with the request data (from the client to the server) and the second is used for the response data (from
              the server to the client).

              Each buffer contains two types of data. The first type is the incoming data waiting for a processing. The second part is the outgoing data already processed. Usually, the incoming  data  is
              processed, after it is tagged as outgoing data, and finally it is sent. The following functions provides tools for manipulating these data in a buffer.

              The following diagram shows where the channel class function are applied.  [image]

              WARNING:
                 It is not possible to read from the response in request action, and it is not possible to read from the request channel in response action.

              WARNING:
                 It  is  forbidden  to  alter the Channels buffer from HTTP contexts.  So only Channel.input(), Channel.output(), Channel.may_recv(), Channel.is_full() and Channel.is_resp() can be called
                 from a HTTP context.

              All the functions provided by this class are available in the sample-fetches, actions and filters contexts. For filters, incoming data (offset and length) are relative to the  filter.  Some
              functions may yield, but only for actions. Yield is not possible for sample-fetches, converters and filters.

       Channel.append(channel, string)
              This function copies the string string at the end of incoming data of the channel buffer. The function returns the copied length on success or -1 if data cannot be copied.

              Same that Channel.insert(channel, string, channel:input())().

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • string (string()) -- The data to copy at the end of incoming data.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

       Channel.data(channel[, offset[, length]])
              This function returns length bytes of incoming data from the channel buffer, starting at the offset offset. The data are not removed from the buffer.

              By  default,  if no length is provided, all incoming data found, starting at the given offset, are returned. If length is set to -1, the function tries to retrieve a maximum of data and, if
              called by an action, it yields if necessary. It also waits for more data if the requested length exceeds the available amount of incoming data. Not providing an offset is the same  as  set‐
              ting it to 0. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data of the channel buffer while negative offset is relative to the end.

              If there is no incoming data and the channel can't receive more data, a 'nil' value is returned.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • offset (integer()) -- optional The offset in incoming data to start to get data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of incoming data.

                     • length (integer()) -- optional The expected length of data to retrieve. All incoming data by default. May be set to -1 to get a maximum of data.

              Returns
                     a string containing the data found or nil.

       Channel.forward(channel, length)
              This  function forwards length bytes of data from the channel buffer. If the requested length exceeds the available amount of incoming data, and if called by an action, the function yields,
              waiting for more data to forward. It returns the amount of data forwarded.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • int (integer()) -- The amount of data to forward.

       Channel.input(channel)
              This function returns the length of incoming data in the channel buffer. When called by a filter, this value is relative to the filter.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of available bytes.

       Channel.insert(channel, string[, offset])
              This function copies the string string at the offset offset in incoming data of the channel buffer. The function returns the copied length on success or -1 if data cannot be copied.

              By default, if no offset is provided, the string is copied in front of incoming data. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data of the channel  buffer  while  negative
              offset is relative to their end.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • string (string()) -- The data to copy into incoming data.

                     • offset (integer()) -- optional The offset in incoming data where to copy data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of incoming data.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

       Channel.is_full(channel)
              This function returns true if the channel buffer is full.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

              Returns
                     a boolean

       Channel.is_resp(channel)
              This function returns true if the channel is the response one.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

              Returns
                     a boolean

       Channel.line(channel[, offset[, length]])
              This function parses length bytes of incoming data of the channel buffer, starting at offset offset, and returns the first line found, including the '\n'.  The data are not removed from the
              buffer. If no line is found, all data are returned.

              By default, if no length is provided, all incoming data, starting at the given offset, are evaluated. If length is set to -1, the function tries to retrieve a maximum of data and, if called
              by an action, yields if necessary. It also waits for more data if the requested length exceeds the available amount of incoming data. Not providing an offset is the same as setting it to 0.
              A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data of the channel buffer while negative offset is relative to the end.

              If there is no incoming data and the channel can't receive more data, a 'nil' value is returned.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • offset (integer()) -- optional The offset in incoming data to start to parse data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of incoming data.

                     • length (integer()) -- optional The length of data to parse. All incoming data by default. May be set to -1 to get a maximum of data.

              Returns
                     a string containing the line found or nil.

       Channel.may_recv(channel)
              This function returns true if the channel may still receive data.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

              Returns
                     a boolean

       Channel.output(channel)
              This function returns the length of outgoing data of the channel buffer. When called by a filter, this value is relative to the filter.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of available bytes.

       Channel.prepend(channel, string)
              This function copies the string string in front of incoming data of the channel buffer. The function returns the copied length on success or -1 if data cannot be copied.

              Same that Channel.insert(channel, string, 0)().

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • string (string()) -- The data to copy in front of incoming data.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

       Channel.remove(channel[, offset[, length]])
              This function removes length bytes of incoming data of the channel buffer, starting at offset offset. This function returns number of bytes removed on success.

              By  default, if no length is provided, all incoming data, starting at the given offset, are removed. Not providing an offset is the same as setting it to 0. A positive offset is relative to
              the beginning of incoming data of the channel buffer while negative offset is relative to the end.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • offset (integer()) -- optional The offset in incoming data where to start to remove data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of incoming data.

                     • length (integer()) -- optional The length of data to remove. All incoming data by default.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of bytes removed.

       Channel.send(channel, string)
              This function requires immediate send of the string string. It means the string is copied at the beginning of incoming data of the channel buffer and immediately forwarded.  Unless  if  the
              connection is close, and if called by an action, this function yields to copy and forward all the string.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • string (string()) -- The data to send.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

       Channel.set(channel, string[, offset[, length]])
              This  function replaces length bytes of incoming data of the channel buffer, starting at offset offset, by the string string. The function returns the copied length on success or -1 if data
              cannot be copied.

              By default, if no length is provided, all incoming data, starting at the given offset, are replaced. Not providing an offset is the same as setting it to 0. A positive offset is relative to
              the beginning of incoming data of the channel buffer while negative offset is relative to the end.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

                     • string (string()) -- The data to copy into incoming data.

                     • offset (integer()) -- optional The offset in incoming data where to start the data replacement. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of incoming data.

                     • length (integer()) -- optional The length of data to replace. All incoming data by default.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

       Channel.dup(channel)
              DEPRECATED

              This function returns all incoming data found in the channel buffer. The data are not removed from the buffer and can be reprocessed later.

              If there is no incoming data and the channel can't receive more data, a 'nil' value is returned.

              Arguments

                     • channel (class_channel()) -- The manipulated Channel.

              Returns
                     a string containing all data found or nil.

              WARNING:
                 This function is deprecated. Channel.data() must be used instead.

       Channel.get(channel)
              DEPRECATED

              This function returns all incoming data found in the channel buffer and remove them from the buffer.

                     • ifexist (boolean()) -- If this parameter is set to true the variable will only be set if it was defined elsewhere (i.e. used within the configuration).  For global variables (using
                       the "proc" scope), they will only be updated and never created. It is highly recommended to always set this to true.

       TXN.unset_var(TXN, var)
              Unset the variable <var>.

              Arguments

                     • txn (class_txn()) -- The class txn object containing the data.

                     • var (string()) -- The variable name according with the HAProxy variable syntax.

       TXN.get_var(TXN, var)
              Returns data stored in the variable <var> converter in Lua type.

              Arguments

                     • txn (class_txn()) -- The class txn object containing the data.

                     • var (string()) -- The variable name according with the HAProxy variable syntax.

       TXN.reply([reply])
              Return a new reply object

              Arguments

                     • reply (table()) -- A table containing info to initialize the reply fields.

              Returns
                     A Reply class object.

              The table used to initialized the reply object may contain following entries :

              • status : The reply status code. the code 200 is used by default.

              • reason : The reply reason. The reason corresponding to the status code is used by default.

              • headers : A list of headers, indexed by header name. Empty by default. For a given name, multiple values are possible, stored in an ordered list.

              • body : The reply body, empty by default.

          local reply = txn:reply{
              status  = 400,
              reason  = "Bad request",
              headers = {
                  ["content-type"]  = { "text/html" },
                  ["cache-control"] = {"no-cache", "no-store" }
              },
              body = "<html><body><h1>invalid request<h1></body></html>"
          }

       TXN.done(txn[, reply])
              This function terminates processing of the transaction and the associated session and optionally reply to the client for HTTP sessions.

              Arguments

                     • txn (class_txn()) -- The class txn object containing the data.

                     • reply (class_reply()) -- The class reply object to return to the client.

              This  functions  can  be  used when a critical error is detected or to terminate processing after some data have been returned to the client (eg: a redirect).  To do so, a reply may be pro‐
              vided. This object is optional and may contain a status code, a reason, a header list and a body. All these fields are optional. When not provided, the default values are used. By  default,
              with  an empty reply object, an empty HTTP 200 response is returned to the client. If no reply object is provided, the transaction is terminated without any reply. If a reply object is pro‐
              vided, it must not exceed the buffer size once converted into the internal HTTP representation. Because for now there is no easy way to be sure it fits, it is probably  better  to  keep  it
              reasonably small.

              The reply object may be fully created in lua or the class Reply may be used to create it.

          local reply = txn:reply()
          reply:set_status(400, "Bad request")
          reply:add_header("content-type", "text/html")
          reply:add_header("cache-control", "no-cache")
          reply:add_header("cache-control", "no-store")
          reply:set_body("<html><body><h1>invalid request<h1></body></html>")
          txn:done(reply)

          txn:done{
              status  = 400,
              reason  = "Bad request",
              headers = {
                  ["content-type"]  = { "text/html" },
                  ["cache-control"] = { "no-cache", "no-store" },
              },
              body = "<html><body><h1>invalid request<h1></body></html>"
          }

          WARNING:
              It  does  not  make sense to call this function from sample-fetches. In this case the behavior is the same than core.done(): it finishes the Lua execution. The transaction is really aborted
              only from an action registered function.

       class Reply()
              context: action

              This class represents a HTTP response message. It provides some methods to enrich it. Once converted into the internal HTTP representation, the response message must not exceed  the  buffer
              size. Because for now there is no easy way to be sure it fits, it is probably better to keep it reasonably small.

                     • body (string()) -- The reply payload.

       class Socket()
              This class must be compatible with the Lua Socket class. Only the 'client' functions are available. See the Lua Socket documentation:

              http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/tcp.html

       Socket.close(socket)
              Closes a TCP object. The internal socket used by the object is closed and the local address to which the object was bound is made available to other applications. No further operations (ex‐
              cept for further calls to the close method) are allowed on a closed Socket.

              Arguments

                     • socket (class_socket()) -- Is the manipulated Socket.

              Note: It is important to close all used sockets once they are not needed, since, in many systems, each socket uses a file descriptor, which are limited system  resources.  Garbage-collected
              objects are automatically closed before destruction, though.

       Socket.connect(socket, address[, port])
              Attempts to connect a socket object to a remote host.

              In case of error, the method returns nil followed by a string describing the error. In case of success, the method returns 1.

              Arguments

                     • socket (class_socket()) -- Is the manipulated Socket.

                     • address (string()) -- can be an IP address or a host name. See below for more information.

                     • port (integer()) -- must be an integer number in the range [1..64K].

              Returns
                     1 or nil.

              An  address  field  extension permits to use the connect() function to connect to other stream than TCP. The syntax containing a simpleipv4 or ipv6 address is the basically expected format.
              This format requires the port.

              Other format accepted are a socket path like "/socket/path", it permits to connect to a socket. Abstract namespaces are supported with the prefix "abns@", and finally a file descriptor  can
              be  passed with the prefix "fd@".  The prefix "ipv4@", "ipv6@" and "unix@" are also supported. The port can be passed int the string. The syntax "127.0.0.1:1234" is valid. In this case, the
              parameter port must not be set.

       Socket.connect_ssl(socket, address, port)
              Same behavior than the function socket:connect, but uses SSL.

              Arguments

                     • socket (class_socket()) -- Is the manipulated Socket.

              Returns
                     1 or nil.

       Socket.getpeername(socket)
              Returns information about the remote side of a connected client object.

              Returns a string with the IP address of the peer, followed by the port number that peer is using for the connection. In case of error, the method returns nil.

              Arguments

                     • socket (class_socket()) -- Is the manipulated Socket.

              Returns
                     a string containing the server information.

       Socket.getsockname(socket)
              Returns the local address information associated to the object.

              The method returns a string with local IP address and a number with the port.  In case of error, the method returns nil.

              Arguments

                     • socket (class_socket()) -- Is the manipulated Socket.

              Returns
                     a string containing the client information.

       Socket.receive(socket[, pattern[, prefix]])
              Reads data from a client object, according to the specified read pattern.  Patterns follow the Lua file I/O format, and the difference in performance between all patterns is negligible.

              Arguments

                     • socket (class_socket()) -- Is the manipulated Socket.

                     • pattern (string|integer()) -- Describe what is required (see below).

                     • prefix (string()) -- A string which will be prefix the returned data.

              Returns
                     a string containing the required data or nil.

              Pattern can be any of the following:

              •

                `*a`: reads from the socket until the connection is closed. No
                       end-of-line translation is performed;

              •

                `*l`: reads a line of text from the Socket. The line is terminated by a
                       LF character (ASCII 10), optionally preceded by a CR character (ASCII 13). The CR and LF characters are not included in the returned line.  In fact, all CR characters  are  ignored
                       by the pattern. This is the default pattern.

              •

                number: causes the method to read a specified number of bytes from the
                       Socket. Prefix is an optional string to be concatenated to the beginning of any received data before return.

              • empty: If the pattern is left empty, the default option is *l.

              If  successful,  the  method  returns the received pattern. In case of error, the method returns nil followed by an error message which can be the string 'closed' in case the connection was
              closed before the transmission was completed or the string 'timeout' in case there was a timeout during the operation. Also, after the error message, the function returns the partial result
              of the transmission.

              Important note: This function was changed severely. It used to support multiple patterns (but I have never seen this feature used) and now it doesn't anymore.  Partial results  used  to  be
              returned in the same way as successful results. This last feature violated the idea that all functions should return nil on error.  Thus it was changed too.

       Socket.send(socket, data[, start[, end]])
              Sends data through client object.

              Arguments

                     • socket (class_socket()) -- Is the manipulated Socket.

                     • data (string()) -- The data that will be sent.

                     • start (integer()) -- The start position in the buffer of the data which will be sent.

                     • end (integer()) -- The end position in the buffer of the data which will be sent.

              Returns
                     see below.

              Data is the string to be sent. The optional arguments i and j work exactly like the standard string.sub Lua function to allow the selection of a substring to be sent.

              If  successful,  the  method  returns  the index of the last byte within [start, end] that has been sent. Notice that, if start is 1 or absent, this is effectively the total number of bytes
              sent. In case of error, the method returns nil, followed by an error message, followed by the index of the last byte within [start, end] that has been sent. You might want to try again from
              the byte following that. The error message can be 'closed' in case the connection was closed before the transmission was completed or the string 'timeout' in case there was a timeout during
              the operation.

              Note: Output is not buffered. For small strings, it is always better to concatenate them in Lua (with the '..' operator) and send the result in one call instead of calling the  method  sev‐
              eral times.

       Socket.setoption(socket, option[, value])
              Just implemented for compatibility, this cal does nothing.

       Socket.settimeout(socket, value[, mode])
              Changes  the  timeout  values  for the object. All I/O operations are blocking.  That is, any call to the methods send, receive, and accept will block indefinitely, until the operation com‐
              pletes. The settimeout method defines a limit on the amount of time the I/O methods can block. When a timeout time has elapsed, the affected methods give up and fail with an error code.

              The amount of time to wait is specified as the value parameter, in seconds.

              The timeout modes are not implemented, the only settable timeout is the inactivity time waiting for complete the internal buffer send or waiting for receive data.

              Arguments

                     • socket (class_socket()) -- Is the manipulated Socket.

                     • value (float()) -- The timeout value. Use floating point to specify milliseconds.

       class Regex()
              This class allows the usage of HAProxy regexes because classic lua doesn't provides regexes. This class inherits the HAProxy compilation options, so the regexes  can  be  libc  regex,  pcre
              regex or pcre JIT regex.

              The expression matching number is limited to 20 per regex. The only available option is case sensitive.

              Because regexes compilation is a heavy process, it is better to define all your regexes in the body context and use it during the runtime.

          -- Create the regex
          st, regex = Regex.new("needle (..) (...)", true);

          -- Check compilation errors
          if st == false then
            print "error: " .. regex
          end

          -- Match the regexes
          print(regex:exec("Looking for a needle in the haystack")) -- true
          print(regex:exec("Lokking for a cat in the haystack"))    -- false

          -- Extract words
          st, list = regex:match("Looking for a needle in the haystack")
          print(st)      -- true
          print(list[1]) -- needle in the
          print(list[2]) -- in
          print(list[3]) -- the

       Regex.new(regex, case_sensitive)
              Create and compile a regex.

              Arguments

                     • regex (string()) -- The regular expression according with the libc or pcre standard

                     • case_sensitive (boolean()) -- Match is case sensitive or not.

              Returns
                     boolean status and Regex class or string containing fail reason.

       Regex.exec(regex, str)
              Execute the regex.

              Arguments

                     • regex (class_regex()) -- A Regex class object.

                     • str (string()) -- The input string will be compared with the compiled regex.

              Returns
                     a boolean status according with the match result, and a table containing all the string matched in order of declaration.

       class Map()
              This class permits to do some lookups in HAProxy maps. The declared maps can be modified during the runtime through the HAProxy management socket.

          default = "usa"

          -- Create and load map
          geo = Map.new("geo.map", Map._ip);

          -- Create new fetch that returns the user country
          core.register_fetches("country", function(txn)
            local src;
            local loc;

            src = txn.f:fhdr("x-forwarded-for");
            if (src == nil) then
              src = txn.f:src()
              if (src == nil) then
                return default;
              end
            end

            -- Perform lookup
            loc = geo:lookup(src);

       class Patref()
              Patref  object corresponds to the internal HAProxy pat_ref element which is used to store ACL and MAP elements. It is identified by its name (reference) which often is a filename, unless it
              is prefixed by 'virt@' for virtual references or 'opt@' for references that don't necessarily point to real file. From Lua, Patref class object may be used to directly  manipulate  existing
              pattern  reference storage. For convenience, Patref objects may be directly accessed and listed as a table thanks to index and pairs metamethods. Note however that for the index metamethod,
              in case of duplicated entries, only the first matching entry is returned.

              WARNING:
                 Not meant to be shared between multiple contexts. If multiple contexts need to work on the same pattern reference, each context should have its own patref object.

              Patref object is obtained using the core.get_patref() function

       Patref.get_name(ref)

              Returns
                     the name of the pattern reference object.

       Patref.is_map(ref)

              Returns
                     true if the pattern reference is used to handle maps instead of acl, false otherwise.

       Patref.purge(ref)
              Completely prune all pattern reference entries pointed to by Patref object.  This special operation doesn't require committing.

       Patref.prepare(ref)
              Create a new empty version for Patref Object. It can be used to manipulate the Patref object with update methods without applying the updates until the commit() method is called.

       Patref.commit(ref)
              Tries to commit pending Patref object updates, that is updates made to the local object will be committed to the underlying pattern reference storage in an atomic manner upon success.  Upon
              failure,  local pending updates are lost. Upon success, all other pending updates on the pattern reference (e.g.: "prepare" from the cli or from other Patref Lua objects) started before the
              new one will be pruned.

              Returns
                     true on success and nil on failure (followed by an error message).

              See Patref.prepare() and Patref.giveup()

       Patref.giveup(ref)
              Drop the pending patref version created using Patref:prepare(): get back to live dataset.

       Patref.add(ref, key[, value])
              Add a new key to the pattern reference, with associated value for maps.

              Arguments

                     • key (string()) -- the string used as a key

                     • value (string()) -- the string used as value to be associated with the key (only relevant for maps)

              Returns
                     true on success and nil on failure (followed by an error message).

              NOTE:
                 Affects the live pattern reference version, unless Patref.prepare() was called and is still ongoing (waiting for commit or giveup)

       patref.add_bulk(ref, table)
              Adds multiple entries at once to the Pattern reference. It is recommended to use this one over Patref.prepare() to add a lot of entries at once because this one is more efficient.

              Arguments

                     • table (table()) --

                       For ACL, a table of keys strings: t[0] = "key1", t[1] = "key2"...

                       For Maps, a table of key:value string pairs: t["key"] = "value"

              Returns
                     true on success and nil on failure (followed by an error message).

              NOTE:
                 Affects the live pattern reference version, unless Patref.prepare() was called and is still pending (waiting for commit or giveup)

       Patref.del(ref, key)
              Delete all entries matching the input key in the pattern reference. In case of duplicate keys, all keys are removed.

              Arguments

                     • key (string()) -- the string used as a key

              Returns
                     true on success and false on failure.

              NOTE:
                 Affects the live pattern reference version, unless Patref.prepare() was called and is still ongoing (waiting for commit or giveup)

       Patref.set(ref, key, value[, force])
              Only relevant for maps. Set existing entries matching key to the provided value. In case of duplicate keys, all matching keys will be set to the new value.

              Arguments

                     • key (string()) -- the string used as a key

                     • value (string()) -- the string used as value

                     • force (boolean()) -- create the entry if it doesn't exist (optional, defaults to false)

              Returns
                     true on success and nil on failure (followed by an error message)

              NOTE:
                 Affects the live pattern reference version, unless Patref.prepare() was called and is still ongoing (waiting for commit or giveup)

       Patref.event_sub(ref, event_types, func)
              Register a function that will be called on specific PAT_REF events.  See core.event_sub() for generalities. Please note however that for performance reasons  pattern  reference  events  can
              only be subscribed per pattern reference (not globally). What this means is that the provided callback function will only be called for events affecting the pattern reference pointed by the
              Patref object (ref) passed as parameter.

              If you want to be notified for events on a given set of pattern references, it is still possible to perform as many per-patref subscriptions as needed.

              Also, for PAT_REF events, no event data is provided (known as "event_data" in callback function's prototype from core.event_sub())

              The list of the available event types for the PAT_REF family are:

                     • PAT_REF_ADD: element was added to the current version of the pattern reference

                     • PAT_REF_DEL: element was deleted from the current version of the pattern reference

                     • PAT_REF_SET: element was modified in the current version of the pattern reference

                     • PAT_REF_CLEAR: all elements were cleared from the current version of the pattern reference

                     • PAT_REF_COMMIT: pending element(s) was/were committed in the current version of the pattern reference

                 NOTE:
                     Use PAT_REF in event_types to subscribe to all pattern reference events types at once.

              Here is a working example showing how to trigger a callback function for the pattern reference associated to file "test.map":

          core.register_init(function()
            -- We assume that "test.map" is a map file referenced in haproxy config
            -- file, thus it is loaded during config parsing and is expected to be
            -- available at init Lua stage. Indeed, the below code wouldn't work if
            -- used directly within body context, as at that time the config is not
            -- fully parsed.
            local map_patref = core.get_patref("test.map")
            map_patref:event_sub({"PAT_REF_ADD"}, function(event, data, sub)
              -- in the patref event handler
              print("entry added!")
            end)
          end)

       class AppletHTTP()
              This class is used with applets that requires the 'http' mode. The http applet can be registered with the core.register_service() function. They are used for processing an http request like
              a server in back of HAProxy.

              This is an hello world sample code:

          core.register_service("hello-world", "http", function(applet)
             local response = "Hello World !"
             applet:set_status(200)
             applet:add_header("content-length", string.len(response))
             applet:add_header("content-type", "text/plain")
             applet:start_response()
             applet:send(response)
          end)

              Returns
                     A Fetches class

              This  attribute  contains a Fetches class object. Note that the applet execution place cannot access to a valid HAProxy core HTTP transaction, so some sample fetches related to the HTTP de‐
              pendent values (hdr, path, ...) are not available.

       AppletHTTP.sf

              Returns
                     A Fetches class

              This attribute contains a Fetches class object. The functions of this object always return a string. Note that the applet execution place cannot access to a valid HAProxy core HTTP transac‐
              tion, so some sample fetches related to the HTTP dependent values (hdr, path, ...) are not available.

       AppletHTTP.method

              Returns
                     string

              The attribute method returns a string containing the HTTP method.

              Returns
                     string

              The attribute qs returns a string containing the HTTP request query string.

       AppletHTTP.length

              Returns
                     integer

              The attribute length returns an integer containing the HTTP body length.

       AppletHTTP.headers

              Returns
                     table

              The attribute headers returns a table containing the HTTP headers. The header names are always in lower case. As the header name can be encountered more than once in each request, the value
              is indexed with 0 as first index value. The table has this form:

          AppletHTTP.headers['<header-name>'][<header-index>] = "<header-value>"

          AppletHTTP.headers["host"][0] = "www.test.com"
          AppletHTTP.headers["accept"][0] = "audio/basic q=1"
          AppletHTTP.headers["accept"][1] = "audio/*, q=0.2"

       AppletHTTP.add_header(applet, name, value)
              This function adds a header in the response. Duplicated headers are not collapsed. The special header content-length is used to determinate the response length. If  it  does  not  exist,  a
              transfer-encoding: chunked is set, and all the write from the function AppletHTTP:send() become a chunk.

              Arguments

                     • applet (class_AppletHTTP()) -- An AppletHTTP class

                     • name (string()) -- the header name

                     • value (string()) -- the header value

       AppletHTTP.start_response(applet)
              This  function  indicates  to the HTTP engine that it can process and send the response headers. After this called we cannot add headers to the response; We cannot use the AppletHTTP:send()
              function if the AppletHTTP:start_response() is not called.

              Arguments

              Returns
                     a string. The string can be empty if we reach the end of the stream.

       AppletHTTP.receive(applet[, size])
              Reads  data  from  the HTTP body, according to the specified read size. If the size is missing, the function tries to read all the content of the stream until the end. If the size is bigger
              than the http body, it returns the amount of data available.

              Arguments

       class AppletTCP()
              This class is used with applets that requires the 'tcp' mode. The tcp applet can be registered with the core.register_service() function. They are used for processing a tcp  stream  like  a
              server in back of HAProxy.

       AppletTCP.c

              Returns
                     A Converters class

              This attribute contains a Converters class object.

       AppletTCP.sc

              Returns
                     A Converters class

              This attribute contains a Converters class object. The functions of this object always return a string.

       AppletTCP.f

              Returns
                     A Fetches class

              This attribute contains a Fetches class object.

       AppletTCP.sf

              Returns
                     A Fetches class

              This attribute contains a Fetches class object.

       AppletTCP.getline(applet)
              This function returns a string containing one line from the stream. If the data returned doesn't contains a final '\n' its assumed than its the last available data before the end of stream.

              Arguments

                     • applet (class_AppletTCP()) -- An AppletTCP class

              Returns
                     a string. The string can be empty if we reach the end of the stream.

       AppletTCP.receive(applet[, size[, timeout]])
              Reads data from the TCP stream, according to the specified read size. If the size is missing, the function tries to read all the content of the stream until the end. An optional timeout may
              be  specified in milliseconds. In this case the function will return no longer than this delay, with the amount of available data, or nil if there is no data. An empty string is returned if
              the connection is closed.

              Arguments

                     • applet (class_AppletTCP()) -- An AppletTCP class

              Returns
                     return nil if the timeout has expired and no data was available but can still be received. Otherwise, a string is returned, possibly an empty string if the connection is closed.

       AppletTCP.try_receive(applet)
              Reads available data from the TCP stream and returns immediately. Returns a string containing read bytes or nil if no bytes are available at that time. An empty string is  returned  if  the
              connection is closed.

              Arguments

                     • applet (class_AppletTCP()) -- An AppletTCP class

              Returns

              See    AppletTCP.set_priv()

       AppletTCP.set_priv(applet, data)
              Store any data in the current HAProxy transaction. This action replaces the old stored data.

              Arguments

                     • data (opaque()) -- The data which is stored in the transaction.

              See    AppletTCP.get_priv()

       AppletTCP.set_var(applet, var, value[, ifexist])
              Converts a Lua type in a HAProxy type and stores it in a variable <var>.

              Arguments

                     • applet (class_AppletTCP()) -- An AppletTCP class

       class StickTable()
              context: task, action, sample-fetch

              This class can be used to access the HAProxy stick tables from Lua.

       StickTable.info()
              Returns stick table attributes as a Lua table. See HAProxy documentation for "stick-table" for canonical info, or check out example below.

              Returns
                     Lua table

              Assume our table has IPv4 key and gpc0 and conn_rate "columns":

          {
            expire=<int>,  # Value in ms
            size=<int>,    # Maximum table size
            used=<int>,    # Actual number of entries in table
            data={         # Data columns, with types as key, and periods as values
                             (-1 if type is not rate counter)
              conn_rate=<int>,
              gpc0=-1
            },
            length=<int>,  # max string length for string table keys, key length
                           # otherwise
            nopurge=<boolean>, # purge oldest entries when table is full
            type="ip"      # can be "ip", "ipv6", "integer", "string", "binary"
          }

       StickTable.lookup(key)
              Returns stick table entry for given <key>

              Arguments

                     • key (string()) -- Stick table key (IP addresses and strings are supported)

              Returns
                     Lua table

       StickTable.dump([filter])
              Returns  all  entries in stick table. An optional filter can be used to extract entries with specific data values. Filter is a table with valid comparison operators as keys followed by data
              type name and value pairs.  Check out the HAProxy docs for "show table" for more details. For the reference, the supported operators are:
                 "eq", "ne", "le", "lt", "ge", "gt"

              For large tables, execution of this function can take a long time (for HAProxy standards). That's also true when filter is used, so take care and measure the impact.

              Arguments

                     • filter (table()) -- Stick table filter

              Returns
                     Stick table entries (table)

              See below for example filter, which contains 4 entries (or comparisons).  (Maximum number of filter entries is 4, defined in the source code)

          local filter = {
            {"gpc0", "gt", 30}, {"gpc1", "gt", 20}}, {"conn_rate", "le", 10}
          }

       class Act()
              context: action

              This class contains all return codes an action may return. It is the lua equivalent to HAProxy "ACT_RET_*" code.

          core.register_action("deny", { "http-req" }, function (txn)
              return act.DENY
           end)

       act.CONTINUE
              This attribute is an integer (0). It instructs HAProxy to continue the current ruleset processing on the message. It is the default return code for a lua action.

              Returns
                     integer

       act.STOP
              This attribute is an integer (1). It instructs HAProxy to stop the current ruleset processing on the message.

       act.YIELD
              This attribute is an integer (2). It instructs HAProxy to temporarily pause the message processing. It will be resumed later on the same rule. The corresponding lua  script  is  re-executed
              for the start.

       act.ERROR
              This  attribute is an integer (3). It triggers an internal errors The message processing is stopped and the transaction is terminated. For HTTP streams, an HTTP 500 error is returned to the
              client.

              Returns
                     integer

       act.DONE
              This attribute is an integer (4). It instructs HAProxy to stop the message processing.

              Returns
                     integer

       act.DENY
              This attribute is an integer (5). It denies the current message. The message processing is stopped and the transaction is terminated. For HTTP streams, an HTTP 403 error is returned to  the
              client if the deny is returned during the request analysis. During the response analysis, a HTTP 502 error is returned and the server response is discarded.

              Returns
                     integer

       act.ABORT
              This  attribute  is  an integer (6). It aborts the current message. The message processing is stopped and the transaction is terminated. For HTTP streams, HAProxy assumes a response was al‐
              ready sent to the client. From the Lua actions point of view, when this code is used, the transaction is terminated with no reply.

              Returns
                     integer

       act.INVALID
              This attribute is an integer (7). It triggers an internal errors. The message processing is stopped and the transaction is terminated. For HTTP streams, an HTTP 400 error is returned to the
              client if the error is returned during the request analysis. During the response analysis, a HTTP 502 error is returned and the server response is discarded.

              Returns
                     integer

       act:wake_time(milliseconds)
              context: action

              Set the script pause timeout to the specified time, defined in milliseconds.

              Arguments

                     • milliseconds (integer()) -- the required milliseconds.

              This function may be used when a lua action returns act.YIELD, to force its wake-up at most after the specified number of milliseconds.

       class filter()
              context: filter

              This class contains return codes some filter callback functions may return. It also contains configuration flags and some helper functions. To understand  how  the  filter  API  works,  see
              doc/internals/api/filters.txt documentation.

       filter.CONTINUE
              This attribute is an integer (1). It may be returned by some filter callback functions to instruct this filtering step is finished for this filter.

       filter.WAIT
              This  attribute is an integer (0). It may be returned by some filter callback functions to instruct the filtering must be paused, waiting for more data or for an external event depending on
              this filter.

       filter.ERROR
              This attribute is an integer (-1). It may be returned by some filter callback functions to trigger an error.

       filter.FLT_CFG_FL_HTX
              This attribute is a flag corresponding to the filter flag FLT_CFG_FL_HTX. When it is set for a filter, it means the filter is able to filter HTTP streams.

       filter.register_data_filter(chn)
              context: filter

              Enable the data filtering on the channel chn for the current filter. It may be called at any time from any callback functions proceeding the data analysis.

              Arguments

                     • chn (class_Channel()) -- A Channel class.

       filter.unregister_data_filter(chn)
              context: filter

              Disable the data filtering on the channel chn for the current filter. It may be called at any time from any callback functions.

              Arguments

                     • chn (class_Channel()) -- A Channel class.

       filter.wake_time(milliseconds)

              Set the script pause timeout to the specified time, defined in milliseconds.

              Arguments

                     • milliseconds (integer()) -- the required milliseconds.

              This function may be used from any lua filter callback function to force its wake-up at most after the specified number of milliseconds. Especially, when filter.CONTINUE is returned.

       A filters is declared using core.register_filter() function. The provided class will be used to instantiate filters. It may define following attributes:

       •

         id: The filter identifier. It is a string that identifies the filter and is
                optional.

       •

         flags: The filter flags. Only filter.FLT_CFG_FL_HTX may be set
                for now.

       Such filter class must also define all required callback functions in the following list. Note that Filter.new() must be defined otherwise the filter is ignored. Others are optional.

       •

         FILTER.new()

         Called to instantiate a new filter. This function must be defined.

              This function returns length bytes of incoming data from the HTTP message http_msg, starting at the offset offset. The data are not removed from the buffer.

              By default, if no length is provided, all incoming data found, starting at the given offset, are returned. If length is set to -1, the function tries to retrieve a maximum of data.  Because
              it  is called in the filter context, it never yield. Not providing an offset is the same as setting it to 0. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data of the http_mes‐
              sage buffer while negative offset is relative to their end.

              If there is no incoming data and the HTTP message can't receive more data, a 'nil' value is returned.

              Arguments

                     • http_msg (class_httpmessage()) -- The manipulated HTTP message.

              This  function  requires immediate send of the string string. It means the string is copied at the beginning of incoming data of the HTTP message http_msg and immediately forwarded. Because
              it is called in the filter context, it never yields.

              Arguments

                     • http_msg (class_httpmessage()) -- The manipulated HTTP message.

                     • string (string()) -- The data to send.

              Returns
                     an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

       HTTPMessage.set_body_len(http_msg, length)
              This  function changes the expected payload length of the HTTP message http_msg. length can be an integer value. In that case, a "Content-Length" header is added with the given value. It is
              also possible to pass the "chunked" string instead of an integer value to force the HTTP message to be chunk-encoded. In that case, a "Transfer-Encoding" header is added with the  "chunked"
              value. In both cases, all existing "Content-Length" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers are removed.

              This  function  should  be  used  in  the  filter  context  to  be  able  to  alter  the  payload  of  the  HTTP  message.  The  internal  state  of the HTTP message is updated accordingly.
              HTTPMessage.add_header() or HTTPMessage.set_header() functions must be used in that case.

              Arguments
