NAME
       ubuntu-dev-tools - Configuration for the ubuntu-dev-tools package.

DESCRIPTION
       The  ubuntu-dev-tools package is similar in scope to the devscripts(1) package, providing a collection of scripts which may be of use to Ubuntu and Debian developers or others wishing to build De‐
       bian packages.

       Some of these scripts have options which may be configured on a system-wide and per-user basis.  These options are configured in devscripts.conf(5).

       All variables are described in the script's manpages. Package-wide variables begin with "UBUNTUTOOLS" and are listed below.

       Every script which reads the configuration files can be forced to ignore them by using the --no-conf command-line option.

ENVIRONMENT
       All ubuntu-dev-tools configuration variables can be set (and overridden) by setting them in the environment (unlike devscripts).

       In addition, several scripts use the following environment variables:

       UBUMAIL
              Overrides DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME when the target is clearly Ubuntu.  Can either contain an e-mail address or Full Name <email@example.org>.

       DEBEMAIL, DEBFULLNAME
              As in devscripts(1).

PACKAGE-WIDE VARIABLES
       The currently recognised package-wide variables are:

       UBUNTUTOOLS_BUILDER
              This specifies the preferred test-builder, one of pbuilder (default), sbuild, pbuilder-dist.

       UBUNTUTOOLS_DEBIAN_MIRROR
              The preferred Debian archive mirror.  Should be of the form http://ftp.debian.org/debian (no trailing slash).  If not specified, the master will be used.

       UBUNTUTOOLS_DEBSEC_MIRROR
              The preferred Debian security archive mirror.  Should be of the form http://security.debian.org (no trailing slash).  If not specified, the master will be used.

       UBUNTUTOOLS_UBUNTU_MIRROR
              The preferred Ubuntu archive mirror.  Should be of the form http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu (no trailing slash).  If not specified, the master will be used.

       UBUNTUTOOLS_UBUNTU_PORTS_MIRROR
              The preferred Ubuntu archive mirror.  Should be of the form http://ports.ubuntu.com (no trailing slash).  If not specified, the master will be used.

       UBUNTUTOOLS_LPINSTANCE
              The launchpad instance to communicate with. e.g. production (default) or staging.

       UBUNTUTOOLS_MIRROR_FALLBACK
              Whether or not to fall-back to the master archive mirror.  This is usually the desired behaviour, as mirrors can lag the masters.  If on a private network with only a local mirror, you  may
              want to set this to no.  One of yes (default) or no.

       UBUNTUTOOLS_UPDATE_BUILDER
              Whether or not to update the test-builder before each test build.  One of yes or no (default).

       UBUNTUTOOLS_WORKDIR
              The directory to use for preparing source packages etc.  When unset, defaults to a directory in /tmp/ named after the script.
