Email::Thread(3pm)                                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                  Email::Thread(3pm)

NAME
       Email::Thread - Use JWZ's mail threading algorithm with Email::Simple objects

VERSION
       version 0.713

SYNOPSIS
           use Email::Thread;
           my $threader = Email::Thread->new(@messages);

           $threader->thread;

           dump_em($_,0) for $threader->rootset;

           sub dump_em {
               my ($self, $level) = @_;
               debug (' \\-> ' x $level);
               if ($self->message) {
                   print $self->message->header("Subject") , "\n";
               } else {
                   print "[ Message $self not available ]\n";
               }
               dump_em($self->child, $level+1) if $self->child;
               dump_em($self->next, $level) if $self->next;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Strictly speaking, this doesn't really need Email::Simple objects.  It just needs an object that responds to the same API. At the time of writing the list of classes with the Email::Simple API
       comprises just Email::Simple.

       Due to how it's implemented, its API is an exact clone of Mail::Thread.  Please see that module's documentation for API details. Just mentally substitute "Email::Thread" everywhere you see
       "Mail::Thread" and "Email::Thread::Container" where you see "Mail::Thread::Container".

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That
       is, if the most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

THANKS
       Simon Cozens (SIMON) for encouraging me to release it, and for Email::Simple and Mail::Thread.

       Richard Clamp (RCLAMP) for the header patch.
