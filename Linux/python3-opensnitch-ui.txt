NAME
       opensnitch-ui - GNU/Linux interactive firewall application

SYNOPSIS
       opensnitch-ui [--socket path] [--max-clients num]

DESCRIPTION
       opensnitch-ui is the OpenSnitch GUI to view events intercepted by the daemon, and to manage the rules.  The GUI is composed of 2 components in the same script: a server and a GUI.  Once the GUI is
       launched, an icon will appear on the system tray.  If the system tray is not available or can't be used, the Events dialog will be launched.

       The  GUI  (i.e.: the server) will listen for new connections from daemons. You can have the daemon installed on multiple machines, and manage them from a centralized GUI.  https://github.com/evil‐

OPTIONS
       --socket path
              Specifies the path or network address where the GUI (i.e.: the server) will listen on.

           Examples:

           Default: unix:///tmp/osui.sock

            - Listening on a Unix socket:
              $ opensnitch-ui --socket unix:///tmp/osui.sock
            * Use unix:///run/user/YOUR_USER_ID/opensnitch/osui.sock for better privacy.

            - Listening on port 50051, all interfaces:
              $ opensnitch-ui --socket "[::]:50051"

       --max-clients num
              Maximum number of clients to allow (default: 10).

FILES
       /home/$USER/.config/opensnitch/
              Path of the GUI configuration.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If something goes wrong, like a crash, launch the GUI from a shell to view debugging messages:

              $ opensnitch-ui
