NAME
       crtest - test cases for QDBM Curia

SYNOPSIS
       crtest write [-s] [-lob] name rnum bnum dnum
       crtest read [-wb] [-lob] name
       crtest rcat [-c] name rnum bnum dnum pnum align
       crtest combo name
       crtest wicked [-c] name rnum

DESCRIPTION
       The  command `crtest' is a utility for facility test and performance test.  Check a database generated by the command or measure the execution time of the command.  This command is used in the follow‐
       ing format.  `name' specifies a database name.  `rnum' specifies the number of records.  `bnum' specifies the number of elements of a bucket array.  `dnum' specifies the number of division of a  data‐
       base.  `pnum' specifies the number of patterns of the keys.  `align' specifies the basic size of alignment.  `fbpsiz' specifies the size of the free block pool.

       crtest write [-s] [-lob] name rnum bnum dnum
              Store records with keys of 8 bytes.  They change as `00000001', `00000002'...

       crtest read [-wb] [-lob] name
              Retrieve all records of the database above.

       crtest rcat [-c] name rnum bnum dnum pnum align fbpsiz
              Store records with partway duplicated keys using concatenate mode.

       crtest combo name
              Perform combination test of various operations.

       crtest wicked [-c] name rnum
              Perform updating operations selected at random.

       Options feature the following.

              -s : make the files sparse.
              -lob : handle large objects.
              -wb : use the function `crgetwb' instead of the function `crget'.
              -c : perform comparison test with map of Cabin.

       This command returns 0 on success, another on failure.  The environment variable `QDBMDBGFD' specifies the file descriptor to output the history of updating the variable `dpecode'.
