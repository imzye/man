NAME
       Text::Patch - Patches text with given patch

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Patch;

           $output = patch( $source, $diff, STYLE => "Unified" );

           use Text::Diff;

           $src  = ...
           $dst  = ...

           $diff = diff( \$src, \$dst, { STYLE => 'Unified' } );

           $out  = patch( $src, $diff, { STYLE => 'Unified' } );

           print "Patch successful" if $out eq $dst;

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Patch combines source text with given diff (difference) data.  Diff data is produced by Text::Diff module or by the standard diff utility (man diff, see -u option).

       patch( $source, $diff, options... )
           First argument is source (original) text. Second is the diff data.  Third argument can be either hash reference with options or all the rest arguments will be considered patch options:

               $output = patch( $source, $diff, STYLE => "Unified", ... );

               $output = patch( $source, $diff, { STYLE => "Unified", ... } );

           Options are:

             STYLE => 'Unified'

           STYLE can be "Unified", "Context" or "OldStyle".

           The 'Unified' diff format looks like this:
