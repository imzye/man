NAME
       unifont-johab631 - Unifont Johab 6/3/1 file format

SYNOPSIS
       hangul-base.hex

DESCRIPTION
       This  document  describes the structure of the Unifont Johab 6/3/1 file format used as input to Hangul syllable generation programs.  Currently, three programs in the Unifont package utilize files
       in this format: unigen-hangul(1), johab2html(1), and johab2syllabes(1).  The easiest way to visualize the two-dimensional organization of all these Hangul letter variations  is  by  examining  the
       HTML output of johab2html(1) in a web browser.

       The "hangul-base.hex" file distributed with Unifont begins at hexadecimal code point 0xE000, which is the start of the Uniocde Plane 0 Private Use Area (PUA).

       The Johab 6/3/1 file format is divided into these ranges, in hexadecimal:

              Range       Hangul

              E000        Blank (filler) glyph.

              E001-E2FA   Initial  consonants  (choseong),  6  variations  each  for  the  Unicode  Hangul  Jamo  choseong  range  of U+1100..U+115E and then the Unicode Jamo Extended-A choseong range of
                          U+A960..U+A97C.

              E2FB-E420   Vowels and diphthongs (jungseong), 3 variations each for the Unicode Hangul Jamo jungseong range of U+1161..U+11A7 and then  the  Unicode  Jamo  Extended-B  jungseong  range  of
                          U+D7B0..U+D7C6.

              E421-E479   Final  consonants  (jongseong),  1  variation  each  for  the  Unicode  Hangul  Jamo  jongseong  range  of U+11A8..U+11FF and then the Unicode Jamo Extended-B jongseong range of
                          U+D7CB..U+D7FB.

              E500-E5FF   Individual Hangul Jamo letters, 1 variation each for the Unicode Hangul Jamo range of U+1100..U+11FF.

              E600-E61F   Individual Hangul Jamo Extended-A letters, 1 variation each for the Unicode Hangul Jamo Extended-A range of U+A960..U+A97F.

              E620-E66F   Individual Hangul Jamo Extended-B letters, 1 variation each for the Unicode Hangul Jamo Extended-B range of U+D7B0..D7FF.

       This johab scheme is much easier to use than the original Unifont 10/3 or 4/4 johab encoding.  That original format was adopted from Hanterm.

   FILLER GLYPH
       The first glyph in the file is a filler, with hexadecimal values of 64 zeroes.  This is used as a filler for Hangul syllable combinations that do not contain one or two of the  three  parts  of  a
       Hangul syllable.

   CHOSEONG
       These are the initial consonants in a syllable.  Each choseong has six variations:

              • Combination with a vertical vowel

              • Combination with a horizontal vowel

              • Combination with a vertical plus horizontal diphthong

              • Combination with a vertical vowel and final consonant

              • Combination with a horizontal vowel and final consonant

              • Combination with a vertical plus horizontal diphthong, and a final consonant.

       All  six  variations  are  created  in  order for the first consonant (U+1100, HANGUL CHOSEONG KIYEOK) in the file entries E001-E006, then all six for the second consonant (U+1101, HANGUL CHOSEONG
       SSANGKIYEOK) in the file entries E007-E00C, etc.

   JUNGSEONG
       These are the medial vowels and diphthongs in a syllable.  Each jungseong has three variations:

              • With initial consonant but no final consonant

              • With initial consonant and final consonant, except final consonant neiun

              • With intial consonant, and with final consonant nieun.

       Similarly as with choseong, all three variations are created in order for the first vowel (U+1161, HANGUL JUNGSEONG A) in the file entries E2FB-E2FD, then all three for the second  vowel  (U+1162,
       HANGUL JUNGSEONG AE), etc.

   JONGSEONG
       These  are  the  final consonants.  Each has only one variation.  The program unigen-hangul(1) additionally shifts these final consonants one column to the right when the vowel in the syllable has
       two long vertical strokes along the right edge, as in U+1162 (HANGUL JUNGSEONG AE).  The other two programs in the Unifont package that form  syllables,  johab2syllables(1)  and  unijohab2html(1),
       overlay all jongseong exactly as they are encoded, with no shifting or extending.

   HANGUL JAMO
       The entire Unicode Hangul Jamo range, U+1100..U+11FF, appears in entries E500-E5FF.

   HANGUL EXTENDED-A JAMO
       The Hangul Jamo Extended-A range, U+A960..U+A97F in E600-E61F.

   HANGUL EXTENDED-B JAMO
       The Hangul Jamo Extended-B range, U+D7B0..U+D7FF in E620-E66F.

FILES
       Unifont  .hex  files  in Johab 6/3/1 encoding.  Programs wishing to interact with this johab encoding can use functions contained in the file unihangul-support.c.  The programs johab2syllables(1),
       unigen-hangul(1), and unijohab2html(1) all use various functions in unihangul-support.c to generate their output.

AUTHOR
       Ho-Seok  Ee  created  the original Johab 6/2/1 format and drew the modern Hangul letters.  Paul Hardy drew the ancient vowels and suggested adding a third vowel variation, for combining with final
       consonant (jongseong) niuen, resulting in a Johab 6/3/1 encoding.  Ho-Seok Ee suggested shifting final consonants one position to the right for combination with vowels  having  two  long  vertical
       strokes on the right edge of a syllable.  Minseo Lee provided feedback on letter design details.
