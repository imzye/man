NAME
       dirfile2ascii — output dirfile database vectors as ASCII text

SYNOPSIS

       dirfile2ascii [ OPTION ]... DIRFILE [ [ -a | -A | -e | -E | -F | -g | -G | -o | -i | -u | -x | -X ] FIELD ]...

DESCRIPTION
       Fetches  data  from a dirfile(5) database specified by DIRFILE and writes it as ASCII to standard output.  Any number of vector FIELDs may be specified.  Each specified field is printed in a sepa‐
       rate column.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -d, --delimeter=delim
              separate columns by delim.  (Default: a single space.)

       -f, --first-frame=first_frame-last_frame
              read from frame first_frame to frame last_frame (inclusive).

       -f, --first-frame=first_frame:nframes
              equivalent to --first-frame=first_frame --num-frames=nframes.

       -f, --first-frame=first_frame
              If first_frame >= 0, start reading at frame first_frame.  If first_frame is -1 and --num-frames=nframes is specified, read the last nframes frames.  If --first-frame is not specified, read‐
              ing starts at frame zero.

       -n, --num-frames=nframes
              read at most nframes frames.  If not specified, or if nframes = 0, all frames to the end-of-field are read.

       -p, --precision=format
              use format to format output.  format may contain any of the flag characters, a field width, and/or a precision as specified in printf(3).  It may not contain a length modifier.

       -q, --quiet
              don't write diagnostic messages on standard error.  (This is the default behaviour).

       -s, --skip=frame_skip
              if frame_skip > 0, output only one sample for every frame_skip frames.

       -v, --verbose
              write diagnostic messages on standard error.

       -z, --fill=STRING
              Fill columns which go past the end of their corresponding field with the string STRING.  The default behaviour is to fill columns with floating-point conversions with NaN and  columns  with
              integer conversion with 0, which mirrors what occurs when an attempt is made to print data from before the start of a field.  (Note: the default behaviour cannot be reproduced with this op‐
              tion, since STRING is applied to all columns, regardless of conversion type.)

       In  addition  to  the above, each FIELD argument may be preceded by a short option, one of: -a, -A, -e, -E, -F, -g, -G, -i, -o, -u, -x, -X, indicating the conversion to be used.  See printf(3) for
       the meaning of these conversion specifiers.  The output flags, width, and precision may be specified by using --precision.  If no conversion specifier is given, %f is used.

       For conversion specifiers %a, %A, %e, %E, %f, %F, %g, %G, data is read from the dirfile as double precision floats.  For conversion specifier %i, data is read as 64-bit signed integers.  For  con‐
       version specifiers %o, %u, %x, %X, data is read as 64-bit unsigned integers.

LIMITATIONS
       No native support for printing complex data is provided.  This may be worked around by using dirfile(5) representation suffixes.  For example, the command

              dirfile2ascii DIRFILE FIELD.r FIELD.i

       will print the real and imaginary parts of the complex valued field FIELD in the first and second columns, respectively.
