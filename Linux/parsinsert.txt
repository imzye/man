NAME
       ParsInsert - Parsimonious Insertion of unclassified sequences into phylogenetic tree

DESCRIPTION
       parsinsert [options]  <insert_sequences>

       Perform Insertion of Sequences into Given Tree

       -m <mask file>           - read mask from this file

       -s <tree sequences>      - read core tree sequences from this file
              (default: PI_Tree.fasta)

       -t <tree file>           - read core tree from this file
              (default: PI_Tree.tree)

       -x <tree taxonomy>       - read core tree taxomony from this file

       -o <output file>         - output taxonomy for each insert sequence to this file
              (default: PI_Results.log)

       -l [-|<log file>]         - create log file (default is ParsInsert.log)

       -n#                      - number of best matches to display

       -c#                      - percent threshold cutoff

       -p                       - print node comments in newick file

       -D#                      - print branch lengths using # decimal places tree sequence file: PI_Tree.fasta
