NAME
       auwave - demonstrates the use of waveforms

SYNOPSIS
       auwave [-audio servername]

DESCRIPTION
       auwave  demonstrates  the  use of waveform elements.  The user can interactively select any waveform supported by the server and control its frequency and volume.  Additionally, the gain of the output
       device can be modified.

AUWAVE AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET
       auwave uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set.  For more information, see the Athena Widget Set documentation.

ENVIRONMENT
       In addition to the standard toolkit environment variables, the following environment variables are used by auwave:

       AUDIOSERVER
               This variable specifies the default audio server to contact if -audio is not specified on the command line.  If this variable is not set and the -audio is not specified on  the  command  line,
               auwave will attempt to connect to the audio server running on the X Window System display.
