NAME
       giac - computer algebra system

SYNOPSIS
       giac [options] files
       icas [options] files
       xcas  files

DESCRIPTION
       giac is an advanced symbolic and numeric calculator. The console interface is named icas or equivalently giac. The corresponding GUI program is called xcas.

       These  programs  have extensive documentation. The GIAC/XCAS manual is available in Info format by invoking `info giac`, and in HTML and DVI format in /usr/share/giac/doc. One can also obtain some
       help about a keyword like this, from inside the program:

          0>> ?gcd
          Returns the greatest common divisor of 2 polynomials of several variables
          or of 2 integers or of 2 rationals.
          (Intg(a) or Poly),(Intg(b) or Poly)
          gcd(45,75); gcd(15/7,50/9); gcd(x^2-2*x+1,x^3-1); gcd(t^2-2*t+1,t^2+t-2);
          gcd((x^2-1)*(y^2-1)*z^2,x^3*y^3*z+(-(y^3))*z+x^3*z-z)
          lcm,euler,modgcd,ezgcd,psrgcd,heugcd,Gcd

       The equivalent output may be retrieved by invoking (e.g.) `cas_help gcd`.

OPTIONS
       --version
              Show version of program.

       --texmacs
              To call giac/icas from inside Texmacs. Users should not need to do this.

       --emacs
              To call giac/icas from inside Emacs. Users should not need to do this.

       --sage To call giac/icas from inside Sage. Users should not need to do this.
