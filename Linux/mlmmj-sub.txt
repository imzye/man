DESCRIPTION
       This utility is used to subscribe people to the specified  mailinglist.
       It  will  write the email address in a file with the name of the begin‐
       ning letter of the email  address  getting  subscribed  in  the  <list‐
       dir>/subscribers.d/ directory.

       The  digest  version of the list is a list version where people receive
       postings to the list periodically (e.g. once a day)  or  when  a  large
       number  of posts have accumulated. Digest subscribers are in the <list‐
       dir>/digesters.d/ directory.

       The nomail version of the list is a list version where people are  sub‐
       scribed  like  usual,  but they won't receive any postings to the list.
       This is useful for people who read the mailinglist through a news gate‐
       way, but want to be able to post to the list. Nomail subscribers are in
       the <listdir>/nomailsubs.d/ directory.

       Unless the -U switch is used it will switch its user id to the user  id
       owning  the  list  directory.  This is done to make sure that new files
       created are having correct permissions.

       If the given address is already subscribed to the list, but to  a  dif‐
       ferent  version, the subscription is switched to that version, and con‐
       firmation and moderation are bypassed. If the address is  already  sub‐
       scribed  to  the  version  requested, a mail is sent to the subscriber,
       unless the -s switch is used.

       Subscription may  be  moderated  (if  <listdir>/control/submod  exists)
       unless  the  -f  switch is given. When a subscription is permitted by a
       gatekeeper, welcome messages are  sent  to  the  subscriber  as  usual,
       regardless of options given now.

       To  ensure  subscription  is  silent from the point of view of the sub‐
       scriber, use -f, but neither -c nor -C. To inhibit notification of  the
       owner,  use  -q.  Use  of  -s  is  recommended to ensure you don't spam
       already-subscribed addresses by accident.
