       Memory profiler for Python applications

       Run `memray run` to generate a memory profile report, then use a reporter command such as `memray flamegraph` or `memray table` to convert the results into HTML.

       Example:

              $ python3 -m memray run -o output.bin my_script.py
              $ python3 -m memray flamegraph output.bin

   positional arguments:
       {run,flamegraph,table,live,tree,parse,summary,stats,transform,attach,detach}
              Mode of operation

       run    Run the specified application and track memory usage

       flamegraph
              Generate an HTML flame graph for peak memory usage

       table  Generate an HTML table with all records in the peak memory usage

       live   Remotely monitor allocations in a text-based interface

       tree   Generate a tree view in the terminal for peak memory usage

       parse  Debug a results file by parsing and printing each record in it

       summary
              Generate a terminal-based summary report of the functions that allocate most memory

       stats  Generate high level stats of the memory usage in the terminal

       transform
              Generate reports files in different formats

       attach Begin tracking allocations in an already-started process

       detach End the tracking started by a previous ``memray attach`` call

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --verbose
              Increase verbosity. Option is additive and can be specified up to 3 times

       -V, --version
              Displays the current version of Memray
