NAME
       lbdb-fetchaddr - grab addresses from mails add append them to lbdb database

SYNOPSIS
       lbdb-fetchaddr [-d dateformat] [-x headerfieldlist] [-c charset] [-a]
       lbdb-fetchaddr [-v|-h]

DESCRIPTION
       lbdb-fetchaddr  is  a  shell  script which reads a mail on stdin. It extracts the contents of some header fields (default: `From:', `To:', `Cc:', `Resent-From:', and `Resent-To:') from the mail header
       (only addresses with a real name) and appends them to $HOME/.lbdb/m_inmail.list.  For performance issues lbdb-fetchaddr appends new addresses to this file without removing duplicates. To  get  rid  of
       duplicates, the program lbdb-munge exists, which is run by m_inmail if needed and removes duplicates.

       To use this program, put the following lines into your $HOME/.procmailrc:
            :0hc
            | lbdb-fetchaddr

       lbdb-fetchaddr  writes  the actual date to the third column of the database by using strftime(3).  It uses "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" as the default date format (e.g. "1999-04-29 14:33"). You can change this by
       using the -d option to select a different date format string as parameter of lbdb-fetchaddr command like
            :0hc
            | lbdb-fetchaddr -d "%y-%m-%d"
       which results in e.g. "99-04-29".

OPTIONS
       -v     Print version number of lbdb-fetchaddr.

       -h     Print short help of lbdb-fetchaddr.

       -d dateformat
              Use the given date format using strftime(3) syntax.

       -x headerfields
              A colon separated list of header fields, which should be searched for mail addresses.  If this option isn't given, we fall back to `from:to:cc:resent-from:resent-to'.

       -c charset
              The charset which will be used to write the database. This should be the charset which the application expects (normally the one from your current locale).  If this option isn't given, we  fall
              back to `iso-8859-15'.

       -a     Also grab addresses without a real name.  Use the local part of the mail address as real name.

FILES
       $HOME/.lbdb/m_inmail.list
       /usr/libexec/lbdb/fetchaddr
       /usr/libexec/lbdb/m_inmail

CREDITS
       Most  of  the really interesting code of this program (namely, the RFC 822 address parser used by lbdb-fetchaddr) was stolen from Michael Elkins' mutt mail user agent. Additional credits go to Brandon
       Long for putting the query functionality into mutt.
