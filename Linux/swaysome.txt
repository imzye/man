NAME
       swaysome - improve multi-output handling on sway

SYNOPSIS
       swaysome [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

DESCRIPTION
       swaysome  helps  you  configure  sway  to work a bit more like AwesomeWM (https://awesomewm.org/). This means that "workspaces" are namespaced in what are called "workspace groups", and "workspace
       groups" can be moved around the differents outputs easily.

       For example, with workspace 11 on the first output, and workspace 21 on the second output, triggering the `swaysome focus 1` shortcut to get workspace 1 would lead you to workspace 11 if your  fo‐
       cus is on the first output, and workspace 21 is the focus is on the second one.

       By  default,  `swaysome init` will create a workspace group per active output, but you may create other groups while working, by either triggering `swaysome focus-group <new-number>` and opening a
       new window, or sending an existing window to it first with `swaysome move-to-group <new-number>`.

       Here is a common use-case for this:

       output-1:
           workspace group 1:
               workspace 11: chats
               workspace 12: emails
       output-2:
           workspace group 2:
               workspace 21: IDE for first project
               workspace 22: browser for first project
               workspace 23: terminals for first project
           workspace group 3:
               workspace 31: IDE for second project
               workspace 32: browser for second project
               workspace 33: terminals for second project

       That way, when output-2 is focused on workspace group 2, be it workspace 21 or 22, the quick `$mod+<number>` (bound to `swaysome focus <number>`) shortcut won't leave workspace group  2,  allowing
       you to open multiple projects in parallel without the hassle of manually remembering how to namespace them.

       In  that  situation,  suppose  you plug in a new output, `output-3`, you may then want to focus workspace group 3 to send it to `output-3`: this is simply done by typing the shortcuts `$mod+Alt+3`
       (`swaysome focus-group 3`) then `$mod+Alt+o` (`swaysome workspace-group-next-output`).

       swaysome may also work with i3, but this is untested. Patches welcome if needed.

       swaysome should be compatible with sworkstyle (https://lib.rs/crates/sworkstyle).  If this is broken, please report a bug.

USAGE
       If you installed swaysome from your distribution's package manager, it should have provided your system with the default configuration file. In that case, you can just include from your sway  con‐
       figuration by appending the following to it:

           include /etc/sway/config.d/swaysome.conf

       Otherwise, if installing by any other way, copy the swaysome.conf file in ~/.config/sway/config.d/swaysome.conf, then append your sway configuration with this:

           include ~/.config/sway/config.d/sway.conf

       On  next  startup  of  `sway`, you should end-up with workspaces from `1` to `0`, prefixed with a screen index, giving you workspace `11` on the first screen, and workspace `21` on the second one,
       both accessible with shortcut `$mod+1` when focused on the right output.

COMMANDS
       init INDEX
              Initialize the workspace groups for all the outputs on workspace INDEX.  This command simply walks through every screen to initialize a prefixed workspace. It does it backwards so that  you
              end-up focused on the first screen, as usual.

       move INDEX
              Move the focused container to workspace INDEX (stay in the same workspace group)

       move-to-group INDEX
              Move the focused container to workspace group INDEX (keep the same workspace index)

       focus INDEX
              Focus to workspace INDEX (stay in the same workspace group)

       focus-group INDEX
              Focus to workspace group INDEX (keep the same workspace index)

       focus-all-outputs INDEX
              Focus to workspace INDEX on all the outputs at once (no keyboard shortcut bound by default for this function)

       next-output
              Move the focused container to the next output

       prev-output
              Move the focused container to the previous output

       workspace-group-next-output
              Move the focused workspace group to the next output

       workspace-group-prev-output
              Move the focused workspace group to the previous output

       next-group
              Move the focused container to the next group

       prev-group
              Move the focused container to the previous group

       rearrange-workspaces
              Rearrange already opened workspaces to the correct outputs, useful when plugging new monitors
