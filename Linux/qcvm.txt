NAME
     qcvm — A standalone QuakeC VM binary executor

SYNOPSIS
     qcvm [options] [parameters] program-file

DESCRIPTION
     qcvm is an executor for QuakeC VM binary files created using a QC compiler such as gmqcc(1) or fteqcc. It provides a small set of builtin functions, and by default executes the main() function if there
     is one. Some options useful for debugging are available as well.

OPTIONS
     There are 2 types of options. Options for the executor, and parameter options used to add parameters which are passed to the main function on execution.

     -h, --help
             Show a usage message and exit.

     -trace  Trace the execution. Each instruction will be printed to stdout before executing it.

     -profile
             Perform some profiling. This is currently not really implemented, the option is available nonetheless.

     -info   Print information from the program's header instead of executing.

     -disasm
             Disassemble the program by function instead of executing.

     -disasm-func function
             Search for and disassemble the given function.

     -printdefs
             List all entries from the program's defs-section. Effectively listing all the global variables of the program.  This option disables execution.

     -printfields
             List all entries from the program's fields-section. Listing all entity-fields declared in the program.  This option disables execution.

     -printfuns
             List functions and some information about their parameters.  This option disables execution. With a verbosity level of 1, builtin numbers are printed. With a verbosity of 2, the function's sizes
             are printed as well. This takes a little longer since the size is found by searching for a ‘DONE’ instruction in the code.

     -v      Increase verbosity level, can be used multiple times.

     -vector 'x y z'
             Append a vector parameter to be passed to main().

     -float number
             Append a float parameter to be passed to main().

     -string 'text'
             Append a string parameter to be passed to main().

BUILTINS
     The following builtin functions are available:

     1) void print(string...) = #1;
           Print the passed strings to stdout. At most 8 strings are allowed.

     2) string ftos(float) = #2;
           Convert a float to a string.

     3) entity spawn() = #3;
           Spawn an entity.

     4) void remove(entity) = #4;
           Remove an entity.

     5) string vtos(vector) = #5;
           Convert a vector to a string.

     6) void error(string...) = #6;
           Print strings to stdout and then exit with an error (limited to 8 arguments)

     7) float vlen(vector) = #7;
           Get the length of a vector.

     8) string etos(entity) = #8;
           Get the entity ID as string.

     9) float stof(string) = #9;
           Convert a string to a float.

     10) string strcat(string, string) = #10;
           Concatenate two strings, returning a tempstring.

     11) float strcmp(string, string) = #11;
     12) float strncmp(string, string, float) = #11;
           Compare two strings. Returns the same as the corresponding C functions.

     12) vector normalize(vector) = #12;
           Normalize a vector so its length is 1.

     13) float sqrt(float) = #13;
           Get a value's square root.
