NAME
       alien-arena-server - wrapper script to run an Alien Arena dedicated server.

SYNOPSIS
       alien-arena-server [OPTIONS] [PARAMETERS]...
       Available options.
       [-h|--help] [-q|--quiet] [-s|--service] [-k|--kill] [-Q|--query] [-r|--rcon]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the alien-arena-server command.

       alien-arena-server  is a wrapper script used for running and maintaining Alien Arena dedicated servers. It calls other scripts ('launch-server', 'kill-runaway-crded', 'svstat', and 'rcon') depend‐
       ing on which option is chosen.  It also calls the 'alienarena-ded' binary itself if -q, --quiet, or no option is used.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -q, --quiet
              Disable console output. Only used when calling the 'alienarena-ded' binary itself.

       -s <configfile>, --service <configfile>
              Calls 'launch-server', which is a shell script designed to emulate running alienarena-ded as a persisant service under linux using a server configuration file <configfile>.
              /usr/share/games/alien-arena/arena/server.cfg is a suitable <configfile> that is already installed with the alien-arena-data package. <configfile> can be specified  as  a  path  inside  the
              .alien-arena directory which is a directory inside your home directory <$HOME/.alien-arena>. <configfile> can also be specified by its full path in this system.

       -k, --kill
              Calls 'kill-runaway-crded', which is a shell script to kill all dedicated server processes. Useful when a server session was started with -s or --service option.

       -Q, --query
              Calls 'svstat' which is a ruby script that will query local servers and produce some nice output for server admins.

       -r <server:port> password <commandstring>, --rcon <server:port> password <commandstring>
              Calls  'rcon'  which is a ruby script that sends rcon commands to servers. <server:port> is the IP address and port number of the server. "password" is the password on the server. <command‐
              string> is any rcon commands to pass to the server.

PARAMETERS
       [PARAMETERS] could be any parameter that can be passed to the script that will be called or the binary 'alienarena-ded'. For example, when using the -s or --service option, <configfile> is a para‐
       meter. Below is a list of the available parameters for each option.

       -s, --service [PARAMETERS]
              <configfile> - Any acceptable server configuration file such as /usr/share/games/alien-arena/arena/server.cfg.

       -r, --rcon [PARAMETERS]
              <server:port> password <commandstring> - <server:port> is the IP address and port number of the server. "password" is the password on the server. <commandstring> is  any  rcon  commands  to
              pass to the server.

       When calling the 'alienarena-ded' binary itself, any series of console codes can be passed to it. Alien Arena uses Quake 2 based console codes. A listing of these codes can be found <http://con‐
       sole.planetquake.gamespy.com/commands/quake_2.html>. Most of the codes described at this webpage will work for Alien Arena.
