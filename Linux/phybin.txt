NAME
       phybin - binning/clustering newick trees by topology

SYNOPSIS
       phybin [OPTION...] files or directories...

DESCRIPTION
       PhyBin takes Newick tree files as input.  Paths of Newick files can be passed directly on the command line.  Or, if directories are provided, all files in those directories will be read.  Taxa are
       named based on the files containing them.  If a file contains multiple trees, all are read by phybin, and the taxa name then includes a suffix indicating the position in the file:

              e.g. FILENAME_0, FILENAME_1, etc.

       When  clustering  trees, Phybin computes a complete all-to-all Robinson-Foulds distance matrix.  If a threshold distance (tree edit distance) is given, then a flat set of clusters will be produced
       in files clusterXX_YY.tr.  Otherwise it produces a full dendogram.

       Binning mode provides an especially quick-and-dirty form of clustering.  When running with the --bin option, only exactly equal trees are put in the same cluster.  Tree  pre-processing  still  ap‐
       plies, however: for example collapsing short branches.

   USAGE NOTES:
       * Currently phybin ignores input trees with the wrong number of taxa.

       * If given a directory as input phybin will assume all contained files are Newick trees.

OPTIONS
       -v       --verbose
              print WARNINGS and other information (recommended at first)

       -V       --version
              show version number

       -o DIR   --output=DIR
              set directory to contain all output files (default "./phybin_out/")

       --selftest
              run internal unit tests

   Clustering Options
       --bin  Use simple binning, the cheapest form of 'clustering'

       --single
              Use single-linkage clustering (nearest neighbor)

       --complete
              Use complete-linkage clustering (furthest neighbor)

       --UPGMA
              Use Unweighted Pair Group Method (average linkage) - DEFAULT mode

       --editdist=DIST
              Combine all clusters separated by DIST or less.  Report a flat list of clusters.  Irrespective of whether this is activated, a hierarchical clustering (dendogram.pdf) is produced.

   Select Robinson-Foulds (symmetric difference) distance algorithm:
       --hashrf
              (default) use a variant of the HashRF algorithm for the distance matrix

       --tolerant
              use a slower, modified RF metric that tolerates missing taxa

   Visualization
       -g       --graphbins
              use graphviz to produce .dot and .pdf output files

       -d       --drawbins
              like -g, but open GUI windows to show each bin's tree

       -w       --view
              for convenience, "view mode" simply displays input Newick files without binning

       --showtrees
              Print (textual) tree topology inside the nodes of the dendrogram

       --highlight=FILE
              Highlight nodes in the tree-of-trees (dendrogram) consistent with the.  given tree file.  Multiple highlights are permitted and use different colors.

       --interior
              Show the consensus trees for interior nodes in the dendogram, rather than just points.

   Tree pre-processing
       --prune=TAXA
              Prune trees to only TAXA before doing anything else.  Space and comma separated lists of taxa are allowed.  Use quotes.

       -b LEN   --minbranchlen=LEN
              collapse branches less than LEN

       --minbootstrap=INT
              collapse branches with bootstrap values less than INT

   Extracting taxa names
       -p NUM   --nameprefix=NUM
              Leaf names in the input Newick trees can be gene names, not taxa.  Then it is typical to extract taxa names from genes.  This option extracts a prefix of NUM characters to serve as the taxa
              name.

       -s STR   --namesep=STR
              An  alternative to --nameprefix, STR provides a set of delimeter characters, for example '-' or '0123456789'.  The taxa name is then a variable-length prefix of each gene name up to but not
              including any character in STR.

       -m FILE  --namemap=FILE
              Even once prefixes are extracted it may be necessary to use a lookup table to compute taxa names, e.g. if multiple genes/plasmids map onto one taxa.  This option specifies a text file  with
              find/replace entries of the form "<string> <taxaname>", which are applied AFTER -s and -p.

   Utility Modes
       --rfdist
              print a Robinson Foulds distance matrix for the input trees

       --setdiff
              for convenience, print the set difference between cluster*.txt files

       --print
              simply print out a concise form of each input tree

       --printnorms
              simply print out a concise and NORMALIZED form of each input tree

       --consensus
              print a strict consensus tree for the inputs, then exit

       --matching
              print a list of tree names that match any --highlight argument
