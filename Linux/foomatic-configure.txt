       foomatic-configure -n queuename [ -N description ] [ -L location ] [ -c connect ] [ -d driver ] [ -p printer ] [ --ppd ppdfile ] [ -s spooler ] [ -C [ sourcespooler ] source‐
       queue ] [ -o option1=value1 -o option2 ... ] [ -q ] foomatic-configure -D -n queuename [ -s spooler ] [ -q ]

DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-configure is a program to set up and configure print queues for every known spooler (CUPS, LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ. CPS, no spooler) and every valid printer/driver combo in the  Foomatic
       database  or  every  PPD  file coming with PostScript printers. As RIP filter (Raster Image Processor, translation from PostScript to the native language of the printer) always foomatic-rip(1) will be
       used, except for PPD files of PostScript printers under CUPS or PPR, they will be used without RIP filter.

       It also comprises half of a programatic API for user tools: you can learn and control everything about the static properties of print queues here. With the sister program foomatic-printjob(1), you can
       do everything related to the print queue's dynamic state: submit jobs, and query, cancel, reorder, and redirect them.

   Options
       -n queuename
                 Configure this print queue

       -N Name/Description
                 Use this proper human-readable name/description

       -L Location
                 Short phrase describing this printer's location

       -c connection
                 Printer is connected thusly (ex file:/dev/lp0)

       -d driver Foomatic database name for desired printer driver

       -p printer
                 Foomatic id for printer

       --ppd ppdfile
                 PPD file, for example the one supplied by the manufacturer of a PostScript printer

       -s spooler
                 Explicit spooler type (cups, lpd, lprng, pdq, ppr, direct)

       -o option=value
                 Set the default of option to value

       -o option Turn on option by default

       -D        Set this queue as the default queue (just give -n queuename)

       -R        Remove this whole queue entirely (just give -n queuename)

       -C [ sourcespooler ] sourcequeue
                 Copy sourcequeue from sourcespooler (or the current one if sourcespooler is not given) into the queue given by -n queuename (of the current spooler).

       -Q        Query existing configuration (gives XML summary)

       -r        List also remotely defined queues (CUPS only)

       -P [ index ]
                 Get Perl dump of current configuration (as a Perl array named QUEUES, the first index is index, or zero if index is not given)

       -O        Print XML Overview of all known printer/drivers (this shows also the Foomatic IDs of the printers)

       -X        Print XML data for -p printer and/or -d driver object

       -q        Run quietly

   Commands
       No commands, just options

BUGS
       foomatic-configure  currently  cannot handle printcap files in the lprng style.  As lprng can use BSD style printcaps this is not much of a problem, as long as the GUI based print manager lprngtool is
       not used.  The difference between those formats is, that BSD style requires continuation lines in printer definitions to be ended with a colon and the newline character to be escaped with a backslash.
       Lprng has no such restriction.

       To use a printcap file generated or edited with lprngtool with foomatic-configure it is necessary to add :\ to the end of all but the last line of every printer definition, just as shown below:

       #comment
       # primary printer name
       lp
       #alternate names
        |lp2|lp3
        |Example of a printer
        :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp
        :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100
        :

       must be converted to:

       #comment
       # primary printer name
       lp\
        |lp2|lp3\
        |Example of a printer\
        :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp:\
        :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100:
