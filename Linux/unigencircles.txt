NAME
       unigencircles - Add dashed combining circles to a unifont.hex file

SYNOPSIS
       unigencircles combining.txt nonprinting.hex < unifont.hex > unifont-circles.hex

DESCRIPTION
       unigencircles  reads  a  unifont.hex file from STDIN, adds dashed combining circles to the hex strings for code points listed in "combining.txt" but not listed in "nonprinting.hex", and writes the re‐
       vised set of glyphs in unifont.hex format to STDOUT.  The resulting combining character glyphs show the dashed combining circles that appear in The Unicode Standard code charts.

       For each code point listed in the "combining.txt" file but not listed in the "nonprinting.hex" file, unigencircles will superimpose a single-width dashed circle in glyphs that are single-width  (i.e.,
       their hex glyph strings are 32 characters long) and will superimpose a double-width dashed circle in glyphs that are double-width (i.e., their hex glyph strings are 64 characters long).

EXAMPLE
              unigencircles combining.txt nonprinting.hex < unifont.hex > unifont-circles.hex

FILES
       *.hex files for Unifont glyph data

       font/ttfsrc/combining.txt for combining code points

       font/plane00/nonprinting.hex for non-printing code points
