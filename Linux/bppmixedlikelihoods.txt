NAME
       bppmixedlikelihoods - Computation of site per site likelihoods of components of mixture models.

SYNOPSIS
       bppmixedlikelihood [options]

AVAILABILITY
       All UNIX flavors

DESCRIPTION
       On  the basis of a mixed model, bppmixedlikelihood computes the likelihood of each site for each submodel of the mixture. This is done with homogeneous and non-homogeneous modelings. If the mixture is
       based on several values of a parameter, the site per site a posteriori probabilities and average value of this parameter are computed.

OPTIONS
       You should refer to 'info bppsuite' or to the online manual of bppsuite for a complete list of available options.

       --noninteractive

            generates output for redirection in a file.

       param=file
