NAME
       pps-tools - LinuxPPS support tools and headers

DESCRIPTION
       The pps-tools package includes the necessary headers for using LinuxPPS PPSAPI kernel interface in user-space applications and several support tools.

       ppstest: PPSAPI interface tester
       ppswatch: continuously print PPS timestamps
       ppsctl: PPS device manager
       ppsfind: find pps device by name

       Most tools display a short help message if you run them with --help as option.  Unfortunately they do not come with any further documentation.
