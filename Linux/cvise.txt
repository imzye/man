       C-Vise

   positional arguments:
       INTERESTINGNESS_TEST
              Executable to check interestingness of test cases

       TEST_CASE
              Test cases

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --n, -n N
              Number of cores to use; C-Vise tries to automatically pick a good setting but its choice may be too low or high for your situation

       --tidy Do not make a backup copy of each file to reduce as file.orig

       --shaddap
              Suppress output about non-fatal internal errors

       --die-on-pass-bug
              Terminate C-Vise if a pass encounters an otherwise non-fatal problem

       --sllooww
              Try harder to reduce, but perhaps take a long time to do so

       --also-interesting EXIT_CODE
              A process exit code (somewhere in the range 64-113 would be usual) that, when returned by the interestingness test, will cause C-Vise to save a copy of the variant

       --debug
              Print debug information (alias for --log-level=DEBUG)

       --log-level {INFO,DEBUG,WARNING,ERROR}
              Define the verbosity of the logged events

       --log-file LOG_FILE
              Log events into LOG_FILE instead of stderr. New events are appended to the end of the file

       --no-give-up
              Don't give up on a pass that hasn't made progress for 50000 iterations

       --print-diff
              Show changes made by transformations, for debugging

       --save-temps
              Don't delete /tmp/cvise-xxxxxx directories on termination

       --skip-initial-passes
              Skip initial passes (useful if input is already partially reduced)

       --skip-interestingness-test-check, -s
              Skip initial interestingness test check

       --remove-pass REMOVE_PASS
              Remove all instances of the specified passes from the schedule (comma-separated)

       --start-with-pass START_WITH_PASS
              Start with the specified pass

       --no-timing
              Do not print timestamps about reduction progress

       --timestamp
              Print timestamps instead of relative time from a reduction start

       --timeout [TIMEOUT]
              Interestingness test timeout in seconds

       --no-cache
              Don't cache behavior of passes

       --skip-key-off
              Disable skipping the rest of the current pass when 's' is pressed

       --max-improvement BYTES
              Largest improvement in file size from a single transformation that C-Vise should accept (useful only to slow C-Vise down)

       --pass-group {all,binary,opencl-120,delta}
              Set of passes used during the reduction

       --pass-group-file PASS_GROUP_FILE
              JSON file defining a custom pass group

       --clang-delta-std {c++98,c++11,c++14,c++17,c++20,c++2b}
              Specify clang_delta C++ standard, it can rapidly speed up all clang_delta passes

       --clang-delta-preserve-routine CLANG_DELTA_PRESERVE_ROUTINE
              Preserve the given function in replace-function-defwith-decl clang delta pass

       --not-c
              Don't run passes that are specific to C and C++, use this mode for reducing other languages

       --renaming
              Enable all renaming passes (that are disabled by default)

       --list-passes
              Print all available passes and exit

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       --commands, -c COMMANDS
              Use shell commands instead of an interestingness test case

       --shell SHELL
              Use selected shell for the --commands option

       --to-utf8
              Convert any non-UTF-8 encoded input file to UTF-8

       --skip-after-n-transforms SKIP_AFTER_N_TRANSFORMS
              Skip each pass after N successful transformations

       --stopping-threshold STOPPING_THRESHOLD
              CVise will stop reducing a test case once it has reduced by this fraction of its original size. Between 0.0 and 1.0.

   available shortcuts:
              S - skip execution of the current pass D - toggle --print-diff option
