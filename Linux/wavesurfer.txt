NAME
       wavesurfer - soundfile editor

SYNOPSIS
       wavesurfer [options] soundfile

DESCRIPTION
       Wavesurfer  is  a  tool  for  sound  visualization  and  manipulation.  It  can  be  used as a stand-alone tool for a wide range of tasks in speech research and education. Typical applications are
       speech/sound analysis and sound annotation/transcription.

       The documentation for wavesurfer can be accessed online via www.speech.kth.se/wavesurfer or through the wavesurfer help menu.

OPTIONS
       WaveSurfer recognizes the following command line switches

       -play

       start playing as soon as the sound is loaded.

       -config configuration

       use the configuration and do not query the user for one. WaveSurfer uses the first matching configuration of the available. If none matches, a wavebar will be displayed.

       -master filename

       when loading several sound files at once, specify which sound's wavebar will control the rest. For example, wavesurfer.tcl -config Waveform -master ex1.wav ex1.wav ex2.wav,  will  make  the  first
       sound's wavebar control the second one as well. Same function can be had by choosing View | Master Widget | ex1.wav.

       -mlf filename

       search the specified HTK Master Label File (only for HTK format transcription panes). Several options can be specified and they will apply to the corresponding transcription pane counting from the
       top.
