NAME
       lckdo - run a program with a lock held

SYNOPSIS
       lckdo [options] {lockfile} {program} [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       lckdo runs a program with a lock held, in order to prevent multiple processes from running in parallel. Use just like nice or nohup.

       Now that util-linux contains a similar command named flock, lckdo is deprecated, and will be removed from some future version of moreutils.

OPTIONS
       -w
           If the lock is already held by another process, wait for it to complete instead of failing immediately.

       -W {sec}
           The same as -w but wait not more than sec seconds.

       -e
           Execute the program directly without forking and waiting (keeps an extra file descriptor open).

       -E {nnn}
           Set the file descriptor number to keep open when exec()ing (implies -e).

       -n
           Do not create the lock file if it does not exist.

       -q
           Produce no output if lock is already held.

       -s
           Lock in shared (read) mode.

       -x
           Lock in exclusive (write) mode (default).

       -t
           Test for lock existence.

EXIT STATUS
       If the lock was successfully acquired, the return value is that of the program invoked by lckdo. If the lock couldn't be acquired, EX_TEMPFAIL is returned. If there was a problem opening/creating or
       locking the lock file, EX_CANTCREAT or EX_OSERR will be returned.
