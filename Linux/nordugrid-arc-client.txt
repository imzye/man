NAME
       arcrenew - ARC Proxy Renewal

DESCRIPTION
   Usage:
              arcrenew [OPTION...] [job ...]

   Brokering and filtering:
       -C, --computing-element=ce
              only select jobs that were submitted to this computing element

       -s, --status=statusstr
              only select jobs whose status is statusstr

       -a, --all
              all jobs

       -r, --rejectmanagement=URL
              skip jobs that are on a computing element with a given URL

   Behaviour tuning:
       -i, --jobids-from-file=filename
              a file containing a list of jobIDs

       -j, --joblist=filename
              the file storing information about active jobs (default /build/reproducible-path/nordugrid-arc-7.1.1/debian/.debhelper/generated/_source/home/.arc/jobs.dat)

       --no-authentication
              do not perform any authentication for opened connections

       --x509-authentication
              perform X.509 authentication for opened connections

       --token-authentication
              perform token authentication for opened connections

       --systemca
              force using CA certificates configuration provided by OpenSSL

       --gridca
              force using CA certificates configuration for Grid services (typically IGTF)

       --anyca
              force using CA certificates configuration for Grid services (typically IGTF) and one provided by OpenSSL

   Other actions:
       -P, --listplugins
              list the available plugins

   Application Options:
       -h, --help
              Show help options

       -z, --conffile=filename
              configuration file (default ~/.arc/client.conf)

       -t, --timeout=seconds
              timeout in seconds (default 20)

       -d, --debug=debuglevel
              FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE or DEBUG

       -v, --version
              print version information

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The arcrenew command renews the delegated x509 proxy of a job submitted an ARC CEs.  The job can be referred to either by the jobid that was returned by arcsub(1) at submission time or by its job‐
       name if the job description that was submitted contained a jobname attribute.

       More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were submitted with the same jobname the proxies of all those jobs are renewed. If the --joblist option is used the list of jobs is
       read from a file with the specified filename. By specifying the --all option, the proxies of all active jobs will be renewed.

       The  --computing-element option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. The --status option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options can be repeated several
       times. See arcstat(1) for possible state values.

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

       ~/.arc/jobs.dat
              This a local database of the user's active jobs. When a job is successfully submitted it is added to database and when it is removed from the remote CE it is removed from  this  list.  This
              database is used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the --all option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the --joblist option a different file
              can be used than the default.
