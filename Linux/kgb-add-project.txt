NAME
       kgb-add-project - helper script for adding new projects to kgb-bot configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       kgb-add-project [--file configfile] [--dir configdir] [--net|--networks ircnetwork] [--save|--write] project-id ircchannel password

DESCRIPTION
       kgb-add-project allows one to add new projects to kgb-bot's configuration file from the command line. It writes the new config to stdout unless --save|--write is given.

ARGUMENTS

           Optional. Defaults to /etc/kgb-bot/kgb.conf.

       --dir configdir
           Optional. Defaults to /etc/kgb-bot/kgb.conf.d/.  Used for writing config snippets for projects with --save|--write.

       --net|network ircnetwork
           Optional. Defaults to oftc. Needs to be in the networks section of the configuration file.

       --save|--write
           Optional. Write new config back to file instead of stdout.

       project-id
           project-id to be added.

       irchannel
           IRC channel where the new project sends its messages. If the channel doesn't start with a character denoting IRC channel ("#&+"), then a hash sign is prepended.

       password
           Password for the new project.

EXAMPLE
       kgb-add-project my-project \#projectchannel RudFiarced0

CAVEATS
       •   kgb-add-project sorts the top-level sections of the configuration file in a fixed order and re-orders the subsections alphabetically.

       •   The output of kgb-add-project does not contain the comments that were present in the source configuration file.
