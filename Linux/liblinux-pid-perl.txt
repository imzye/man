NAME
       Linux::Pid - Get the native PID and the PPID on Linux

SYNOPSIS
           use Linux::Pid;
           print Linux::Pid::getpid(), "\t", Linux::Pid::getppid(), "\n";

           use Linux::Pid qw(getpid getppid);
           print getpid(), "\t", getppid(), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Why should one use a module to get the PID and the PPID of a process where there are the $$ variable and the getppid() builtin ? (Not mentioning the equivalent POSIX::getpid() and POSIX::getppid()
       functions.)

       In fact, this is useful on Linux, with multithreaded programs. Linux' C library, using the linux thread model, returns different values of the PID and the PPID from different threads. (Other
       thread models such as NPTL don't have the same behaviour). This module forces perl to call the underlying C functions getpid() and getppid().
