NAME
       modulemd-validator - validate modulemd documents

SYNOPSIS
       modulemd-validator [--quiet|--verbose|--debug] FILE...
       modulemd-validator [--quiet|--verbose|--debug] --type=TYPE FILE
       modulemd-validator {--version|--help}

DESCRIPTION
       This tool validates modulemd documents specified with the positional arguments using a libmodulemd parser.

       Without a --type option, all document types which can be found in a YUM repository will be recognized. In this case each FILE can contain multiple modulemd documents.

       Otherwise, exactly one FILE containing exactly one modulemd document must be provided and the document will be validated against the given TYPE.

OPTIONS
       --type=TYPE
              Constrain a document type. The recognized types are:

              modulemd-v1
                     An obsolete format used for building and installing modules.

              modulemd-v2
                     A deprecated format for building modules and a contemporary format for built modules which can be placed into a YUM repository and installed by a package manager.

              modulemd-defaults-v1
                     A format for defining default streams and default profiles of a module. Found in YUM repositories.

              modulemd-obsoletes-v1
                     A format for defining streams which reach or will reach its end of life. It can also recommend a new stream which obsoleted the old one. Found in YUM repositories.

              modulemd-packager-v2
                     An obsolete format for building modules.

              modulemd-packager-v3
                     A contemporary format for building modules.

              modulemd-translations-v1
                     A contemporary format for delivering localized human-oriented texts (e.g. a description or a summary) associated with a module. Found in YUM repositories.

              Only single-document files are supported.  For compatibility, if this options is not provided, any document type loadable into a modulemd index (i.e. those intended for YUM repositories) is
              acceptable.

       --debug
              Output debugging messages.

       -q, --quiet
              Print no output.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -h, --help
              Print a usage text and then exit.

       -V, --version
              Print a version number and then exit.

EXIT CODE
       If the supplied documents are valid (and satisfy the --type constrain), zero exit code will be returned.  Otherwise a non-zero code will be emitted.

REPORTING BUGS
       Bugs and feature requests can be reported at the libmodulemd home page.

       Specification of the modulemd documents is available in a yaml_spec directory at the libmodulemd home page.
