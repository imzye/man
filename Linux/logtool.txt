NAME
       logtool - parse and filter syslog files

SYNOPSIS
       (stdout) | logtool -[args]

       Logtool  is  a  command line program that will parse logfiles into a more palatable format.  It will take anything resembling a syslog or multilog file, as well as unformatted ASCII, and crunch it
       into one of the following formats for your viewing pleasure:

            ANSI (colorized for easy "at a glance" viewing)

            ASCII (e-mail reports/term's w/o color)

            CSV (spreadsheet/database imports)

            HTML (for generating web pages)

            RAW (for no good reason)

OPTIONS
       -o [ ANSI | ASCII | CSV | HTML | RAW ]
            Allows you to specify the output format to be one of the following: ANSI (default), ASCII, CSV, HTML, RAW.  Options are not case sensitive (ie: -o CSV and -o csv should  yield  the  same  re‐
            sults)

       -t [ long | short ]
            Allows you to specify the time display format to be one of the following: (Long [default]) Mon Dy HH:MM:SS or (Short) HH:MM

       -b   Causes logtool to beep on RED events (ANSI output only).  This is usefull when you want to monitor a logfile on an ongoing basis, and wish to have your terminal beep whenever something out of
            the ordinary happens.

       -s   Causes logtool to not display the syslog "source" field

       -p   Causes logtool to not display the "program" field

       -c [/path/config.file]
            Allows you to specify a config file other than the default /etc/logtool/logtool.conf

       -i [/path/includefile]
            Allows you to specify an alterate file containing regex's for inclusion [default=/etc/logtool/include]

       -e [/path/excludefile]
            Allows you to specify an alternate file containing regex's for exclusion [default=/etc/logtool/exclude]

       -n   Causes logtool to skip any attempts to resolve IP->Hostname by the various modules (handy when your DNS is down temporairly).

       -v   Set logtool to operate in verbose mode (does nothing currently)

       -V   Causes logtool to print it's version information and exit

       -h   Display the help message

SUGGESTED USAGE(S)
       As a 'live' logfile monitoring tool:
              tail -f /var/log/messages | logtool -o ANSI -b

       To generate colorized webpages of logfiles:
              cat /var/log/messages | logtool -o HTML > /home/httpd/html/logs/messages.html

       To generate reports via a cronjob:
              retail /var/log/messages | logtool -o ASCII | mail -s "Daily report" someuser@somedomain.ext

CONFIG FILE
       /etc/logtool/logtool.conf

       The config file should be commented to the point of being self-documenting, so we will not comment very extensively on it here.  Suffice to say, this is the place where you should configure 99% of
       your runtime options for logtool.  You may also  have a collection of different default configurations, and select amongst them by the '-c' option of logtool.

AVAILABILITY
       Logtool  is known to compile/run on all UNIX flavors using a 2.95.x GNU C Compiler, the GNU Make utility, and a proper ANSI C library (glibc is recommended, but not required).  Specific reports of
       success include FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, SunOS, AIX, SCO, and of course, any known flavor of Linux (including at least 2 embedded system variants).

SEE ALSO
       regex(7) for help with constructing regular expressions for the include/exclude/colors files.  If you find no regex manual on your system, try 'apropos regex' and see what you get, or  as  a  last
       ditch, 'man grep' should at least point you in the right direction.

       You  can  also find a somewhat better bit of documentation in the textfile 'logtool.txt' (usually in the /usr/doc/, /usr/share/doc/ or similar tree on most Linux distributions).  If you don't know
       where to look, you can probably find it by typing 'locate logtool.txt' at the command line.
