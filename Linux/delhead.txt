Name
       delhead - Set FITS or IRAF header keyword values

Synopsis
       delhead [-nv] <FITS or IRAF file[s]> kw1 kw2 ... kwn

Description
       Delete  keyword  entries from the header of FITS or IRAF image[s].  If a keyword does not already exist, ignore it.  To delete keywords in a list of files, substitute @<listfile> for the file names on
       the command line.  To delete a lot of keywords, put them, one per line, in a file and substitute @<keylistfile> on the command line.  If two @ commands are present, the program will figure  out  which
       contains file names and which contains keywords.

Options
       -n     Write a new file with an added "e" before the extension.  The default is to overwrite the input file.

       -v     Print confirmations of each parameter setting
