NAME
       apngopt - optimize animated PNG image files

SYNOPSIS
       apngopt [options] anim.png [anim_opt.png]

DESCRIPTION
       After converting impage to APNG with e.g. gif2apng(1), the files size can further be reduced with this utility.

       The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) file format is an extension to the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification. It allows for animated PNG files that work similarly to animated GIF
       files, while retaining backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files and adding support for 8-bit transparency and 24-bit images.

OPTIONS
       -z0  : zlib compression

       -z1  : 7zip compression (default)

       -z2  : zopfli compression

       -i## : number of iterations, default -i15

STANDARDS
       APNG Specification: https://wiki.mozilla.org/APNG_Specification
