NAME
       mu-cade - chase action game

DESCRIPTION
       The Physics Centipede Invasion Smashup waggly shmup, 'Mu-cade'

       Mu-cade  is another shoot-em-up game by Kenta Cho. In this game Kenta has introduced physics into his formula of hardcore shooting games. Similar in some ways to Asteroids and Nibbles, the playing
       area is a rectangular arena in which vessel-snakes have only one idea at the head: expelling the others into the vacuum. You incarnate one of them, and you'll quickly realize the subtlety  of  the
       goal: your tail lengthens as you destroy your enemies.
