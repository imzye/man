NAME
       html2ps - convert HTML to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       html2ps [ -2cdDFghHLnORtTuUv ] [ -b URL ] [ -C string ] [ -e encoding ] [ -f file[:file[:...]]  ] [ -i num ] [ -k file ] [ -l lang ] [ -m num ] [ -M num ] [ -N num ] [ -o file ] [ -r path ] [ -s num ]
       [ -S string ] [ -W string ] [ -x num ] [ URL|file ]

DESCRIPTION
       The program html2ps converts HTML to PostScript. The HTML code can be retrieved from one or more URL:s or local files, specified as parameters on the command line.  If no parameter is  given,  html2ps
       reads from standard input.

       Note:  To  avoid  unnecessary  network traffic, one can rebuild an already generated PostScript file with new options. This is done by running html2ps with the new options, and with the old PostScript
       file as input (not applicable for all options).

OPTIONS
       All options have a short (case sensitive), and a long (case insensitive) form.

       -2 --twoup
              Two column (2-up) output. The default is one column per page.

       -b URL --base URL
              Use URL as a base to expand relative references for in-line images. This is useful if you have downloaded a document to a local file.  The URL should then be the URL of the original document.

       -c --check
              Check the syntax of the HTML file (using an external syntax checker). The default is to not make a syntax check.

       -C string --toc string
              Generate a table of contents (ToC). The value should be a string consisting of one of the letters 'f', 'h', or 't', optionally combined with the letter 'b':

              b      The ToC will be printed first. This requires that Ghostscript is installed.
              f      The ToC will be generated from the links in the converted document.
              h      The ToC will be generated from headings and titles in the converted documents. Note that if the document author for some strange reason has chosen to use some other  means  to  represent
                     the headings than the HTML elements H1,...,H6, you are out of luck!
              t      The ToC will be generated from links having the attribute rev=TOC in the converted document.

       -d --debug
              Generate debugging information. You should always use this option when reporting problems with html2ps.

       -D --dsc --DSC
              Generate  DSC  compliant  PostScript. This requires Ghostscript and can take quite some time to do. Note that a PostScript file generated with this option cannot be used as input to html2ps for
              reformatting later.

       -e encoding --encoding encoding
              The document encoding. Currently recognized values are ISO-8859-1, EUC-JP, SHIFT-JIS, and ISO-2022-JP (other EUC-xx encodings may also work). The default is ISO-8859-1.

       -f file[:file[:...]] --rcfile file[:file[:...]]
              A colon separated list of configuration file names to use instead of the default personal configuration file $HOME/.html2psrc.  Definitions made in one file  override  definitions  in  previous
              files  (the  last  file  in  the  list has highest precedence). An empty file name (as in ':file', 'file1::file3', or 'file:') will expand to the default personal file. The environment variable
              HTML2PSPATH is used to specify the directories where to search for these files. (Note: this is only supposed to be used on the command line, not in a configuration file.)

       -F --frame
              Draw a frame around the text on each page. The default is to not draw a frame.

       -g --grayscale
              Convert colour images to grayscale images. Note that the PostScript file will be smaller when the images are converted to grayscale. The default is to generate colour images.

       -h --help
              Show usage information.

       -H --hyphenate
              Hyphenate the text. This requires TeX hyphenation pattern files.

       -i num --scaleimage num
              Scale in-line images with a factor num The default is 1.

       -k file --cookie file
              Enable cookie support, using a netscape formatted cookie file (requires libwww-perl).

       -l lang --language lang
              Specifies the language of the document (overrides an eventual LANG attribute of the BODY element).  The language should be given according to RFC1766  (ftp://ftp.nordu.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt)  and
              ISO 639 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm).

       -L --landscape
              Generate code for printing in landscape mode. The default is portrait mode.

       -m num --scalemath num
              Scale mathematical formulas with a factor num The default is 1.

       -M num --mainchapter num
              Specifies the start number for automatic numbering of headings (by setting the seq-number parameter), the default is 1.

       -n --number
              Insert page numbers. The default is to not number the pages.

       -N num --startno num
              Specifies the starting page number, the default is 1.

       -o file --output file
              Write the PostScript code to file.  The default is to write to standard output.

       -O --original
              Use  PostScript  original  images  if they exist. For example, if a document contains an image figure.gif, and an encapsulated PostScript file named figure.ps exists in the same directory, that
              file will be use instead. This only work for documents read as local files. Note: if the PostScript file is large or contains bitmap images, this must be combined with the -D  option.  In  HTML
              4.0 this can be achieved in a much better way with:

              <OBJECT data="figure.ps" type="application/postscript">
              <OBJECT data="figure.gif" type="image/gif">
              <PRE>[Maybe some ASCII art for text browsers]</PRE>
              </OBJECT>
              </OBJECT>

       -r path --rootdir path
              When a document is read from a local file, this value specifies a base directory for resolving relative links starting with "/".  Typically, this should be the directory where your web server's
              home page resides.

       -R --xref
              Insert cross references at every link to within the set of converted documents.

       -s num --scaledoc num
              Scale the entire document with a factor num The default is 1.

       -S string --style string
              This option complements/overrides definitions made in the configuration files. The string must follow the configuration file syntax. (Note: this is only supposed to be used on the command line,
              not in a configuration file.)

       -t --titlepage
              Generate a title page. The default is to not generate one.

       -T --text
              Text mode, ignore images. The default is to include the images.

       -u --underline
              Underline text that constitutes a hypertext link. The default is to not underline.

       -U --colour
              Produce colour output for text and background, when specified.  The default is black text on white background (mnemonic: coloUr ;-).

       -v --version
              Print information about the current version of html2ps.

       -W string --web string
              Process  a  web  of  documents by recursively retrieve and convert documents that are referenced with hyperlinks. When dealing with remote documents it will of course be necessary to impose re‐
              strictions, to avoid downloading the entire web... The value should be a string consisting of one of the letters 'a', 'b', 'l', 'r', or 's', optionally combined with a combination of  the  let‐
              ters 'p', 'L', and a positive integer:

              a      Follow all links.
              b      Follow only links to within the same directory, or below, as the start document.
              l      Follow only links specified with "<LINK rel=NEXT>" in the document.
              p      Prompt for each remote document. This mode will automatically be entered after the first 50 documents.
              r      Follow only relative links.
              s      Follow only links to within the same server as the start document.
              L      With  this  option, the order in which the documents are processed will be: first all top level documents, then the documents linked to from these etc. For example, if the document A has
                     links to B and C, and B has a link to D, the order will be A-B-C-D.  By default, each document will be followed by the first document it links to etc; so the default order for the  exam‐
                     ple is A-B-D-C.
              #      A positive integer giving the number of recursive levels. The default is 4 (when the option is present).

       -x num --duplex num
              Generate postscript code for single or double sided printing.  No default, valid values are:

              0      Single sided.
              1      Double sided.
              2      Double sided, opposite page reversed (tumble mode).

BUGS
       (This is incomplete.)

       The CELLSPACING attribute of the TABLE element is not implemented as described in the specification; instead the value of the CELLPADDING attribute is increased by half the value of CELLSPACING.

       Rendering HTML tables well is a non-trivial task. For "real" tables, that is representation of tabular data, html2ps usually generates reasonably good output. When tables are used for layout purposes,
       the result varies from good to useless. This is because a table cell is never broken across pages. So if a table contains a cell with a lot of content, the entire table may have to be scaled  down  in
       size in order to make this cell fit on a single page. Sometimes this may even result in unreadable output.

       Page breaks are occasionally done in bad places: for example directly after a (long) heading, and before the last line in a paragraph.

ENVIRONMENT
       HTML2PSPATH
              This variable specifies the directories to search for configuration files. It should be a colon separated list of directory names. Use a dot '.' to denote the current directory. An empty direc‐
              tory name (as in ':dir', 'dir1::dir3', or 'dir:') will expand to the directory where the global configuration file is. The default value is '.:', that is: search the  current  directory  first,
              and then the global one.

FILES
       $HOME/.html2psrc
              User configuration file, see html2psrc(5).
