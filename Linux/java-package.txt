NAME
       make-jpkg - builds Debian packages from Java binary distributions

SYNOPSIS
       make-jpkg [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       make-jpkg builds a Debian package from the given Java distribution FILE.

       Supported java binary distributions currently include:
         * Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) :
           - The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 6, 7 and 8
           - The Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 6, 7 and 8
           - The Java API Javadoc, version 6, 7 and 8
         (Choose tar.gz archives or self-extracting archives, do _not_ choose the RPM!)

       The following options are recognized:

       --full-name NAME
              full name used in the maintainer field of the package

       --email EMAIL
              email address used in the maintainer field of the package

       --distribution DISTRIBUTION
              distribution to use in the debian changelog for the resulting package

       --priority PRIORITY
              numeric  priority for use by update-alternatives.  This overrides the default priority, which is intentionally lower than that of the Debian-provided OpenJDK packages.  Only use this option
              if the generated package should be considered higher priority by update-alternatives.

       --changes
              create a .changes file

       --revision
              add debian revision

       --source
              build a source package instead of a binary deb package

       --with-system-certs
              Replace the JVMs keystore with a softlink to the system's keystore, (/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts) which is managed automatically by the ca-certificates and ca-certificates-java packages.

       --jce-policy JCE_POLICY_FILE
              Replace cryptography files with versions from the specified JCE_POLICY_FILE.

       --help display help text and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Download a supported JRE, JDK, API tar.gz or self-extracting archive from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads and execute make-jpkg file with the downloaded file.  The  program
       asks the user for additional information and builds a Debian binary package in the current directory.

       The  program requires about 400 MB free disk space in a temporary directory. The temporary directory defaults to /tmp but you can specify an alternate directory by setting the environment variable
       TMPDIR.

EXAMPLE
       To install Oracle(TM) 8 Standard Edition JDK, download a release from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html and invoke make-jpkg, for example:

              make-jpkg <path_to_download_directory>/jdk-8u102-linux-x64.tar.gz

       This generate a Debian package in the current directory, that can be installed using dpkg:

              dpkg -i oracle-java8-jdk_8u102_amd64.deb

       When you're done, you can delete initial download as well as generated package:

              rm <path_to_download_directory>/jdk-8u102-linux-x64.tar.gz oracle-java8-jdk_8u102_amd64.deb

ENVIRONMENT
       TMPDIR base directory used for temporary files (defaults to /tmp)

       J2SE_PACKAGE_FULL_NAME
              full name used in the maintainer field of the package; if none is supplied then the default of "Debian Java Maintainers" is used.

       J2SE_PACKAGE_EMAIL
              email address used in the maintainer field of the package; if none is supplied the default of "pkg-java-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org" is used.
