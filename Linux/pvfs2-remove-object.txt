NAME
       pvfs2-remove-object – remove internal object from OrangeFS volume

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-remove-object   [-hv]  [-f  fs_id]  [-o  handle]  [-p  handle  -d
       entry_name]

DESCRIPTION
       The pvfs2-remove-object removes an object from an  OrangeFS  volume  by
       handle  number.   This  would  be used to repair a corrupt file system.
       Improper use of this utility could corrupt a file system.

       The -p and -d options must be  used  together  to  remove  a  directory
       entry.

       The options are as follows:

       -h     Display synopsis.

       -v     Print version number and exit.

       -f     Use fs_id as file system ID.

       -o     Remove the handle handle.

       -p     Specify the parent handle handle.

       -p     Specify the dirent name entry_name.

ENVIRONMENT
       PVFS2_DEBUGFILE
              If set to the path of a local file, redirect debug output to it.

       PVFS2_DEBUGMASK
              Set  the  OrangeFS debug mask.  Possible masks are documented in
              pvfs2-set-debugmask(1).

       PVFS2TAB_FILE
              If set, the full pathname for an alternate pvfs2tab file

FILES
       /etc/pvfs2tab

EXAMPLES
       Copy the file /etc/motd to /mnt/bar.  If /mnt is  an  OrangeFS  volume,
       this will copy the file into OrangeFS.

             pvfs2-cp /etc/motd /mnt/bar

CAVEATS
       When  dst_file  is  a  directory  the  utility  does not work.  In this
       respect it is different than the cp(1) utility.
