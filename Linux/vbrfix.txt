NAME
       vbrfix - fix erroneous VBR MP3 files

SYNOPSIS
       vbrfix -flag1 -flag2 -flagn in.mp3 out.mp3

DESCRIPTION
       In an average song there are points that require high quality and points that require low quality (i.e., silence). Instead of having the whole file at 160kbps (CBR - Constant Bit Rate), we can use
       VBR - Variable Bit rate. This allows us to have say 96Kbps at points not requiring high quality and 192kbps when we need it: resulting in an overall smaller but higher quality MP3.

       However,  the problem is that many MP3 programs estimate the time of a MP3 based on the first bitrate they find and the filesize. With VBR you can get fairly random times; as most songs start with
       silence you usually get the song length being shown as much longer than it should be. Also when you jump through the file in VBR: 50% through the file is not 50% through the song.

       A VBR null frame is placed at the beginning of the file to tell the MP3 player information about the song length and indexing through the song.  Some poor encoders don't produce this null frame or
       do so incorrectly - this is what vbrfix attempts to fix. Vbrfix can also fix other problems with MP3s as it deletes all non-MP3 content (other than tags you state you want to keep).

       It can also help when merging two VBR MP3s together with a merging tool and then needing a newly calculated VBR null frame.

       -ri1          removeId3v1 Tag

       -ri2          removeId3v2 Tag

       -skiplame     if a tag was made by LAME don't fix it

       -always       always write a new file even if not VBR

       -makevbr      make it VBR (you need -always also)

       -log          write a log file

       -lameinfo     keep the lame info
