NAME
       rbm - Packaging tool

SYNOPSIS
       rbm [command] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Reproducible Build Manager (rbm) is a tool that helps you create and build packages for multiple linux distributions, and automate the parts that can be automated. It includes options to run the build
       in a defined environement to allow reproducing the build.

       It can be used to create rpm, debian and other types of packages.

MAIN FEATURES
       tarball creation
           Create tarballs for your software using a simple command and a git or mercurial revision.

       automatic verification of gpg signatures
           If your git commits or git tags are gpg signed, the signature can be automatically checked using a specified keyring.

       package creation
           Create binary or source packages from any git or mercurial revision using a simple command.

       packages upload
           Upload the packages that you have built to a repository and update metadata.

       multi-os support
           RPM and debian packages are currently supported. Support for more packaging systems could easily be added. Using package templates and the Template Toolkit, you can make different packages for
           different distributions using the same files. The syntax of this templating system is much more clear and powerful than the RPM macros syntax.

       remote builds
           Build your software on a remote server with ssh, or in a local chroot using a different OS. For instance if you are using rbm on an rpm based distribution, this allows you to build debian packages
           from the same workspace, using a Debian chroot.

       customizable
           Almost everything rbm do can be changed using some optional settings, globally, or for some selected projects or OSs.

       simple configuration
           The configuration is done using simple YAML files.

       a flexible configuration system
           All settings can be set globally, per workspace, project, or target operating system.

       a dynamic configuration system
           All configuration settings are templates. You can reuse other configuration settings, or the output of some commands in those settings. For instance, the version number of your software can be set
           using a command to grep the README file in your sources tree.

       extensible in perl
           While the configuration is usually done in simple YAML, you can also in the same configuration file use perl to define any of the options. Those options can be defined by a perl function that will
           be executed when the option is queried, and whose return value will be used as the option value.
