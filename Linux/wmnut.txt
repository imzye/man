NAME
       WMNUT - Dockable UPS Monitor

SYNOPSIS
       wmnut [-A T1 T2] [-b BlinkRate] [-B BeepVolume] [-C CriticalLevel] [-d display] [-h] [-l] [-L LowLevel] [-U upsname] [-v] [-V] [-w]

DESCRIPTION
       WMNUT is an UPS Monitor. It is used to visually display and interpret details of up to 9 UPSs status via NUT - Network UPS Tools framework.

       WMNUT  is  dockable  using  WindowMaker and AfterStep window-managers; under other window-managers, WMNUT should be used with "-w" option to appear as a nicely-sized 64x64 application with a back‐
       ground.

       WMNUT provides the following information:

       - Status of power supply (Blinking Red/Yellow/Green colored meter/battery),

       - Percentage of battery remaining (numeric and meter),

       - Load level percentage on output (numeric, if available),

       - Runtime to empty, ie time left to battery depletion (MM:SS),

       - Communication status with UPS (Blinking Red/Green "C").

OPTIONS
       -A <T1 T2>
              Send messages to users terminals when Low and critical.  T1 is seconds between messages when Low.  T2 is seconds between messages when Critical.

       -b <BlinkRate>
              Blink rate for red LED. (0 for no blinking.)

       -B <Volume>
              Beep at Critical Level. Volume is between -100% to 100%. This function has been disabled, at least temporarily.

       -C <CriticalLevel>
              Define level at which red LED turns on.

       -d <display>
              Use alternate display.

       -h     Display help screen.

       -l     Use a low-color pixmap to conserve colors on 8-bit displays.

       -L <LowLevel>
              Define level at which yellow LED turns on.  CriticalLevel takes precedence if LowLevel<CriticalLevel.

       -U <upsname>
              Define upsname ([upsname@]hostname, default is localhost).  You can use up to 9 call to -U <upsname> to monitor multiple UPSs.

       -v     Print version (includes important WMNUT info).

       -V     Verbose mode : display NUT available feature and base value.

       -w     Windowed mode (opposite to native withdrawn mode for Window Maker).

BUGS
       None are known
