NAME
       kea-shell - Text client for Control Agent process

SYNOPSIS
       kea-shell [-h] [-v] [--host] [--port] [--path] [--ca] [--cert] [--key] [--auth-user] [--auth-password] [--timeout] [--service] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       The kea-shell provides a REST client for the Kea Control Agent (CA).  It takes commands as a command-line parameter that is sent to the CA with proper JSON encapsulation. Optional arguments may be
       specified on the standard input. The request is sent via HTTP and a response is retrieved, displayed on the standard output. Basic HTTP authentication and HTTPS, i.e. TLS transport, are supported.

ARGUMENTS
       The arguments are as follows:

       -h     Displays help regarding command-line parameters.

       -v     Displays the Kea version.

       --host Specifies the host to connect to. The Control Agent must be running at the specified host. If not specified, 127.0.0.1 is used.

       --port Specifies the TCP port to connect to. Control Agent must be listening at the specified port. If not specified, 8000 is used.

       --path Specifies the path in the URL to connect to. If not specified, an empty path is used. As Control Agent listens at the empty path, this parameter is useful only with a reverse proxy.

       --ca   Specifies the file or directory name of the Certification Authority.  If not specified, HTTPS is not used.

       --cert Specifies the file name of the user end-entity public key certificate.  If specified, the file name of the user key must also be specified.

       --key  Specifies the file name of the user key file. If specified, the file name of the user certificate must also be specified.  Encrypted key files are not supported.

       --auth-user
              Specifies the user ID for basic HTTP authentication. If not specified, or specified as the empty string, authentication is not used.

       --auth-password
              Specifies the password for basic HTTP authentication. If not specified but the user ID is specified, an empty password is used.

       --timeout
              Specifies the connection timeout, in seconds. The default is 10.

       --service
              Specifies the service that is the target of a command. If not specified, the Control Agent itself is targeted. May be used more than once to specify multiple targets.

       command
              Specifies the command to be sent to the CA. If not specified, list-commands is used.

DOCUMENTATION
       Kea  comes  with  an  extensive  Kea Administrator Reference Manual that covers all aspects of running the Kea software - compilation, installation, configuration, configuration examples, and much
       more. Kea also features a Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea can print with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are available  in  various  formats  (.txt,
       .html, .pdf) with the Kea distribution. The Kea documentation is available at https://kea.readthedocs.io.

       Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer's Guide, available at https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/.

       The Kea project website is available at https://kea.isc.org.

MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT
       There are two public mailing lists available for the Kea project. kea-users (kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while kea-dev (kea-dev at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea de‐
       velopers, prospective contributors, and other advanced users. Both lists are available at https://lists.isc.org. The community provides best-effort support on both of those lists.
