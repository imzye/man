NAME
       gentest - Run random generic SMB operations against two SMB servers and show the differences in behavior

SYNOPSIS
       gentest {//server1/share1} {//server2/share2} {-U user%pass} {-U user%pass} [-s seed] [-o numops] [-a] [-A] [-i FILE] [-O] [-S FILE] [-L] [-F] [-C] [-X]

DESCRIPTION
       gentest is a utility for detecting differences in behaviour between SMB servers. It will run a random set of generic operations against //server1/share1 and then the same random set against
       //server2/share2 and display the differences in the responses it gets.

       This utility is used by the Samba team to find differences in behaviour between Samba and Windows servers.

OPTIONS
       -U user%pass
           Specify the user and password to use when logging on on the shares. This parameter is mandatory and has to be specified twice.

       -s seed
           Seed the random number generator with the specified value.

       -o numops
           Set the number of operations to perform.

       -a
           Print the operations that are performed.

       -A
           Backtrack to find minimal number of operations required to make the response to a certain call differ.

       -i FILE
           Specify a file containing the names of fields that have to be ignored (such as time fields). See below for a description of the file format.

       -O
           Enable oplocks.

       -S FILE
           Set preset seeds file. The default is gentest_seeds.dat.

       -L
           Use preset seeds

       -F
           Fast reconnect (just close files)

       -C
           Continuous analysis mode

       -X
           Analyse even when the test succeeded.
