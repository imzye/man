   parse
       Parses a Link-header field a returns all founded links as a list of HashRefs.

           my @links = HTTP::Link->parse(<<EOT);
           </TheBook/Chapter/2>; rel="previous", </TheBook/Chapter/4>; rel="next"
           EOT
           # Result:

               iri => '/TheBook/Chapter/2',
               relation => 'previous'
           },{
               iri => '/TheBook/Chapter/4',
               relation => 'next'
           });

   parse_hash
       Parses a Link-header field a returns all founded links as a HashRef with IRIs as key:

           my %links = HTTP::Link->parse_hash(<<EOT);
           </TheBook/Chapter/2>; rel="previous", </TheBook/Chapter/4>; rel="next"
           EOT
           # Result:
           %links = (
