NAME
       pfsintiff - Load images or frames in several variants of TIFF format (both LDR and HDR)

SYNOPSIS
       pfsintiff (<file> [--linear] [--frames <range>] [--skip-missing])  [<file>...]

DESCRIPTION
       pfsintiff  command  loads  images in TIFF format and writes pfs stream to the Standard Output. The pfs stream is usually piped to another program for further processing. To detect the format automati‐
       cally based on the extension, use pfsin command.

       Both the standard LDR tiff and extended HDR (logLuv encoding http://www.anyhere.com/gward/pixformat/tiffluv.html); Note that both LDR and HDR tiff files provide photometric data (ie  linearly  related
       to luminance). The 'LUMINANCE' tag is set to 'RELATIVE', also the '--linear' switch is ignored.

       To read images from standard input use a single dash '-' instead of filename. The images are read until EOF is reached.

       Each file can contain a %d pattern, which is substituted with frame numbers. The pattern has the same syntax as C printf command. For example, you can use %04d to make the frame number four digit with
       proceedings zeros. You can select the frames using the following options (the options must be always given after the file name):

       --frames <range>
              Range is given in mathlab / octave format:

              startframe:step:endframe

              Frame numbers start with startframe (default 0), are increased by step (default 1) and stop at endframe You can skip one of those values, for example 1:100 for frames 1,2,...,100 and  0:2:  for
              frame 0,2,4,... up to the last file that exists.

       --skip-missing
              Skip  up  to ten frames in a row if corresponding files are missing. Otherwise the program stops reading sequence at the first file that does not exists. This switch does not apply to the first
              frame in a sequence. This switch can be useful if there is a rendered animation where some of the frame has not been generated.

       --linear
              Ignored for compatibility with pfsinppm.

EXAMPLES
       pfsintiff frame%04d.tif --frames 0:10 | pfsview

              Read frames from files frame0000.tif, frame0001.tif, ..., frame0010.tif and show them using pfsview.
