NAME
       atari-hd-image - tool for creating a harddisk image for use with Hatari

SYNOPSIS
       atari-hd-image size [filename] [partition name] [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       Create an ACSI/IDE harddisk image for Hatari with a single Atari compatible DOS FAT partition (using sfdisk, mkdosfs, atari-convert-dir, mcopy, dd and python).

OPTIONS
       size   Harddisk image size in megabytes, 8-512.  512MB is largest partition size supported by TOS versions before v4.x and by mkdosfs (for Atari compatible partition formatting).

       filename
              Name for the harddisk image (default: hd.img)

       partition name
              Name for the single partition (default: DOS)

       directory
              directory for initial content copied to the image.  atari-convert-dir tool is used to clip long file names to 8+3 size required by FAT and Atari TOS.  If resulting file names aren't unique, you
              get warning(s), but script continues

EXAMPLES
       16MB 'hd.img' HD image:
              atari-hd-image 16

       8MB image with partition named 'TEST', and files from content/:
              atari-hd-image 8 8mb-disk.img TEST content/
