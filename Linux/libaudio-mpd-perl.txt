NAME
       mpd-dynamic - a dynamic playlist for mpd

VERSION
       version 2.004

DESCRIPTION
       This program implements a dynamic playlist for MPD, build on top of the Audio::MPD perl module.

       MPD (music player daemon) is a cool music player, but it lacks a dynamic playlist. A dynamic playlist is a playlist that will change automatically over time. In particular, it will remove already
       played songs (keeping at most a given number of songs) and add new songs to the playlist so it never fall short of songs.

       Note that since mpd is a daemon needing no gui to work, "mpd-dynamic" is also a daemon. That is, it will fork and do all its work from the background.  This way, you can fire "mpd" and
       "mpd-dynamic" and forget completely about your music (especially since "mpd-dynamic" is a low-resource program): it will just be there! :-)

USAGE
           mpd-dynamic [options]

OPTIONS
   General behaviour
       You can customize the usage of mpd-dynamic with the following options:

       -o[ld] <old>
           Number of old tracks to keep in the backlog. Defaults to 10.

       -n[ew] <new>
           Number of new tracks to keep in the to-be-played playlist. Defaults to 10.

       -s[leep] <sleep>
           Time spent sleeping (in seconds) before checking if playlist should be updated. Default to 5 seconds.

       -d[ebug]
           Run mpd-dynamic in debug mode. In particular, the program will not daemonize itself. Default to false.

       -e[ncoding] <encoding>
           Print debug messages with this encoding. Since mpd-dynamic is meant to be a silent daemon, this option will not be used outside of debug mode. Default to "utf-8".

       --version
       --usage
       --help
       --man
           Print the usual program information

       Note however that those flags are optional: since "mpd-dynamic" comes with some sane defaults, you can fire "mpd-dynamic" as is.

   Ratings
       You  can  also  take  advantage  of  ratings  if  you want. With those options, songs need to have at least a given rating (or no rating yet) to be inserted: this way, you will only listen to your
       favorite songs!

       Ratings can be created / updated with "mpd-rate".

       Note that if you supply a non-existant rating db-file, the rating mechanism will be ignored. The following options control the rating mechanism:

       -r[atings] <ratings>
           The path of a db file with the ratings per song. The keys are the song path (relative to MPD root), and the value is an integer (the rating). Default to "~/.mpd/ratings.db".

       -m[in[imum]] <min>
           The minimum rating for a song to be inserted in the playlist. Default to 4.
