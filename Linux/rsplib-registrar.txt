DESCRIPTION
       rspregistrar provides a registrar service for Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) pool elements (PEs) and pool users (PUs). PRs of an operation scope synchronize their view of the handlespace using
       the  Endpoint  haNdlespace  Redundancy  Protocol (ENRP), transported via SCTP. An operation scope has a limited range, e.g. an organization or only a building. In particular, it is restricted to a
       single administrative domain - in contrast to GRID computing - in order to keep the management complexity at a minimum. Nevertheless, PEs may be distributed globally for their service  to  survive
       localized disasters.

       PEs  choose  an arbitrary PR of the operation scope to register into a pool by using the Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP), again transported via SCTP.  Upon registration at a PR, the chosen
       PR becomes the Home-PR (PR-H) of the newly registered PE. A PR-H is responsible for monitoring its PEs' availability by keep-alive messages (to be acknowledged by the PE within  a  given  timeout)
       and propagates the information about its PEs to the other PRs of the operation scope via ENRP updates.

       In  order  to access the service of a pool given by its PH, a PU requests a PE selection from an arbitrary PR of the operation scope, using the Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP), transported
       via SCTP. The PR selects the requested list of PE identities by applying a pool-specific selection rule, called pool policy.

       In order to allow for automatic configuration, a PR can send out regular announces via an ASAP and ENRP multicast address. PEs and PUs can listen to this address to learn  the  list  of  currently
       available PRs.

ARGUMENTS
       The following options are available:

       -quiet  Do not print startup and shutdown messages.

       -announcettl=TTL
               Sets the TTL for outgoing ASAP Announce/ENRP Presence messages via multicast.

       Logging Parameters:

               -logfile=filename
                       Write logging output to a file (default is stdout); given file will be overwritten.
