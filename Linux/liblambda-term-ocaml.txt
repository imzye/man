NAME
       lambda-term-inputrc - Key bindings for lambda-term applications

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.config/lambda-term-inputrc

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the format of the ~/.config/lambda-term-inputrc file. This file is a text file which associates editing actions to key sequences. Comments start with a '#' character and
       empty lines are ignored.

       Bindings are of the form:

               <key-sequence>: <actions>

       Where <key-sequence> is a sequence of keys in the emacs format. For example Control+w is written "C-w", Control+Meta+x followed by "e" is written "C-M-x e".  <actions> is a list of editing actions
       separeted by commas. The list of all available actions with a short description can be obtained by running the command lambda-term-actions(1) in a terminal.

       The  file is divided in two section, the [edit] section and the [read-line] section. The first one is for key bindings that apply everyhere and the second for key bindings that apply only in read-
       line.

       Here is an example of bindings:

               [read-line]
               C-w: kill-prev-word
               M-!: play-macro

       In addition to letters and symbols the following keys can be used:

               * enter
               * escape
               * tab
               * up
               * down
               * left
               * right
               * f1
               * f2
               * f3
               * f4
               * f5
               * f6
               * f7
               * f8
               * f9
               * f10
               * f11
               * f12
               * next
               * prev
               * home
               * end
               * insert
               * delete
               * backspace

       Note that lambda-term accept only ascii characters in the configuration file, to use other unicode character you must use the notation U+<code> where <code> is the code of the character  in  hexa‐
       decimal.
