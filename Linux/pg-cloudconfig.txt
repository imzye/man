NAME
       pg_cloudconfig - set optimized defaults for PostgreSQL in virtualized environments

DESCRIPTION
       usage: pg_cloudconfig [-h] [--max_connections MAX_CONNECTIONS]

       [--pg_conf_dir PG_CONF_DIR] [--dynamic_only]
              [--blacklist SETTING [SETTING ...]] [--debug] [-q] [--version] pg_version pg_clustername

       Tool to initially set optimized defaults for PostgreSQL in virtualized environments. Settings are changed without asking for confirmation.

   positional arguments:
       pg_version
              version of the PostgreSQL cluster to tune

       pg_clustername
              name of the PostgreSQL cluster to tune

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --max_connections MAX_CONNECTIONS
              set the max_connections explicitly if needed

       --pg_conf_dir PG_CONF_DIR
              path to dir holding the postgresql.conf (to override default)

       --dynamic_only
              do not set static optimized defaults, only set values dynamic calculated

       --blacklist SETTING [SETTING ...]
              settings not to touch

       --debug
              show debug messages

       -q, --quiet
              disable output

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       pg_cloudconfig  should  be  run  as  the same user as PostgreSQL. pg_version and pg_clustername are used to choose a cluster. It is assumed that the Debian /
       postgresql-common naming and configuration schema is used. If this is not the case --pg_conf_dir needs to be set. pg_conftool is used  to  get/set  settings.
       This does not tune PostgreSQL for any specific workload but only tries to set some optimized defaults based on a few input variables and simple rules.
