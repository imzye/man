NAME
       debdiff-apply - apply a debdiff to a Debian source package

SYNOPSIS
       debdiff-apply [options] [orig_dsc_or_dir] [patch_file]
       debdiff-apply [options] < [patch_file]

DESCRIPTION
       debdiff-apply takes a patchfile that describes the differences between two Debian source packages old and new, and applies it to a target Debian source package orig.

       orig could either be the same as old or it could be different.  patchfile is expected to be a unified diff between two Debian source trees, as what debdiff(1) normally generates.

       Any  changes  to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the conflicts that changelog diffs typically produce when applied naively. The exact behaviour may be tweaked in the future, so one
       should not rely on it.

       If patchfile does not apply to orig, even after the special-casing of debian/changelog, no changes are made and debdiff-apply(1) will exit with a non-zero error code.

ARGUMENTS
       orig_dsc_or_dir
              Target to apply the patch to. This can either be an unpacked source tree, or a .dsc file. In the former case, the directory is modified in-place; in the latter case, a second .dsc  is  created.
              Default: .

       patch_file
              Patch file to apply, in the format output by debdiff(1).  Default: /dev/stdin

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --verbose
              Output more information

       -c CHANGELOG, --changelog CHANGELOG
              Path to debian/changelog; default: debian/changelog

       -D DISTRIBUTION, --distribution DISTRIBUTION
              Distribution to use, if the patch doesn't already contain a changelog; default: experimental

       --repl Run the python REPL after processing.

       --source-version
              Don't apply the patch; instead print out the version of the package that it is supposed to be applied to, or nothing if the patch does not specify a source version.

       --target-version
              Don't apply the patch; instead print out the new version of the package debdiff-apply(1) would generate, when the patch is applied to the the given target package, as specified by the other ar‐
              guments.

   For .dsc patch targets:
       --no-clean
              Don't clean temporary directories after a failure, so you can examine what failed.

       --quilt-refresh
              If the building of the new source package fails, try to refresh patches using quilt(1) then try building it again.

       -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
              Extract the .dsc into this directory, which won't be cleaned up after debdiff-apply(1) exits. If not given, then it will be extracted to a temporary directory.
