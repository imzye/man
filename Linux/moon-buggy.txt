SYNOPSIS
       moon-buggy [-hnsV] [--help] [--no-title] [--show-scores] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       Moon-buggy  is  a  simple character graphics game, where you drive some kind of car across the moon´s surface.  Unfortunately there are dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump over
       them!

OPTIONS
       The program understands the following command line options.

       -h, --help
              shows a short usage message.

       -m, --mesg
              disable write access to your terminal by other users, so your boss can´t disturb your game play with the help of "write" or "finger".

       -n, --no-title
              skips the title screen.

       -s, --show-scores
              shows the current highscore list and exits.

       -V, --version
              prints the program´s version to standard output and exits.

KEYS
       The moon-buggy is controlled by a couple of keys, which are described near the bottom of the screen.  Most important are the following keys.

       SPC, j makes your car jump.  The length of a jump is fixed and you can only start a new jump, while the wheels have contact to the ground.

       a, l   fires the mining laser.  The laser is used to remove stones, which may block your way.

       q      quits the game prematurely.  But you still keep your score and may enter the highscore list.
