NAME
       tbl2asn - prepare a GenBank submission using an ASCII feature table

SYNOPSIS
       tbl2asn  [-]  [-A str]  [-C str]  [-D filename] [-E] [-F str] [-G str] [-H str] [-J] [-K] [-L] [-M str] [-N n] [-O] [-P] [-Q str] [-R] [-S] [-T] [-U] [-V str] [-W] [-X str] [-Y filename] [-Z filename]
       [-a str] [-b] [-c str] [-f filename] [-g] [-h] [-i filename] [-j str] [-k str] [-l str] [-m str] [-n str] [-o filename] [-p str] [-q] [-r str]  [-s]  [-t filename]  [-u]  [-v]  [-w filename]  [-x str]
       [-y str] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
       tbl2asn  reads  a template along with sequence and table files, and outputs ASN.1 for submission to GenBank. Thus, the submitter does not need to read each set of table and sequence files into Sequin.
       Furthermore, the template file can contain the organism and submitter information common to all records, obviating the need to input these data for each sequence/table pair.
