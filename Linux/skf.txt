NAME
       skf - simple Kanji Filter (v2.1)

SYNOPSIS
       skf [-EIJKNQRSXZbehjknqrsuvxz] [ long_format_options ] [infiles..]

DESCRIPTION
       skf is a yet another i18n capable kanji-filter, designed for reading various CJK-coded files on the Net.  skf converts input kanji texts or streams into a character stream using designated codeset and
       output them to standard output. Specifically, skf is designed to be a versatile filter to read documents in various code sets, and does not provide features not related to code conversion.

       Like nkf, skf automatically recognizes an input file code when it is a kind of ISO-2022 compliant code, and also detects EUC-variant codes if input file is Japanese text without X 0201 kanas.  skf 2.1
       can  read  various iso-2022 compliant character sets, including JIS Kanji codes (X 0208, X 0212 and X 0213), EUC encoding (euc-jp (with X 0213 support), euc-cn, euc-kr and euc-tw), ISO Europian latins
       (ISO-8859-1 to 11, 13/14/15/16) and many regional character sets.  skf can also read some non-iso2022 compliant sets, including Microsoft Shift-JIS code, KOI-8-R/U, GB2312 (HZ), big5,  VISCII(rfc1456,
       include VIQR), Unicode standard (UCS2/UTF-16, UTF7 and UTF8), some of MS codesets (cp1250 etc.) and some other vendor specific codes (KEIS83, JEF etc).

       Supported  output  character sets of skf are more limited, but still include X 0208/X 0212/X 0213 JIS, X 0201 JIS, ASCII, Microsoft Shift-JIS, EUC-jp/-kr/-cn, HZ, iso-2022-jp/kr, big5, VISCII and Uni‐
       code.

       skf also provides some basic decoding features for some common encodings including MIME, Punycode and URI codepoint.  Unicode decomposition feature is also supported since 1.96.

       As noted above, skf is designed to convert input text into some kind of human-readable forms under a local environment (i.e. codeset), and has several extra conversion features like  GNU  recode  type
       folding.  Such conversions include Windows/Macintosh specific code swaps and old-new jis glyph changes, html-format/TeX format conversion and variant unifications.

       skf also can be compiled as an extension of some lightweight languages.  See README.txt for details.

       If one or more file names are given, skf read the files and output converted stream to stdout.  If no file names are given, input is taken from stdin and output is also stdout.  OPTIONS are taken from
       environment variables SKFENV, skfenv and command line, respectively in this order. Environment variables are not used when skf is running as a priviledged user.  skf does not use LOCALE-related  envi‐
       ronment variables for conversions, but output error messages are controlled by given LOCALES.

CODESET OPTIONS
       skf is written from scratch, and inherits no code from nkf. However, skf is intended to be a drop-in replacement for nkf(v1.4) and has a similar commonly-used nkf option set.
       skf 2.1 recognizes following options. Defaults are all off if not explicitly specified.

   buffering control
       -b     use buffered output. This is default.

       -u     use unbuffered output.  Code detection feature is disabled when this option is on.

   Input/Output codeset options
       --ic=  input_code_set
              specify input codeset is input_code_set.  Possible candidates are shown below.

       --oc=  output_code_set
              specify  output  codeset  is output_code_set.  Possible candidates are shown below. Default codeset in distribution package is euc-jp, but depends on compile option. Default codeset is shown by
              ´skf -h´.

     Supported codeset
       skf recognizes following codesets as an input/output codeset. These codeset names are case insensitive, and minus ('-') and underscore ('_') is ignored.  Note that iso-2022 escape-based input  codeset
       (registered  to IANA) is recoginized automatically, even when non-iso2022 codeset (except Unicode and B-Right/V) is specified.  o in in-column means named codeset can be specified as input and x means
       named codeset is not for input. output-column is same except it is for output.

              utf16le and unicode is little endian.  Output includes endian mark by default unless --disable-endian-mark is specified. Output range is within UTF-32 with surrogate pair unless --limit-to-ucs2
              is specified.
              Note that ucs2 is not supported within lightweight language extension in both in and output, because of SWIG's passing data structure limitation. Specify to ucs2 will generate error.

       utf8
              Encoding is UTF-8 encoded Unicode (v11.0). Output doesn't include byte order mark unless --enable-endian-mark is specified.  Output range is within UTF-32 unless --limit-to-ucs2  is  specified.
              By default, CESU-8 is not accepted as input. Option --enable-cesu8 enables CESU-8 input for utf-8 converter. CESU-8 output is not supported.  For UTF-8, endian mark (BOM) is always ignored.

       utf7
              Encoding  is  UTF-7 encoded Unicode (v11.0). Input/output range is limited to UTF-16, and value above U+10000 is regarded as undefined.  BOM is always ignored for input, and never used for out‐
              put.

       utf7-imap

     ISO-2022 Specific controls
       Replaces G0-3 after setting up according to specified input codeset by assigned character set with this option. Note that this doesn't change any codeset properties of the original codeset, like  lan‐
       guage and encoding.

       --set-g0=`charset name'
              Predefines specified code set to plane 0 (G0). Also set to GL at initial state.

       --set-g1=`charset name'
              Predefines specified code set to right plane (G1). Also set to GR at initial state.

       --set-g2=`charset name'
              Predefines specified code set to right plane (G2).

       --set-g3=`charset name'
              Predefines specified code set to right plane (G3).

       Supported  `char_set'  is  as follows. 'o' means the codeset can be specified to set to the plane. 'x' means you can't. For unicode family codesets, this option is ignored. For other non-iso2022 cate‐
       gories, this option is not supported, and result is unpredictable.

       --euc-protect-g1
              In EUC input mode, suppress sequences to set a charset to G1. Such sequences are discarded.

       --add-annon
              Add announcer for JIS X 0208:1997 to X 0208 designate sequence. This option works only with iso-2022-based output.

       --input-detect-jis78
              Distinguish JIS X 0208:1978 codeset and JIS X 0208:1997 codeset.  By default, these two charsets are regarded as X 0208:1997. This option is valid only when input encoding is JIS (iso-2022-jp).

     JIS X 0212(Supplement Kanji code) Support
       --x0212-enable
              skf by default does not output JIS X 0212 code in JIS/EUC mode. This option enables use of JIS X 0212 part.  Non-Japanese code, Shift_JIS variants, Unicode or KEIS output  ignore  this  option.
              Note that this option is supported for backward compatibility.  It may not be supported in future versions.

     Unicode coding specific control options
       skf-2.10 is conformed on Unicode 11.0 specification.

       --use-compat --suppress-compat
              By  --suppress-compat, skf substitutes characters in unicode compatibility planes (U+F900 - U+FFFD) to appropriate characters in non-compatibility planes. If this substitution is enabled, these
              characters is converted to variants or undefined.  By --use-compat, skf outputs character in this area as it is.  Default is --use-compat.  Several codesets controls  this  as  codeset  feature
              (i.e. Use compatibility planes). See codeset section.

       --use-ms-compat
              When  output  is  Unicode,  make  Unicode  map to be Microsoft windows compatible). This only changes conversion for some symbols in JIS-Kanji, and adding --use-compat option is recommended for
              roundtrip conversion. If you need more strict compatibility, try cp932w for input codeset.

       --use-cde-compat
              When output is Unicode, make translation CDE standard codeset compatible.

       --little-endian
              When output is UTF-16le/be, use little endian byte-order.

       --big-endian
              When output is UTF-16le/be, use big endian byte-order.

       --disable-endian-mark --enable-endian-mark
              When output is UTF-16 or UTF-8, do not use/use byte order marking. To make UTF-16N, use this option with --little-endian. By default, BOM is enabled for UTF-16 and disabled for UTF-8.

       --input-little-endian
              When input is UTF-16le/be, assume input is little endian byte-ordered.

       --input-big-endian
              When input is UTF-16le/be, assume input is big endian byte-ordered.

       --endian-protect
              Do not use endian mark in input stream. Endian mark is just discarded.  This is off by default.

       --limit-to-ucs2
              Do not use > 0x10000 area code in Unicode (i.e. limits code to BMP area).  This option doesn't limit internal code range in skf. This is off by default.

       --disable-cjk-extension
              Treat CJK extension A/B areas as undefined. This is off (i.e. these areas are enabled) by default.

       --enable-cesu8
              Enable CESU-8 input in utf-8 codeset. Ignored for any other codesets.

       --non-strict-utf8
              Enable broken (decodable but not obeying specs.) utf-8 input. If you need this option, proceeds with extra care.

       --enable-nfd-decomposition --disable-nfd-decomposition
              Enable/Disable Unicode Normalized decomposition. Default is disabled.

       --enable-nfda-decomposition --disable-nfda-decomposition
              Enable/Disable Apple-compatible Unicode Normalized decomposition.  Default is disabled.

       --oldcell-to-emoticon
              Convert old cell-phone gaiji area to emoticon. Supported: NTT Docomo/AU emoticons. A reverse mapping is not supported.

       --fix-ms-radical-bug
              mscvrt bug for Windows 10 20H1 or later has an infamous bug which convert some Kanji to Kanji radix. This option reconvert radix area to appropriate Kanjis.  This option is for Unicode output.

     Miscellanious codeset related options
       --old-nec-compat
              Enable old NEC kanji sequence (ESC-K,H). Needs compile option --enable-oldnec at configuration.

       --no-utf7
              Assume input codeset is *NOT* UTF-7 encoded Unicode.  This option disables input utf7 testing.

       --no-kana
              Assume input codeset does *NOT* include JIS X 0201 kana.

       --input-limit-to-jp
              Tell detection mechanism that input is some kind of Japanese codeset.

   OUTPUT Conversions options
       skf is intended to output stream to stdout, buf nkf-compatible file-encoding change option is also provided.

       --overwrite[=SUFFIX] --in-place[=SUFFIX]
              converts encoding of file(s) specified as input. --overwrite preserves file change date. If SUFFIX parameter is added, input file is back-up'ed with a name appended this SUFFIX.

       skf has various features to fix output files appropriate in local environment.  Most of these are controlled by extended control switches described in this section.

       --use-g0-ascii
              set G0(=GL) for output encoding to ASCII, ignoring codeset designation.

     X-0201 Kana/latin conversions
       skf by default converts X-0201 kanas to X-0208 kanas. To output X-0201 kana as it is, use one of following options. When output is designated to EUC or SJIS, these three  options  enable  X-0201  kana
       output by ways provided by each encoding. When Unicode output is specified, (equiv.) kana part output is controlled by --use-compat, not following switches.  Valid only when output codeset is NOT Uni‐
       code family.

       --kana-jis7
              use SI/SO locking shift sequence to designate X-0201 kana.  This switch is valid for jis, jis-x0213 and cp50220 (i.e. cp50221) encoding.  For other codesets, this option is ignored.

       --kana-jis8
              output X-0201 kana using 8-bit code right plane.  This switch is valid for jis and jis-x0213 encoding.  For other codeset, this option is ignored.

       --kana-esci --kana-call
              use ESC-(-I to designate X-0201 kana.  This switch is valid for jis, jis-x0213 and cp50220 (i.e. cp50222) encoding.  For other codeset, this option is ignored.

       --kana-enable
              If output is EUC-JP or cp51932, use X-0201 kana with G2.  If SJIS output, it is same as --kana-jis8.  When JIS output, it is same as --kana-call.

       --use-iso8859-1
              Enable iso-8859-1 output. Iso-8859-1 is invoked to G1 and set to GR plane.

     URI/TeX format conversion feature options
       With Unicode(tm) family output codings, skf output non-ascii latin character part as it is, but with other output codings, skf converts these characters using following rules:

       (1) If a code is defined in a specified output codeset, specified code point is used for output.
       (2) If one of following html convert modes are enabled (i.e. --convert-html --convert-sgml) and the code is defined in html/sgml codeset, it is converted to entity-reference or codepoint reference.
       (3) If tex convert mode enabled and the code is defined in tex expression, it is converted to tex format.
       (4) If the code is a kind of combined ligatures, it is shown by a set of characters.
       (5) A kind of replacement character is shown, with warning.

       --convert-html --convert-sgml--convert-xml
              Enable html convert mode. This mode is cleared by --reset. These two options are synonyms, and are treated as same option.

       --convert-html-decimal
              Enable html code-point decimal convert mode. This mode is cleared by --reset.

       --convert-html-hexadecimal
              Enable html code-point hexadecimal convert mode. This mode is cleared by --reset.

       --convert-tex
              Enable TeX convert mode. This mode is cleared by --reset.

       --convert-perl
              Enable Perl5 literal convert mode. This mode is cleared by --reset.

       --convert-java
              Enable Java literal convert mode. This mode is cleared by --reset.

       --convert-python
              Enable Python literal convert mode. This mode is cleared by --reset.

       --use-replace-char
              In Unicode, use unicode replacement chatacter (U+fffc) for undefined chatacter.

 Extended Options
   Encoding/Decoding control options
       --decode=`encoding scheme'

       --encode=`encoding scheme'
              Specify an decoding/encoding scheme for input stream.  Supported encoding schemes for decoding are `hex', 'mime', 'mime_q',  'mime_b',  'uri',  'ace',  'hex_perc_encode',  'base64',  'qencode',
              'rfc2231',  `rot'  and  'none'.  Each option means CAP hex-code, mime, mime Q-encoding, mime B-encoding, uri character reference, ACE punycode, uri percent notation, base64, Q-encoding, rfc2231
              and rot13/47 respectively. 'none' means no decode.
              For encoding, 'hex', 'mime_b', 'mime_q', 'uri', 'ace', 'cap',
               'hex_perc_encode', 'base64' and 'none' are supported. EBCDIC related codesets and some already ascii-encoded codeset (e.g. UTF-7) output with encoding is not supported.
              Only one decode/encode option is valid, and if more than one option is specified, the last one is used.  When one of mime decodings is specified, base text is assumed to be EUC encoding  unless
              specified  otherwise. Except rot, which assumes input stream is Shift_JIS, EUC or iso-2022-jp, these encodings assumes input stream is ascii (as defined in RFC2045). Some encodings may co-exist
              with encoding, but this is not guaranteed. Especially, if input is UTF-16/UCS2 code, these encoding is ignored in skf.

       --mime-ms-compat
              treat japanese generic codesets as Microsoft cp932 compatible. More specifically, with this option skf treats iso-2022-jp as cp50220, euc-jp as cp51932 and Shift_JIS as cp932w.   --mime-persis‐
              tent skf detects address-like strings and excludes them from mime encoding.  This option disables such behavior. Default in nkf-compatible mode.

   End of line control options
       --lineend-thru
              Output end-of-line code as it is. Also output ^Z code as it is.  This is default.

       --lineend-cr --lineend-mac-Lm
              Use CR as end-of-line code. Also delete ^Z code from input stream.

       --lineend-lf --lineend-unix-Lu
              Use LF as end-of-line code. Also delete ^Z code from input stream.

       --lineend-crlf --lineend-windows-Lw
              Use CR+LF as end-of-line code. Also delete ^Z code from input stream.  This option doesn't preserve original order of cr and lf.

       --input-cr
              Assume input stream uses CR as end-of-line code.

       --input-lf
              Assume input stream uses LF as end-of-line code.

       --input-crlf
              Assume input stream uses CR+LF as end-of-line code.

              Wrap  input lines by line_length columns. f option deletes CR/LF's in input, and F option doesn't delete them. For Japanese convension, both gyoutou-kinsoku(by burasage-gumi) and gyoumatsu-kin‐
              soku(by oidasi-gumi) is supported. The burasage-length is controlled by kinsoku option. Default value for line_length is 66, and must be < 1000. Default value for kinsoku is 5, and must  be  <=
              10. In 'f' option, skf autodetects paragraph and retains some CR/LF. 2nd 'f' option format (with '+') disables this behaviour.  In nkf compatible mode, some fold behaviors change as follows.
              (1) Default line_length is set to 60, and kinsoku value is 10.
              (2) alpha numeric characters become gyoutou-kinsoku characters.

   File control options
       --filewise-detect --force-reset
              Reset and re-detect input code set at the start of each file.

       --linewise-detect
              Reset and re-detect input code set at the start of each line.

   Compatibility options
       --nkf-compat
              interpret  following options as nkf compatible manners.  -l, -d, -c, -x, -X, -w and -W works as nkf2.x -f and -F behavior is changed as shown above.  -T, -i, -o is not supported.  Most of other
              nkf options and switches also work like nkf, except in case of error.

       --skf-compat
              interpret following options as skf-native manners.

       -r     nkf-compatible rot. Works only with --nkf-compat mode. Allowed input encodings are limited to JIS/Shift_JIS/EUC.

       -h[123]--hiragana--katakana--katakana-hiragana
              -h, -h1 and --hiragana converts all kanas to hiragana.  -h2 and --katakana convert all kanas to katakana.  -h3 and --katakana-hiragana swap katakana and hiragana.

       --nkf-help
              show option difference/compatibility between skf and nkf.

       --in-place[=SUF]--overwrite[=SUF]
              replace specified file with converted codeset. overwrite retains file create time stamp.  If a suffix is given, the suffix is added to output file name and input file is not removed.

   Lightweight language specific options
       skf plugin for lightweight language has subset of options. More specifically, file input/output related options(-b, -u,  --overwrite  --in-place,  --filewise-detect  --linewise-detect  --show-filename
       --suppress-filename) and UTF-16 output is disabled(except ruby or python3).

     Ruby-1.9.x/2.x specific options
       Since ruby 1.9, ruby uses CCS string handling. skf returns output string with specified codeset. Following options override this behavior.

       --rb-out-ascii8bit
              returns string with ascii-8bit encoding.

       --rb-out-string
              returns string with specified encoding.

     Python-3.x specific options
       Since  native  codeset representation in python3.x is UCS2/UCS4, skf behaves differently with output codeset option. If output codeset is either UTF-16 or UTF-32(in wide mode), skf returns Unicode ob‐
       ject, and for all other codesets skf returns binary array object. Following options change this behavior.

       --py-out-binary
              use psuede unicode binary stream to output.

       --py-out-string
              use binary array object on UTF-16/32 output. BOM is enabled.
              skf accepts either a binary array or an unicode object for input.

   Misc. Control options
       --disable-space-convert --enable-space-convert
              skf converts an ideographic space into two ascii spaces.  Disable option disables, and enable option enables this behavior.  Default is disabled.

       --html-sanitize
              Convert several characters in HTML document to entity reference expression. Specifically, "!#$&%()/<>:;?´ are escaped by entity-references.

       --filewise-detect --force-reset
              If multiple input files are given, detect input codeset for each file.

       --linewise-detect
              Detect input code line-wise. Note this option weakens code detect correctness.

       --reset
              Reset all flags specified by extended controls and enviroment variables.

       --inquiry --guess
              skf detects code and output detect result to stdout. No filtering output is performed. If multiple input files are given, --show-filename is automatically enabled.

       --hard-inquiry
              Similar as inquiry, but reports both code and an end-of-line character.

       --suppress-filename
              When inquiry(--inquiry) is on, this option disables file name output.  This option overrides --show-filename.

       --show-filename
              When inquiry(--inquiry) is on, this option adds each file name to output.

       --invis-strip
              Delete all escape sequences not belonging to ISO-2022 code extension. This is intended to replace invisstrip command bundled in inews package.

       -I     Warn if input has unassigned code points.

       -v     print version information and exit.

       --help print brief help and exit.

       --show-supported-codeset
              Display supported codesets (input) and exit. Both canonical names (left side) and detailed names are shown. This canonical name can be used as MIME charset and also as ic-option code specifica‐
              tion.

       --show-supported-charset
              Display  supported character sets (output) and exit. Both canonical names and detailed names are shown. Some charsets with special treatments (i.e.  meaningless as set-g* parameters) intension‐
              ally lacks addressable cnames.

FILES
       /usr/(local/)share/skf/lib/   (Unices)

       /Program Files/skf/share/lib (MS Windows)
              These directories are where external codeset conversion tables go.  The location that current skf assumes are shown by -h option.

       skf is written by Seiji Kaneko (efialtes@osdn.jp) based on idea from nkf written by Itaru Ichikawa (ichikawa@flab.fujitsu.co.jp) X 0213 code table is derived from work  of  earthian@tama.or.jp.   Some
       codeset mapping is derived from various sources. Detailed origin is shown in copyright document included in this distribution.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       1. skf can handle mixed coding with some limitations. However, code detection tends to fail for mixed code, and giving explicit input code set is strongly encouraged, if codeset is known beforehand.
       In case of need, --linewise-detect option may help, but code detecting will more likely fail.

       2. skf implements ISO-2022 with following exceptions.
        i) GL 0x20 is always space. Even when 96-character codeset is invoked to GL.
        ii) Sequences for setting codes to C1 and C2 are always ignored.
        iii) If unknown sequence is given to G0, G0 is set to ascii, and locking/single shift is cleared. Unknown sequece call to set to G1-G3 is just ignored.
        Private charset is also not supported and is ignored.
        iv) Sequences for 96 character multibyte coding is ignored (Currently, no codeset is registered).
        v) Calling UTF-8, UTF-16 coding system from iso-2022 is supported, and returns to previous coding system by standard return.
        Callings and returns to/from other coding schemes are ignored.
        vi) For supporting some of cellular phone glyphs, several private (not registered) codesets are defined in skf, and can be called by appropriate sequences.

       3. Error output coding is controlled by LOCALE environment variables in UN*X system. skf doesn't take care of situations like stdout and stderr are redirecting into a same stream. Such case should  be
       handled by user side.

       4.  skf  converts  KEIS/JIS  X  0213  code  using  CJK-extension B area and CJK compatibility area. For this reason, X 0213 and KEIS convert result varies depending on --use-compat and --limit-to-ucs2
       switches.

       5. JIS X 0207:1979 is not supported. JIS X 0211:1987 is designed to be supported (i.e. common terminal control sequence will be transparently passed to output).

       6. Even if unbuffer option(-u) is specified, some code-translation related bufferings are still performed (in MIME, kana, VIQR etc.).

       7. skf-1.9x or later recognizes and handles languages in iso639-1(alpha 2).  iso639-2 is not supported as a valid language set.

       8. Unicode IVS is not supported. Sequences are just discarded.

       9. skf-1.9x or later does not retain Macintosh RLO-ordered character property.  Codesets with this kind of codes are not supported.

       10. CNS11643 4th, 5th, 6th planes are not supported.

       11. In python 3 extension, a detected codeset by inquiry for input unicode strings are always UTF-32be.

       12. In lightweight language extension except ruby and python, UCS2/UTF-16 are not supported.

Notes
       1. Extended options are changed extensively since skf-1.9. Some archaic options (eg. -B, -@ and -r) have been deleted from this version.

       2. skf is originally forked project from nkf, but doesn't contain any nkf codes now.  Copyright notice is retained by honor.

       3. From version 1.9, default Japanese character set assumed by skf has changed to JIS X 0208:1990 with Microsoft Japanese Windows gaiji (i.e. CP932).

       4. Code autodetection is not perfect by design. If it has failed to detect input code properly, please give input code information explicitly.

       5. Some ligatures in Unicode, cp932 gaiji and KEIS83 are converted using JIS X 0124 and other convention.  During this conversion, its byte length is not preserved.

       6. skf is intended to pass ANSI compatible terminal control codes transparently, but this is not guaranteed.

       7. nkf's -i and -o options works only in nkf-compat mode. It is obsolete option in 1.97, and valid only when iso-2022-jp and without considering output codeset specifications.

       8. For unconverted character, skf uses geta and undefined character as --use-replace-char option.  If output codeset doesn't contain geta code, skf prefers 'black square character', then uses '.'  re‐
       spectively.

       9. There are some undocumented options. These options should be considered as highly experimental.

       10.  In  lineend_thru  mode  and  using folding, skf remembers order of cr and lf appears in stream, and use that order.  For this design, if skf needs to output line-end character before any line-end
       character appears in input stream, input order may not be preserved.

       11. NKF-compatibility
       1) --prefix, some --fb's and --no-best-fit-chars are not supported.
       2) MSDOS (and -T), --exec-in and --exec-out are not supported. -O is supported.
       3) MIME decoding/encoding handling behaviors differ in various ways.
       4) lineend conversion acts differently. Results may not be same for some messy text.
       5) -r option and --decode=rot is different. See each option description.
       6) detected codeset name is not compatible with nkf. --help and --version return different results.
       7) in-place and overwrite suffix with * is not supported.

       12. Conversion to NYUUKAN GAIJI is as follows
       1) Kanji codes in JIS X0208(1997), JIS X0212(1990), JIS X0213(2004/2012),
        Houmusho-kokuji No.582 beppyou No.1 are sent to output as it is.
       2) Kanji codes in beppyou No.4-2 leftmost columns are converted to the first
        priority character in the table. If the second priority characters appear,
        the codes are sent to output as it is.
       3) Other kanji codes are converted as undefined codes. See above conversion method.  Non-kanji codes (latins, glyphs etc.) are sent to output as it is.

       13. ARIB B24 compatibility
       1) Input only. ARIB B24 output is not supported.
       2) Neither international encoding nor X0213 extension are supported.
       3) Macro define sequences are suppressed. These sequences are recognized and
        discarded.
       4) Without specifying arib codeset, skf treats Arib-defined codepage as follows.
         i) private codepage are supported. ascii/jis x-0201 0x5f is not modified.
         ii) macro define/invoke and rpc invoke does not work. These characters are
           discarded.
