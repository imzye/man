NAME
       rdiff - compute and apply signature-based file differences

SYNOPSYS
       rdiff [options] signature old-file signature-file

       rdiff [options] delta signature-file new-file delta-file

       rdiff [options] patch old-file delta-file new-file

USAGE
       You  can  use rdiff to update files, much like rsync does.  However, unlike rsync, rdiff puts you in control.  There are three steps to updating a file: signature, delta, and patch. Use the signa‐
       ture subcommand to generate a small signature-file from the old-file. Use the delta subcommand to generate a small delta-file from the signature-file to the new-file. Use the patch  subcommand  to
       apply the delta-file to the old-file to regenerate the new-file.

DESCRIPTION
       In  every  case  where  a filename must be specified, - may be used instead to mean either standard input or standard output as appropriate.  Be aware that if you do this, you'll need to terminate
       your options with -- or rdiff will think you are passing it an empty option.

RETURN VALUE
       0 for successful completion, 1 for environmental problems (file not found, invalid options, IO error, etc), 2 for a corrupt file and 3 for an internal error or unhandled situation in  librsync  or
       rdiff.
