NAME
       dh_golang - Generates Static-Built-Using substvar for Go programs

SYNOPSIS
       dh_golang [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_golang is a debhelper program which adds the misc:Static-Built-Using substvar based on the dependencies of the package being built. It uses go list to determine the packages imported and dpkg-
       query to find the source package and version that provided that package.

       dh_golang started out in 2013 by generating the misc:Built-Using substvar, but it was clarified Debian Policy in 2017 that the Built-Using field was intended only for license-required
       dependencies, hence the switch to the new Static-Built-Using field in 2022.

       For backward compatibility, dh_golang will continue to generate the misc:Built-Using substvar until all Go packages have transitioned to misc:Static-Built-Using.

NOTES
       The best way to invoke dh_golang is by adding dh-sequence-golang to the package build dependencies and using dh or by using dh --with=golang.
