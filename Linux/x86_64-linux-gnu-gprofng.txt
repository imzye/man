GPROFNG(1)                                                                  User Commands                                                                 GPROFNG(1)

NAME
       gprofng - the driver for the gprofng tool suite

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng [OPTION(S)] COMMAND [KEYWORD] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       This is the driver for the GPROFNG tools suite to gather and analyze performance data.

OPTIONS
       --version
              print the version number and exit.

       --help print usage information and exit.

       --check
              verify if the hardware and software environment is supported.

       --verbose {on|off}
              enable (on) or disable (off) verbose mode; the default is "off".

COMMANDS
       The driver supports various commands. These are listed below.

       It  is  also  possible to invoke the lower level commands directly, but since these are subject to change, in particular the options, we recommend to use the
       driver.

       The man pages for the commands below can be viewed using the command name with "gprofng" replaced by "gp" and the spaces replaced by a dash ("-"). For  exam‐
       ple the man page name for "gprofng collect app" is "gp-collect-app".

       The following combination of commands and keywords are supported:

       Collect performance data

       gprofng collect app
              collect application performance data.

       Display the performance results

       gprofng display text
              display the performance data in ASCII format.

       gprofng display html
              generate an HTML file from one or more experiments.

       gprofng display src
              display source or disassembly with compiler annotations.

       Miscellaneous commands

       gprofng archive
              include binaries and source code in an experiment directory.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are supported:

       GPROFNG_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH
              set the depth of the call stack (default is 256).

       GPROFNG_USE_JAVA_OPTIONS
              may be set when profiling a C/C++ application that uses dlopen() to execute Java code.

       GPROFNG_SSH_REMOTE_DISPLAY
              use this variable to define the ssh command executed by the remote display tool.

       GPROFNG_SKIP_VALIDATION
              set this variable to disable checking hardware, system, and Java versions.

       GPROFNG_ALLOW_CORE_DUMP
              set this variable to allow a core file to be generated; otherwise an error report is created on /tmp.

       GPROFNG_ARCHIVE
              use this variable to define the settings for automatic archiving upon experiment recording completion.

       GPROFNG_ARCHIVE_COMMON_DIR
              set this variable to the location of the common archive.

       GPROFNG_JAVA_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH
              set the depth of the Java call stack; the default is 256; set to 0 to disable capturing of call stacks.

       GPROFNG_JAVA_NATIVE_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH
              set  the  depth  of the Java native call stack; the default is 256; set to 0 to disable capturing of call stacks (JNI and assembly call stacks are not
              captured).

DOCUMENTATION
       A getting started guide for gprofng is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the info and gprofng programs are properly installed  at  your  site,  the  command
       "info gprofng" should give you access to this document.
