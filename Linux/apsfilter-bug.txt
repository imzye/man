APSFILTER-BUG(1)                                                                          BSD General Commands Manual                                                                          APSFILTER-BUG(1)

NAME
     apsfilter-bug — create a half-automatic bug report for apsfilter

SYNOPSIS
     apsfilter-bug

OPTIONS
     none

DESCRIPTION
     With the apsfilter-bug script you can automatically create a bug report for apsfilter(1).  A template report file is created which you can edit with your favourite editor ( emacs(1) by default, or what‐
     ever is entered in the environment variable EDITOR ).

     You will see a couple of lines starting with '#'; these lines will be removed before the report is sent. So if you want to use the '#' character at the beginning of a line, just indent it with a space.

     A very important piece of the bug report is the debugging log created by aps2file(1), probably with a command like
           aps2file -D -o /dev/null [-P...] [-Z...] [input] 2> log.txt
     Unless you don't even have a chance to create a debugging log, it is crucial for serious bug hunting.

     After you have filled in as much (useful) information as possible, you must save the file under its original name, then exit your editor.

     If you invoked apsfilter-bug by accident, or if you need some additional system information to include into the bug report, just exit your editor without saving the file.

NOTES
     In addition to the stuff you've edited, some more information is appended to the bug report automatically:

     apsfilter version    7.2.6-stable
     ghostscript version  (from 'gs --version')
     system id            (from 'uname -a')
     configure options    --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --mandir=/usr/share/man --with-awk=/usr/bin/awk --with-sendmail=/usr/sbin/sendmail --with-shell=/bin/bash
     shell executable     /bin/bash
     awk executable       /usr/bin/awk
     sendmail executable  /usr/sbin/sendmail

FILES
     /usr/bin/aps2file  script to create debugging output

BUGS
     See apsfilter software center - http://www.apsfilter.org/ - for new versions, bugfixes and known bugs.

     Please use the new tool apsfilter-bug(1) to release bug- or problem reports. It automatically presents you a form in an editor window which asks you some standard questions.  If you save and quit the
     editor session, then this report is sent automatically via e-mail to the proper apsfilter mailinglist.

     If apsfilter fails to print something or prints it in a way you wouldn't expect and you want to report an apsfilter error then please save the debugging output of one print session using the new
     aps2file(1) utility by typing aps2file -D -Z options file > /dev/null 2> file.debug and including the debugging output in the file file.debug into the edit session of the apsfilter-bug utility, so that
     it is included into the mail to the apsfilter mailinglist.

     Please note that you need to run /bin/sh (Bourne Shell), bash or a compatible shell, so that the above mentioned output redirection works. Under C-shell (/bin/csh) or tcsh it would't work. If you don't
     know, then simply make sure you use the Bournce shell by typing /bin/sh or bash, then you should have no problems with redirection of stdout and stderr (> /dev/null 2> file.debug).
