       archpkgs2solv [OPTIONS] PKG1.pkg.xz ...

DESCRIPTION
       The archpkgs2solv tool converts the meta data from one or more Arch Linux packages into the solv file written to standard output.

       -m MANIFESTFILE
           Read the rpm file names from the specified MANIFESTFILE. You can use - to read the manifest from standard input.
