NAME
       dptest - test cases for QDBM Depot

SYNOPSIS
       dptest write [-s] name rnum bnum
       dptest read [-wb] name

DESCRIPTION
       The  command `dptest' is a utility for facility test and performance test.  Check a database generated by the command or measure the execution time of the command.  This command is used in the follow‐
       ing format.  `name' specifies a database name.  `rnum' specifies the number of the records.  `bnum' specifies the number of the elements of the bucket array.  `pnum' specifies the number  of  patterns
       of the keys. `align' specifies the basic size of alignment.  `fbpsiz' specifies the size of the free block pool.

       dptest write [-s] name rnum bnum
              Store records with keys of 8 bytes.  They change as `00000001', `00000002'...

       dptest read [-wb] name
              Retrieve all records of the database above.

       dptest rcat [-c] name rnum bnum pnum align fbpsiz
              Store records with partway duplicated keys using concatenate mode.

       dptest combo name
              Perform combination test of various operations.

       dptest wicked [-c] name rnum
              Perform updating operations selected at random.

       Options feature the following.

              -s : make the file sparse.
              -wb : use the function `dpgetwb' instead of the function `dpget'.
              -c : perform comparison test with map of Cabin.

       This command returns 0 on success, another on failure.  The environment variable `QDBMDBGFD' specifies the file descriptor to output the history of updating the variable `dpecode'.
