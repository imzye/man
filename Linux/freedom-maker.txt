DESCRIPTION
       FreedomBox is a community project to develop, design and promote personal servers running free software for private, personal communications. It is a networking appliance designed to allow
       interfacing with the rest of the Internet under conditions of protected privacy and data security. It hosts applications such as blog, wiki, website, social network, email, web proxy and a Tor
       relay on a device that can replace a wireless router so that data stays with the users.

       freedom-maker is a tool to build FreedomBox images for various single board computers, virtual machines and general purpose computers.
