CYR_DBTOOL(8)                     Cyrus IMAP                     CYR_DBTOOL(8)

NAME
       cyr_dbtool - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Manage Cyrus databases

SYNOPSIS
       cyr_dbtool [ -C config-file ] [ -M ] [ -n ] [ -o ] [ -T ]
               db-file db-backend action [ key ] [ value ]

DESCRIPTION
       cyr_dbtool is used to manage a cyrusdb file. The usable actions are:
          show [<prefix>]

          get <key>

          set <key> <value>

          delete <key>

          consistency

          repack

       You  may omit key or key/value and specify one per line on stdin.  Keys
       are terminated by tab or newline, values are terminated by newline.

       Running without any options will list the available  database  backends
       and usable actions.

       The  consistency  action  runs a consistency check on the DB by calling
       'myconsistent' on it.

       The repack action will compress the database by removing stale data  on
       backends which support it.  It's a NOOP otherwise.

       cyr_dbtool  reads  its  configuration  options out of the imapd.conf(5)
       file unless specified otherwise by -C.

       NOTE:
          Note that the file locations are NOT read out of  the  configuration
          file, and must be supplied on the command line.

       TIP:
          The format of all Cyrus databases is detailed in the distribution in
          file doc/internal/database-formats.html.  Please  consult  that  for
          details.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -M     Uses improved MBOX list sort

       -n     Create the database file if it doesn't already exist.

       -o     Store all the output in memory and only print it once the trans‐
              action is completed.

       -T     Use  a transaction to do the action (most especially for 'show')
              - the default used to be transactions.

EXAMPLES
       This series of examples address manipulating the user_deny.db database,
       which is used to deny users access to specific services.  This is typi‐
       cally a Cyrus "flat" format database.

       user_deny.db is indexed by userid and each record contains the database
       version  number  (currently 2), a list of "wildmat" patterns specifying
       Cyrus services to be denied, and a text message to be displayed to  the
       user  upon denial. The service names to be matched are those as used in
       cyrus.conf(5).  cyr_deny(8) provides  more  convenient  way  to  manage
       user_deny.db.

       NOTE:
          Given  that  keys are tab-delimited, these examples use the notation
          <tab> to indicate the tab character.  When  entering  this  via  the
          command  line,  remember to escape tabs.  In a normal shell, one can
          do so with <ctrl-v> (^v).  The  sequence  "<ctrl-v><ctrl-i>"  (^v^i)
          works well to enter tab characters.

       cyr_dbtool /var/lib/imap/user_deny.db flat baduser "2<tab>pop3,imap<tab>Denied"
          Deny the user 'baduser' access to imap and pop3.

       cyr_dbtool /var/lib/imap/user_deny.db flat show
          Show all current database records.

       cyr_dbtool /var/lib/imap/user_deny.db flat get baduser
          Get the current database record(s) for user 'baduser'.
