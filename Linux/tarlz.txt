NAME
       tarlz - creates tar archives with multimember lzip compression

SYNOPSIS
       tarlz operation [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       Tarlz is a massively parallel (multithreaded) combined implementation of the tar archiver and the lzip compressor. Tarlz uses the compression library lzlib.

       Tarlz  creates tar archives using a simplified and safer variant of the POSIX pax format compressed in lzip format, keeping the alignment between tar members and lzip members. The resulting multi‐
       member tar.lz archive is backward compatible with standard tar tools like GNU tar, which treat it like any other tar.lz archive. Tarlz can append files to the end of such compressed archives.

       Keeping the alignment between tar members and lzip members has two advantages. It adds an indexed lzip layer on top of the tar archive, making it possible to decode the archive safely in parallel.
       It also reduces the amount of data lost in case of corruption.

       The tarlz file format is a safe POSIX-style backup format. In case of corruption, tarlz can extract all the undamaged members from the tar.lz archive, skipping over the damaged members, just  like
       the  standard (uncompressed) tar. Moreover, the option '--keep-damaged' can be used to recover as much data as possible from each damaged member, and lziprecover can be used to recover some of the
       damaged members.

       --warn-newer
              warn if any file is newer than the archive

       If no archive is specified, tarlz tries to read it from standard input or write it to standard output.

       Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file not found, files differ, invalid command-line options, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or invalid input file,  3  for
       an internal consistency error (e.g., bug) which caused tarlz to panic.
