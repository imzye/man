NAME
       utrans-deb - apply utrans to all systemd units in given deb files

       utrans [ -b <BACKENDS> ] <DEB-FILE>*

       -b <BACKENDS>
              use the comma-separated list of backends for all utrans calls.  The last mentioned backend of each type (service, socket, timer) will be used.

DESCRIPTION
       utrans-deb  uses  utrans to translate systemd services, sockets and timers in given deb files to corresponding generic UNIX configuration and scripting as used in alternative settings that exclude
       systemd.

       The translation creates a temporary working directory in the current directory for unpacking of all deb given files and translation of their units. The result is packed up into a tar file named as
       the first deb file with "-services.tgz" appended.
