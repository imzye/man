NAME
       ixplore - A tool that provides insights into IXFRs

SYNOPSIS
       ixplore COMMAND COMMAND_OPT...

       ixplore diff ZONE BEFORE AFTER

       ixplore track IP ADDRESS PORT ZONE DIRECTORY

DESCRIPTION
       ixplore  is a tool to work with IXFR (incremental zonetransfers) in two
       modes (specified by COMMAND): diff or track.

       In the 'diff' mode, it will show a diff(1)-like output  between  BEFORE
       and AFTER.

       In  the 'track' mode, ixplore consumes IXFRs from IP ADDRESS and writes
       the resulting zonefiles out to  DIRECTORY/ZONE-serial.  If  no  initial
       zonefiles  exist, an initial AXFR will be done first. ixplore will then
       check the SOA serial on IP ADDRESS for ZONE every SOA  Refresh  seconds
       and perform an IXFR if the serial has increased.
