NAME
       Purple - Perl extension to the libpurple instant messenger library.

SYNOPSIS
         use Purple;

ABSTRACT
         This module provides the interface for using perl scripts as plugins
         in libpurple.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the interface for using perl scripts as plugins in Purple. With this, developers can write perl scripts that can be loaded in Purple as
       plugins. The scripts can interact with IMs, chats, accounts, the buddy list, libpurple signals, and more.

       The API for the perl interface is very similar to that of the Purple C API, which can be viewed at http://developer.pidgin.im/doxygen/ or in the header files
       in the Purple source tree.
