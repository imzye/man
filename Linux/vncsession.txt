NAME
       vncsession - start a VNC server

SYNOPSIS
       vncsession <username> <:display#>

DESCRIPTION
       vncsession  is used to start a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) desktop.  vncsession performs all the necessary steps to create a new user session, run Xvnc with appropriate options and starts a window
       manager on the VNC desktop.

       vncsession is rarely called directly and is normally started by the system service manager.

FILES
       Several VNC-related files are found in the directory $HOME/.vnc:

       /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults
              The optional system-wide equivalent of $HOME/.vnc/config. If this file exists and defines options to be passed to Xvnc, they will be used as defaults for  users.  The  user's  $HOME/.vnc/config
              overrides  settings configured in this file.  The overall configuration file load order is: this file, $HOME/.vnc/config, and then /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory. None are required to
              exist.

       /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory
              The optional system-wide equivalent of $HOME/.vnc/config. If this file exists and defines options to be passed to Xvnc, they  will  override  any  of  the  same  options  defined  in  a  user's
              $HOME/.vnc/config.  This  file offers a mechanism to establish some basic form of system-wide policy. WARNING! There is nothing stopping users from constructing their own vncsession-like script
              that calls Xvnc directly to bypass any options defined in /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory. The  overall  configuration  file  load  order  is:  /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults,
              $HOME/.vnc/config, and then this file. None are required to exist.

       $HOME/.vnc/config
              An  optional server config file wherein options to be passed to Xvnc are listed to avoid hard-coding them to the physical invocation. List options in this file one per line. For those requiring
              an argument, simply separate the option from the argument with an equal sign, for example: "geometry=2000x1200" or "securitytypes=vncauth,tlsvnc". Options without an argument are simply  listed
              as a single word, for example: "localhost" or "alwaysshared".

              The special option session can be used to control which session type will be started. This should match one of the files in /usr/share/xsessions. E.g. if there is a file called "gnome.desktop",
              then "session=gnome" would be set to use that session type.

       $HOME/.vnc/passwd
              The VNC password file.

       $HOME/.vnc/host:display#.log
              The log file for Xvnc and the session.
