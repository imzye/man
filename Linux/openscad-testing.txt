NAME
       openscad-testrun - set up and run the OpenSCAD test suite

SYNOPSIS
       openscad-testrun [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the openscad-testrun command.

       openscad-testrun  is  a  script that sets up a directory in which the OpenSCAD test suite (implemented in ctest) can be run by creating symlinks to the system locations of the input data, and runs
       it. The created directory is not removed, but will contain the test results in addition to the symlinks.

       It is required as the test suite in its original form expects all the test input and output data in relative locations, and the typical user has no write access to where the data  resides.  Future
       changes to the test suite might make it more flexible, removing the need for this script.

OPTIONS
       -d directory, --directory directory
              Set up the tests in a directory called directory. By default, this is generated from the current date and time like openscad-test-2012-02-15_13_37.

       -j N, --parallel N
              Run N test jobs in parallel. This can also be set in the CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL environment variable. The default is to run as many jobs as the number of available processing units available,
              as returned by nproc(1).

       -n, --dry-run
              Do not run the test suite, just set it up.

       --virtual
              Use xvfb-run to execute the tests inside a virtual X server.

       All additional arguments are passed on to ctest.
