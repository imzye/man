KISSNETD(8)              Linux System Managers Manual              KISSNETD(8)

NAME
       kissnetd - Create a virtual network.

SYNOPSIS
       kissnetd [-f size] [-v] [-p <num> | tty... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Kissnetd allows the creation of a virtual network of AX.25 systems that
       use the KISS protocol. Each tty named on the command line is opened and
       any  KISS  frames received on tty is copied to the other ttys. This al‐
       lows a number of AX.25 systems to share the same packets.

OPTIONS
       -p num    Automaticaly allocate num Unix98 slave pty's  via  /dev/ptmx.
                 These  are  written  to  stdout  and  could be parsed by your
                 startup scripts.  "kissnetd -p 3" is an comfortable  alterna‐
                 tive to "kissnetd /dev/ptmx /dev/ptmx /dev/ptmx".

       -f size   This  sets  the maximum KISS frame size that the program will
                 handle. The default is 512 bytes which will be adequate under
                 most circumstances.

       -v        Enables verbose mode, tracing of data passed is sent to stan‐
                 dard output.
