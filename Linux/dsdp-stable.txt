NAME
       dsdp-stable - Find the maximum stable set of a graph

SYNOPSIS
       dsdp-stable [OPTIONS] GRAPH_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The dsdp-stable program reads a graph from a file, formulates the Maxi‐
       mum Stable Set problem, and solves the problem using the DSDP library.

OPTIONS
       -dloginfo N
              Set the logging level (default 0).  More information is  printed
              for higher numbers.

       -params FILE
              Read DSDP parameters from FILE

       -help  Print a help message

FILE FORMAT
       The input file should be in the following format:
              n m
              r1 c1 [w1]
              …
              im jm [wm]
       where n is the number of nodes, and m is the number of edges.  Each r/c
       pair or r/c/w triple describes one edge, where r is the row, c  is  the
       column, and w is the weight.  The weight is ignored, if present.
