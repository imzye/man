NAME
       freeplane - Program for working with Mind Maps.

SYNOPSIS

       freeplane [-X menukey] [-S] [-N] [-h] [-U] [--help] [file1] [file2] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       freeplane is a free and open source software application that supports thinking, sharing information and getting things done at work, in school and at home. The core of the software is tools
       for mind mapping (also known as concept mapping or information mapping) and using mapped information.

       Occupying the middle ground between an editor and a diagramming tool, Freeplane allows the user to add content as quickly and naturally as they would in a text editor, yet producing
       structured content that can be manipulated as easily as a diagram.

       Features include ordering ideas in nodes and freely positionable nodes, connecting nodes, automatic/conditional styles, scripting, add-ons, LaTeX, search/filtering, different export features,
       printing, password protection of nodes/maps and more.

       See http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page for a full list of applications and features.

       This manual page was written for the Debian(TM) distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation in the Help menu and the Freeplane wiki
       (http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

       Many more improvements...
           Please see the changelog at /usr/share/doc/freeplane/changelog.gz.

KNOWN ISSUES
       •   There are rendering issues (probably due to OpenJDK), i.e. distortions when scrolling horizontally or vertically. Possible workarounds are described on a wiki page:
           http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Rendering_Issues

       •   Sometimes keypresses get lost when running ibus-daemon: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714524

       •   The Debian package does not include the signed applet code. That's why most applets won't run[1] after creating an applet export from the Debian package. You can ask for the signed applet
           in the open discussion forum: http://www.freeplane.org/discussion

       •   The Freeplane flash export has been excluded, because Debian devs (among them the flash compiler package maintainer) prefer free technologies. You can ask for the
           'freeplane-flash-browser' deb in the open discussion forum: http://www.freeplane.org/discussion

SEE ALSO
       Much documentation is available from the Freeplane wiki under http://www.freeplane.org/.

       There is an open discussion forum at http://www.freeplane.org/discussion, which is the place to ask questions.
