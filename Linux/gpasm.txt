NAME
       gpasm - GNU PIC assembler

SYNOPSIS
       gpasm [options] file

WARNING
       The  information  in this man page is an extract from the full documentation of gputils and is limited to the meaning of the options.  For complete and current documentation, refer to "gputils.ps" lo‐
       cated in the gputils docs directory.

DESCRIPTION
       gpasm is an assembler for Microchip (TM) PIC (TM) micro-controllers.  It's intended to be compatible with the manufacturer's MPASM assembler.  gpasm is part of gputils.  Check the  gputils(1)  manpage
       for details on other GNU PIC utilities.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of the gpasm options.  gpasm options always supersede any settings in the source code.

       -a FMT, --hex-format FMT
              GPASM supports inhx8m, inhx8s, inhx16, and inhx32 hex file formats.  This option controls which hex file format is used.  The default is inhx32.

       -c, --object
              Output a relocatable object (new COFF format).

       -C, --old-coff
              Output a relocatable object (old COFF format).

       -d, --debug
              Output debug messages.

       -D SYM=VAL, --define SYM=VAL
              Define SYM with value VAL. This is equivalent to placing "#define SYM VAL" in the source.

       -e [ON|OFF], --expand [ON|OFF]
              Macro  expansion  in the listing file is controlled using the EXPAND and NOEXPAND directives.  This option can force either directive to be ignored.  When "ON" is selected the macros are always
              expanded regardless of the presence of NOEXPAND.  Likewise, "OFF" will force macros not to be expanded.

       -f, --full-address
              Show full address in .lst file at the memory map region.

       -g, --debug-info
              Use debug directives for COFF.

       -h, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       -i, --ignore-case
              All user defined symbols and macros are case sensitive.  This option makes them case insensitive.

       -I DIR, --include DIR
              The top level assembly file is passed to gpasm as an argument.  This file can contain INCLUDE directives.  These directives open the specified file and then its contents are  assembled.   GPASM
              searches for these files in the local directory.  If the file is not located, the default header path is checked.  Finally, all paths specified using this argument are searched.

       -j, --sdcc-dev16-list
              Help to the extension of the pic16devices.txt file in the sdcc project.  Using by itself, displays the all '16e' devices. Along with the '-p' option, shows only the specified device.

       -k, --error
              Enables creation of the error file.

       -l[12[ce]|14[cef]|16[ce]], --list-chips[=([12[ce]|14[cef]|16[ce]])]
              List supported processors based on various aspects. (f => x)

       -L, --force-list
              Ignore NOLIST directives.  This forces gpasm to print every line assembled in the list file output.

       -m, --dump
              Upon completion of the final pass of assembly, display the contents of instruction memory.

       --mpasm-compatible
              This option sets the MPASM compatibility mode.

       -M, --deps
              Output a dependency file.

       -n, --dos
              By default, gpasm generates hex files using ISO format.  However, some device programmers required a DOS formatted file.  This option will cause gpasm to generate a DOS formatted hex file.

       -o FILE, --output FILE
              Alternate name of output files. Option effect of:
              -- If the "-c" option included in the command line:
                 FILE.o, FILE.lst, FILE.err
                 (The "FILE.o" should specified.)
              -- If the "-c" option not included in the command line:
                 FILE.hex, FILE.cod, FILE.lst, FILE.err
                 (The "FILE.hex" should specified.)

       -p PROC, --processor PROC
              Select the processor.

       -P FILE, --preprocess FILE
              Write preprocessed asm file to FILE.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress anything sent to standard output.

       -r RADIX, --radix RADIX
              The supported radices are BIN, DEC, OCT, and HEX. The default is HEX.

       -s[12[ce]|14[cef]|16[ce]],
              --list-processor-properties[=([12[ce]|14[cef]|16[ce]])]

              Lists properties of the processors. Using by itself, displays the all devices or group of the devices. Along with the '-p' option, shows only the specified device. (f => x)

       -S [0|1|2], --strict [0|1|2]
              Set the strict level of the recommended instruction-parameters (W or F and A or B). The "strict messages" have higher priority than the warnings. (See: -w [0|1|2]) [0]
                  0: Is the default. No strict messages.
                  1: Show warning messages if one of is missing.
                  2: Show error messages if one of is missing.

       -t, --sdcc-dev14-list
              Help to the extension of the pic14devices.txt file in the sdcc project.  Using by itself, displays the all '14' and '14e' devices. Along with the '-p' option, shows only the specified device.

       --strict-options
              If this is set, then an option may not be parameter of an another option.  For example: -I -c

       -u, --absolute
              Use absolute paths.

       -v, --version
              Show the version information and exit.

       -w [0|1|2], --warning [0|1|2]
              This option sets the message level.
                  0: Is the default. It will allow all messages, warnings and errors to be reported.
                  1: Will suppress the messages.
                  2: Will suppress the messages and warnings.

       -X, --macro-dereference
              Use the source from where the macro was invoked for errors.

       -y, --extended
              Enable 18xx extended mode.
