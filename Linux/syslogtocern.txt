NAME
       syslogtocern - convert thttpd syslog entries into CERN Common Log format

SYNOPSIS
       syslogtocern logfile ...

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  one  or  more  syslog  files as input.  Takes the thttpd entries, and converts them into CERN Combined Common Log format.  Produces two files as output: access_log and error_log.  If files with
       those names already exist in the current directory, they are overwritten.

SEE ALSO
       thttpd(8)

BUGS / DEFICIENCIES
       Lumps all thttpd processes together.  It ought to produce separate files for each, identified by IP address and port number.  However, that change represents a huge increase  in  complexity,  so  next
       version.
