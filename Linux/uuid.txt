DESCRIPTION
       By default, generates a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), of a version specified by -v (default 1) in the canonical STRing format.
       With -d, decodes uuid (or reads it in from the standard input stream if "-"), yielding something akin to
         encode: STR:     92a3d3de-6bbf-11ef-9f5b-774ebb537938
                 SIV:     194917928982963228599463962120788605240

                          node:  77:4e:bb:53:79:38 (local multicast)

                          (no semantics: random data only)

       A  UUID  is  a 128-bit (16-byte) number whose format (method of generation) makes it very likely that it will be unique, both spatially and temporally.  This makes them well-suited for identifying
       anything from ephemera like database queries to databases themselves.

       The three principal -Formats are:
         STRing                      01234567-890a-bcde-f012-3456789abcde (hexadecimal string broken up by dashes)
         SIV (Single Integer Value)  128-bit decimal integer
         BINary or "raw"             the 16 bytes of the UUID in big endian order (most significant first)

       UUIDs come in a few -versions:
         1  based on the current time (to the precision of 100ns), and the host's MAC address (this implementation uses the MAC address of the first NIC it finds, unless -m, in which case random data  is
            substituted for the MAC)
         6  very similar, but the most significant (slowest-changing) parts of the timestamp are stored first, which improves locality in some database applications

         7  contains the current UNIX time — versions 1 and 6 encode a UUID time which is off by like 400 years — (to the precision of 1ms), then 10 bytes of random data.
            This version should be preferred to 1 and 6.

         3  hashes  the  "namespace"  (first argument, either a STRing-format UUID or a well-known name (see below)) and the "name" (second argument, arbitrary data) with the MD5(3) digest, and uses that
            directly (a few branding bytes are replaced to identify the format)
         5  the same as version 3, but uses the first 16 bytes of the SHA1(3) digest

         4  just random data

       The namespaces understood when generating version 3 and 5 UUIDs are:
         uuid     (any valid STRingified UUID)
         nil      00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 — the special all-zero UUID
         max      ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff — the special all-bits-set/sorts-after-everything sentinel UUID
         ns:DNS   6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8 — for fully-qualified domain names
         ns:URL   6ba7b811-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8 — for URLs
         ns:OID   6ba7b812-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8 — for ISO OIDs
         ns:X500  6ba7b814-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8 — for X.500 Distinguished Names

OPTIONS
       -n count        Generate count UUIDs.  Defaults to 1.
       -o outfile      Write to outfile.
       -F BIN|STR|SIV  Produce output in the given format.  Defaults to STR.
       -r              -F BIN
       -v 1|3|4|5|6|7  Version to generate.  Defaults to 1.
       -m              -v 1|6 only: ignore the current host's MAC addresses, use random data instead (this may still happen if the if a MAC can't be determined or all MACs are multicast).
       -1              -v 1 only, count >1 only: generate each UUID independently.  Version 1 UUIDs have a field that increases monotonically within a session; thus, for example, in
                         $ uuid -n 4
                         366ab5a3-6bc4-11ef-a31a-0026b986fdd4
                         366ab5ce-6bc4-11ef-a31b-0026b986fdd4
                         366ab5f8-6bc4-11ef-a31c-0026b986fdd4
                         366ab621-6bc4-11ef-a31d-0026b986fdd4
                                            ^^^^
                       the highlighted column starts random, but then increments.  -1 generates each UUID de novo.

       -d              Decode and parse uuid.  -F sets which format to read.  -F BIN is only available when reading from the standard input stream ("-").

EXAMPLES
       A web site can be uniquely identified with a version 5 (SHA-1), namespace ns:DNS UUID, and a web-page — ns:URL (note that this information cannot be extracted, and only serves as a  way  to  avoid
       collisions for otherwise-identical names):
       $ uuid -v 5 ns:DNS hinfo.network.
       f50b485f-ac66-591d-b95f-2c946c5a5668
       $ uuid -v 5 ns:URL https://hinfo.network

STANDARDS
       RFC 9562: Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562 supersedes all previous standards with an unbecoming brevity.

       There are many Versions, but only one useful Variant.
