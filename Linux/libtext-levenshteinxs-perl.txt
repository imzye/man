NAME
       Text::LevenshteinXS - An XS implementation of the Levenshtein edit distance

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::LevenshteinXS qw(distance);

        print distance("foo","four");
        # prints "2"

        print distance("foo","bar");
        # prints "3"

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the Levenshtein edit distance in a XS way.

       The Levenshtein edit distance is a measure of the degree of proximity between two strings.  This distance is the number of substitutions, deletions or insertions ("edits") needed to transform one
       string into the other one (and vice versa).  When two strings have distance 0, they are the same.  A good point to start is: <http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm>

       All the credits go to Vladimir Levenshtein the author of the algorithm and to Lorenzo Seidenari who made the C implementation <http://www.merriampark.com/ldc.htm>
