NAME
       Devilspie2 - perform scripted actions on windows as they are created

Description
       Devilspie2 is a program that detects windows as they are created, and performs scripted actions on them. The scripts are written in Lua, allowing a great deal of customisation.

       More details in /usr/share/doc/devilspie2.

Options
       --version
              Displays the version of Devilspie2.

       --folder folder
              Sets the folder where the Lua scripts are loaded from.

       --debug
              Shows debug information from the Lua scripts. If debug_print is used in the Lua scripts, that output will only be printed to stdout if this option is used.

       --emulate
