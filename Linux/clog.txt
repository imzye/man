NAME
       clog - colorized log filter

SYNOPSIS
       clog [<options>] [<section> ...]

         -h|--help       Show this usage
         -v|--version    Show this version
         -d|--date       Prepend all lines with the current date
         -t|--time       Prepend all lines with the current time
         -f|--file       Override default ~/.clogrc

DESCRIPTION
       Clog is a filter command, and therefore copies its input to its output.  But if lines in the input match certain patterns, actions are taken, which are defined as 'rules'.

       The rules are defined in ~/.clogrc as text patterns or regular expressions, and the actions are specified, to colorize either the line or matching pattern, or perhaps to suppress the line.

       If --date is specified the current date, YYYY-MM-DD, is prepended to all lines.

       If --time is specified the current time, HH:MM:SS, is prepended to all lines.

       If --file is specified, an alternate configuration rc file may be specified.  Default is to ~/.clogrc

       One or more section arguments may be specified.  If none are provided, 'default' is assumed.  A section corresponds to a named rule set defined in ~/.clogrc. and allows the use of one .clogrc file
       to serve multiple different uses of clog.  If more than one section is specified, the rules sets are combined, in the sequence found.

CONFIGURATION FILE AND OVERRIDE OPTIONS
       Clog reads its configuration from a file in the user's home directory: ~/.clogrc.

       The format of the rules is:

              <section> rule /<pattern>/ --> <color> <action>
              <section> rule "<pattern>" --> <color> <action>

       If the pattern is surrounded by / characters, it is interpreted as a regular expression.  If the pattern is surrounded by " characters, it is interpreted as a string fragment.

       The section is simply a way to allow multiple rules sets, so that one .clogrc file can serve multiple uses.  The pattern may be any supported Standard C Library regular expression.  Action must be
       one of 'line', 'match', 'suppress' or 'blank'.

       Note that there is a default section, called 'default'.  Putting rules in the default section means that no section need be specified on the command line.

       Any color can be used, in both the 16- and 256-color space.  Some examples are:

              bold
              underline
              bold blue
              underline on green
              black on white
              bold red on bright white
              rgb200 on grey4

       Instead of coloring the whole line, specifying 'match' instead will only color the parts of the line that match.

EXAMPLE Rulesets
       Here is an example ~/.clogrc file.

              # Standard syslog entries.
              default rule /warn|debug/   --> yellow line
              default rule /error|severe/ --> red line
              default rule /critical/     --> bold red line
              default rule /critical/     --> blank
              default rule /ignore/       --> suppress

              # Apache access.log status codes
              apache rule / 2[0-9][0-9] / --> green match
              apache rule / 3[0-9][0-9] / --> yellow match
              apache rule / 4[0-9][0-9] / --> red match
              apache rule / 5[0-9][0-9] / --> bold red match
