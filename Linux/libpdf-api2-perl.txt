NAME
       PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::Objind - Low-level PDF indirect object

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       Instance variables differ from content variables in that they all start with a space.

       parent
           For  an  object which is a reference to an object in some source, this holds the reference to the source object, so that should the reference have to be de-referenced, then we know where to go
           and get the info.

       objnum (R)
           The object number in the source (only for object references)

       objgen (R)
           The object generation in the source

           There are other instance variables which are used by the parent for file control.

       isfree
           This marks whether the object is in the free list and available for re-use as another object elsewhere in the file.

       nextfree
           Holds a direct reference to the next free object in the free list.

METHODS
   PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::Objind->new()
       Creates a new indirect object

   uid
       Returns a Unique id for this object, creating one if it didn't have one before

   $r->release
       Releases ALL of the memory used by this indirect object, and all of its component/child objects.  This method is called automatically by '"PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::File->release"' (so you don't have
       to call it yourself).

       Note: it is important that this method get called at some point prior to the actual destruction of the object.  Internally, PDF files have an enormous amount of cross-references  and  this  causes
       circular references within our own internal data structures.  Calling 'release()' forces these circular references to be cleaned up and the entire internal data structure purged.

   $r->val
       Returns the value of this object or reads the object and then returns its value.

       Note that all direct subclasses *must* make their own versions of this subroutine otherwise we could be in for a very deep loop!

   $r->realise
       Makes sure that the object is fully read in, etc.

   $r->outobjdeep($fh, $pdf)
       If you really want to output this object, then you must need to read it first.  This also means that all direct subclasses must subclass this method or loop forever!

   $r->outobj($fh)
       If this is a full object then outputs a reference to the object, otherwise calls outobjdeep to output the contents of the object at this point.

   $r->elements
       Abstract superclass function filler. Returns self here but should return something more useful if an array.

   $r->empty
       Empties all content from this object to free up memory or to be read to pass the object into the free list. Simplistically undefs all instance variables other than object number and generation.

   $r->merge($objind)
       This  merges  content information into an object reference place-holder.  This occurs when an object reference is read before the object definition and the information in the read data needs to be
       merged into the object place-holder

   $r->is_obj($pdf)
       Returns whether this object is a full object with its own object number or whether it is purely a sub-object. $pdf indicates which output file we are concerned that the object is an object in.

   $r->copy($pdf, $res)
       Returns a new copy of this object. The object is assumed to be some kind of associative array and the copy is a deep copy for elements which are not PDF objects, according  to  $pdf,  and  shallow
       copy for those that are.  Notice that calling "copy" on an object forces at least a one level copy even if it is a PDF object. The returned object loses its PDF object status though.

       If  $res is defined then the copy goes into that object rather than creating a new one. It is up to the caller to bless $res, etc. Notice that elements from $self are not copied into $res if there
       is already an entry for them existing in $res.
