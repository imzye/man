NAME
       dascrubber - alignment-based scrubbing pipeline for DNA sequencing reads

DESCRIPTION
       The  Dazzler Scrubbing Suite produces a set of edited reads that are guaranteed to (a) be continuous stretches of the underlying genome (i.e. no unremoved adapters and not chimers) and (b) have no
       very low quality stretches (i.e. the error rate never exceeds some reasonable maximum, 20% or so in the case of Pacbio data). Its secondary goal is to do so with the minimum removal  of  data  and
       splitting of reads.

OPTIONS
       For a complete description of available commands and their options, see the README file in /usr/share/doc/dascrubber/
