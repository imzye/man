NAME
       tping - Send echo messages to LAM nodes.

SYNOPSIS
       tping [-hv] [-c count] [-d delay] [-l length] nodes

OPTIONS
       -h            Print the command help menu.

       -v            Turn OFF verbose mode.

       -c count      Send count messages.

       -d delay      Delay delay seconds between each message.

       -l length     Each message is length bytes long.

DESCRIPTION
       The  tping  command sends messages to, and collects replies from, a list of nodes, via the LAM echo server.  It is similar to the UNIX ping(8) command, and is used as a quick diagnosis of the LAM net‐
       work.

       Unless options are specified, tping sends a 1 byte message an infinite number of times, displaying the roundtrip time of each message as it completes, with a delay of 1 second between roundtrips.  Af‐
       ter the loop is broken (with keyboard interrupt, eg: ^C), tping prints statistics about all roundtrip messages.

EXAMPLES
       tping h
           Echo messages to the local node.

       tping -v n7 -l 1000 -c 10
           Echo 1000 byte messages to node 7.  Stay silent while working.  Stop after 10 roundtrips and report statistics.

BUGS
       There is no built-in timeout and tping will wait forever to receive an echo.  If no echo is received, due to a dead link or node, tping hangs.  Stop the process with a keyboard suspend signal (eg: ^Z)
       and terminate LAM with lamhalt(1) or lamwipe(1) (although the use of lamwipe(1) is deprecated).
