DESCRIPTION
       mkfs.f2fs  is used to create a f2fs file system (usually in a disk partition).  device is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g.  /dev/sdXX).  sectors is optionally given for specifing the
       filesystem size.

       The exit code returned by mkfs.f2fs is 0 on success and 1 on failure.

OPTIONS
       -a heap-based-allocation
              Specify 1 or 0 to enable/disable heap based block allocation policy.  If the value is equal to 1, each of active log areas are initially assigned separately according to the whole volume  size.
              The default value is 1.

       -c device-list
              Build f2fs with these additional comma separated devices, so that the user can see all the devices as one big volume.  Supports up to 7 devices except meta device.

       -d debug-level
              Specify the level of debugging options.  The default number is 0, which shows basic debugging messages.

       -e extension-list
              Specify  a list of file extensions that f2fs will treat as cold files.  The data of files with those extensions will be stored in the cold log.  The default list includes most of the multimedia
              file extensions such as jpg, gif, mpeg, mkv, and so on.

       -E extension-list
              Specify a list of file extensions that f2fs will treat as hot files.  The data of files with those extensions will be stored in the hot log.  The default list includes database file extensions,
              such as db.

       -f     Force  overwrite  when  an existing filesystem is detected on the device.  By default, mkfs.f2fs will not write to the device if it suspects that there is a filesystem or partition table on the
              device already.

       -g     Add default Android options.

       -i     Enable extended node bitmap.  -l volume-label Specify the volume label to the partition mounted as F2FS.

       -m     Specify f2fs filesystem to supports the block zoned feature.  Without it, the filesystem doesn't support the feature.

       -o overprovision-ratio-percentage
              Specify the percentage of the volume that will be used as overprovision area.  This area is hidden to users, and utilized by F2FS cleaner. If not specified, the best number will be assigned au‐
              tomatically according to the partition size.

       -O feature-list
              Set additional features for the filesystem. Features are comma separated, and the flag can be repeated. The following features are supported:

                   encrypt     Enable support for filesystem level encryption.

                   extra_attr  Enable extra attr feature, required for some of the other features.

                   project_quota
                               Enable project ID tracking. This is used for projet quota accounting. Requires extra attr.

                   inode_checksum
                               Enable inode checksum. Requires extra attr.

                   flexible_inline_xattr
                               Enable flexible inline xattr. Requires extra attr.

                   quota       Enable quotas.

                   inode_crtime
                               Enable inode creation time feature. Requires extra attr.

                   lost_found  Enable lost+found feature.

                   verity      Reserved feature.

                   sb_checksum Enable superblock checksum.

                   casefold    Enable casefolding support in the filesystem. Optional flags can be passed with -C

                   compression Enable support for filesystem level compression. Requires extra attr.

       -C encoding:flags
              Support casefolding with a specific encoding, with optional comma separated flags.

                   encoding:

                               utf8        Use UTF-8 for casefolding.
                   flags:

                               strict      This flag specifies that invalid strings should be rejected by the filesystem.  Default is disabled.

       -q     Quiet mode.  With it, mkfs.f2fs does not show any messages, including the basic messages.

       -r     Sets the checkpointing srand seed to 0.

       -R     Give root_owner option for initial uid/gid assignment.  Default is set by getuid()/getgid(), and assigned by "-R $uid:$gid".

       -s #-of-segments-per-section
              Specify  the number of segments per section. A section consists of multiple consecutive segments, and is the unit of garbage collection.  The default number is 1, which means one segment is as‐
              signed to a section.

       -S     Enable sparse mode.

       -t 1/0 Specify 1 or 0 to enable or disable discard policy, respectively.  The default value is 1.

       -T timestamp
              Set inodes times to a given timestamp. By default, the current time will be used.  This behaviour corresponds to the value -1.

       -w wanted-sector-size
              Specify the sector size in bytes.  Without it, the sectors will be calculated by device sector size.

       -z #-of-sections-per-zone
              Specify the number of sections per zone. A zone consists of multiple sections.  F2FS allocates segments for active logs with separated zones as much as possible.  The default number is 1, which
              means a zone consists of one section.

       sectors
              Number of sectors. Default is determined by device size.

       -V     Print the version number and exit.
