NAME
       et - Main API of the Event Trace (ET) application

DESCRIPTION
       Interface module for the Event Trace (ET) application

EXPORTS
       trace_me(DetailLevel, From, To, Label, Contents) -> hopefully_traced

              Types:

                 DetailLevel = integer(X) when X =< 0, X >= 100
                 From = actor()
                 To = actor()
                 Label = atom() | string() | term()
                 Contents = [{Key, Value}] | term()
                 actor() = term()

              A function that is intended to be traced.

              This  function  is intended to be invoked at strategic places in
              user applications in order to  enable  simplified  tracing.  The
              functions  are extremely light weight as they do nothing besides
              returning an atom. The functions are designed for being  traced.
              The global tracing mechanism in et_collector defaults to set its
              trace pattern to these functions.

              The label is intended to provide a brief summary of  the  event.
              It is preferred to use an atom but a string would also do.

              The  contents can be any term but in order to simplify post pro‐
              cessing of the traced events, a plain list of {Key,  Value}  tu‐
              ples is preferred.

              Some  events,  such as messages, are directed from some actor to
              another. Other events (termed actions)  may  be  undirected  and
              only have one actor.

       trace_me(DetailLevel, FromTo, Label, Contents) -> hopefully_traced

              Invokes et:trace_me/5 with both From and To set to FromTo.

       phone_home(DetailLevel, FromTo, Label, Contents) -> hopefully_traced
       phone_home(DetailLevel, From, To, Label, Contents) -> hopefully_traced

              These functions sends a signal to the outer space and the caller
              hopes that someone is listening. In  other  words,  they  invoke
              et:trace_me/4 and et:trace_me/5 respectively.

       report_event(DetailLevel, FromTo, Label, Contents) -> hopefully_traced
       report_event(DetailLevel,   From,   To,   Label,   Contents)  ->  hope‐
       fully_traced

              Deprecated functions which for the time being are kept for back‐
              wards compatibility. Invokes et:trace_me/4 and et:trace_me/5 re‐
              spectively.
