SMP_REP_MANUFACTURER(8)                                                                            SMP_UTILS                                                                            SMP_REP_MANUFACTURER(8)

NAME
       smp_rep_manufacturer - invoke REPORT MANUFACTURER INFORMATION SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_rep_manufacturer [--help] [--hex] [--interface=PARAMS] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] [--zero] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT MANUFACTURER INFORMATION function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on the inter‐
       face, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between  HBAs  if  there  are
       multiple present.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies  the  SAS  address  of the SMP target device. Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the target's SAS address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in
              decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

       -z, --zero
              zero the Allocated Response Length field in the request. This is required for strict SAS-1.1 compliance. However this option should not be given in SAS-2 and later; if it is given  an  abridged
              response may result.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP REPORT MANUFACTURER function was introduced in SAS-1, with small additions in SAS-1.1 . This function remains unaltered in SAS-2 and SPL-1.
