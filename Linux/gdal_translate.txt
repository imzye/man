DESCRIPTION
       The  gdal_translate  utility can be used to convert raster data between
       different formats, potentially performing some operations like  subset‐
       tings, resampling, and rescaling pixels in the process.

       -ot <type>
              Force  the  output image bands to have a specific data type sup‐
              ported by the driver, which may be one of the  following:  Byte,
              UInt16,  Int16, UInt32, Int32, Float32, Float64, CInt16, CInt32,
              CFloat32 or CFloat64.

       -strict
              Don't be forgiving of mismatches and lost data when  translating
              to the output format.

       -if <format>
              Format/driver name to be attempted to open the input file(s). It
              is generally not necessary to specify it, but it can be used  to
              skip automatic driver detection, when it fails to select the ap‐
              propriate driver.  This option can be repeated several times  to
              specify several candidate drivers.

              New in version 3.2.

       -of <format>
              Select  the output format. Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not speci‐
              fied, the format is guessed from the extension  (previously  was
              GTiff). Use the short format name.

       -b <band>
              Select an input band band for output. Bands are numbered from 1.
              Multiple -b switches may be used to select a set of input  bands
              to  write to the output file, or to reorder bands. band can also
              be set to "mask,1" (or just "mask") to mean the mask band of the
              first band of the input dataset.

       -mask <band>
              Select  an  input  band band to create output dataset mask band.
              Bands are numbered from 1. band can be set to  "none"  to  avoid
              copying  the global mask of the input dataset if it exists. Oth‐
              erwise it is copied by default ("auto"), unless the mask  is  an
              alpha  channel, or if it is explicitly used to be a regular band
              of the output dataset ("-b mask").  band  can  also  be  set  to
              "mask,1"  (or just "mask") to mean the mask band of the 1st band
              of the input dataset.

       -expand gray|rgb|rgba
              To expose a dataset with 1 band with a color table as a  dataset
              with  3  (RGB) or 4 (RGBA) bands. Useful for output drivers such
              as JPEG, JPEG2000, MrSID, ECW that don't support  color  indexed
              datasets.  The  'gray'  value enables to expand a dataset with a
              color table that only contains gray levels  to  a  gray  indexed
              dataset.

       -outsize <xsize>[%]|0 <ysize>[%]|0
              Set the size of the output file.  Outsize is in pixels and lines
              unless '%' is attached in which case it is as a fraction of  the
              input image size.  If one of the 2 values is set to 0, its value
              will be determined from the other one, while maintaining the as‐
              pect ratio of the source dataset.

       -tr <xres> <yres>
              set target resolution. The values must be expressed in georefer‐
              enced units.  Both must be positive values. This is mutually ex‐
              clusive with -outsize and -a_ullr.

       -r      {nearest     (default),bilinear,cubic,cubicspline,lanczos,aver‐
       age,rms,mode}
              Select a resampling algorithm.

              nearest applies a nearest neighbour (simple sampling) resampler

              average computes the average of all non-NODATA contributing pix‐
              els.  Starting  with GDAL 3.1, this is a weighted average taking
              into account properly the weight of source pixels not contribut‐
              ing fully to the target pixel.

              rms  computes  the  root  mean  squared  / quadratic mean of all
              non-NODATA contributing pixels (GDAL >= 3.3)

              bilinear applies a bilinear convolution kernel.

              cubic applies a cubic convolution kernel.

              cubicspline applies a B-Spline convolution kernel.

              lanczos applies a Lanczos windowed sinc convolution kernel.

              mode selects the value which appears most often of all the  sam‐
              pled points.

       -scale [src_min src_max [dst_min dst_max]]
              Rescale  the  input  pixels  values  from  the  range src_min to
              src_max to the range dst_min to dst_max. If omitted  the  output
              range  is 0 to 255.  If omitted the input range is automatically
              computed from the source data. Note that these values  are  only
              used  to compute a scale and offset to apply to the input raster
              values. In particular, src_min and src_max are not used to  clip
              input  values.   -scale can be repeated several times (if speci‐
              fied only once, it also applies  to  all  bands  of  the  output
              dataset),  so as to specify per band parameters. It is also pos‐
              sible to use the "-scale_bn" syntax where bn is  a  band  number
              (e.g.  "-scale_2"  for  the  2nd  band of the output dataset) to
              specify the parameters of one or several specific bands.

       -exponent <exp_val>
              To apply non-linear scaling with a power  function.  exp_val  is
              the  exponent of the power function (must be positive). This op‐
              tion must be used with the  -scale  option.  If  specified  only
              once, -exponent applies to all bands of the output image. It can
              be repeated several times so as to specify per band  parameters.
              It is also possible to use the "-exponent_bn" syntax where bn is
              a band number (e.g. "-exponent_2" for the 2nd band of the output
              dataset)  to  specify  the parameters of one or several specific
              bands.

       -unscale
              Apply the scale/offset metadata for the bands to convert  scaled
              values  to unscaled values.  It is also often necessary to reset
              the output datatype with the -ot switch.

       -srcwin <xoff> <yoff> <xsize> <ysize>
              Selects a subwindow from the source image for copying  based  on
              pixel/line location.

       -projwin <ulx> <uly> <lrx> <lry>
              Selects  a  subwindow  from  the  source image for copying (like
              -srcwin) but with the corners given in georeferenced coordinates
              (by  default expressed in the SRS of the dataset. Can be changed
              with -projwin_srs).

              NOTE:
                 In GDAL 2.1.0 and 2.1.1, using -projwin with coordinates  not
                 aligned  with  pixels  will result in a sub-pixel shift. This
                 has  been  corrected  in  later  versions.   When   selecting
                 non-nearest  neighbour  resampling, starting with GDAL 2.1.0,
                 sub-pixel accuracy is however used to get better results.

       -projwin_srs <srs_def>
              Specifies the SRS in which to interpret  the  coordinates  given
              with  -projwin.  The  <srs_def> may be any of the usual GDAL/OGR
              forms, complete WKT, PROJ.4, EPSG:n or  a  file  containing  the
              WKT.

              WARNING:
                 This does not cause reprojection of the dataset to the speci‐
                 fied SRS.

       -epo   (Error when Partially Outside) If this option is set, -srcwin or
              -projwin  values  that falls partially outside the source raster
              extent will be considered as an error. The default  behavior  is
              to  accept  such requests, when they were considered as an error
              before.

       -eco   (Error when Completely Outside) Same as -epo,  except  that  the
              criterion  for erroring out is when the request falls completely
              outside the source raster extent.

       -a_srs <srs_def>
              Override the projection for the output file.

              The coordinate reference systems that can be passed are anything
              supported  by  the  OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput() call,
              which includes EPSG Projected, Geographic or Compound CRS  (i.e.
              EPSG:4296),  a well known text (WKT) CRS definition, PROJ.4 dec‐
              larations, or the name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS defi‐
              nition.

              NOTE:
                 No reprojection is done.

       -a_scale <value>
              Set band scaling value (no modification of pixel values is done)

              New in version 2.3.

       -a_offset<value>
              Set band offset value (no modification of pixel values is done)

              New in version 2.3.

       -a_ullr <ulx> <uly> <lrx> <lry>
              Assign/override  the  georeferenced  bounds  of the output file.
              This assigns georeferenced bounds to the output  file,  ignoring
              what  would have been derived from the source file. So this does
              not cause reprojection to the specified SRS.

       -a_nodata <value>
              Assign a specified nodata value to output bands. It can  be  set
              to  <i>none</i>  to  avoid  setting a nodata value to the output
              file if one exists for the source file. Note that, if the  input
              dataset  has  a  nodata  value, this does not cause pixel values
              that are equal to that nodata value to be changed to  the  value
              specified with this option.

       -colorinterp_X <red|green|blue|alpha|gray|undefined>
              Override  the color interpretation of band X (where X is a valid
              band number, starting at 1)

              New in version 2.3.

       -colorinterp   <red|green|blue|alpha|gray|undefined[,red|green|blue|al‐
       pha|gray|undefined]*>
              Override  the  color  interpretation of all specified bands. For
              example -colorinterp red,green,blue,alpha for a  4  band  output
              dataset.

              New in version 2.3.

       -mo META-TAG=VALUE
              Passes  a metadata key and value to set on the output dataset if
              possible.

       -co <NAME=VALUE>
              Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can
              be  used  to control particulars about the file created. For in‐
              stance, the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to  control
              compression, and whether the file should be tiled.

              The  creation  options available vary by format driver, and some
              simple formats have no creation options at all. A  list  of  op‐
              tions  supported  for  a format can be listed with the --formats
              command line option but the documentation for the format is  the
              definitive  source  of  information  on driver creation options.
              See raster_drivers format specific documentation for legal  cre‐
              ation options for each format.

       -nogcp Do  not  copy  the  GCPs  in  the  source  dataset to the output
              dataset.

       -gcp <pixel> <line> <easting> <northing> <elevation>
              Add the indicated ground control point to  the  output  dataset.
              This  option  may be provided multiple times to provide a set of
              GCPs.

       -q     Suppress progress monitor and other non-error output.

       -sds   Copy all subdatasets of this file to  individual  output  files.
              Use with formats like HDF that have subdatasets.

       -stats Force (re)computation of statistics.

       -norat Do not copy source RAT into destination dataset.

       -noxmp Do not copy the XMP metadata in the source dataset to the output
              dataset when driver is able to copy it.

              New in version 3.2.

       -oo NAME=VALUE
              Dataset open option (format specific)

       <src_dataset>
              The source dataset name. It can be either file name, URL of data
              source or subdataset name for multi-dataset files.

       <dst_dataset>
              The destination file name.

C API
       This utility is also callable from C with GDALTranslate().

       New in version 2.1.
