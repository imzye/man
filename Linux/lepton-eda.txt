NAME
       lepton-schdiff - Graphical diff tool for schematics

SYNOPSIS
       lepton-schdiff [-d VIEWER] infile1.sch infile2.sch

DESCRIPTION
       The  lepton-schdiff  program  will use ImageMagick(1) to display a graphical diff of two schematic files.  It's most useful when combined with a revision control system so it can compare two revi‐
       sions of the same file, review changes, etc.  However, it is limited in that it can only compare two files at a time; it cannot diff entire directories nor can it diff an entire  revision  (unless
       that revision affected only one file).

       VIEWER command, if specified, will be used to display the result.  By default, it's display program from the ImageMagick package.

       lepton-schdiff can easily be configured to work with most revision control systems.  Here are instructions for three:

       git: Use the difftool command exactly as you would use diff , but supply the -x lepton-schdiff option.

       mercurial: Use the lepton-schdiff command exactly as you would use diff , but add the following lines to your .hgrc:

                [extensions]
                hgext.extdiff =
                [extdiff]
                cmd.schdiff = lepton-schdiff

       subversion: Use the diff command like normal, but supply the --diff-cmd lepton-schdiff option.

       Note:  To  make lepton-schdiff work properly, all page contents should be enclosed in some form of bounding box (e.g.  a title block), otherwise the symbols in exported images could have different
       relative positions and/or sizes, resulting in a difference image that is rather hard to comprehend.

EXAMPLES
       Use git to view the changes to a file between two revisions
              git difftool -x lepton-schdiff 182110f 039e012 cpu.sch

       Use mercurial to see all the changes since a specific revision
              hg schdiff -r 8442880f9835 cpld.sch

       Use subversion to review a specific revision
              svn diff --diff-cmd lepton-schdiff -c 49 power.sch
