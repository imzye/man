NAME
       targetclid - daemon component for targetcli

DESCRIPTION
       targetclid  is  the  daemon  component  of targetcli, which will help retain state of various configfs object in memory, hence any new request/command can directly use the in memory objects instead of
       reconstructing them by parsing through the entire configfs files again and again for each and every single command. This will greatly improve the overall execution time taken by targetcli commands  at
       scale.

USAGE
       targetclid [cmd]
       --help for additional usage information.
       --version for version information.

QUICKSTART & EXAMPLES
       To start using the daemon, one need to enable targetclid socket,
              $ systemctl enable targetclid.socket

       If you would like to use the daemonized approach as default method then,
              $ targetcli set global auto_use_daemon=true
              $ targetcli ls

       You can use interactive mode,
              $ targetcli <hit-enter>
              targetcli shell version 2.1.51
              Entering targetcli interactive mode for daemonized approach.
              Type 'exit' to quit.
              /> pwd
              /
              /> cd /iscsi
              /> pwd
              /iscsi
              /> exit

       You can also use batch mode for sending multiple commands in one go,
              $ targetcli set global daemon_use_batch_mode=true
              Parameter daemon_use_batch_mode is now 'true'.
              $ targetcli <hit-enter>
              targetcli shell version 2.1.51
              Entering targetcli batch mode for daemonized approach.
              Enter multiple commands separated by newline and type 'exit' to run them all in one go.
              /> ls
              /> pwd
              /> get global loglevel_file
              /> exit

       You can set preference to stop using daemonized mode even when the daemon is not running,
              $ targetcli --disable-daemon
