               tracefile(s)

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an  HTML  view  of coverage data found in tracefile.  Note that
       tracefile may also be a list of filenames.

       HTML output files are created in the current working  directory  unless
       the --output-directory option is used. If tracefile ends with ".gz", it
       is assumed to be GZIP-compressed and the gunzip tool will  be  used  to
       decompress it transparently.

       Note  that all source code files have to be present and readable at the
       exact file system location they were compiled.

       Use option --css-file to modify layout and colors of the generated HTML
       output.  Files  are marked in different colors depending on the associ‐
       ated coverage rate. By default, the coverage limits for low, medium and
       high  coverage  are  set  to  0-75%, 75-90% and 90-100% percent respec‐
       tively. To change these values, use  configuration  file  options  gen‐
       html_hi_limit and genhtml_med_limit.

       Also  note  that  when  displaying  percentages,  0%  and 100% are only
       printed when the values are exactly 0%  and  100%  respectively.  Other
       values  which would conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead
       printed as nearest non-boundary value. This behavior is  in  accordance
       with that of the gcov(1) tool.

OPTIONS
       -h
       --help
              Print a short help text, then exit.

       -v
       --version
              Print version number, then exit.

       -q
       --quiet
              Do not print progress messages.

              Suppresses  all  informational progress output. When this switch
              is enabled, only error or warning messages are printed.

       -f
       --frames
              Use HTML frames for source code view.

              If enabled, a frameset is created for  each  source  code  file,
              providing an overview of the source code as a "clickable" image.
              Note that this option will slow down output creation  noticeably
              because  each  source  code  character has to be inspected once.
              Note also that the GD.pm Perl module has  to  be  installed  for
              this    option    to    work    (it   may   be   obtained   from
              http://www.cpan.org).

       -s
       --show-details
              Generate detailed directory view.

              When this option is enabled, genhtml generates two  versions  of
              each  file  view. One containing the standard information plus a
              link to a "detailed" version. The latter  additionally  contains
              information about which test case covered how many lines of each
              source file.

       -b baseline-file
       --baseline-file baseline-file
              Use data in baseline-file as coverage baseline.

              The tracefile specified by baseline-file is read and all  counts
              found  in  the  original tracefile are decremented by the corre‐
              sponding counts in baseline-file before creating any output.

              Note that when a count for a particular line in baseline-file is
              greater than the count in the tracefile, the result is zero.

       -o output-directory
       --output-directory output-directory
              Create files in output-directory.

              Use  this option to tell genhtml to write the resulting files to
              a directory other than the current one. If output-directory does
              not exist, it will be created.

              It  is  advisable  to  use  this  option  since depending on the
              project size, a lot of files and subdirectories may be created.

       -t title
       --title title
              Display title in header of all pages.

              title is written to the header portion of  each  generated  HTML
              page  to  identify  the context in which a particular output was
              created. By default this is the name of the tracefile.

       -d description-file
       --description-file description-file
              Read test case descriptions from description-file.

              All test case descriptions found in description-file and  refer‐
              enced  in  the  input data file are read and written to an extra
              page which is then incorporated into the HTML output.

              The file format of description-file is:

              for each test case:
                     TN:<testname>
                     TD:<test description>

              Valid test case names can consist of letters,  numbers  and  the
              underscore character ('_').
       -k
       --keep-descriptions
              Do not remove unused test descriptions.

              Keep descriptions found in the description file even if the cov‐
              erage data indicates that the associated test case did not cover
              any lines of code.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_keep_descriptions.

       -c css-file
       --css-file css-file
              Use external style sheet file css-file.

              Using this option, an extra .css file  may  be  specified  which
              will replace the default one. This may be helpful if the default
              colors make your eyes want to jump out of their sockets :)

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_css_file.

       -p prefix
       --prefix prefix
              Remove prefix from all directory names.

              Because  lists  containing long filenames are difficult to read,
              there is a mechanism implemented that will automatically try  to
              shorten  all directory names on the overview page beginning with
              a common prefix. By default, this is  done  using  an  algorithm
              that tries to find the prefix which, when applied, will minimize
              the resulting sum of characters of all directory names.

              Use this option to specify the prefix to be removed by yourself.

       --no-prefix
              Do not remove prefix from directory names.

              This  switch  will  completely  disable  the  prefix   mechanism
              described in the previous section.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_no_prefix.

       --no-source
              Do not create source code view.

              Use this switch if you don't want to get a source code view  for
              each file.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_no_source.

       --num-spaces spaces
              Replace tabs in source view with num spaces.

              Default value is 8.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_num_spaces.

       --highlight
              Highlight lines with converted-only coverage data.

              Use this option in conjunction with the --diff option of lcov to
              highlight those lines which were only covered in data sets which
              were converted from previous source code versions.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_highlight.

       --legend
              Include color legend in HTML output.

              Use this option to include a legend explaining  the  meaning  of
              color coding in the resulting HTML output.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_legend.

       --html-prolog prolog-file
              Read customized HTML prolog from prolog-file.

              Use this option to replace the default HTML prolog (the  initial
              part  of  the  HTML  source code leading up to and including the
              <body> tag) with the contents of prolog-file.  Within the prolog
              text, the following words will be replaced when a page is gener‐
              ated:

              @pagetitle@
              The title of the page.

              @basedir@
              A relative path leading to the base directory (e.g. for locating
              css-files).

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_html_prolog.

       --html-epilog epilog-file
              Read customized HTML epilog from epilog-file.

              Use this option to replace the default HTML  epilog  (the  final
              part  of the HTML source including </body>) with the contents of
              epilog-file.

              Within the epilog text, the following  words  will  be  replaced
              when a page is generated:

              @basedir@
              A relative path leading to the base directory (e.g. for locating
              css-files).

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_html_epilog.

       --html-extension extension
              Use customized filename extension for generated HTML pages.

              This  option  is  useful  in situations where different filename
              extensions are required to render the resulting pages  correctly
              (e.g.  php).  Note that a '.' will be inserted between the file‐
              name and the extension specified by this option.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_html_extension.

       --html-gzip
              Compress  all generated html files with gzip and add a .htaccess
              file specifying gzip-encoding in the root output directory.

              Use this option if you want to save  space  on  your  webserver.
              Requires  a  webserver with .htaccess support and a browser with
              support for gzip compressed html.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_html_gzip.

       --sort
       --no-sort
              Specify  whether  to  include sorted views of file and directory
              overviews.

              Use --sort to include sorted views or --no-sort to  not  include
              them.  Sorted views are enabled by default.

              When  sorted  views are enabled, each overview page will contain
              links to views of that page sorted by coverage rate.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_sort.

       --function-coverage
       --no-function-coverage
              Specify  whether  to display function coverage summaries in HTML
              output.

              Use --function-coverage to enable function coverage summaries or
              --no-function-coverage  to  disable  it.  Function coverage sum‐
              maries are enabled by default

              When function coverage summaries are enabled, each overview page
              will  contain  the number of functions found and hit per file or
              directory, together with the resulting coverage rate.  In  addi‐
              tion,  each source code view will contain a link to a page which
              lists all functions found in that file plus the respective  call
              count for those functions.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_function_coverage.

       --branch-coverage
       --no-branch-coverage
              Specify whether to display branch coverage data in HTML output.

              Use --branch-coverage  to  enable  branch  coverage  display  or
              --no-branch-coverage to disable it. Branch coverage data display
              is enabled by default

              When branch coverage display is enabled, each overview page will
              contain  the number of branches found and hit per file or direc‐
              tory, together with the resulting coverage  rate.  In  addition,
              each  source  code view will contain an extra column which lists
              all branches of a line with indications of  whether  the  branch
              was taken or not. Branches are shown in the following format:

               ' + ': Branch was taken at least once
               ' - ': Branch was not taken
               ' # ': The basic block containing the branch was never executed

              Note  that it might not always be possible to relate branches to
              the corresponding source code  statements:  during  compilation,
              GCC  might  shuffle branches around or eliminate some of them to
              generate better code.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_branch_coverage.

       --demangle-cpp
              Specify whether to demangle C++ function names.

              Use  this  option  if  you want to convert C++ internal function
              names to human readable format for display on the HTML  function
              overview  page.   This  option requires that the c++filt tool is
              installed (see c++filt(1)).

       --ignore-errors errors
              Specify a list of errors after which to continue processing.

              Use this option to specify a list of  one  or  more  classes  of
              errors after which geninfo should continue processing instead of
              aborting.

              errors can be a comma-separated list of the following keywords:

              source: the source code file for a data set could not be found.

       --config-file config-file
              Specify a configuration file to use.

              When this option is specified, neither the system-wide  configu‐
              ration  file  /etc/lcovrc,  nor  the per-user configuration file
              ~/.lcovrc is read.

              This option may be useful when there is a need  to  run  several
              instances  of  genhtml with different configuration file options
              in parallel.

       --rc keyword=value
              Override a configuration directive.

              Use this option to specify a keyword=value statement which over‐
              rides  the  corresponding  configuration statement in the lcovrc
              configuration file. You can specify this option more  than  once
              to  override  multiple  configuration statements.  See lcovrc(5)
              for a list of available keywords and their meaning.

       --precision num
              Show coverage rates with num number of digits after the decimal-
              point.

              Default value is 1.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_precision.

       --missed
              Show counts of missed lines, functions, or branches

              Use this option to change overview pages to show  the  count  of
              lines,  functions,  or  branches that were not hit. These counts
              are represented by negative numbers.

              When specified together with --sort, file  and  directory  views
              will be sorted by missed counts.

              This option can also be configured permanently using the config‐
              uration file option genhtml_missed.

FILES
       /etc/lcovrc
              The system-wide configuration file.

       ~/.lcovrc
              The per-user configuration file.
