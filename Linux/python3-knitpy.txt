NAME
       knitpy - a report generation tool with Python

SYNOPSIS
       knitpy [options] infile.pymd

DESCRIPTION
       This application is used to convert pymd documents (*.pymd) to various other formats.

       Codeblocks  and  inline code are executed via IPython kernels and the results are inserted into the document. Documents should follow rmarkdown syntax (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), substituting
       'python' for 'r' if python code should be executed.

       The commandline interface should be compatible to knitr.

       knitpy uses pandoc to do any file type conversion (md -> html|latex|...).

       ONLY SOME FEATURES OF knitr OR rmarkdown ARE YET SUPPORTED...

OPTIONS
       Type 'knitpy --help' to see the available options.  For more information on full configurables, use '--help-all'.

EXAMPLES
       The simplest way to use knitpy is 'knitpy mydocument.pymd', which will convert mydocument.pymd to the default format (probably HTML).

       Output formats supported: 'html', 'pdf' and 'docx'. Change with '--to=<format>'.  Use '--to=all' to convert to all export formats specified in the yaml header
