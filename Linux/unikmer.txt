NAME
       unikmer - Toolkit for nucleic acid k-mer analysis

DESCRIPTION
       unikmer - Toolkit for k-mer with taxonomic information

       unikmer is a toolkit for nucleic acid k-mer analysis, providing functions including set operation on k-mers optional with TaxIds but without count information.

       K-mers are either encoded (k<=32) or hashed (arbitrary k) into 'uint64', and serialized in binary file with extension '.unik'.

       TaxIds can be assigned when counting k-mers from genome sequences, and LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) is computed during set opertions including computing union, intersection, set difference, unique
       and repeated k-mers.

       Version: v0.19.0

       Dataset (optional):

              Manipulating  k-mers  with  TaxIds  needs  taxonomy  file  from  e.g.,  NCBI Taxonomy database, please extract "nodes.dmp", "names.dmp", "delnodes.dmp" and "merged.dmp" from link below into
              ~/.unikmer/ , ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz , or some other directory, and later you can refer to using flag --data-dir or environment variable UNIKMER_DB.

              For GTDB, use 'taxonkit create-taxdump' to create NCBI-style taxonomy dump files, or download from:

              https://github.com/shenwei356/gtdb-taxonomy

              Note that TaxIds are represented using uint32 and stored in 4 or less bytes, all TaxIds should be in the range of [1, 4294967295]

   Flags:
       -c, --compact
              write compact binary file with little loss of speed

       --compression-level int
              compression level (default -1)

       --data-dir string
              directory containing NCBI Taxonomy files, including nodes.dmp, names.dmp, merged.dmp and delnodes.dmp (default "/home/nilesh/.unikmer")

       -h, --help
              help for unikmer

       -I, --ignore-taxid
              ignore taxonomy information

       -i, --infile-list string
              file of input files list (one file per line), if given, they are appended to files from cli arguments

       --max-taxid uint32
              for smaller TaxIds, we can use less space to store TaxIds. default value is 1<<32-1, that's enough for NCBI Taxonomy TaxIds (default 4294967295)

       -C, --no-compress
              do not compress binary file (not recommended)

       --nocheck-file
              do not check binary file, when using process substitution or named pipe

       -j, --threads int
              number of CPUs to use (default 4)

       --verbose
              print verbose information

       Use "unikmer [command] --help" for more information about a command.
