ABOUT FIREJAIL
       Firejail  is  a SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux namespaces, seccomp-bpf and Linux capa‐
       bilities.  It allows a process and all its descendants to have their own private view of the globally shared kernel resources, such as the network stack, process table, mount table.  Firejail  can
       work in a SELinux or AppArmor environment, and it is integrated with Linux Control Groups.
