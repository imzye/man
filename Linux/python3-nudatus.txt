DESCRIPTION
       nudatus is a utility to remove comments from Python 3 scripts.

       nudatus  was  created to help fit longer, heavily-documented Python programs onto the micro:bit single-board computer (SBC), but it should be suitable for similar platforms with restricted storage
       capacity.

ARGUMENTS

       output a file to write the stripped Python script to.  If output is not specified, output will be written to STDOUT.

OPTIONS
       --version
              print version number and exit

       -h     print help, then exit

EXAMPLES
       Remove comments from the script script.py and write the stripped file to script-min.py:

              nudatus script.py script-min.py
