NAME
       prometheus-process-exporter - Prometheus exporter which mines procfs to report on selected processes.

SYNOPSIS
       prometheus-process-exporter [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       Some  apps  are  impractical  to instrument directly, either because you don't control the code or they're written in a language that isn't easy to instrument with Prometheus. This exporter solves
       that issue by mining process metrics from procfs.

       The recommended option is to use a config file, but for convenience and backwards compatibility the -procnames / -namemapping options exist as an alternative.

       The -children option (default:true) makes it so that any process that otherwise isn't part of its own group becomes part of the first group found (if any) when walking the process tree upwards. In
       other words, resource usage of subprocesses is added to their parent's usage unless the subprocess identifies as a different group name.

OPTIONS
       -children
              If a proc is tracked, track with it any children that aren't part of their own group (default true).

       -config.path string
              Path to YAML config file.

       -debug Log debugging information to stdout.

       -man   Print manual.

       -namemapping string
              Comma-separated list, alternating process name and capturing regex to apply to cmdline.

       -procfs string
              Path to read proc data from (default "/proc").

       -procnames string
              Comma-separated list of process names to monitor.

       -recheck Re-check process names on each scrape.

       -web.config.file string
              Path to YAML web config file.

       -web.listen-address string
              Address on which to expose metrics and web interface. (default ":9256").

       -web.telemetry-path string
              Path under which to expose metrics. (default "/metrics").
