NAME
       ws_allocate - create a workspace directory and return its path

SYNOPSIS
       ws_allocate [-h] [-x] [-g] [-F FILESYSTEM] [-r DAYS] [-m MAILADDRESS] [-c COMMENT] NAME DURATION

DESCRIPTION
       Create  a workspace for the calling user with name NAME which will exist for DURATION days.  The command will always return the full name of the created directory on stdout, and will print some infor‐
       mation to stderr.  A workspace has a limited lifetime, which can be restricted by the administrator.  The DURATION might be cut to that maximum, a warning will be printed in that case.

       A workspace can be extended if allowed by the administrator, who might limit the number of extensions.

       A reminder email can be sent to address MAILADDRESS (or address from ~/.ws_user.conf) DAYS before the workspace expires. This will done probably during a nightly cleanup run, do not expect it to  come
       exactly in time but rather the night after the warning period is met.

       The idea of the workspace is to allow the administrator to keep control of filespace in working filesystems, and to avoid the situations that data of past and finished projects/jobs is idling for ever
       on disks. A user can create and dispose arbitrary number of workspaces, they are cheap, and can be created e.g. for each job.

       For the administrator, workspaces offer further advantages, like beeing able to migrate users to another filesystem over time, and to do loadbalancing over directories and filesystems.

       From the system side, workspaces will be deleted after beeing expired. A friendly user can release workspaces before the expiration date using ws_release which will mark the workspace for future dele‐
       tion and make the data unavailable for the user.

       Deletion is probably a task done once a night and not immediately.

       If  a  workspace  was  forgotten  and  expired, it might make sense to contact the administrator, as he probaly can restore a workspace for some time, if disk space is not low.  Check if ws_restore is
       available to restore workspaces that are still in the hidden area.

OPTIONS
       -h     display usage help text

       -x     extend an existing workspace until today + DURATION days.  The number of extensions can be limited. Can be combined with -m to add a mail address  and  with  -r  to  add  reminder  to  existing
              workspaces. If used with 0 as duration, it does not consume an extension.

       -F     select the filesystem to create the workspace in, there is always a default for this.  See ws_list -l for a list of available filesystems.

       -m     mailaddress to send reminder mail to, can be combined with -x to add mailaddress to existing workspace (combine with duration 0).

       -c     comment to attach to workspace, can be combined with -x to change comment of an existing workspace (combine with duration 0).

       -r DAYS
              reminder  email  will be sent DAYS days before the workspace will expire, can be combined with -x to add reminder to existing workspace. This could be sent in the night after the exact point in
              time, during a cleanup.  See ws_send_ical for a way to send calendar entries.

       -g     a group-workspace will be created, that is a workspace that can be seen by other members of current group with ws_list -g and the workspace itself is created group readable.

EXAMPLES
       create a workspace for 10 days:
              ws_allocate myworkspace 10

FILES
       ~/.ws_user.conf can contain an email address to send reminders to, if no -m option is used.

       It has the form
              mail: user@domain
