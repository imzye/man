PVFS2-SET-EVENTMASK(1)      General Commands Manual     PVFS2-SET-EVENTMASK(1)

NAME
       pvfs2-set-eventmask – enable and disable debug strings to log

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-set-eventmask [-m mount_point] [-e events]

DESCRIPTION
       The server contains many log strings which are categorized.  This util‐
       ity sets which categories to log on the server.   The  output  will  be
       into the configured server log file.

       The options are as follows:

       -h     Display  synopsis.   This  includes  a list of all possible mask
              strings.

       -v     Print version number and exit.

       -m     Specify the file system to operate on.

       -s     Specify the address of the  server.   This  option  is  used  to
              change  the  mask  only  on  a  particular server instead of the
              entire cluster.
