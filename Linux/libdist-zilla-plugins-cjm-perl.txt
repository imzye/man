NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PrereqsFromMeta - Check the prereqs from our META.json

VERSION
       This document describes version 4.23 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PrereqsFromMeta, released December 17, 2017 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM version 6.000.

SYNOPSIS
       In your dist.ini:

         [Test::PrereqsFromMeta]

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin will inject t/00-all_prereqs.t into your dist.  This test reads your META.json file and attempts to load all runtime prerequisites.  It fails if any required runtime prerequisites fail
       to load.  (If the loaded version is less than the required version, it prints a warning message but the test does not fail.)

       In addition, if "AUTOMATED_TESTING" is set, it dumps out every module in %INC along with its version.  This can help you determine the cause of failures reported by CPAN Testers.

       You can also get the version dump by running t/00-all_prereqs.t with the "-v" or "--verbose" option.  (This is not the same as passing the "-v" option to "prove".)

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       No bugs have been reported.
