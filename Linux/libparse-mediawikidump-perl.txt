Parse::MediaWikiDump::page(3pm)                                                     User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                     Parse::MediaWikiDump::page(3pm)

NAME
       Parse::MediaWikiDump::page - Object representing a specific revision of a MediaWiki page

ABOUT
       This object is returned from the "next" method of Parse::MediaWikiDump::Pages and Parse::MediaWikiDump::Revisions. You most likely will not be creating instances of this particular object yourself
       instead you use this object to access the information about a page in a MediaWiki instance.

SYNOPSIS
         $pages = Parse::MediaWikiDump::Pages->new('pages-articles.xml');

         #get all the records from the dump files, one record at a time
         while(defined($page = $pages->next)) {
           print "title '", $page->title, "' id ", $page->id, "\n";
         }

STATUS
       This software is being RETIRED - MediaWiki::DumpFile is the official successor to Parse::MediaWikiDump and includes a compatibility library called MediaWiki::DumpFile::Compat that is 100% API
       compatible and is a near perfect standin for this module. It is faster in all instances where it counts and is actively maintained. Any undocumented deviation of MediaWiki::DumpFile::Compat from
       Parse::MediaWikiDump is considered a bug and will be fixed.
