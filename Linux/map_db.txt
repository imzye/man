NAME
       map_db - read a FASTA (0), GENBANK flat file (1) PIR/VMS (5) or GCG binary (6) sequence database and produce the offsets necessary for efficient memory mapping.

SYNOPSIS
       map_db [-n] filename | "filename libtype"

DESCRIPTION
       map_db filename reads the sequence database in filename and produce a new file filename.xin with the offset information necessary for efficient memory mapping.

       The programs in fasta version 32t08 can use memory mapped i/o to load sequence database files and read them efficiently.  Memory mapping is used only if a ".xin" file is available.  The ".xin" file is
       created by map_db.

       In addition to map_db, list_db is available to display the database size, etc, and set of offsets calculated by map_db.

OPTIONS
       -n     Read file as DNA database.
