NAME
       sssctl - SSSD control and status utility

SYNOPSIS
       sssctl COMMAND [options]

DESCRIPTION
       sssctl provides a simple and unified way to obtain information about
       SSSD status, such as active server, auto-discovered servers, domains
       and cached objects. In addition, it can manage SSSD data files for
       troubleshooting in such a way that is safe to manipulate while SSSD is
       running.

AVAILABLE COMMANDS
       To list all available commands run sssctl without any parameters. To
       print help for selected command run sssctl COMMAND --help.

COMMON OPTIONS
       Those options are available with all commands.

       --debug LEVEL
           SSSD supports two representations for specifying the debug level.
           The simplest is to specify a decimal value from 0-9, which
           represents enabling that level and all lower-level debug messages.
           The more comprehensive option is to specify a hexadecimal bitmask
           to enable or disable specific levels (such as if you wish to
           suppress a level).

           Currently supported debug levels:

           0, 0x0010: Fatal failures. Anything that would prevent SSSD from
           starting up or causes it to cease running.

           1, 0x0020: Critical failures. An error that doesn't kill SSSD, but
           one that indicates that at least one major feature is not going to
           work properly.

           2, 0x0040: Serious failures. An error announcing that a particular
           request or operation has failed.

           3, 0x0080: Minor failures. These are the errors that would
           percolate down to cause the operation failure of 2.

           4, 0x0100: Configuration settings.

           5, 0x0200: Function data.

           6, 0x0400: Trace messages for operation functions.

           7, 0x1000: Trace messages for internal control functions.

           8, 0x2000: Contents of function-internal variables that may be
           interesting.

           9, 0x4000: Extremely low-level tracing information.

           10, 0x10000: Even more low-level libldb tracing information. Almost
           never really required.

           To log required bitmask debug levels, simply add their numbers
           together as shown in following examples:

           Example: To log fatal failures, critical failures, serious failures
           and function data use 0x0270.

           Example: To log fatal failures, configuration settings, function
           data, trace messages for internal control functions use 0x1310.

           Note: The bitmask format of debug levels was introduced in 1.7.0.

           Default: 0x0070 (i.e. fatal, critical and serious failures;
           corresponds to setting 2 in decimal notation)
