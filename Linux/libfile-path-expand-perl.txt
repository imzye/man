NAME
       File::Path::Expand - expand filenames

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Path::Expand;
        print expand_filename("~richardc/foo"); # prints "/home/richardc/foo"

DESCRIPTION
       File::Path::Expand expands user directories in filenames.  For the simple case it's no more complex than s{^~/}{$HOME/}, but for other cases it consults "getpwent" and does the right thing.
