NAME
       ROX-Filer - a simple graphical file manager

SYNOPSIS
       rox [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       ROX-Filer is a simple and easy to use graphical file manager for X11, the windowing system used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

       It is also the core component of the ROX Desktop: http://rox.sourceforge.net

       Invoking rox opens each directory or file listed, or the current working directory if no arguments are given.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -b, --border=PANEL
              open PANEL.

       -B, --bottom=PANEL
              open PANEL as a bottom-edge panel.

       -c, --client-id=ID
              used for session management.

       -d, --dir=DIR
              open DIR as directory (not as an application, even if it looks like one).

       -D, --close=DIR
              close DIR and all its subdirectories.

       -h, --help
              display help about the various options.

       -l, --left=PANEL
              open PANEL as a left-edge panel.

       -m, --mime-type=FILE
              print MIME type of FILE and exit.

       -n, --new
              start a new filer, even if one already seems to be
                    running. This also prevents the filer from forking (running in the
                    background). This option is mainly useful for debugging.

       -p, --pinboard=PIN
              use pinboard PIN as the pinboard.

       -r, --right=PANEL
              open PANEL as a right-edge panel.

       -R, --RPC
              read and invoke SOAP RPC from standard input (see the manual).

       -s, --show=FILE
              open a directory showing FILE.

       -S, --rox-session
              run  by  session manager, open the default panel and pinboard (implies --new).  If an XSM session manager is running and this option is used then ROX-
              Filer will ask to be automatically restarted if it crashes.

       -t, --top=PANEL
              open PANEL as a top-edge panel.

       -u, --user
              show user name in each window.

       -U, --url=URI
              run URI as a file or directory. If URI is a file: url and refers to a file on the local machine then it is converted to a local  file  name:   rox  -U
              file:///tmp is equivalent to rox /tmp.  If the URI is some other scheme the shared URI handler configuration is consulted to run it.

       -v, --version
              display the version information and exit.

       -x, --examine=FILE
              FILE has changed; re-examine it.
