NAME
       libglpk-java - GNU Linear Programming Kit Java Binding

DESCRIPTION
       The GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) package supplies a solver for large scale linear programming (LP) and mixed integer programming (MIP).  The GLPK project is hosted at http://www.gnu.org/soft‐
       ware/glpk.

       It has two mailing lists:
       - help-glpk@gnu.org and
       - bug-glpk@gnu.org.

       To subscribe to one of these lists, please, send an empty mail with a Subject: header line of just "subscribe" to the list.

       GLPK provides a library written in C and a standalone solver.  The source code provided at ftp://gnu.ftp.org/gnu/glpk/ contains the documentation of the library in file doc/glpk.pdf.

       The Java platform provides the Java Native Interface (JNI) to integrate non-Java language libraries into Java applications.

       Project GLPK for Java delivers a Java Binding for GLPK. It is hosted at http://glpk-java.sourceforge.net/.

       To report problems and suggestions concerning GLPK for Java, please, send an email to the author at xypron.glpk@gmx.de.

ARCHITECTURE
       A GLPK for Java application will consist of the following
       - the GLPK library
       - the GLPK for Java JNI library
       - the GLPK for Java class library
       - the application code.

GLPK LIBRARY
       The GLPK library can be compiled from source code. Follow the instructions in file INSTALL provided in the source distribution. Precompiled packages are available in many Linux distributions.

       The usual installation path for the library is /usr/local/lib/libglpk.so.  The library has to be in the search path for binaries.

GLPK FOR JAVA JNI LIBRARY
       The GLPK for Java JNI library can be compiled from source code. Follow the instructions in file INSTALL provided in the source distribution.

       The  usual installation path for the library is /usr/local/lib/jni/libglpk-java.so.  The library has to be in the search path for binaries. Specify the library path upon invocation of the applica‐
       tion, e.g.
       java -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib/jni

GLPK FOR JAVA CLASS LIBRARY
       The source code to compile the GLPK for Java class library is provided at http://glpk-java.sourceforge.net.

       The GLPK for Java class library can be compiled from source code. Follow the instructions in file INSTALL provided in the source distribution.  The usual  installation  path  for  the  library  is
       /usr/local/share/java/glpk-java.jar.

       The library has to be in the CLASSPATH. Specify the classpath upon invocation of the application, e.g.
       java -classpath /usr/local/share/java/glpk-java.jar;.

SEE ALSO
       Further documentation and examples can be found in the documentation path, which defaults to /usr/local/share/doc/libglpk-java.
