NAME
       pocommentclean - Remove all translator comments from PO files.

SYNOPSIS
       pocommentclean [--backup] po-dir

       where po-dir is a directory of existing PO files that you want to clean.

DESCRIPTION
       pocommentclean will remove all translator comments from a directory of PO files.

OPTIONS
       --backup
              Create a backup file for each PO file converted, with the .po.bak extension.

OPERATION
       Using sed pocommentclean will delete all lines starting with # but which are not standard Gettext PO format lines. So it won't delete developer comments (#.), obsolete messages (#~), flags (#,) or lo‐
       cations (#:).

BUGS
       pocommentclean cannot clean individual PO files, it only cleans directories.
