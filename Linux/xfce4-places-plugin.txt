NAME
       Xfce4-places-plugin - quick access to folders, documents and removable media

        - System-defined directories (home folder, trash, desktop, file system)
        - Removable media (using thunar-vfs)
        - User-defined bookmarks (reads ~/.gtk-bookmarks)
        - Recent documents submenu
