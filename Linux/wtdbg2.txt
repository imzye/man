   File format:
              PGZF fellows standard GZIP format (rfc1952), and is blocked compressed.  It defines two TAGs in each GZIP header, ZS: block size, ZX: random access index.  Program pgzf can decompress .pgzf
              and .gz files. When decompressing .gz files, pgzf is in fact a buffered gzip reader. Also, .pgzf files can be decompressed by program gzip.

       In plan to support random access
