AXPARMS(8)               Linux System Managers Manual               AXPARMS(8)

NAME
       axparms - Configure AX.25 interfaces.

SYNOPSIS
       axparms --assoc|--forward|--route|--setcall|--version ...

DESCRIPTION
       The axparms command is designed to be a multi-function command that al‐
       lows miscellaneous commands to be issued to the  Linux  AX.25  protocol
       layer.   The different modes of the command are chosen by the first ar‐
       gument. Subsequent arguments depend upon this argument and so no gener‐
       alised command format can be given.

--assoc Argument
       The format of this option is:

       axparms --assoc <callsign> <username|uid>
       axparms --assoc <callsign> delete
       axparms --assoc policy [default|deny]
       axparms --assoc show

       This option mainpulates the kernel uid/callsign mapping table, allowing
       callsigns to be associated and dis-associated with a user.  The  policy
       option  permits the superuser to have all other uid's either default to
       the actual port name, or to block traffic.

       At power up the table is blank and the policy is  'default',  which  is
       thus backward compatible.

--forward Argument
       Allows  the use of many receivers with one transmitter, known as packet
       forwarding in many systems. The format of this command is:

       axparms --forward <portfrom> <portto>
       axparms --forward <portfrom> delete

       Any packets to be transmitted on port portfrom will be  transmitted  on
       port  portto. This will stay in force until the second form of the com‐
       mand is issued which will remove the association.

--route Argument
       This option allows the internal AX.25 routing table to be  manipulated.
       This  table  is available for reading in /proc/net/ax25_route, and will
       be built up dynamically by stations heard. However it  is  possible  to
       add, delete and list entries via this option.

       The formats of this option are:

       axparms --route add <port> <callsign> [<digis>] [--ipmode V|D]
       axparms --route del <port> <callsign>
       axparms --route list

       Routes  added  via  this  command will not be removed from the internal
       routing table when they are “old” as normal entries are.  The  --ipmode
       option sets mode vc or mode datagram for this destination.

       If  the  <callsign> argument is set to “default” then this will set the
       default route for all outgoing AX.25 connections  which  will  be  used
       when there is no specific route to the required destination.

--setcall Argument
       The format of this option is:

       axparms --setcall <interface> <callsign>

       This  changes the callsign associated at the given physical ax25 inter‐
       face.

       Cave: The interface name is not the symbolic port  name  from  axports,
       but  the real interface name (from ifconfig(8)): ax0, ax1, .., sp0, ..,
       bpq0, ... etc..

       The change is permanent as long as the  interface  exists,  or  another
       “axparms --setcall” is issued.

       The  interface has to exist already in order to use this option; it may
       be in state UP or DOWN.

--version Argument
       This option displays the version of the AX.25  utilities  that  axparms
       belongs to.
