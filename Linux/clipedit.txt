NAME
       clipedit - Edit clipboard contents in one swoop.

VERSION
       version 0.26

MOTIVATION
       Eliminating the "Open editor, edit stuff, copy back to the clipboard"
       shuffle.

NOTE
       If for some reason the clipboard contents changes during the edit
       session, you will be prompted to choose between 1) the original
       Clipboard contents, 2) the new Clipboard contents, and 3) the result of
       your edits (which is the default if you just hit "Enter").

CONFIGURATION
       If you don't want the script to use "vim" to edit, set either the
       environment variable $VISUAL or $EDITOR.
