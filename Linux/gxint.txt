NAME
       gxint - load and run an interactive GEANT application

SYNOPSIS
       gxint [options] file(s)

DESCRIPTION
       gxint is a script to load and run a GEANT application, which is usually in the form of Fortran source code.  The desired routines are given in file(s).

OPTIONS
       -d driver
              Specify a graphics driver.  The available options on Linux are X11 and Motif (which should also work with lesstif). X11 is the default.

       -g geant_version
              Specify the version of GEANT to use.  Current default is 3.21.  This option only makes sense if you have installed a GEANT version other than 3.21 (i.e. one not packaged by Debian).

       -h host
              Useful with the -d X11 option only.  Specifies the hostname used for the display; syntax is identical with that of $DISPLAY.  If no hostname is specified, the value of $DISPLAY is used.

       -l library
              Specify additional libraries.  This option may be repeated to add several libs.

       -L path
              Additional loader search path.  Useful if additional libraries are specified with -l option.  This option may be repeated with more than one pathname.

       -m     Do NOT use main program from cernlib area.

       -o outputfile
              Do not immediately run GEANT, but instead produce an executable file named outputfile.  If "-o" is not given, the executable file will be created in $HOME, named GEANTpid (pid being the process
              ID of gxint), and run automatically.

       -v version
              Specify version of $CERN_LEVEL.  This is meaningless unless you have installed an upstream version of CERNLIB (i.e. not packaged by Debian); see the file  /usr/share/doc/cernlib-base/README.De‐
              bian.

       -?, --help
              Show a summary of options.

       /usr/share/doc/cernlib-base/README.Debian describes how one might use the -v flag with Debian's versions of the cernlib and gxint scripts if one has an upstream version of CERNLIB installed.
