NAME
       cppi - indent the C preprocessor directives in FILE to reflect their nesting

SYNOPSIS
       cppi [FILE]
       cppi -c [OPTION] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Indent  the  C preprocessor directives in FILE to reflect their nesting and ensure that there is exactly one space character between each #if, #elif, #define directive and the following token, and
       write the result to standard output.  The number of spaces between the `#' and the following directive must correspond to the level of nesting of that directive.  With no FILE, or when FILE is  -,
       read standard input.

       -a, --ansi
              when checking, fail if text follows #else or #endif

       -c, --check
              set exit code, but don't produce any output

       -l, --list-files-only
              don't generate diagnostics about indentation; print to stdout only the names of files that are not properly indented

       -m, --max-string-length=LENGTH
              fail if there is a double-quoted string longer than LENGTH;  if LENGTH is 0 (the default), then there is no limit

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       With the -c option, don't write to stdout.  Instead, check the indentation of the specified files giving diagnostics for preprocessor lines that aren't properly indented or are otherwise invalid.

       Note that --ansi without --check does not correct the problem of non-ANSI text following #else and #endif directives.

   The exit code will be one of these:
       0      all directives properly indented

       1      some cpp directive(s) improperly indented, or text follows #else/#endif (enabled with --check --ansi), or a double-quoted string is longer than the specified maximum

       2      #if/#endif mismatch, EOF in comment or string

       3      file (e.g. open/read/write) error

       A pragma directive may have its `#' indented.
