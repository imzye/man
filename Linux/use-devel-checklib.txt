NAME
       use-devel-checklib - (DEPRECATED)a script to package Devel::CheckLib with your code.

DESCRIPTION
       This script was DEPRECATED.

       If you need to depend on this library, you should use `configure_requires` in Makefile.PL or Build.PL instead.

WARNINGS, BUGS and FEEDBACK
       This script has not been thoroughly tested.  You should check by hand that it has done what you expected after running it.

       If you use Module::Build::Compat to write a Makefile.PL, then you will need to re-run this script whenever you have generated a new Makefile.PL.

       I welcome feedback about my code, including constructive criticism.  Bug reports should be made using <http://rt.cpan.org/> or by email.
