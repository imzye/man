NAME
       git-rebase-patch - Rebases a patch

SYNOPSIS
       git-rebase-patch <patch-file>

DESCRIPTION
       Given  you have a patch that doesn´t apply to the current HEAD, but you
       know it applied to some commit in the past, git-rebase-patch will  help
       you find that commit and do a rebase.

OPTIONS
       <patch-file>
              The patch to be applied.

EXAMPLES
       Executing

           $ git rebase-patch test.patch

       could give you something like that:

           Trying to find a commit the patch applies to...
           Patch applied to dbcf408dd26 as 7dc8b23ae1a
           First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
           Applying: test.patch
           Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
           Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
           Auto-merging README.txt

       Then  your  last  commit  has  the  changes  of  the patch and is named
       test.patch.
