NAME
       datezone - Convert DATE/TIMEs between timezones.

SYNOPSIS
       datezone [OPTION]...  [ZONENAME]... [DATE/TIME]...

DESCRIPTION
       Convert DATE/TIMEs between timezones.  If DATE/TIME is omitted, it defaults to `now'.

       DATE/TIME can also be one of the following specials
         - `now'           interpreted as the current (UTC) time stamp
         - `time'          the time part of the current (UTC) time stamp
         - `today'         the current date (according to UTC)
         - `tomo[rrow]'    tomorrow's date (according to UTC)
         - `y[ester]day'   yesterday's date (according to UTC)

       When DATE/TIME is a date (i.e. the time component is omitted) the result will show the timezone offset at the end of that day.

       When DATE/TIME is a time (i.e. the date component is omitted) the conversion takes place on the date as specified by --base|-b, by default the current date.

       Recognized OPTIONs:

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress message about date/time or zonename parser errors and fix-ups.  The default is to print a warning or the fixed up value and return error code 2.

       -b, --base=DT
              For  underspecified  input  use DT as a fallback to fill in missing fields.  Also used for ambiguous format specifiers to position their range on the absolute time line.  Must be a date/time in
              ISO8601 format.  If omitted defaults to the current date/time.

       -i, --input-format=STRING...
              Input format, can be used multiple times.  Each date/time will be passed to the input format parsers in the order they are given, if a date/time can be read successfully with a given input for‐
              mat specifier string, that value will be used.

       --from-locale=LOCALE
              Interpret dates on stdin or the command line as coming from the locale LOCALE, this would only affect month and weekday names as input formats have to be specified explicitly.

       --from-zone=ZONE
              Interpret dates on stdin or the command line as coming from the time zone ZONE.

       --next Show next transition from/to DST.

       --prev Show previous transition from/to DST.

FORMAT SPECS
       Format specs in dateutils are similar to posix' strftime().

       However, due to a broader range of supported calendars dateutils must employ different rules.

       Date specs:
         %a  The abbreviated weekday name
         %A  The full weekday name
         %_a The weekday name shortened to a single character (MTWRFAS)
         %b  The abbreviated month name
         %B  The full month name
         %_b The month name shortened to a single character (FGHJKMNQUVXZ)
         %c  The count of the weekday within the month (range 00 to 05)
         %C  The count of the weekday within the year (range 00 to 53)
         %d  The day of the month, 2 digits (range 00 to 31)
         %D  The day of the year, 3 digits (range 000 to 366)
         %F  Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (ymd's canonical format)
         %g  ISO week date year without the century (range 00 to 99)
         %G  ISO week date year including the century
         %j  Equivalent to %D
         %m  The month in the current calendar (range 00 to 19)
         %Q  The quarter of the year (range Q1 to Q4)
         %q  The number of the quarter (range 01 to 04)
         %s  The number of seconds since the Epoch.
         %u  The weekday as number (range 01 to 07, Sunday being 07)
         %U  The week count,  day of week is Sun (range 00 to 53)
         %V  The ISO week count,  day of week is Mon (range 01 to 53)
         %w  The weekday as number (range 00 to 06, Sunday being 00)
         %W  The week count,  day of week is Mon (range 00 to 53)
         %y  The year without a century (range 00 to 99)
         %Y  The year including the century
         %_y The year shortened to a single digit
         %Z  The zone offset in hours and minutes (HH:MM) with
             a preceding sign (+ for offsets east of UTC, - for offsets
             west of UTC)

         %Od The day as roman numerals
         %Om The month as roman numerals
         %Oy The two digit year as roman numerals
         %OY The year including the century as roman numerals

         %rs In time systems whose Epoch is different from the unix Epoch, this
             selects the number of seconds since then.
         %rY In calendars with years that don't coincide with the Gregorian
             years, this selects the calendar's year.

         %dth  The day of the month as an ordinal number, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.
         %mth  The month of the year as an ordinal number, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.

         %db The business day of the month (since last month's ultimo)
         %dB Number of business days until this month's ultimo

       Time specs:
         %H  The hour of the day using a 24h clock, 2 digits (range 00 to 23)
         %I  The hour of the day using a 12h clock, 2 digits (range 01 to 12)
         %M  The minute (range 00 to 59)

         %p  The string AM or PM, noon is PM and midnight is AM.
         %P  Like %p but in lowercase
         %S  The  (range 00 to 60, 60 is for leap seconds)
         %T  Equivalent to %H:%M:%S

       General specs:
         %n  A newline character
         %t  A tab character
         %%  A literal % character

       Modifiers:
         %O  Modifier to turn decimal numbers into Roman numerals
         %r  Modifier to turn units into real units
         %0  Modifier to turn on zero prefixes
         %SPC  Modifier to turn on space prefixes
         %-  Modifier to turn off prefixes altogether
         th  Suffix, read and print ordinal numbers
         b   Suffix, treat days as business days

       By design dates before 1601-01-01 are not supported.

       For conformity here is a list of calendar designators and their corresponding format string:
         ymd     %Y-%m-%d
         ymcw    %Y-%m-%c-%w
         ywd     %rY-W%V-%u
         bizda   %Y-%m-%db
         lilian     n/a
         ldn        n/a
         julian     n/a
         jdn        n/a
         matlab     n/a
         mdn        n/a

       These designators can be used as output format string, moreover, @code{lilian}/@code{ldn} and @code{julian}/@code{jdn} can also be used as input format string.
