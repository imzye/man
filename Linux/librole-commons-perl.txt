Role::Commons::ObjectID(3pm)                                                        User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                        Role::Commons::ObjectID(3pm)

NAME
       Role::Commons::Authority - an object method providing a unique identifier

SYNOPSIS
          use v5.14;

          package Person 1.0 {
             use Moo;
             use Role::Commons -all;
             has name => (is => 'ro');
          };

          my $bob1 = Person->new(name => "Bob");
          my $bob2 = Person->new(name => "Bob");

          say $bob1->object_id;  # an identifier
          say $bob2->object_id;  # a different identifier

DESCRIPTION
       This is a tiny shim between Object::ID and Role::Commons (and hence Moo::Role/Moose::Role too).
