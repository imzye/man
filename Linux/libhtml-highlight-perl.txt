NAME
       HTML::Highlight - A module to highlight words or patterns in HTML documents

SYNOPSIS
               use HTML::Highlight;

               # create the highlighter object

               my $hl = new HTML::Highlight (
                       words => [
                               'word',
                               'any',
                               'car',
                               'some phrase'
                       ],
                       wildcards => [
                               undef,
                               '%',
                               '*',
                               undef
                       ],
                       colors => [
                               '#FF0000',
                               'red',
                               'green',
                               'rgb(255, 0, 0)'
                       ],
                       czech_language => 0,
                       debug => 0
               );

               # Remember that you don't need to specify your own colors.
               # The default colors should be optimal.

               # Now you can use the object to highlight patterns in a document
               # by passing content of the document to its highlight() method.
               # The highlighter object "remembers" its configuration.

               my $highlighted_document = $hl->highlight($document);

MOTIVATION
       This module was originaly created to work together with fulltext indexing module DBIx::TextIndex to highlight search results.

       A need for a highlighter that takes wildcard matches and HTML tags into account and supports czech language (or other Slavic languages) was the motivation to create this module.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides Google-like highlighting of words or patterns in HTML documents. This feature is typically used to highlight search results.

       The construcutor:
                   my $hl = new HTML::Highlight (
                           words => [],
                           wildcards => [],
                           colors => [],
                           czech_language => 0,
                           debug => 0
                   );

           This is a constructor of the highlighter object. It takes an array of even number of parameters.

           The words parameter is a reference to an array of words to highlight.

           The wildcards parameter is a reference to an array of wildcards, that are applied to corresponding words in the words array.

           A wildcard can be either undef or one of '%' or '*'.

           The "%" character means "match any characters":

                   "%" applied to 'car' ==> matches "car", "cars", "careful", ...

           The "*" character means "match also plural form of the word":

                   "*" applied to 'car' ==> matches only "car" or "cars"

           An undefined wildcard means "match exactly the corresponding word":

                   undefined wildcard applied to 'car' ==> matches only "car"

           The colors parameter is a reference to an array of CSS color identificators, that are used to highlight the corresponding words in the words array.

           Default  Google-like  colors  are  used if you don't specify your own colors. Number of colors can be lower than number of words - in this case the colors are rotated and some of the words are
           therefore highlighted using the same color.

           The highlighter takes HTML tags into account and therefore does not "highlight" a word or a pattern inside a tag.

           A support for diacritics insenstive matching for ISO-8859-2 languages (for for example the czech language) can be activated using the czech_language option.  This  feature  requires  a  module
           CzFast that is available on CPAN in a directory of author TRIPIE or at http://geocities.com/tripiecz/.

           Your system's locales must be set correctly to use the czech_language feature.

       highlight
                   my $hl_document = $hl->highlight($document);

           The  only  parameter  is a document in that you want to highlight the words that were passed to the constructor of the highlighter object. The method returns a version of the document in which
           the words are highlighted.

       preview_context
                   my $sections = $hl->preview_context($document, $num);

           This method takes two parameters. The first one is the document you want to scan for the words that were passed to the constructor of  the  highlighter  object.  The  second  parameter  is  an
           optional  integer that specifies maximum number of characters in each of the context sections (see below). This parameter defaults to 80 characters if it's not specified. Minimum allowed value
           of this parameter is 60.

           The method returns a reference to an array of sections of the document in which the words that were passed to the constructor appear.  HTML tags are removed before the document  is  proccessed
           and  are  not present in the output.  This feature is typically used in search engines to preview a context in which words from a search query appear in the resulting documents.  The words are
           always in the middle of each of the sections. The number of sections this method returns is equal to the number of words passed to the constructor of the highlighter object.  That  means  only
           the first occurrence of each of the words is taken into account.

       No official support is provided, but I welcome any comments, patches and suggestions on my email.
