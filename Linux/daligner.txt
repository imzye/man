NAME
       daligner - local alignment discovery between long nucleotide sequencing reads

SYNOPSIS
       daligner [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       These  tools  permit  one to find all significant local alignments between reads encoded in a Dazzler database.  The assumption is that the reads are from a Pacific Biosciences RS II long read se‐
       quencer.  That is, the reads are long and noisy, up to 15% on average.

OPTIONS
       For a complete description of available commands and their options, see /usr/share/doc/daligner/README.md

                                                                                                October 2016                                                                                    DALIGNER(1)
