NAME
       vipe - edit pipe

SYNOPSIS
       command1 | vipe | command2

DESCRIPTION
       vipe allows you to run your editor in the middle of a unix pipeline and edit the data that is being piped between programs. Your editor will have the full data being piped from command1 loaded into
       it, and when you close it, that data will be piped into command2.

ARGUMENTS
       vipe takes an argument --suffix that can be used to provide a file extension to the temp file generated.  This enables editors to provide syntax highlighting and activate modes.  For example, you can
       call vipe like

         vipe --suffix csv

       to create a tempfile with .csv extensions which makes Emacs (or your favorite editor) launch in CSV major mode.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       EDITOR
           Editor to use.

       VISUAL
           Also supported to determine what editor to use.
