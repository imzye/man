NAME
       sgen - Mono XML Serializer GENerator

SYNOPSIS
       sgen [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  pre-compilable  custom  XML  serializer classes for specific
       types.

OPTIONS
       --assembly[:filename] , -a
              Specifies the assembly filename to process.

       --type[:typefullname] , -t
              Explicitly specifies the runtime type to process.

       --reference:[filename] , -r
              Specifies an assembly filename, which is referenced by the  tar‐
              get assembly and thus required to process it.

       --compiler:[options] , -c
              Specifies compiler options.

       --proxytypes , -p
              (Not supported yet.)

       --debug , -d
              Indicates the compiler to generate debug information.

       --keep , -k
              Indicates the compiler to keep generated temporary source files.

       --force , -f
              Indicates the generator to force overwriting existing assembly.

       --out:[output-directory] , -o
              Specifies  the output directory for resulting files. By default,
              it is current directory.

       --nologo , -n
              Indicates to not print the logo for this tool.

       --silent , -s
              Indicates the tool to run silently.

       --verbose , -v
              Indicates the tool to be more verbose on its progress.

       --help , -?
              Display command line help.

FEATURES
       It generates a file which contains a set  of  classes  for  custom  XML
       serialization.  The  resulting  classes enable xml serialization faster
       since it does not have to generate serialization classes dynamically at
       run time.

       Generated classes are supported only after 2.0 profile.
