NAME
       lxqt-config-appearance - GUI appearance application of LXQt: the fast and lightweight Qt Desktop Environment

SYNOPSIS
       lxqt-config-appearance

DESCRIPTION
       With this application you can set and configure the Qt/LXQt GUI appearance of programs.

       In  Linux,  the look of a GUI application depends on the toolkit it is based on.  in LXQt, the overall look of many apps relies on the Qt framework GUI. The lxqt-config-appearance application provides
       all aspects of configuring the appearance of the LXQt desktop.

       All the remaining major aspects of LXQt appearance rely on the active Qt widget style because the LXQt DE is based on the Qt framework.

       LXQt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt technologies and ships several core desktop components, all of which are optional:

        * Panel
        * Desktop
        * Application launcher
        * Settings center (related to this)
        * Session handler
        * Polkit handler
        * SSH password manager
        * Display manager handler
        * Power manager

       These components perform actions like their counterparts in other desktop environments and their names are self-descriptive. They are usually not launched manually but automatically, when an LXQt ses‐
       sion is chosen in the Display Manager.
