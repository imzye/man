NAME
       linkltc - create symbolic links for LibTranscript Converters (LTCs)

SYNOPSIS
       linkltc FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       linkltc creates symbolic links for LibTranscript Converters (LTCs). A single LTC may contain multiple converters, and a symbolic link for the names of the alternate converters is required for
       libtranscript to find them.

OPTIONS
       linkltc accepts the following options:

       -v, --verbose
              Produce verbose output to standard error.

       To stop linkltc from interpreting file names that start with a dash as options, one can specify a double dash (--) after which linkltc will interpret any following arguments as files to read.
