NAME
       nona-svg - stitch a vector panorama image

SYNOPSIS
        nona-svg [options] -o output project_file (image files)

        Options:
         -o prefix    Prefix for output
         -i num       Images to render, can be specified multiple times
         -h | --help  Outputs help documentation.

DESCRIPTION
       nona-svg is a drop in replacement for nona that works with SVG vector files.

       There are some snags:

       The .pto project needs to prepared with the correct w and h (width and height in pixels) parameters for the input SVG files in each i-line.  You can specify the SVG filenames using the n parameter, or
       by appending the SVG filenames on the command-line (similar to nona).

       This tool uses regular expressions rather than an SVG parser, so expect it to fail in all sorts of situations.  It seems to be ok with simple lines and curves generated by Inkscape.

       This tool uses pano_trafo from the Hugin project to do the projection math, the way the connection is done makes it only likely to work on unixy systems.

       Expect to see 'ContractViolation' errors from vigra, ignore them, this is a bug in pano_trafo which unnecessarily tries to open image files.

       Note that only homography transformations preserve splines, i.e. this only works properly if the input and output projection is rectilinear.  Having said that, the error with other projections isn't
       so noticeable if your lines are short and/or they are converted to 'curves' in Inkscape before remapping.
