   NAME
       x25519-cli - command-line interface for the lib25519 implementation of the X25519 encryption system

   SYNOPSIS
       Key generation:

              x25519-keypair 5>publickey 9>secretkey

       Shared-secret generation for Alice:

              x25519-dh 8<alicesecret 4<bobpublic 7>sharedsecret

   DESCRIPTION
       lib25519  is  an  implementation  of  the  X25519 encryption system and the Ed25519 signature system.  The command-line interface for lib25519 provides two X25519 tools, documented here, and three
       Ed25519 tools, documented separately.

       Each tool exits nonzero on failure (e.g., running out of memory), 0 on success.

       These tools allow lib25519 to be easily used from shell scripts.  Other languages can also use lib25519 via these tools, but languages typically have good support for FFI and can use the C  inter‐
       face directly.

   KEY GENERATION
       Alice runs the x25519-keypair command.  This command randomly generates Alice’s secret key and Alice’s corresponding public key.  It writes the public key to file descriptor 5, and then writes the
       secret key to file descriptor 9.

   SHARED-SECRET GENERATION
       Alice runs the x25519-dh command.  This command reads Alice’s secret key from file descriptor 8.  It then reads Bob’s public key from file descriptor 4.  It then writes a secret shared between Al‐
       ice and Bob to file descriptor 7.
