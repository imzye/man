NAME
       incrontab - table manipulator for inotify cron (incron)

SYNOPSIS
       incrontab [-u user] [-f config] file

       incrontab [-u user] [-f config] [-l | -r | -e | -t | -d]

DESCRIPTION
       incrontab  is a table manipulator for the inotify cron (incron) system.
       It creates, removes, modifies and lists user tables (incrontab(5)).

       Each user (including even system users without home directories) has an
       incron  table which can't be manipulated directly (only root can effec‐
       tively change these tables and is NOT recommended to do so).

       All informational messages of this program are printed to the  standard
       error output (stderr).

       If /etc/incron.allow exists only users listed here may use incron. Oth‐
       erwise if /etc/incron.deny exists only users NOT listed  here  may  use
       incron.  If  none  of  these  files  exists  everyone is allowed to use
       incron. (Important note: This behavior is insecure and will be probably
       changed  to be compatible with the style used by ISC Cron.) Location of
       these files can be changed in the configuration.

       The first form of this command imports a file, validates it and  stores
       to the table. "-" can be used for loading from the standard input.

       -u  (or  --user)  option overrides the current (real) user to the given
       one. This option is intended for manipulation with system users' tables
       (such as apache, postfix, daemon etc.). It can be used only if the cur‐
       rent user has root's effective rights.

       -l (or --list) option causes the current table is printed to the  stan‐
       dard output.

       -r  (or  --remove)  option  causes the current table (if any) is perma‐
       nently remove without any warning or confirmation. Use with caution!

       -e (or --edit) option causes executing an editor for editing  the  user
       table  (see  below for the information about editor selection). You can
       edit your incron table now. If the table is changed it stores the modi‐
       fied version.

       -t (or --types) option causes the list of supported event types (delim‐
       ited by commas) is printed to the  standard  output.  This  feature  is
       intended  for  front-end applications to find out which event types was
       compiled in.

       -d  (or  --reload)  option  causes  reloading  the  current  table   by
       incrond(8).  It  is  done through "touching" the table (writing into it
       without modifying it). This  feature  is  intended  e.g.  for  creating
       watches  on  newly  created  files (with already existing rules) or for
       rearming IN_ONESHOT watches.

       -f <FILE> (or --config=<FILE>) option specifies  another  location  for
       the configuration file (/etc/incron.conf is used by default). This fea‐
       ture requires root privileges.

       There is a few complex algorithm how to determine which editor will  be
       user for editing. If any of the following rule succeeds the appropriate
       editor is used:

       1. EDITOR environment variable

       2. VISUAL environment variable

       3. configuration value

       4. etc/alternatives/editor

       5. hard-wired editor (vim by default)

       It's not recommended to use graphical  editors  (such  as  gVim,  KEdit
       etc.) due to possible problems with connecting to the X server.
