LINUX USER'S GUIDE
       Make sure you're using the latest released version of ANT+minus.

       Make sure that the cp210x kernel module is loaded: "sudo modprobe cp210x". Verify by looking at non-empty output of "lsmod | grep cp210x".

       Make sure that the USB2ANT stick is connected to the machine.

       Make sure cp210x driver was assigned to your USB2ANT. Verify by "dmesg | grep tty" and look for a line similar to: "[ 3274.854726] usb 6-2: cp210x converter now attached  to  ttyUSB0".  Also  make
       sure "ls /dev/ttyUSB*" lists your device node.
