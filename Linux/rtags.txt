NAME
       rtags-rdm - manual page for RTags server

SYNOPSIS
       rtags-rdm [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       RTags  is a client/server application that indexes C/C++ code and keeps a persistent file-based database of references, declarations, definitions, symbolnames etc. There's also limited support for
       ObjC/ObjC++. It allows you to find symbols by name (including nested class and namespace scope). Most importantly we give you proper follow-symbol and find-references support. We  also  have  neat
       little  things  like  rename-symbol,  integration  with clang's "fixits" (http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html). We also integrate with flymake using clang's vastly superior errors and warnings.
       Since RTags constantly will reindex "dirty" files you get live updates of compiler errors and warnings. Since we already know how to compile your sources we have a way to quickly bring up the pre‐
       processed output of the current source file in a buffer.

       While existing taggers like gnu global, cscope, etags, ctags etc do a decent job for C they often fall a little bit short for C++. With its incredible lexical complexity, parsing C++ is an incred‐
       ibly hard task and we make no bones about the fact that the only reason we are able to improve on the current tools is because of clang (http://clang.llvm.org/). RTags is named RTags  in  recogni‐
       tion of Roberto Raggi on whose C++ parser we intended to base this project but he assured us clang was the way to go. The name stuck though.
