NAME
       AtteanX::Store::LMDB - LMDB-based RDF store

VERSION
       This document describes AtteanX::Store::LMDB version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use AtteanX::Store::LMDB;

DESCRIPTION
       AtteanX::Store::LMDB provides a persistent quad-store based on LMDB.

METHODS
       Beyond the methods documented below, this class inherits methods from the Attean::API::QuadStore class.

       "new ()"
           Returns a new LMDB-backed store object.

       "size"
           Returns the number of quads in the store.

       "get_quads ( $subject, $predicate, $object, $graph )"
           Returns a stream object of all statements matching the specified subject, predicate, object, and graph. Any of the arguments may be undef to match any value.

       "get_graphs"
           Returns an iterator over the Attean::API::Term objects comprising the set of graphs of the stored quads.

       "add_quad ( $quad )"
           Adds the specified $quad to the underlying model.

       "remove_quad ( $statement )"
           Removes the specified $statement from the underlying model.

       create_graph( $graph )
           This is a no-op function for the memory quad-store.

       drop_graph( $graph )
           Removes all quads with the given $graph.

       clear_graph( $graph )
           Removes all quads with the given $graph.
