IREXEC(1)                        User Commands                       IREXEC(1)

NAME
       irexec - run programs with one button press

SYNOPSIS
       irexec [options] [config_file]

DESCRIPTION
       irexec  executes  commands  on  an IR signal decoded by lircd, the LIRC
       daemon. It uses an lircrc config file where the  config =  entries  are
       executed. E. g., given the following config file snippet
           begin
               prog   = irexec
               button = KEY_RED
               config = echo "KEY_RED"
           end

       irexec  will echo KEY_RED on the terminal when the corresponding button
       is pushed on a remote. The command is an arbitrary shell  command  exe‐
       cuted asynchronously - irexec does not wait for it to complete.

ARGUMENTS
       config_file
           lircrc  configuration  file.  irexec  only uses entries with prog =
           irexec. The path defaults to ~/.config/lircrc.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display usage summary

       -v, --version
           Display version

       -d, --daemon
           Make irexec fork to background. In this case a config  file  should
           be  given  on  the command line as irexec won't be able to find any
           home directory.

       -D, --loglevel [level]
           Determine the amount of logging information. [level] can be a  sym‐
           bolic  syslog  level:  error,  warning, info, notice or debug. lirc
           also defines three additional levels trace, trace and trace2  which
           gives  even  more  messages (trace2 bringing the most). However, in
           the log these messages are marked as debug. By default, no  logging
           is done.

       -n, --name <name>
           Use  this  program name instead of the default irexec as identifier
           in the lircd.conf file.

ENVIRONMENT
       LIRC_SOCKET_PATH
           Path  to  the  lircd  socket  irexec  reads   from,   defaults   to
           /var/run/lirc/lircd.

FILES
       ~/.config/lircrc
           Default config file

       /etc/lirc/lircrc
           Config file used by the systemd irexec service.

       ~/.cache/irexec.log
           Debug  log.  Setting  the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable relo‐
           cates this file to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/irexec.log

NOTES
       For versions up to 0.9.1 irexec used to  wait until the  executed  pro‐
       gram  terminated.  Old  configuration  files thus often includes a  '&'
       appended to the command string to avoid being  stuck  in  the  command.
       This  is  not  required in 0.9.2+ which cannot wait for command comple‐
       tion.

       irexec should run as a service. The contrib directory contains a .desk‐
       top file which could be dropped in ~/.local/autostart. Doing so creates
       a service which can  be  handled  by  regular  desktop  tools  such  as
       gnome-tweak-tool  on all major desktops. If running restricted commands
       such as powering off the machine is required, sudo(8) can  be  used  to
       allow regular users to run such commands.

       An  alternative is to use the irexec.service systemd service which runs
       as root (and can run in parallel with the desktop service).  Running as
       root  has severe security implications.  See the Configuration Guide in
       the html documentation.
