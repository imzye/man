PKCSSLOTD(8)                     openCryptoki                     PKCSSLOTD(8)

NAME
       pkcsslotd - shared memory manager for opencryptoki

DESCRIPTION
       The  pkcsslotd  daemon  manages PKCS#11 objects between PKCS#11-enabled
       applications. When 2 or more processes are accessing the  same  crypto‐
       graphic token, the daemon is notified and updates each application when
       the token's objects change.

NOTES
       Only one instance of the pkcsslotd daemon  should  be  running  on  any
       given host. If a prior instance of pkcsslotd did not shut down cleanly,
       then it may leave an allocated shared memory segment on the system. The
       allocated memory segment can be identified by its key and can be safely
       removed once the daemon is stopped with the ipcrm command, such as:

       ipcrm -M 0x6202AB38

       The daemon creates the shared memory segment with  group  ownership  by
       the  pkcs11  group. All non-root users that should be able to use open‐
       Cryptoki need to be members of the group. Only trusted users should  be
       assigned  to  the group, see the "SECURITY NOTE" in the opencryptoki(7)
       manual page for details.
