NAME
       shoogle - command-line access to the Google API

SYNOPSIS
       shoogle -h

       shoogle show [--debug-request-level <n>] [--debug-response-level <n>] [<API-PATH>]

       shoogle execute [-c <CLIENT-SECRET-FILE>] [--credentials-file CREDENTIALS-FILE | --credentials-profile CREDENTIALS-PROFILE>] [-f <path>] <API-PATH> <JSON-FILE>

DESCRIPTION
       shoogle is a CLI tool which provides access to Google API functions.  It can be used to discover interfaces and methods, and to execute them.

   Parameters
       -h, –help
              Print command-line help information.

       show   List information about Google API Services, Resources, and methods.

       execute
              Execute a Google API method.

       JSON-FILE
              JSON-formatted file containing API request information.  See JSON-FILE for details.

       API_PATH
              The path specification for a Google API method.  See API-PATH for details.

   `Show' Command Options
       –debug-request-level <n>
              A non-negative integer indicating the recursion level for information output for method request documentation.

       –debug-response-level <n>
              A non-negative integer indicating the recursion level for information output for method response documentation.

   `Execute' Command Options
       -c <CLIENT-SECRET-FILE>, –client-secret-file <CLIENT-SECRET-FILE>
              A path to the client secret JSON file, to be used to start OAuth2 authentication.  See CLIENT-SECRET-FILE for details.

       -f <path>, –media-file <path>
              File to use for media-related operations.

       –credentials-file <CREDENTIALS-FILE>
              Select a specific set of established OAuth2 credentials.  See CREDENTIALS-FILE for details.

       –credentials-profile <CREDENTIALS-PROFILE>
              Select a profile for the OAuth2 credentials.  See CREDENTIALS-PROFILE for details.

   JSON-FILE
       The `shoogle show' command can show the request information needed for an API method.  This file contains the required input parameters for a method to be executed, in that format.

       A value of `-' indicates that the JSON information will be read from STDIN.

   API-PATH
       The “API Path” for an API method is of the form “SERVICE:VERSION.RESOURCE.METHOD”.

       For  the  `show' command, this parameter is optional, and may be truncated.  For instance, if it is omitted, a list of Services is shown.  If the method name is left off, a list of methods is
       shown.  For a full path, detail in the method inputs and outputs is shown.

       For the `execute' command, this defines the method to be called.

   CLIENT-SECRET-FILE
       The Client Secret JSON file contains user information for authorization.  It can be downloaded from the Google Console OAuth 2.0 Client ID page.  The client IDs are listed on the  Credentials
       page (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

   CREDENTIALS-FILE
       The CREDENTIALS-FILE contains the authorization tokens generated from a successful OAuth 2.0 executed transaction.  It allows authentication to succeed on subsequent calls without interaction
       by the user.

       By default, this file is stored in ~/.shoogle/credentials/<profile>/.  This option overrides that path.

       Typically, this option is not required.

   CREDENTIALS-PROFILE
       shoogle aggregates CREDENTIALS-FILEs by profile.  This option allows the profile name to be specified.  The default is “default”.

       Typically, this option is not required.

EXAMPLES
       List services:

              shoogle show

       List resources for a service:

              shoogle show urlshortener:v1.

       List methods for a resource:

              shoogle show urlshortener:v1.url

       List parameters and results for a method:

              shoogle show urlshortener:v1.url.list

       Call a method:

              echo '{}' | shoogle execute -c <secrets.json> urlshortener:v1.url.list -

       jq is a command-line JSON builder/parser.  This example shows how to upload a video from a JSON template and extract the ID from the response:

              $ cat upload-video.template.json
              {
                "part": "snippet",
                "body": {
                  "snippet": {
                    "title": $title,
                    "description": $description
                  }
                }
              }

              $ jq -n -f upload-video.template.json --arg title "Chess" --arg description "Norway Chess" |
                  shoogle execute -c your_client_id.json youtube:v3.videos.insert - -f chess.mp4 |
                  jq -r '.id'
