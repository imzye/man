WOL(1)                                                                                                wol                                                                                                WOL(1)

NAME
       wol - Wake On LAN client

SYNOPSIS
       wol [OPTION] ... MAC-ADDRESS ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual gives you an introduction into "wol", the Wake On LAN client.  It remotely turns on computers that supports Magic Packet technology (also known as Wake On LAN).

       Some workstations support SecureON password feature. These machines only wake up if you provide the correct password. "wol" also provides this feature.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Print a summary of the command line options.

       -V
       --version
           Print the version number of "wol".

       -h HOST
       --host=HOST
       -i HOST
       --ipaddr=HOST
           Broadcast packet to this IP address or hostname. This is important if your wol client is a multihomed host and you want to send only to one subnet (default IP address is 255.255.255.255).

       -b HOST
       --bind=HOST
           Bind to this IP address or hostname. This allows broadcasting on multihomed hosts by specifying the IP address of the desired outgoing interface.

       -p NUM
       --port=NUM
           Send packet with this destination port NUM. This option is important if your packet filter would block the default destination port 40000.

       -f FILE
       --file=FILE
           Read hardware addresses, IP addresses/hostnames, optional ports and SecureON password from file FILE. If FILE is - "wol" reads from stdin.

       -   Read hardware addresses, IP addresses, optional ports and optional SecureON password from stdin. So you can extract MAC-ADDRESSES from any source and pipe the data into "wol" so.

       -v
       --verbose
           Turns on verbose output.

       -w NUM
       --wait=NUM
           Waits NUM milliseconds between Magic Packets. Also known as fuse health pack.

       --passwd[=PASS]
           Send a magic packet with SecureON password feature. PASS is written as x-x-x-x-x-x, where x is a hexadecimal number between 0 and ff which represents one byte of the password.

           If you don't provide PASS "wol" prompts you for a password.

           To set the password of your SecureON capable NIC, you can use "ethtool" (<http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/>).
