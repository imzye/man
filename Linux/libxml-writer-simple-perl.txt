XML::Writer::Simple(3pm)                                                            User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                            XML::Writer::Simple(3pm)

NAME
       XML::Writer::Simple - Create XML files easily!

SYNOPSIS
           use XML::Writer::Simple dtd => "file.dtd";

           print xml_header(encoding => 'iso-8859-1');
           print para("foo",b("bar"),"zbr");

           # if you want CGI but you do not want CGI :)
           use XML::Writer::Simple ':html';

USAGE
       This module takes some ideas from CGI to make easier the life for those who need to generated XML code. You can use the module in three flavours (or combine them):

       tags
           When importing the module you can specify the tags you will be using:

             use XML::Writer::Simple tags => [qw/p b i tt/];

             print p("Hey, ",b("you"),"! ", i("Yes ", b("you")));

           that will generate

            <p>Hey <b>you</b>! <i>Yes <b>you</b></i></p>

       dtd You can supply a DTD, that will be analyzed, and the tags used:

             use XML::Writer::Simple dtd => "tmx.dtd";

             print tu(seg("foo"),seg("bar"));

       xml You can supply an XML (or a reference to a list of XML files). They will be parsed, and the tags used:

             use XML::Writer::Simple xml => "foo.xml";

             print foo("bar");

       partial
           You can supply an 'partial' key, to generate prototypes for partial tags construction. For instance:

             use XML::Writer::Simple tags => qw/foo bar/, partial => 1;

             print start_foo;
             print ...
             print end_foo;

       You can also use tagsets, where sets of tags from a well known format are imported. For example, to use HTML:

          use XML::Writer::Simple ':html';

EXPORT
       This module export one function for each element at the dtd or xml file you are using. See below for details.

FUNCTIONS
   import
       Used when you 'use' the module, should not be used directly.

   xml_header
       This function returns the xml header string, without encoding definition, with a trailing new line. Default XML encoding should be UTF-8, by the way.

       You can force an encoding passing it as argument:

         print xml_header(encoding=>'iso-8859-1');

   powertag
       Used to specify a powertag. For instance:

         powertag("ul","li");

         ul_li([qw/foo bar zbr ugh/]);

       will generate

         <ul>
          <li>foo</li>
          <li>bar</li>
          <li>zbr</li>
          <li>ugh</li>
         </ul>

       You can also supply this information when loading the module, with

         use XML::Writer::Simple powertags=>["ul_li","ol_li"];

       Powertags support three level tags as well:

         use XML::Writer::Simple powertags=>["table_tr_td"];

         print table_tr_td(['a','b','c'],['d','e','f']);

   quote_entities
       To use the special characters "<", ">" and "&" on your PCDATA content you need to protect them. You can either do that yourself or call this function.

          print f(quote_entities("a < b"));
