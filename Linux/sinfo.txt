NAME
       sinfod - a monitoring tool for networked computers

SYNOPSIS
       sinfod [-F] [-q] [-V] [-b #.#.#.#] [-c] [-n card ] [ -N nicevalue ] [ -m marker ] [ -i processname ] [-s][-W]

DESCRIPTION
       sinfod distributes system information to other sinfods on your local network.

       These Information include the system load, memory utilization and the `TOP-5' processes on every machine.

       It's main advantage is, that these informations are broadcasted using the udp(7) protocol.

       If  each  node  broadcasts  it's  information  in  a cooperative manner, the network load is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in your network.  Other systems to monitor your cluster load (e.g.
       rup(1) ) are using a polling scheme where every node has to ask every other node for the system information: In that case the network load is O(N**2).

       The task of sinfod is to broadcast the relevant information for the local node and to collect  broadcasts from other nodes.  Other programs ( sinfo(1) ) can get access to this  information  via  a
       simple tcp(7) connection that normally is routed through the local loopback interface.

OPTIONS
       -F/--foreground
              Unlike normal operation, sinfod will not detach from the terminal when given this option.  Some debugging informations will be visible.

       -q/--quiet
              Start quietly - for init scripts.

       -V/--version
              Print the version number and exit.

       -b #.#.#.#/--bcastaddress=#.#.#.#
              Set the broadcast address of the sinfod.  Default is 255.255.255.255.  In you want to run sinfod without a network card "-b 127.0.0.1" may be necessary.

       -c/--cmdline
              Broadcast the full command line of a process instead of the command only.

       -m marker/--marker=marker
              Mark the machine with a name. e.g. laboratory, pool or cluster.

       -i/--ignore <process>
              Don't broadcast any information on <process> ; --ignore may be set multiple times.

       -t/--top <count>
              Broadcast information on the top <count> processes; default: 5

       -n card/--networkcard=card
              Set the name of the network card whose informations will be broadcasted. (e.g. eth0).  Default is the network card that saw the most traffic at the start of sinfod.

       -N nicevalue/--nice=nicevalue
              Set the priority of this demon to nicevalue. Default is 15.

       -s/--spymode
              Deactivate the TCP interface and the collection of received packets.  The demon starts in a broadcast-only mode.

       -W/--watchdog
              Start with simple watchdog.
