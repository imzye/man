NAME
       CrossFire - a multiplayer adventure and arcade game server

SYNOPSIS
       crossfire-server [-<options>]

DESCRIPTION
       CrossFire is a multiplayer graphical arcade and adventure game, which has certain flavours from other games, especially Gauntlet (TM), NetHack, Moria, Angband, and Ragnarok.  Any number of players can
       move around in their own window, finding and using items and battling monsters.  They can choose to cooperate or compete in the same world.

       CrossFire runs as a client/server model. You will also need one of the clients to play. With them you can either connect to a server someone else has set up, or run your  own  server  and  connect  to
       that. At now clients exit for the X-Windows, GTK, Java, and Windows NT environment.

OPTIONS
       -csport <port number>
              Specifies the port to that should be used for the client/server connection.

       -d     Turns on some debugging.

       +d     Turns off debugging. Useful if DEBUG was defined at compile time.

       -detach
              This will run the server as a demon.

       -h     Prints out a list of server options.

       -log <file>
              Specifies a file to send output to.  Only has meaning if -detach is specified.

       -mon   Turns on monster-debugging.

       -o     Prints out info on what was defined at compile time.

       -s     Displays the highscore list.

       -score <name | class>
              Displays all highscores with matching name or class.

       -v     Prints out version and contributors.
