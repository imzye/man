NAME
       vcard2pal - convert vcard contacts into a pal calendar file

SYNOPSIS
       vcard2pal [filenames ...]

DESCRIPTION
       vcard2pal is a small awk script to convert vcard contacts into a calendar file for the pal calendar program.

USAGE
       Using vcard2pal is really simple, as it doesn't have any options.

       You feed it some vcard formatted contacts either on stdin or give it the filenames of files which it should read and put the output of the script into a file which you then give to pal.

       As vcard2pal needs no interactive input, you can also call it from cron or a makefile to always have an uptodate pal file generated from your contacts.

BUGS
       Please report bugs or fixes to Uli Martens <uli@youam.net>.
