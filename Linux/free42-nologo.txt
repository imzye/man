NAME
       free42bin - program to calculate the cool way

SYNOPSIS
       free42bin

DESCRIPTION
       Free42 is a re-implementation of the HP-42S calculator and the HP-82240 printer.  It is a complete rewrite, not using any HP code, and it does not require an HP-42S ROM image.

       Loading  and  saving  programs is possible in all Free42 versions except OS X Dashboard. The exact process is pretty straightforward in the desktop versions (Windows, OS X, Linux), but it is a bit
       more complicated on mobile devices.  vailable via the Info system.

                                                                                             November 14, 2013                                                                                 free42bin(1)
