KISSPARMS(8)             Linux System Managers Manual             KISSPARMS(8)

NAME
       kissparms - Configure KISS TNCs.

SYNOPSIS
       kissparms  [-c  crc-type]  -p  <port>  [-f y|n] [-h hw] [-l txtail] [-r
       pers] [-s slot] [-t txd] [-e feclevel] [-v] [-x] [-X raw]

DESCRIPTION
       Kissparms is used to dynamically configure KISS  TNCs  that  have  been
       setup for AX.25 use by kissattach.  This program uses the packet inter‐
       face to allow it to communicate with the KISS TNC without  interrupting
       the  AX.25 data stream. Therefore the KISS parameters may be set at any
       time during the operation of the AX.25 port.

       A full description of the KISS protocol can be found in  the  ARRL  6th
       Computer  Networking  Conference  papers  pp 38-43. While use of the Tx
       Tail value is now deprecated, it has been included to satisfy  the  re‐
       quirements of users of old TNC firmware.

       Although this utility was originally designed for controlling KISS TNCs
       connected to a serial port, it is used  by  a  number  of  other  Linux
       packet radio devices such as the Z8530 SCC driver for controlling their
       parameters in exactly the same manner. Therefore kissparms  functional‐
       ity extends to more than KISS TNCs.

OPTIONS
       -c crc-type Sets  the crc-type to use. For e.g. kernel mkiss: 0 = auto,
                   1 = none, 2 = flexnet, 3 = smack

       -p port     Sets the port that is being configured.

       -f y|n      This sets the TNC into either full duplex  ``y'',  or  half
                   duplex ``n'' mode.

       -h hardware This is used to set hardware specific parameters.

       -e FEC error correction level
                   Sets the FEC error correction level in a DSP card based mo‐
                   dem (KISS parameter 8). Larger correction level means  bet‐
                   ter  noise resistance, but slower throughput on a good con‐
                   nection. This is an experimental feature found  in  a  QPSK
                   modem  for  the  Motorola DSP56001 based DSP4 and EVM cards
                   only.

       -l txtail   Sets the TX Tail time in milliseconds. Note that  the  com‐
                   mand to the TNC only operates in steps of ten milliseconds,
                   so only use values like 10, 20 etc.

       -r persist  Sets the persist value. This parameter  is  scaled  to  the
                   range 0 to 255.

       -s slottime Sets the slottime in milliseconds. Note that the command to
                   the TNC only operates in steps of ten milliseconds, so only
                   use values like 10, 20 etc.

       -t txdelay  Sets the TX Delay in milliseconds. Note that the command to
                   the TNC only operates in steps of ten milliseconds, so only
                   use values like 10, 20 etc.

       -v          Display the version.

       -x          Takes  the  TNC out of KISS mode back into ``normal'' mode.
                   This command is manufacturer specific  but  works  in  many
                   cases.  This  option  overrides all options except the port
                   number.

       -Xraw       Sends the specified raw value to the kiss driver.
