NAME
       dump-acct - print an acct file in human-readable format.

SYNOPSIS
       dump-acct [-r|--reverse] [-R|--raw] [--format] version] [--byteswap] [--ahz] hertz] [-n|--num recs] [-h|--help] [ files]

DESCRIPTION
       dump-acct filename prints a list of all executed processes. This list is written by the kernel which must be compiled with BSD process accounting enabled (Debian kernel image have it already enabled).
       It must be started with accton(5).  Note that on Debian systems, this is ensured via the init script /etc/init.d/acct.

       All fields are separated by vertical line. Fields are: command, version, user time, system time, effective time, uid, gid, memory, io, pid, ppid, time.  User, system and effective times are ticks  per
       second. One tick is usually 1/50 of a second. The time field shows the start time of the process.

       The --raw switch, as well as the --format, --byteswap, and --ahz can be used as a handy format converter.
