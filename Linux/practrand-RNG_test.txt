NAME
       practrand-RNG_test - manual page for practrand-RNG_test using PractRand
       version 0.95

DESCRIPTION
       practrand-RNG_test  using  PractRand   version   0.95   syntax:   prac‐
       trand-RNG_test  RNG_name [options] or: practrand-RNG_test  (use no com‐
       mand line options to see brief overview) or: practrand-RNG_test  --help
       (to see this message) or: practrand-RNG_test --version  (to see version
       number) A command  line  tool  for  testing  RNGs  with  the  PractRand
       library.  RNG names:

              To use an external RNG, use stdin as an RNG name and pipe in the
              random numbers.  stdin8,  stdin16,  stdin32,  and  stdin64  also
              work,  each  interpretting the input in slightly different ways.
              Use stdin if you're uncertain how many bits the RNG produces  at
              a time, or if it's not one of those options.  The lowest quality
              recommended RNGs are sfc16 and  mt19937.   The  entropy  pooling
              RNGs  available are arbee and sha2_basd_pool.  Small recommended
              RNGs include sfc16, sfc32, sfc64, jsf32, jsf64, .

   threshold options:
              At most one threshold option should be specified.   The  default
              threshold  setting  is  '-e 0.1', alternatives are '-p 0.001' or
              '-a'

       -a     no threshold - display all test results.

       -e EXPECTED
              sets intelligent p-value thesholds to display an expected number
              of  test results equal to EXPECTED.  If EXPECTED is zero or less
              then intelligent p-value thresholds will be disabled EXPECTED is
              a float with default value 0.1

       -p THRESHOLD
              sets  simple  p-value  thresholds  to  display  any test results
              within THRESHOLD of an extrema.  If THRESHOLD is  zero  or  less
              then  simple  p-value thresholds will be disabled THRESHOLD is a
              float with recommended value 0.001

   test set options:
              The default test set options are '-tf 1' and '-te 0'

       -tf FOLDING
              FOLDING may be 0, 1, or 2.  0 means that the base tests are  run
              on  only the raw test data.  1 means that the base tests are run
              on the raw test data and also on a simple transform that  empha‐
              sizes the lowest bits.  2 means that the base tests are run on a
              wider variety of transforms of the test data.

       -te EXPANDED
              EXPANDED may be 0 or 1.  0 means that the base  tests  used  are
              the  normal  ones  for  PractRand, optimized for sensitivity per
              time.  1 means that the expanded test set is used, optimized for
              sensitivity  per  bit.  ... and now additional value(s) are sup‐
              ported.  Setting this to 10 will use an systematically expanding
              Birthday Spacings Test in place of a normal test set.  This test
              is separate because it uses too much memory to run  concurrently
              with other tests

   test target options:
              At most one test target option should be specified.  The default
              test target option is '-ttnormal'

       -ttnormal
              Test target: normal - the testing is done on the RNGs output.

       -ttseed64
              Test target: RNG seeding from 64 bit integers.  First,  the  RNG
              is  seeded  with a randomly chosen 64 bit integer.  Then 8 bytes
              of output are taken from the RNG and given to the  tests.   Then
              another  seed is chosen at a low hamming distance from the prior
              seed and another 8 bytes of RNG output are given to  the  tests.
              This  is  repeated indefinitely, with care taken to minimize the
              amount of duplicate seeds used.

       -ttep  Test target: Entropy pooling.  This should only be done on  RNGs
              that  support  entropy pooling.  It is similar to -ttseed64, but
              the entropy accumulation methods  are  used  instead  of  simple
              seeding, and the amount of entropy used is much larger.

       -walk_sequence
              Some test-target modes will search seeds sequentially, each sub‐
              sequent seed 1 higher than the previous.

       -walk_greycode
              Some test-target modes will search seeds in a  simple  greycoded
              sequence,  each  subsequent  seed at Hamming distance 1 from the
              prior in a strict order.

       -walk_random
              Some test-target modes will search seeds in a random walk,  each
              subsequent  seed  chosen at random from unused values at Hamming
              distance 1 from the prior value.

       -walk_random_l
              Some test-target modes will search seeds in a random walk,  each
              subsequent  seed  chosen at random from unused values at Hamming
              distance 1 from the prior value, but lower bits will be  changed
              much more often than higher bits.

       -walk_random_h
              Some  test-target modes will search seeds in a random walk, each
              subsequent seed chosen at random from unused values  at  Hamming
              distance 1 from the prior value, but higher bits will be changed
              much more often than lower bits.

   test length options:
       -tlmin LENGTH
              sets the minimum test length to LENGTH.  The tests will  run  on
              that  much  data  before  it starts printing regular results.  A
              large minimum will prevent it from  displaying  results  on  any
              test  lengths  other  than the maximum length (set by tlmax) and
              lengths that were explicitly requested (by tlshow).   See  notes
              on  lengths  for  details on how to express the length you want.
              The default minimum is 1.5 seconds (-tlmin 1.5s).

       -tlmax LENGTH
              sets the maximum test length to LENGTH.   The  tests  will  stop
              after  that  much data.  See notes on lengths for details on how
              to express the length you want.  The default maximum is 32  ter‐
              abytes (-tlmin 32TB).

       -tlshow  LENGTH  sets  an  additional point at which to display interim
              results.

              You can set multiple such points if desired.  These are in addi‐
              tion  to  the  normal interim results points, which are at every
              amount of data that is a power of 2 after the minimum and before
              the  maximum.   See  the  notes on lengths for details on how to
              express the lengths you want.

       -tlfail
              Halts testing after  interim  results  are  displayed  if  those
              results include any failures. (default)

       -tlmaxonly
              The opposite of -tlfail

   other options:
       -multithreaded
              enables  multithreaded  testing.  Typically up to 5 cores can be
              used at once.

       -singlethreaded disables multithreaded testing.
              (default)

       -seed SEED
              specifies a 64 bit integer to seed the tested RNG with.   If  no
              seed  is  specified  then  a  seed will be chosen randomly.  The
              value should be expressed in hexadecimal.  An '0x' prefix on the
              seed is acceptable but not necessary.

       -list_recommended_rngs
              List the names of all recommended PRNGs.

       -list_reference_rngs
              List  the  names of all PRNGs used Tests_results.txt.  These are
              (mostly) bad PRNGs used as a reference set for comparing differ‐
              ent PRNG test suites.

   notes on lengths:
       Each of the test length options requires a field named LENGTH.
              These fields

       can accept either an amount of time or an amount of data.
              In either case,

              several  types  of  units  are  supported.   A  time  should  be
              expressed as a number postfixed with either s, m, h,  or  d,  to
              express  a number of seconds, minutes, hours, or days.  example:
              -tlmin 1.4s (sets the minimum test length  to  1.4  seconds)  An
              amount  of data can be expressed as a number with no postfix, in
              which case the number will be treated as the log-based-2 of  the
              amount  of  bytes  to  test  (in  normal  target  mode)  or  the
              log-baed-2 of the number of seeds or strings to test  in  alter‐
              nate  test  target  modes.  example: -tlmin 23 (sets the minimum
              test length to 8 million bytes or 8

              million seeds, depending upon test target mode)

              Alternatively, an amount of data can be expressed  as  a  number
              followed  by  KB,  MB,  GB,  TB, or PB for kilobytes, megabytes,
              gigabytes, or petabytes.  example: -tlmin 14KB (sets the minimum
              test  length  to 14 kilobytes If the B is omitted on KB, MB, GB,
              TB, or PB then it treat the metric prefixes as refering to  num‐
              bers of bytes in normal test target mode, or numbers of seeds in
              seeding test target mode, or numbers of strings in entropy pool‐
              ing  test  target  mode.   example: -tlmin 40M (sets the minimum
              test length to ~40 million bytes or ~40

              million seeds, depending upon test target mode)

              A minor detail: I use the de facto standard (in  which  K  means
              1024 when dealing with quantities of binary information) not the
              official standard (in which K means 1000 no matter what is being
              dealt with unless an 'i' follows the 'K').
