NAME
       backend-spec - interface between jw and its backends

DESCRIPTION
       jw(1) calls backends like backends/html to do the "real" conversion work. The backend gets all necessary data delivered via environment variables ready to use.

       This documentation describes those environment variables.

       The backend is run in the directory where the output files are to be created. It should return 0 if there weren't any problem, and return a positive value otherwise.
