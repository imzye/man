NAME
       king - interactive system for three-dimensional vector graphics

SYNOPSIS
       king [options] [input file(s)]

DESCRIPTION
       KiNG (Kinemage, Next Generation) is an interactive system for three-dimensional vector graphics. It supports a set of graphics primitives that make it suitable for many types of graphs, plots, and
       other  illustrations; although its first use was to display macromolecular structures for biophysical research. KiNG builds on Mage, JavaMage, and the "kinemage" (kinetic image) concept to deliver
       a full-featured Java application with a user-friendly interface and integrated editing features. The KiNG jar file can be used within a web page as a Java applet or Java object to promote easy ac‐
       cess to kinemages or coordinate files from a web browser.

OPTIONS
       -version
              Print version information.

       -m[erge]
              Merge all input files into one kinemage.

       -s[ingle]
              Keep all input kin or structure files into separate kinemages.

       -phenix
              Use Phenix colors for electron density files entered on command line.

INPUT FILES
       KiNG accepts kinemage, PDB, mmCIF, or electron density files as input.
