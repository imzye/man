NAME
       djinn - generate Haskell expressions from types

SYNOPSIS
       djinn [OPTION ... ] [FILE ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Djinn uses a theorem prover for intuitionistic propositional logic to generate a Haskell expression when given a type.

       Given a type the program will deduce an expression of this type, if one exists. If the Djinn says the type is not realizable it is because there is no (total) expression of the given type.

OPTIONS
       [-|+]multi          Print multiple solutions.

       [-|+]sorted         Sort solutions.

       [-|+]debug          Debug mode.

SEE ALSO
       The program provides interactive documentation.
