NAME
       radecode - tshark-like decode of argus(1) user data

SYNOPSIS
       radecode -r argusFlowFile

DESCRIPTION
       Radecode is a perl script that uses text2pcap(1) and tshark(1) from the
       wireshark(1) distribution to decode TCP and UDP  flow  associated  user
       data  from an argus flow capture file.  You must enable argus user data
       capture with the -U nnnn option or there will be no data to decode. Due
       to  limitations  in  test2pcap  only TCP and UDP flows are decoded. The
       other flow data are silently ignored.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the source file name all ra(1) options are available but
       may not make sense.
