NAME
       tahoe - Secure distributed file store.

SYNOPSIS
       tahoe [global-options] <command> [command-options]

DESCRIPTION
       Tahoe-LAFS  is a Free and Open decentralized cloud storage system.  It distributes your data across multiple servers.  Even if some of the servers fail or are taken over by an attacker, the entire
       file store continues to function correctly, preserving your privacy and security.

       The "tahoe" executable can be used to create and manage client/server nodes, manipulate the file store, and perform several debugging/maintenance tasks.

       Please have a look at the 'SEE ALSO' section at the end of this manual page for pointers to further instructions.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       -d, --node-directory=
              Specify which Tahoe node directory should be used. The directory should either contain a full Tahoe node, or a file named node.url that points to some other Tahoe node. It should also  con‐
              tain a file named 'private/aliases' which contains the mapping from alias name to root dirnode URI. [default for most commands: '$HOME/.tahoe']

       --eliot-destination=
              Add an Eliot logging destination.  May be given more than once.

       --help Display help and exit.

       --help-eliot-destinations
              Emit usage information for --eliot-destination.

       -q, --quiet
              Operate silently.

       -V, --version
              Display version numbers.

       --wormhole-invite-appid=
              The appid to use on the wormhole server.  [default: tahoe-lafs.org/invite]

       --wormhole-server=
              The magic wormhole server to use. [default: ws://wormhole.tahoe-lafs.org:4000/v1]

COMMANDS
       The tahoe runner can be used for various tasks depending on the command used:

       tahoe COMMAND [OPTION]... [NODEDIR]

ADMINISTRATION
       Create node configurations and securely invite clients to a grid.

   COMMANDS
       create-node
              Create a node that acts as a client, server or both.

       create-client
              Create a client node (providing storage to others initially disabled).

       create-introducer
              Create  an  introducer node.  When the grid is large or very dynamic, introducers make it easier for clients to connect.  See "Static Server Definitions" in the documentation on how to con‐
              figure clients to connect to one or more storage servers without using an introducer.

       invite Invite a new node to a grid.  See "Magic Wormhole Invites" in the documentation.

   OPTIONS
       -C, --basedir=
              Same as the global --node-directory option.

       -n, --nickname=
              Specify the nickname for this node (create-node and create-client only).

       -i, --introducer=
              Specify the introducer FURL to use (create-node and create-client only).

       --hostname=
              Hostname to automatically set --location/--port when --listen=tcp (the default).

       -p, --webport=
              Specify which TCP port to run the HTTP interface on.  Use 'none' to disable.  Default: 'tcp:3456:interface=127.0.0.1' (create-node and create-client only).

       --no-storage
              Do not offer storage service to other nodes (create-node only).

CONTROLLING NODES
       In the past, the 'tahoe' command offered service watching (with start, restart, stop commands), but this was not very portable and has been deprecated.

   COMMANDS
       run    Run a node without daemonizing.  This is the only command for running nodes.

   OPTIONS
       --allow-stdin-close
              Do not exit when stdin closes ("tahoe run" otherwise will exit).  This is required for some service runners (like systemd, for example).

       -C, --basedir=
              Same as the global --node-directory option.

       --help Display help and exit.  This includes lots of 'twistd-options' for debugging, logging, profiling, et cetera that are left out of this manual page for brevity.

USING THE FILE STORE
       All the following commands require pointing tahoe to a running client node with the '--node-directory' ('-d') option (or, alternatively, using the default location).

       Please run 'tahoe COMMAND --help' for more details on each command.

   COMMANDS
       mkdir  Create a directory and return its capability ("dircap").

       add-alias
              Add an alias for an existing cap.

       create-alias
              Create an alias pointing to a new cap.

       list-aliases
              List all alias caps.

       ls     List a directory.

       get    Retrieve a file from the grid.

       put    Upload a file into the grid.

       cp     Copy one or more files or directories.

       unlink Unlink a file or directory on the grid.

       rm     Same as unlink.

       mv     Move a file within the grid.

       ln     Make an additional link to an existing file or directory.

       backup Make target dir look like local dir.

       webopen
              Open a web browser to a grid file or directory.

       manifest
              List all files/directories in a subtree.

       stats  Print statistics about all files/directories in a subtree.

       check  Check a single file or directory.

       deep-check
              Check all files/directories reachable from a starting point.

DEBUGGING
       The following commands are useful for developers and for troubleshooting.

       tahoe debug SUBCOMMAND [OPTION]... [PARAMETER]...
