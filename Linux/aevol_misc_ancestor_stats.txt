NAME
       Aevol - an in silico experimental evolution platform

SYNOPSIS
       aevol_misc_ancestor_stats -h | --help
       aevol_misc_ancestor_stats -V | --version
       aevol_misc_ancestor_stats LINEAGE_FILE [-FMv]

DESCRIPTION
       Aevol  is  a simulation platform that allows one to let populations of digital organisms evolve in different conditions and study experimentally the mechanisms responsible for the structuration of the
       genome and the transcriptome.

       aevol_misc_ancestor_stats
              issues statistics for the line of descent described in LINEAGE_FILE.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              print help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -F, --full-check
              perform genome checks whenever possible

       -M, --trace-mutations
              outputs the fixed mutations (in a separate file)

       -v, --verbose
              be verbose
