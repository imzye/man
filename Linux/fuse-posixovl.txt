NAME
       posixovl -- FUSE file system that provides POSIX functionality

SYNOPSIS
           mount.posixovl [-F] [-S SOURCE_DIR] TARGET_DIR [-- fuseopts]

DESCRIPTION
       If no source directory is given, the TARGET_DIR specifies both source and target (mount point), yielding an "over mount".

       Supports: chmod, chown, hardlink, mkfifo, mknod, symlink/readlink ACLs/xattrs (only in passthrough mode, no emulation).

NOTES
       Using posixovl on an already POSIX-behaving file system (e.g. XFS) incurs some issues, since detecting whether a path is POSIX behaving or not is difficult. Hence, the following decision was made:

           - permissions will be set to the default permissions (see below) unless
             a HCB is found that can override these
           - all lower-level files will be operated on/created with the user who
             initiated the mount

       If no HCB exists for a file or directory, the default permissions are 644 and 755, respectively. The owner and group of the inode will be the owner/group of the real file.

       Each non-regular, non-directory virtual file will have a zero-size real file. Simplifies handling, and makes it apparent the object exists when using other operating system.

       Command df(1) will show:

           $ df -Tah
           File System    Type    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
           /dev/hda5     vfat    5.9G  2.1G  3.9G  35% /windows/D
           posix-overlay(/windows/D)
                fuse.posixovl    5.9G  2.1G  3.9G  35% /windows/D

OPTIONS
       -F  Option -F will disable permission and ownership checks that would be required in case you have a POSIX mount over VFAT. For example, where /vfat is vfat, and /vfat/xfs is a POSIX-behaving file
           system.

EXAMPLES
       In  general,  posixovl  does  not handle case-insensitivity of the underlying file system (in case of VFAT, for example). If you create a file X0 on VFAT, it is usually lowercased to x0, which may
       break some software, namely X.org. In order to make VFAT behave more POSIX-like, the following mount options are recommended:

           mount -t vfat /dev/sda5 /mnt/vfat -o check=s,shortname=mixed

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.
