NAME
       nxtrc - a program to interact with LEGO NXT via BlueTooth

SYNOPSIS
       nxtrc [-s]

       nxtrc [-a ADDR] [-v] command

DESCRIPTION
       NXTRC (NXT Remote Command) is a small program that allows to send various commands to a LEGO Mindstorm NXT Brick. It uses the Bluetooth protocol through the Bluez libraries.

       The  option  -s starts a scan to find BlueTooth devices. If a BT address is given in the command line or is in the Environment Variable BTADDR it connects to the NXT and performs the task specified in
       <command>. The first time you connect with a device you need to exchange a password, this task is usually done by the Operative System BlueTooth Management (as Kbluetooth under KDE).

COMMANDS and OPTIONS
       -a     BlueTooth Address of the NXT, required if BTADDR Environment Variable is not set to the address

       -b     Get Battery Level

       -d  FILE
              Delete FILE frome NXT

       -h     display a short help text

       -i     Get info on NXT brick

       -k     Stop a program running on NXT

       -l[PATT]
              List files on NXT brick matching PATTern if present (e.g. -l*.rxe) N.B. No spaces between -l and PATT! see at the end the patterns allowed

       -m  FILE
              Play sound file FILE once

       -M  FILE
              Play sound file FILE indefinitely

       -n  NAME
              Set NXT name to NAME

       -p  FILE
              Run Program FILE on NXT

       -r  FILE
              Read FILE frome NXT and save it in the working directory if FILE is already present ask for permission to overwrite

       -v     Be verbose. This is the only option that can be given with another command.  It's not always very useful....

       -w  FILE
              Write FILE on NXT, If FILE is already present ask for permission to overwrite

       -W  FILE
              Same as -w forcing overwrite if FILE exists

       -z     Stop Sound Playback

File Names and Patterns
       On the NXT File names are of the form "Name.Ext" with max 15 characters for the Name and 3 for the Extension. When asking a listing with the -l command you can give a specific file name to see if it's
       on  the  NXT  and  list its size, or a Pattern using widlcards. Due to the limitation of the NXT API patterns are limited to the form "*.ext", "Name.*" or "*.*" this last one is the default and can be
       omitted.

EXAMPLES
       scan for devices
           $ nxtrc -s
            00:10:20:30:40:50  NXT1
            00:01:01:02:03:04  NXT2

       set up Environment Variable for connection with NXT1 and ask for info
           $ export BTADDR=00:10:20:30:40:50
           $ nxtrc -i

       load program Prog.rxe on  NXT1 and run it
           $ nxtrc -W Prog.rxe
           $ nxtrc -p Prog.rxe

EXIT STATUS
       nxtrc returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is returned in case of failure.
