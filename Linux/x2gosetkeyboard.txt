NAME
       x2gosetkeyboard - Allow server-side Keyboard Setting Updates issued by X2Go Client

SYNOPSIS
       x2gosetkeyboard

DESCRIPTION
       x2gosetkeyboard looks for a 'keyboard' file in the X2Go session directory and introspects the X2Go session keyboard settings requested from the client side.

       If no 'keyboard' file is present in the X2Go session directory, nothing happens (i.e. no error will be raised).

RETURN VALUES
       If x2gosetkeyboard successfully sets the session's keyboard parameters an exit code of 0 is returned. Also, if the file ${HOME}/.x2go/C-${X2GO_SESSION}/keyboard is not presented at the expected
       location, a zero-exitcode is returned.

       If the command fails on its way, then the exitcode of the failing command is returned.

FILES
       ${HOME}/.x2go/C-${X2GO_SESSION}/keyboard
