NAME
       condor_sos - HTCondor Manual

       Issue a command that will be serviced with a higher priority

SYNOPSIS
       condor_sos [-help | -version ]

       condor_sos [-debug ] [-timeoutmult value] condor_command

DESCRIPTION
       condor_sos sends the condor_command in such a way that the command is serviced ahead of other waiting commands. It appears to have a higher priority than other waiting commands.

       condor_sos is intended to give administrators a way to query the condor_schedd and condor_collector daemons when they are under such a heavy load that they are not responsive.

       There must be a special command port configured, in order for a command to be serviced with priority. The condor_schedd and condor_collector always have the special command port. Other daemons require
       configuration by setting configuration variable <SUBSYS>_SUPER_ADDRESS_FILE.

OPTIONS
          -help  Display usage information

          -version
                 Display version information

          -debug Print extra debugging information as the command executes.

          -timeoutmult value
                 Multiply any timeouts set for the command by the integer value.

EXAMPLES
       The example command

          condor_sos -timeoutmult 5 condor_hold -all

       causes the condor_hold -all command to be handled by the condor_schedd with priority over any other commands that the condor_schedd has waiting to be serviced. It also extends any set  timeouts  by  a
       factor of 5.

EXIT STATUS
       condor_sos will exit with the value 1 on error and with the exit value of the invoked command when the command is successfully invoked.
