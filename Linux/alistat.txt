NAME
       alistat - show statistics for a multiple alignment file

SYNOPSIS
       alistat [options] alignfile

DESCRIPTION
       alistat reads a multiple sequence alignment from the file alignfile in any supported format (including SELEX, GCG MSF, and CLUSTAL), and shows a number of simple statistics about it.  These statistics
       include the name of the format, the number of sequences, the total number of residues, the average and range of the sequence lengths, the alignment length (e.g. including gap characters).

       Also shown are some percent identities. A percent pairwise alignment identity is defined as (idents / MIN(len1, len2)) where idents is the number of exact identities and len1, len2 are  the  unaligned
       lengths  of  the  two  sequences. The "average percent identity", "most related pair", and "most unrelated pair" of the alignment are the average, maximum, and minimum of all (N)(N-1)/2 pairs, respec‐
       tively.  The "most distant seq" is calculated by finding the maximum pairwise identity (best relative) for all N sequences, then finding the minimum of these N numbers (hence, the  most  outlying  se‐
       quence).

OPTIONS
       -a     Show additional verbose information: a table with one line per sequence showing name, length, and its highest and lowest pairwise identity. These lines are prefixed with a * character to enable
              easily grep'ing them out and sorting them. For example, alistat -a foo.slx | grep * | sort -n +3 gives a ranked list of the most distant sequences in the alignment.  Incompatible  with  the  -f
              option.

       -f     Fast;  use  a  sampling  method  to  estimate the average %id.  When this option is chosen, alistat doesn't show the other three pairwise identity numbers.  This option is useful for very large
              alignments, for which the full (N)(N-1) calculation of all pairs would be prohibitive (e.g. Pfam's GP120 alignment, with over 10,000 sequences). Incompatible with the -a option.

       -h     Print brief help; includes version number and summary of all options, including expert options.

       -q     be quiet - suppress the verbose header (program name, release number and date, the parameters and options in effect).

       -B     (Babelfish). Autodetect and read a sequence file format other than the default (FASTA). Almost any common sequence file format is recognized (including Genbank, EMBL, SWISS-PROT, PIR,  and  GCG
              unaligned sequence formats, and Stockholm, GCG MSF, and Clustal alignment formats). See the printed documentation for a complete list of supported formats.

EXPERT OPTIONS
       --informat <s>
              Specify that the sequence file is in format <s>, rather than the default FASTA format.  Common examples include Genbank, EMBL, GCG, PIR, Stockholm, Clustal, MSF, or PHYLIP; see the printed doc‐
              umentation for a complete list of accepted format names.  This option overrides the default format (FASTA) and the -B Babelfish autodetection option.
