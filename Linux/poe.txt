NAME
       Poe - a vorbis comment editor

SYNOPSIS
       Poe

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the Poe command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       Poe is a vorbis comment editor. It tries to follow the vorbis comment header specification closely, while being convenient and flexible to use.  Towards that
       end,  it doesn't have a static 'form' style interface. Instead, it has an editable table of comments. The contents of the table change dependent upon prefer‐
       ence settings, and what comments are in the ogg file you are editing.

SEE ALSO
       GNUstep(7).
