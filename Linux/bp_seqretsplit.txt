NAME
       bp_seqretsplit - split a sequence (or stream) into a single file per sequence

SYNOPSIS
         bp_seqretsplit file1 file2 ..
         # or
         bp_seqretsplit < file1

DESCRIPTION
       The script will split all sequences from fasta file(s) (or stdin) to individual files. The filename is the sequence ID (everything before the 1st whitespace in a FASTA header).  Currently it doesn't
       check to see that it isn't overwriting an existing file so IDs should be unique

       This is inspired by EMBOSS seqretsplit tool.
