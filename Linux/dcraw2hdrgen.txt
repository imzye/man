NAME
       dcraw2hdrgen - Parse information in given Digital Camera RAW files and output a hdrgen script for generation of HDR images.

SYNOPSIS
       dcraw2hdrgen <file1.cr2> [<file2.cr2>...]

DESCRIPTION
       This program can be used to automatically create an hdrgen script for use with software creating HDR images. The exposure information is extracted from RAW files using the `dcraw` tool.

       If this script doesn't recognise the exposure settings from the images taken by your camera, please verify if dcraw supports your camera: `dcraw -i -v your_image.cr2`. You should see a detailed infor‐
       mation on shot settings including exposure time. Maybe compiling the newest version will help.

EXAMPLES
       dcraw2hdrgen IMG_0001.CR2 IMG_0002.CR2 IMG_0003.CR2 > sample.hdrgen

              Creates a sample.hdrgen script for given images.
