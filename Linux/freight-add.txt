NAME
       freight-add - add a package to Freight

SYNOPSIS
       freight add [-c conf] [-v] [-h] package manager/distro[/component][...]

DESCRIPTION
       freight-add  registers  package  with  one  or  more  manager/distro[/component]  pairs  (or  triples).  Currently,  apt  is  the only supported manager and package must be one of *.deb, *.ddeb, *.dsc
       *.debian.tar.gz *.orig.tar.gz, *.dsc *.diff.gz *.orig.tar.gz, or *.dsc *.tar.gz. distro may be any arbitrary value but is best suited to naming a particular version of the target operating system (for
       example, "wheezy" or "precise"). component is optional and for apt defaults to main.

       The package files are organized in the Freight library so freight-cache(1) has an easy time of creating package repositories for each manager/distro[/component] later.
