Data::Format::HTML(3pm)                                                             User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                             Data::Format::HTML(3pm)

NAME
       Data::Format::HTML - Format Perl data structures into simple HTML

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::Format::HTML;

        my $f = Data::Format::HTML->new;

        my %hash = (simple => 'hash');

        # Of course it's very unlikely that you won't deal ever with this
        # kind of structure, but HTML is able to hand it all anyway :)
        my $struct = {
               foo                             => 'bar',
               1                                       => 2,
               \'hello'                        => 'goodbye',
               array_ref                       => [qw/one two three/],
               nested_hash                     => \%hash,
               [qw/1 2/]                       => sub { die; },
               even_more                       => { arr => {
                               1 => [2, 3, 4],
                               this_is_insane => { a => { b => { c => { d => { e => 'z'}}}}}
                       },
               },
        };

        $struct->{'Data::Format::HTML handles it all'} = $f;

        print $f->format( $struct );

       And that will output the following insane, but possible, for the sake of showing, HTML:

       In theory you can pass any kind of Perl data structure to "format" and you will get its data HTML-formatted.

TODO
       •   A LOT. ;)

       •   Explain how CSS can prettify the tables (specification for everything)

       •   Get CSS.

       •   Better support for GLOB, CODE, REF and company.

       •   Extend this documentation.
