NAME
       audisp-syslog - plugin to push audit events into syslog

SYNOPSIS
       audisp-syslog [ OPTIONS ]

DESCRIPTION
       audisp-syslog is a plugin for the audit event dispatcher that wraps au‐
       dit events back around to syslog. It can be passed three  options:  one
       which  is  the  syslog  facility, one that is the syslog level that all
       events are logged with, and one that determines if events should be in‐
       terpreted. Valid facilities are LOG_LOCAL0 through 7, LOG_AUTH, LOG_AU‐
       THPRIV, LOG_DAEMON, LOG_SYSLOG, and LOG_USER. Valid levels are  LOG_DE‐
       BUG  through  LOG_EMERG.  Setting these options is done in the /etc/au‐
       dit/syslog.conf file on the args line.

       If it is desired that events are interpreted, add the word interpret to
       the  args line. This will cause all events to be interpreted. The draw‐
       back to this approach is that naive parsers can be tricked by an adver‐
       sary  that has the ability to name files, processes, or other user con‐
       trolled objects.

       If you are aggregating multiple machines, you should  edit  auditd.conf
       to  set  the  name_format to something meaningful and the log_format to
       enriched. This way you can tell where the event came from and have  the
       user  name and groups resolved locally before it is sent off of the ma‐
       chine.
