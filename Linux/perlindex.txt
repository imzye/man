NAME
       perlindex - index and query perl manual pages

SYNOPSIS
           perlindex -index

           perlindex tell me where the flowers are

DESCRIPTION
       ""perlindex -index"" generates an AnyDBM_File index which can be searched with free text queries ""perlindex" a verbose query".

       Each word of the query is searched in the index and a score is generated for each document containing it. Scores for all words are added and the documents with the highest score are printed.  All
       words are stemed with Porters algorithm (see Text::English) before indexing and searching happens.

       The score is computed as:

           $score{$document} += $tf{$word,$document}/$maxtf{$document}
                                * log ($N/$n{$word});

       where

       $N        is the number of documents in the index,

       $n{$word} is the number of documents containing the word,

       $tf{$word,$document}
                 is the number of occurrences of word in the document, and

       $maxtf{$document}
                 is the maximum frequency of any word in document.

FILES
       The index will be generated in your man directory. Strictly speaking in "$Config{man1direxp}/.."

           The following files will be generated:

           index_fn           # docid -> (max frequency, filename)
           index_idf          # term  -> number of documents containing term
           index_if           # term  -> (docid, frequency)*
           index_seen         # fn    -> indexed?
