NAME
       fence_virtd - Fencing host for virtual machines

DESCRIPTION
       fence_virtd is a host daemon designed to route fencing requests for virtual machines.

       Fence_virt and fence_xvm talk to fence_virtd, which supports multiple backend plugins, including:
        - libvirt for single-node operation
        - Corosync CPG and libvirt when using Linux-cluster release 3.0.0 or later
        - libvirt-qpid for multi-node, non-cluster operation

       For compatibility, fence_xvm from linux-cluster release 2 may talk to fence_virtd.

       fence_virtd accepts a few options on the command line, but most options are read from fence_virt.conf.

PARAMETERS
       -d     Specify debug level, e.g. "-d99"

       -c     Interactively prompt user for configuration information

       -f     Specify an alternate configuration file instead of /etc/fence_virt.conf

       -F     Do not fork into background after starting (overrides any setting in fence_virt.conf)

       -w     Wait for backend to be available (overrides any setting in fence_virt.conf)

       -p     Specify the full path to the pid file used to record the active process pid.
