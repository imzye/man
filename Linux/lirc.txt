NAME
       lircrc - application-specific remotes signals configuration

DESCRIPTION
       lircrc  is the last LIRC configuration point in the flow of events from the kernel to the application. It provides a way to translate the application-agnostic events which lircd makes available on
       /var/run/lirc/lircd to application-specific strings.  The translation is invoked by LIRC-aware applications by using the the lirc_code2char() routine in the lirc_client library.

       The lircrc event mapping is not only mapping from a remote event to an application string. It also supports a variety of functionality such as repeat suppression, modes, long keypresses and button
       sequences.

       The default location for lircrc is ~/.config/lircrc with a global fallback in /etc/lirc/lircrc. Many applications which uses the lircrc translations have private locations for the file.

       The programmatic interface to the lircrc functionality is described in the Client API manual, see below

       The file format is described in the configuration manual, see below.
