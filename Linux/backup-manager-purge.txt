NAME
       backup-manager-purge - backup-manager's wrapper for outdating files

SYNOPSIS
       backup-manager-purge [TTL] <options>

DESCRIPTION
       backup-manager-purge is the only authorized entity that can say if an
       archive should be purged or not. Any tasks used by backup-manager may
       have to know if an archive is deprecated (eg: the purging phase of an
       upload method). This tool is here to fulfill that need.

       Given a time to live (TTL) and a list of archives, backup-manager-purge
       will return another list of archives, corresponding to the ones that
       are outdated by the TTL.

REQUIRED ARGS
       --ttl=time-to-live
           Specify the time to live (in days) for the archives. Any archive
           that is older than ttl days will be outdated.

OPTIONAL ARGS
       --files-from=file
           A file containing a list of archives to parse, one archive per
           line.  If this option is not used, STDIN will be used for catching
           the files to parse.

RETURN
       backup-manager-purge will return the list of outdated files on STDOUT,
       one file per line.

ERROR CODES
       If an error occurs, it will print the error message on stderr and will
       exit with an error code greater than 0.

       Here are the possible error codes:

       bad command line (wrong arguments) : 10
       internal error (should be reported as a bug) : 20
