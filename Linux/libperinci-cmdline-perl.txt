NAME
       Perinci::CmdLine::Manual::HowTo::Debugging - How-to guides related to debugging

VERSION
       This document describes version 2.000.1 of Perinci::CmdLine::Manual::HowTo::Debugging (from Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine), released on 2024-11-12.

DESCRIPTION
       If you encounter issues with Perinci::CmdLine, you can try these things to aid with debugging:

       Increase log level. Perinci::CmdLine uses Log::ger. If your command-line object is instantiated with "log" attribute set to true, you just need to specify "--verbose", "--debug", or "--trace"
       command-line options to see more logging statements:

        % your-cli --verbose ...
        % your-cli --debug ...
        % your-cli --trace ...
        % your-cli --log-level trace ... ;# ditto

       If your command-line object is not instantiated with "log" attribute set to true, you can enable logging with:

        % PERL5OPT=-MLog::ger::Screen LOG_LEVEL=info your-cli ...
        % PERL5OPT=-MLog::ger::Screen DEBUG=1 your-cli ...
        % PERL5OPT=-MLog::ger::Screen TRACE=1 your-cli ...

       Dump parsed arguments, internal data structures. If seeing log statements does not give clue, you can try dumping various data structures. This can be done with plugins. For example, to dump
       parsed command-line arguments after validation and then exit, you can use the following command (setting log level to trace is helpful to see the program flow and at what points the plugins are
       triggered):

        % PERINCI_CMDLINE_PLUGINS=-DumpArgs,-Exit@after_validate_args your-cli --trace ...

       Logging other components. See Log::ger::For::LWP, Log::ger::For::HTTP::Tiny, Log::ger::For::DBI, Log::ger::DBI::Query.

CONTRIBUTING
       To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on GitHub.

       Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can simply modify the code, then test via:

        % prove -l

       If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla, Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
       Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be
       reported to me.
