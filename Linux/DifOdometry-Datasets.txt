NAME
       DifOdometry-Datasets - DIFODO (visual odometry method) from datasets

SYNOPSIS
       DifOdometry-Datasets  [-h] [-c] [-cc ] [-s]

DESCRIPTION
       This GUI application is designed to test the performance of DIFODO (visual odometry method) with the datasets of TUM.  Only the ground truth and the depth images are used.

       A config file can be used to customize the most important parameters of the method (there is an embedded config file that is loaded by default but you should at least change the rawlog file path).
