NAME
       pathogen - Puzzle game about matching 3D model structures

SYNOPSIS
       pathogen

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pathogen command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       Pathogen  Warrior is a puzzle game about matching 3D model structures with a 2D hexagon map. It was one of the entrants to the 4th Ludum Dare 48-hour game development competition. The theme of the
       competition was "Infection". In Pathogen Warrior, the player's task is to match rotating 3D pathogen structures with a 2D model using a hexagon map. The time to accomplish the task is limited, and
       after successfully completing one pathogen, the player is advanced to next level, which has a more challenging pathogen.
