Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate(3pm)                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                  Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate(3pm)

NAME
       Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate -- go from cardinal number (3) to ordinal ("3rd")

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate;
         print ordinate(4), "\n";
          # prints 4th
         print ordinate(-342), "\n";
          # prints -342nd

         # Example of actual use:
         ...
         for(my $i = 0; $i < @records; $i++) {
           unless(is_valid($record[$i]) {
             warn "The ", ordinate($i), " record is invalid!\n";
             next;
           }
           ...
         }

DESCRIPTION
       There are two kinds of numbers in English -- cardinals (1, 2, 3...), and ordinals (1st, 2nd, 3rd...).  This library provides functions for giving the ordinal form of a number, given its cardinal
       value.

FUNCTIONS
       ordinate(SCALAR)
           Returns a string consisting of that scalar's string form, plus the appropriate ordinal suffix.  Example: "ordinate(23)" returns "23rd".

           As a special case, "ordinate(undef)" and "ordinate("")" return "0th", not "th".

           This function is exported by default.

       th(SCALAR)
           Merely an alias for "ordinate", but not exported by default.

       ordsuf(SCALAR)
           Returns just the appropriate ordinal suffix for the given scalar numeric value.  This is what "ordinate" uses to actually do its work.  For example, ordsuf(3) is "rd".

           Not exported by default.

       The above functions are all prototyped to take a scalar value, so "ordinate(@stuff)" is the same as "ordinate(scalar @stuff)".

CAVEATS
       * Note that this library knows only about numbers, not number-words.  "ordinate('seven')" might just as well be "ordinate('superglue')" or "ordinate("\x1E\x9A")" -- you'll get the fallthru case of
       the input string plus "th".

       *  As  is  unavoidable,  "ordinate(0256)"  returns  "174th" (because ordinate sees the value 174). Similarly, "ordinate(1E12)" returns "1000000000000th".  Returning "trillionth" would be nice, but
       that's an awfully atypical case.

       * Note that this library's algorithm (as well as the basic concept and implementation of ordinal numbers) is totally language specific.

       To pick a trivial example, consider that in French, 1 ordinates as "1ier", whereas 41 ordinates as "41ieme".

SEE ALSO
       Lingua::EN::Inflect provides an "ORD" function, which returns the ordinal form of a cardinal number.

       Lingua::EN::Number::IsOrdinal provides an "is_ordinal" function, which returns true if passed an ordinal number.

       Lingua::EN::Numbers provides function "num2en_ordinal()" which will take a number and return the ordinal as a word.  So 3 will result in "third".
