SUB_SAT(3clc)                                                                                  OpenCL Manual                                                                                  SUB_SAT(3clc)

NAME
       sub_sat - Returns x - y and saturates the result.

       gentype sub_sat(gentype x, gentype y);

DESCRIPTION
       sub_sat returns x - y and saturates the result.

NOTES
       Built-in integer functions take scalar or vector arguments. The vector versions of the integer functions operate component-wise. The description is per component.

       We use the generic type name gentype to indicate that the function can take char, char{2|3|4|8|16}, uchar, uchar{2|3|4|8|16}, short, short{2|3|4|8|16}, ushort, ushort{2|3|4|8|16}, int,
       int{2|3|4|8|16}, uint, uint{2|3|4|8|16}, long, long{2|3|4|8|16}, ulong, or ulong{2|3|4|8|16} as the type for the arguments. We use the generic type name ugentype to refer to unsigned versions of
       gentype. For example, if gentype is char4, ugentype is uchar4.

       We also use the generic type name sgentype to indicate that the function can take a scalar data type i.e.  char, uchar, short, ushort, int, uint, long, or ulong as the type for the arguments. For
       built-in integer functions that take gentype and sgentype arguments, the gentype argument must be a vector or scalar version of the sgentype argument. For example, if sgentype is uchar, gentype
       must be uchar or uchar{2|3|4|8|16}. For vector versions, sgentype is implicitly widened to gentype as described in section 6.3.a of the OpenCL specification.

       For any specific use of a function, the actual type has to be the same for all arguments and the return type unless otherwise specified.
