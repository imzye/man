NAME
       ydump - JSON pretty printer

SYNOPSIS
       ydump [Options...] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       ydump pretty prints data in the extended JSON format of the yojson library.  JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a lightweight data-interchange format.

       ydump reads from standard input if the file argument is omitted.

OPTIONS
       -o <file>
              pretty print to file instead of standard output

       -std   use JSON standard syntax only: Convert tuples and variants into standard JSON, refuse to print NaN and infinities, require the root node to be either an object or an array.

       -c     compact output

       -s     streaming mode: read and write a sequence of JSON values instead of just one (this is the default).

       -u     disable streaming mode: A single JSON record is expected.

       -sort  sort object fields (default: preserve internal field order)

       -ob    convert to biniou format and pretty print that (experimental)

       -version
              print version and exit

       -help | --help
              print options
