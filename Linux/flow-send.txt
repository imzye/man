NAME
       flow-send - Transmit flow data with the NetFlow protocol.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-send [ -h ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -m privacy_mask ]  [ -s ]  [ -x xmit_delay ]  [ -V pdu_version ]  localip/remoteip/port

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-send utility is used to transmit flows in NetFlow format to a collector specified by localip/remoteip/port.

OPTIONS
       -d debug_level
              Enable debugging.

       -h     Display help.

       -s     Enable spoofing of source IP address.

       -m privacy_mask
              Apply  privacy_mask to the source and destination IP address of flows. For example a privacy_mask of 255.255.255.0 would convert flows with source/destination IP addresses 10.1.1.1 and 10.2.2.2
              to 10.1.1.0 and 10.2.2.0 respectively.

       -V pdu_version
              Use pdu_version format when transmitting.

       -x xmit_delay
              Configure a microsecond transmit delay between packets. This may be necessary in some configurations to prevent a transmit buffer overrun.

EXAMPLES
       Transmit all flows in the directory /flows/krc4 to the collector at 10.0.0.1 listening on port 9500.

       flow-cat /flows/krc4 | flow-send 0/10.0.0.1/9500

       Generate a test pattern of version 7 flows and send them to a collector at 10.0.0.1 listening on port 9500.

       flow-gen -V7 | flow-send 0/10.0.0.1/9500

BUGS
       It is not currently possible to convert between the aggregated formats (8.x) and the non aggregated formats (1,5,6,7).
