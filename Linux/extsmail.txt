EXTSMAIL.CONF(5)                                                                             File Formats Manual                                                                           EXTSMAIL.CONF(5)

NAME
       extsmail.conf — configure robust sending of e-mail to external commands

DESCRIPTION
       extsmail.conf is used to configure extsmail(1) and extsmaild(1).  It consists of one or more key = value pairs. The following variables are defined:

       spool_dir
               Sets the location of the spool directory used by extsmail(1) and extsmaild(1).  This is the only variable which must be set in every configuration file.

       notify_failure_interval
               Specifies  how  often notifications of unsuccessful deliveries should be made.  If unspecified, or set to 0, notifications will never be made. Times are specified as a number followed by d
               (days), h (hours), m (minutes), or s (seconds).

       notify_failure_cmd
               The shell command to be executed when notify_failure_interval seconds / minutes / hours / days have elapsed since the last fully successful send cycle. If the string ${TIME} exists in  the
               command,  it  is  replaced with a pretty printed string detailing how much time has elapsed since the last fully successfully send cycle.  The resulting string is then passed to system(3).
               Note that no security checking is (or can be) done on the command, so this option should be used with caution if a single configuration file serves multiple users. Please check  the  warn‐
               ings that come with system(3).

       notify_success_cmd
               The shell command to be executed when 1 or more messages have been successfully sent. If the string ${SUCCESSES} exists in the command, it is replaced with a string representing the number
               of successfully sent messages. The same warnings that apply to notify_failure_cmd also apply to this command.

FILES
       The extsmail configuration file is searched for, in order, in the following locations:

       ~/.extsmail/conf
               Per-user extsmail configuration.

       /etc/extsmail/conf
               System-wide extsmail configuration.

EXAMPLES
       The simplest configuration file looks as follows:

             spool_dir = "~/somewhere"

       A more complex configuration which uses a notification framework to inform the user of mail sending and failure looks as follows:

             spool_dir = "~/somewhere"
             notify_failure_interval = 30m
             notify_failure_cmd = "notify-send -a extsmaild -c email
               -i mail-send -u critical 'extsmaild: ${TIME} since a fully
               successful send cycle'"
             notify_success_cmd = "notify-send -a extsmaild -c email
               -i mail-send -u low 'extsmaild: ${SUCCESSES} messages
               successfully sent'"
