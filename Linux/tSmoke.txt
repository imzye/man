DESCRIPTION
       The tSmoke tool is a commandline tool which interfaces with the SmokePing system.  Its main function is to send a message indicating the current status of the systems being monitored by Smokeping or
       an HTML mail file containing the status over the past day, past week and past month including an overview.

       Typical crontab used to invoke this are

        # Quick morning alert to see what's down
        0 6 * * * /usr/local/smokeping/bin/tSmoke.pl --q --to=mobilephone@att.net.invalid --morning
        # Weekly report on the percent availability of network systems with no detail
        0 8 * * * /usr/local/smokeping/bin/tSmoke.pl --q --to=mailbox@company.com.invalid --weekly --detail=0

SETUP
       When installing tSmoke, some variables must be adjusted to fit your local system.

       We need to use the following libraries:

       Smokeping
       RRDTool Perl bindings
       Getopt::Long

       Set up your libraries:

        use lib "/usr/local/smokeping/lib";
        use lib "/usr/local/rrdtool-1.0.39/lib/perl";

       Point to your Smokeping config file

        my $cfgfile = "/usr/local/smokeping/etc/config";

       Modify the Smokeping config file to include a path for tmail in the General section:

        tmail = /usr/local/smokeping/etc/tmail
