BACKGAMMON(6)                  BSD Games Manual                  BACKGAMMON(6)

NAME
     backgammon — the game of backgammon
     teachgammon — learn to play backgammon

SYNOPSIS
     backgammon [-] [-nrwb] [-pr] [-pw] [-pb] [-t term] [-s file]
     teachgammon

DESCRIPTION
     This program lets you play backgammon against the computer or against a
     "friend".  All commands are only one letter, so you don't need to type a
     carriage return, except at the end of a move.  The program is mostly
     self-explanatory, so that a question mark (?) will usually get some help.
     If you answer `y' when the program asks if you want the rules, you will
     get text explaining the rules of the game, some hints on strategy, in‐
     structions on how to use the program, and a tutorial consisting of a
     practice game against the computer.  A description of how to use the pro‐
     gram can be obtained by answering `y' when it asks if you want instruc‐
     tions.

     The possible arguments for backgammon (most are unnecessary but some are
     very convenient) consist of:

     -n      don't ask for rules or instructions

     -r      player is red (implies n)

     -w      player is white (implies n)

     -b      two players, red and white (implies n)

     -pr     print the board before red's turn

     -pw     print the board before white's turn

     -pb     print the board before both player's turn

     -t term
             terminal is type term, uses /usr/share/misc/termcap

     -s file
             recover previously saved game from file

     Any unrecognized arguments are ignored.  An argument of a lone `-' gets a
     description of possible arguments.

     If term has capabilities for direct cursor movement (see termcap(5))
     backgammon ``fixes'' the board after each move, so the board does not
     need to be reprinted, unless the screen suffers some horrendous malady.
     Also, any `p' option will be ignored.  (The `t' option is not necessary
     unless the terminal type does not match the entry in the
     /usr/share/misc/termcap data base.)

QUICK REFERENCE
     When the program prompts by typing only your color, type a space or car‐
     riage return to roll, or

     d       to double

     p       to print the board

     q       to quit

     s       to save the game for later

     When the program prompts with 'Move:', type

     p       to print the board

     q       to quit

     s       to save the game

     or a move, which is a sequence of

     s-f     move from s to f

     s/r     move one man on s the roll r separated by commas or spaces and
             ending with a newline.  Available abbreviations are

             s-f1-f2
                     means s-f1,f1-f2

             s/r1r2  means s/r1,s/r2

     Use b for bar and h for home, or 0 or 25 as appropriate.

BUGS
     The program's strategy needs much work.
