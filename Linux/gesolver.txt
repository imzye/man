NAME
       gesolve - eigensolver for generalized eigenvalue problems (Ritz values only)

SYNOPSIS
       gesolve matrix_a_filename matrix_b_filename evalues_filename  [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program inputs the matrix data from matrix_a_filename matrix_b_filename, and solves the generalized eigenvalue problem A*x = l*B*x with the solver specified by options.  It outputs the specified
       number of Ritz values, the number of which is given by option -ss, to evalues_filename in the extended Matrix Market format (see Appendix of Lis User Guide). Both the Matrix Market format and the Har‐
       well-Boeing format are supported for the matrix filenames.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -e eigensolver
              The following options are supported for eigensolver:

              -e {gli|15}
                     Generalized Lanczos

                     -ss [1]
                            The size of the subspace

              -e {gai|16}
                     Generalized Arnoldi

                     -ss [1]
                            The size of the subspace

       Other Options for eigensolver:

       -eprint [0]
              The output of the residual history

              -eprint {none|0}
                     None

              -eprint {mem|1}
                     Save the residual history

              -eprint {out|2}
                     Output it to the standard output

              -eprint {all|3}
                     Save the residual history and output it to the standard output

       -omp_num_threads [t]
              The number of the threads (t represents the maximum number of the threads)

       -estorage [0]
              The matrix storage format

       -estorage_block [2]
              The block size of the BSR and BSC formats

       -ef [0]
              The precision of the eigensolver

              -ef {double|0}
                     Double precision

              -ef {quad|1}
                     Double-double (quadruple) precision

       See Lis User Guide for full description.
