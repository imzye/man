NAME
       fluid - the fast light user-interface designer

SYNOPSIS
       fluid [ -c [ -o code-filename -h header-filename ] ] [ filename.fl ]

DESCRIPTION
       fluid  is  an  interactive GUI designer for FLTK. When run with no arguments or with a filename, fluid will display the GUI hierarchy and any windows defined in the file.  Functions, classes, win‐
       dows, and GUI components can be manipulated as needed.

       When used with the -c option, fluid will create the necessary C++ header and code files in the current directory.  You can override the default extensions, filenames, and directories using the  -o
       and -h options.
