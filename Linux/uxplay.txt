NAME
       uxplay - start AirPlay server

SYNOPSIS
       uxplay [-n name] [-s wxh] [-p [n]] [more  OPTIONS  ...]

DESCRIPTION
       UxPlay 1.72: An open-source AirPlay mirroring (+ audio streaming) server:

OPTIONS
       -n name   Specify the network name of the AirPlay server

       -nh       Do NOT append "@hostname" at end of AirPlay server name

       -h265     Support h265 (4K) video (with h265 versions of h264 plugins)

       -hls      Support HTTP Live Streaming (currently YouTube video only)

                 v = 2 or 3 (default 3) optionally selects video player version

       -pin[xxxx]Use a 4-digit pin code to control client access (default: no)

                 without option, pin is random: optionally use fixed pin xxxx.

       -reg [fn] Keep a register in $HOME/.uxplay.register to verify returning

                 client pin-registration; (option: use file "fn" for this)

       -pw [pwd] Require use of password "pwd" to control client access.

                 (with no pwd, pin entry is required at each connection.)

                 (option "-pw" after "-pin" overrides it, and vice versa.)

       -vsync[x] Mirror mode: sync audio to video using timestamps (default)

                 x is optional audio delay: millisecs, decimal, can be neg.

       -vsync no Switch off audio/(server)video timestamp synchronization.

       -async[x] Audio-Only mode: sync audio to client video (default: no).

       -async no Switch off audio/(client)video timestamp synchronization.

       -db l[:h] Set minumum volume attenuation to l dB (decibels, negative);

                 optional: set maximum to h dB (+ or -); default -30.0:0.0

       -taper    Use a "tapered" AirPlay volume-control profile.

       -vol v    Set initial audio-streaming volume: range [mute=0.0:1.0=full].

       -s wxh[@r]Request to client for video display resolution [refresh_rate]

                 default 1920x1080[@60] (or 3840x2160[@60] with -h265 option).

       -o        Set display "overscanned" mode on (not usually needed)

       -fs       Full-screen (only with X11, Wayland, VAAPI, D3D11, kms)

       -p        Use legacy ports UDP 6000:6001:7011 TCP 7000:7001:7100

       -p n      Use TCP and UDP ports n,n+1,n+2. range 1024-65535

                 use "-p n1,n2,n3" to set each port, "n1,n2" for n3 = n2+1

                 "-p tcp n" or "-p udp n" sets TCP or UDP ports separately.

       -avdec    Force software h264 video decoding with libav decoder.

       -vp prs   Choose GStreamer h264 parser; default "h264parse"

       -vd dec   Choose GStreamer h264 decoder; default "decodebin"

                 choices: (software) avdec_h264; (hardware) v4l2h264dec,

                 nvdec, nvh264dec, vaapih264dec, vtdec, ...

       -vc cnv   Choose GStreamer videoconverter; default "videoconvert"

                 another choice when using v4l2h264dec: v4l2convert.

       -vs sink  Choose the GStreamer videosink; default "autovideosink"

                 choices: ximagesink,xvimagesink,vaapisink,glimagesink,

                 gtksink,waylandsink,osxvideosink,kmssink,d3d11videosink,...

       -vs 0     Streamed audio only, with no video display window.

       -v4l2     Use Video4Linux2 for GPU hardware h264 video decoding.

       -bt709    Sometimes needed for Raspberry Pi models using Video4Linux2.

       -srgb     Display "Full range" [0-255] color, not "Limited Range"[16-235]

                 This is a workaround for a GStreamer problem, until it is fixed.

       -srgb no  Disable srgb option (use when enabled by default: Linux, *BSD)

       -as sink  Choose the GStreamer audiosink; default "autoaudiosink"

                 choices:pulsesink,alsasink,pipewiresink,osssink,oss4sink,

       -nc  no   Cancel the -nc option (DO close video window).

       -nohold   Drop current connection when new client connects.

       -restrict Restrict clients to those specified by "-allow deviceID".

                 Uxplay displays deviceID when a client attempts to connect.

                 Use "-restrict no" for no client restrictions (default).

       -allow id Permit deviceID = id to connect if restrictions are imposed.

       -block id Always block connections from deviceID = id.

       -FPSdata  Show video-streaming performance reports sent by client.

       -fps n    Set maximum allowed streaming framerate, default 30

       -f {H|V|I}Horizontal|Vertical flip, or both=Inversion=rotate 180 deg

       -r {R|L}  Rotate 90 degrees Right (cw) or Left (ccw)

       -m [mac]  Set MAC address (also Device ID); use for concurrent UxPlays

                 if mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx is not given, a random MAC is used.

       -key [fn] Store private key in $HOME/.uxplay.pem (or in file "fn")

       -dacp [fn]Export client DACP information to file $HOME/.uxplay.dacp

                 (option to use file "fn" instead); used for client remote.

       -vdmp [n] Dump h264 video output to "fn.h264"; fn="videodump", change

                 with "-vdmp [n] filename". If [n] is given, file fn.x.h264

                 x=1,2,.. opens whenever a new SPS/PPS NAL arrives, and <=n

                 NAL units are dumped.

       -admp [n] Dump audio output to "fn.x.fmt", fmt ={aac, alac, aud}, x

                 =1,2,..; fn="audiodump"; change with "-admp [n] filename".

                 x increases when audio format changes. If n is given, <= n

                 audio packets are dumped. "aud"= unknown format.

       -d [n]    Enable debug logging; optional: n=1 to skip normal packet data.

       -v        Displays version information

       -h        Displays help information

       -rc fn    Read startup options from file "fn" instead of ~/.uxplayrc, etc

FILES
       Options in one of $UXPLAYRC, or ~/.uxplayrc, or  ~/.config/uxplayrc
