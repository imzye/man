NAME
       unbound-checkconf - Check unbound configuration file for errors.

SYNOPSIS
       unbound-checkconf [-h] [-f] [-o option] [cfgfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Unbound-checkconf checks the configuration file for the unbound(8) DNS resolver for syntax and other errors.  The config file syntax is described in unbound.conf(5).

       The available options are:

       -h     Show the version and commandline option help.

       -f     Print full pathname, with chroot applied to it.  Use with the -o option.

       -o option
              If given, after checking the config file the value of this option is printed to stdout.  For "" (disabled) options an empty line is printed.

       cfgfile
              The config file to read with settings for unbound. It is checked.  If omitted, the config file at the default location is checked.

EXIT CODE
       The unbound-checkconf program exits with status code 1 on error, 0 for a correct config file.
