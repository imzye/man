NAME
       sosi2osm - SOSI to OSM converter

SYNOPSIS
       sosi2osm [ sosi file ] [ lua file ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the sosi2osm program.

       This utility is capable of converting SOSI files (usually with the .sos extension) to .osm files. A SOSI file is a geospatial vector data format used for exchange of geograhical information in Norway.
       Osm-files are used by the OpenStreetMap community.

       In order to do a conversion you specify the name of the SOSI-file and one .lua file. Then the .osm file will be written to stdout.  The lua file is used to tell which tags  are  converted  into  which
       tags. A number of .lua files are bundled together with the package:

       /usr/share/sosi2osm/lua/default.lua
       /usr/share/sosi2osm/lua/adresser.lua
       /usr/share/sosi2osm/lua/arealdekke.lua
       /usr/share/sosi2osm/lua/adm.lua

       If no conversion of tags is necessary, one may simply run it like this:

       sosi2osm input.sos default.lua > output.osm

       For converting address nodes, use:

       sosi2osm input.sos adresser.lua > output.osm

       Please open the lua-files and see what they do.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options.
