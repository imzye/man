NAME
       globus-update-certificate-dir - Update symlinks in the trusted CA
       directory

SYNOPSIS
       globus-update-certificate-dir -help

       globus-update-certificate-dir [-d DIRECTORY]

DESCRIPTION
       The globus-update-certificate-dir program creates symlinks between
       files (CA certificates, certificate revocation lists, signing policy,
       and certificate request configuration files) using the certificate hash
       the installed version of OpenSSL uses. OpenSSL 1.0.0 uses a different
       name hashing algorithm than previous versions, so CA distributions
       created with older versions of OpenSSL might not be able to locate
       trusted CAs and related files. Running globus-update-certificate-dir
       against a trusted CA directory will add symlinks to the files to the
       hash if needed.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Display a help message to standard output and exit

       -d DIRECTORY
           Create links in the trusted CA directory DIRECTORY instead of using
           the default search path.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following variables affect the execution of
       globus-update-certificate-dir:

       X509_CERT_DIR
           Default trusted certificate directory.

       HOME
