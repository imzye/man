NAME
       fp2subc - convert any footprint into a pcb-rnd subcircuit

SYNPOSIS
       fp2subc [options] infile [outfile]

DECSRIPTION
       fp2subc  executes  pcb-rnd in batch mode to load a footprint (typically specified in an alien format) and save it as a native pcb-rnd subcircuit. The script is useful for mass-converting old footprint
       libraries.

       If outfile is not specified, its name is guessed from infile

OPTIONS
       --lib  infile is not a path but a footprint name that should be searched in the library

       -l     same as --lib

       --pcb-rnd exepath
              run exepath for invoking pcb-rnd (default is "pcb-rnd", which depends on $PATH)

       -p exepath
              same as --pcb-rnd

       --debugger exepath
              insert exepath before pcb-rnd on the command line; useful for running the process e.g. in valgrind

       -d exepath
              same as --debugger

       -c key=val
              pass on a -c key=val CLI config setting to pcb-rnd; useful for setting up library paths

                                                                                                   2018-04-08                                                                                        fp2subc(1)
