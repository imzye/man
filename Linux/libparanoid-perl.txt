NAME
       Paranoid::Network::Socket - Socket wrapper for seemless IPv6 support

VERSION
       $Id: lib/Paranoid/Network/Socket.pm, 2.10 2022/03/08 00:01:04 acorliss Exp $

SYNOPSIS
         # use Socket; # no longer needed
         use Paranoid::Network::Socket;
         use Paranoid::Network::Socket qw(:crlf);

         $ipv6_enabled = has_ipv6();

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a wrapper for Socket(3) and Socket6(3), and is meant to be used in lieu of using those packages directly.  Doing so removes any of the version dependent support issues on Perl and
       its bundled Socket(3) where IPv6 is concerned.

       Starting in Perl 5.12 the beginnings of IPv6 support emerged in the bundled Socket(3) module, but full IPv6 support didn't arrive until 5.14.  Prior versions of Perl required the use of the
       external Socket6(3) module (available on CPAN).

       With this module IPv6 support, if available, is brought in automatically at runtime, regardless of where that support is provided.  It also makes a default export of inet_pton and inet_ntop,
       something that Socket(3) only does on request.

       Finally, this module provides a has_ipv6 function which will return whether your Perl has full IPv6 support.  Full support is determined by the presence of sockaddr_in6.

       All of the regular tag sets provided by either Socket modules are supported by this module.

IMPORT LISTS
       This module exports the following symbols by default:

           has_ipv6 @Socket::EXPORT

       The following specialized import lists also exist:

           List        Members
           --------------------------------------------------------
           all         @defaults @Socket::EXPORT_OK

       NOTE: As a substitute for using Socket directly, this also passes on all the specialized targets of that module.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   has_ipv6
           $ipv6_enabled = has_ipv6();

       Returns a boolean value denoting whether or not this module has full IPv6 support.

DEPENDENCIES
       o   Socket

       o   Socket6 (optional)
