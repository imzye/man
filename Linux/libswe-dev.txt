NAME
       libswe - Swiss Ephemeris

SYNOPSIS
       libswe the Swiss Ephemeris

DESCRIPTION
       The Swiss Ephemeris did not arise in the UNIX/Gnu Linux world and hence does not have an  UNIX/Gnu Linux style manpage.  It is however well documented in the
       following files:

       /usr/share/doc/libswe-doc/swephprg.pdf

       /usr/share/doc/libswe-doc/swisseph.pdf

       /usr/share/doc/libswe-doc/swephprg.html

       /usr/share/doc/libswe-doc/swisseph.html

       This documentation can also be found on line on astrodienst's web pages.
