NAME
       gitview.sh - repository restorer for white_dune (graphical vrml97/x3d editor and animation tool)

SYNOPSIS
       gitview.sh viewercommand file

DESCRIPTION
       gitview.sh is a tool to restore git revision control files (usually built while using "File->save" in white_dune).
       / white_dune is a graphical editor for the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML97), ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997 and X3D.
       gitview.sh is similar to gitk , but shows the restored files, not the output of the "diff" command (which are rather useless for VRML97/x3D files (or other 3D data, images or videos, if this files are
       stored in a git repository)).
       When used with a viewercommand and a file, gitview.sh opens a X11 window and shows the available revisions of the file.  If a revision is selected and OK is pressed, this revision is  restored  (over‐
       writing the file) and the viewercommand is used for the restored file.
