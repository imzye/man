NAME
       simutrans - transportation simulator

SYNOPSIS
       simutrans [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the simutrans command.

       simutrans is a freeware transportation simulator that runs under Windows, Linux, and a few other operating systems (Mac with Intel processors, BEOS).

       You take on the role of operating a transportation company, and your goal is to get goods of various kinds, as well as passengers and mail, from one place to the next.

       Don't  be fooled by the tile-based graphics - this is a very complex game, and it is constantly evolving, with new features being added. It is a living game, and consistently being made better and
       better.
