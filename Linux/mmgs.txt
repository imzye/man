NAME
     mmgs — Adaptation and optimization of a surface triangulation representing a piecewise linear approximation of an underlying surface geometry.

SYNOPSIS
     mmgs ⟨mesh_file⟩ [output_file] [-sol ⟨solution_file⟩] [-met ⟨metric_file⟩] [-h] [-v] [-m ⟨n⟩] [-d] [-val] [-default] [-A] [-ar ⟨x⟩ | -nr] [-hmin ⟨x⟩] [-hmax ⟨x⟩] [-hsiz ⟨x⟩] [-hausd ⟨x⟩] [-hgrad ⟨x⟩]

DESCRIPTION
     The mmgs application is dedicated to surface triangulation remeshing.

     By default it performs mesh modifications in order to control the surface approximation.
     Providing a metric file, it adapts the mesh to the prescribed sizes at nodes.
     Providing a level-set file containing the values of the level-set function at the mesh nodes, the -ls option allows to explicitely mesh an implicit domain.  -optim option allow to improve the mesh qual‐
     ity with respect to initial mesh size and the surface approximation respect.

          -nosizreq               No imposition of the size of required edges over required vertices.
          -nreg                   Normal regularization using laplacian - antilaplacian smoothing.
          -nsd ⟨n⟩                Save the subdomain of index n (default is n=0 which save all subdomains).
          -optim                  Mesh improvement with respect to the initial mesh size.
          -rn ⟨n⟩                 Turn on ( n=1 ) or off ( n=0 ) the renumbering using the SCOTCH library (only available with the USE_SCOTCH compilation flag and if the scotch library is founded).

RETURN VALUES
     mmgs returns:
     •   the 0 value if successful;
     •   the 1 value if the process fail but we can save a conform mesh;
     •   the 2 value if the process fail and we can't save a conform mesh.
