NAME
       squeue - view information about jobs located in the Slurm scheduling queue.

SYNOPSIS
       squeue [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       squeue is used to view job and job step information for jobs managed by Slurm.

OPTIONS
       -A <account_list>, --account=<account_list>
              Specify the accounts of the jobs to view. Accepts a comma separated list of account names. This has no effect when listing job steps.

       -a, --all
              Display  information  about  jobs  and job steps in all partitions.  This causes information to be displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden, partitions that are unavailable to a
              user's group, and federated jobs that are in a "revoked" state.

       -r, --array
              Display one job array element per line.  Without this option, the display will be optimized for use with job arrays (pending job array elements will be combined on one line of output  with  the
              array index values printed using a regular expression).

       --array-unique
              Display  one  unique pending job array element per line. Without this option, the pending job array elements will be grouped into the master array job to optimize the display.  This can also be
              set with the environment variable SQUEUE_ARRAY_UNIQUE.

       --federation
              Show jobs from the federation if a member of one.

       -h, --noheader
              Do not print a header on the output.

       --help Print a help message describing all options squeue.

       --hide Do not display information about jobs and job steps in all partitions. By default, information about partitions that are configured as hidden or are not available to the user's group  will  not
              be displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).

       -i <seconds>, --iterate=<seconds>
              Repeatedly gather and report the requested information at the interval specified (in seconds).  By default, prints a time stamp with the header.

       -j <job_id_list>, --jobs=<job_id_list>
              Requests a comma separated list of job IDs to display.  Defaults to all jobs.  The --jobs=<job_id_list> option may be used in conjunction with the --steps option to print step information about
              specific jobs.  Note: If a list of job IDs is provided, the jobs are displayed even if they are on hidden partitions. Since this option's argument is optional, for  proper  parsing  the  single
              letter  option  must be followed immediately with the value and not include a space between them. For example "-j1008" and not "-j 1008".  The job ID format is "job_id[_array_id]".  Performance
              of the command can be measurably improved for systems with large numbers of jobs when a single job ID is specified.  By default, this field size will be limited to 64 bytes.  Use  the  environ‐
              ment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.

       --local
              Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation (if any). Overrides --federation.

       -l, --long
              Report more of the available information for the selected jobs or job steps, subject to any constraints specified.

       -L, --licenses=<license_list>
              Request jobs requesting or using one or more of the named licenses.  The license list consists of a comma separated list of license names.

       --me   Equivalent to --user=<my username>.

       -M, --clusters=<cluster_name>
              Clusters to issue commands to.  Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.  A value of 'all' will query to run on all clusters.  This option implicitly sets the --local option.

       -n, --name=<name_list>
              Request jobs or job steps having one of the specified names.  The list consists of a comma separated list of job names.

       --noconvert
              Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to 2G).

       -o <output_format>, --format=<output_format>
              Specify  the information to be displayed, its size and position (right or left justified).  Also see the -O <output_format>, --Format=<output_format> option described below (which supports less
              flexibility in formatting, but supports access to all fields).  If the command is executed in a federated cluster environment and information about more than one cluster is to be displayed  and
              the -h, --noheader option is used, then the cluster name will be displayed before the default output formats shown below.

              The default formats with various options are:

              default        "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %R"

              -l, --long     "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.8T %.10M %.9l %.6D %R"

              -s, --steps    "%.15i %.8j %.9P %.8u %.9M %N"

              The format of each field is "%[[.]size]type[suffix]"

                 size   Minimum field size. If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information will be used.

                 .      Indicates the output should be right justified and size must be specified.  By default output is left justified.

                 suffix Arbitrary string to append to the end of the field.

              Note that many of these type specifications are valid only for jobs while others are valid only for job steps.  Valid type specifications include:

              %all  Print all fields available for this data type with a vertical bar separating each field.

              %a    Account associated with the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %A    Number of tasks created by a job step.  This reports the value of the srun --ntasks option.  (Valid for job steps only)

              %A    Job id.  This will have a unique value for each element of job arrays.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %B    Executing  (batch)  host.  For an allocated session, this is the host on which the session is executing (i.e. the node from which the srun or the salloc command was executed). For a batch
                    job, this is the node executing the batch script. In the case of a typical Linux cluster, this would be the compute node zero of the allocation. In the case of a Cray  ALPS  system,  this
                    would be the front-end host whose slurmd daemon executes the job script.

              %c    Minimum number of CPUs (processors) per node requested by the job.  This reports the value of the srun --mincpus option with a default value of zero.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %C    Number  of CPUs (processors) requested by the job or allocated to it if already running.  As a job is completing this number will reflect the current number of CPUs allocated.  (Valid for
                    jobs only)

              %d    Minimum size of temporary disk space (in MB) requested by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %D    Number of nodes allocated to the job or the minimum number of nodes required by a pending job. The actual number of nodes allocated to a pending job may exceed  this  number  if  the  job
                    specified  a  node  range count (e.g.  minimum and maximum node counts) or the job specifies a processor count instead of a node count. As a job is completing this number will reflect the
                    current number of nodes allocated.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %e    Time at which the job ended or is expected to end (based upon its time limit).  (Valid for jobs only)

              %E    Job dependencies remaining. This job will not begin execution until these dependent jobs complete. In the case of a job that can not run due to job dependencies never being satisfied, the
                    full original job dependency specification will be reported. A value of NULL implies this job has no dependencies.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %f    Features required by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %F    Job array's job ID. This is the base job ID.  For non-array jobs, this is the job ID.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %g    Group name of the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %G    Group ID of the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %h    Can the compute resources allocated to the job be over subscribed by other jobs.  The resources to be over subscribed can be nodes, sockets, cores, or hyperthreads depending upon configu‐
                    ration.  The value will be "YES" if the job was submitted with the oversubscribe option or the partition is configured with OverSubscribe=Force, "NO" if the job  requires  exclusive  node
                    access,  "USER"  if the allocated compute nodes are dedicated to a single user, "MCS" if the allocated compute nodes are dedicated to a single security class (See MCSPlugin and MCSParame‐
                    ters configuration parameters for more information), "OK" otherwise (typically allocated dedicated CPUs), (Valid for jobs only)

              %H    Number of sockets per node requested by the job.  This reports the value of the srun --sockets-per-node option.  When --sockets-per-node has not been set, "*" is  displayed.   (Valid  for
                    jobs only)

              %i    Job  or  job  step  id.  In the case of job arrays, the job ID format will be of the form "<base_job_id>_<index>".  By default, the job array index field size will be limited to 64 bytes.
                    Use the environment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.  (Valid for jobs and job steps) In the case of heterogeneous job allocations, the job ID format will be of the
                    form "#+#" where the first number is the "heterogeneous job leader" and the second number the zero origin offset for each component of the job.

              %I    Number  of  cores  per socket requested by the job.  This reports the value of the srun --cores-per-socket option.  When --cores-per-socket has not been set, "*" is displayed.  (Valid for
                    jobs only)

              %j    Job or job step name.  (Valid for jobs and job steps)

              %J    Number of threads per core requested by the job.  This reports the value of the srun --threads-per-core option.  When --threads-per-core has not been set, "*" is  displayed.   (Valid  for
                    jobs only)

              %k    Comment associated with the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %K    Job array index.  By default, this field size will be limited to 64 bytes.  Use the environment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %l    Time limit of the job or job step in days-hours:minutes:seconds.  The value may be "NOT_SET" if not yet established or "UNLIMITED" for no limit.  (Valid for jobs and job steps)

              %L    Time  left  for  the job to execute in days-hours:minutes:seconds.  This value is calculated by subtracting the job's time used from its time limit.  The value may be "NOT_SET" if not yet
                    established or "UNLIMITED" for no limit.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %m    Minimum size of memory (in MB) requested by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %M    Time used by the job or job step in days-hours:minutes:seconds.  The days and hours are printed only as needed.  For job steps this field shows the elapsed time since execution began  and
                    thus will be inaccurate for job steps which have been suspended.  Clock skew between nodes in the cluster will cause the time to be inaccurate.  If the time is obviously wrong (e.g. nega‐
                    tive), it displays as "INVALID".  (Valid for jobs and job steps)

              %n    List of node names explicitly requested by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %N    List of nodes allocated to the job or job step. In the case of a COMPLETING job, the list of nodes will comprise only those nodes that have not yet been returned to service.   (Valid  for
                    jobs and job steps)

              %o    The command to be executed.

              %R    For  pending  jobs:  the  reason a job is waiting for execution is printed within parenthesis.  For terminated jobs with failure: an explanation as to why the job failed is printed within
                    parenthesis.  For all other job states: the list of allocate nodes.  See the JOB REASON CODES section below for more information.  (Valid for jobs only)

              %s    Node selection plugin specific data for a job. Possible data includes: Geometry requirement of resource allocation (X,Y,Z dimensions), Connection type (TORUS, MESH, or NAV ==  torus  else

              Specify  the  information to be displayed.  Also see the -o <output_format>, --format=<output_format> option described below (which supports greater flexibility in formatting, but does not sup‐
              port access to all fields because we ran out of letters).  Requests a comma separated list of job information to be displayed.

              The format of each field is "type[:[.][size][sufix]]"

                 size   Minimum field size. If no size is specified, 20 characters will be allocated to print the information.

       -p <part_list>, --partition=<part_list>
              Specify the partitions of the jobs or steps to view. Accepts a comma separated list of partition names.

       -P, --priority
              For pending jobs submitted to multiple partitions, list the job once per partition. In addition, if jobs are sorted by priority, consider both the partition and job priority. This option can be
              used to produce a list of pending jobs in the same order considered for scheduling by Slurm with appropriate additional options (e.g. "--sort=-p,i --states=PD").

       -q <qos_list>, --qos=<qos_list>
              Specify the qos(s) of the jobs or steps to view. Accepts a comma separated list of qos's.

       -R, --reservation=<reservation_name>
              Specify the reservation of the jobs to view.

       -s, --steps
              Specify  the  job  steps  to  view.   This  flag  indicates  that  a comma separated list of job steps to view follows without an equal sign (see examples).  The job step format is "job_id[_ar‐
              ray_id].step_id". Defaults to all job steps. Since this option's argument is optional, for proper parsing the single letter option must be followed immediately with the value and not include  a
              space between them. For example "-s1008.0" and not "-s 1008.0".

       --sibling
              Show all sibling jobs on a federated cluster. Implies --federation.

       -S <sort_list>, --sort=<sort_list>
              Specification  of  the order in which records should be reported.  This uses the same field specification as the <output_format>.  The long format option "cluster" can also be used to sort jobs
              or job steps by cluster name (e.g. federated jobs).  Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields separated by commas.  The field specifications may be preceded by "+" or "-"
              for  ascending  (default)  and descending order respectively.  For example, a sort value of "P,U" will sort the records by partition name then by user id.  The default value of sort for jobs is
              "P,t,-p" (increasing partition name then within a given partition by increasing job state and then decreasing priority).  The default value of sort for job steps is "P,i" (increasing  partition
              name then within a given partition by increasing step id).

       --start
              Report  the  expected  start  time and resources to be allocated for pending jobs in order of increasing start time.  This is equivalent to the following options: --format="%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u
              %.2t  %.19S %.6D %20Y %R", --sort=S and --states=PENDING.  Any of these options may be explicitly changed as desired by combining the --start option with other option values (e.g. to use a dif‐
              ferent output format).  The expected start time of pending jobs is only available if the Slurm is configured to use the backfill scheduling plugin.

       -t <state_list>, --states=<state_list>
              Specify  the states of jobs to view.  Accepts a comma separated list of state names or "all". If "all" is specified then jobs of all states will be reported. If no state is specified then pend‐
              ing, running, and completing jobs are reported. See the JOB STATE CODES section below for a list of valid states. Both extended and compact forms are valid.  Note the <state_list>  supplied  is
              case insensitive ("pd" and "PD" are equivalent).

       -u <user_list>, --user=<user_list>
              Request  jobs  or job steps from a comma separated list of users.  The list can consist of user names or user id numbers.  Performance of the command can be measurably improved for systems with
              large numbers of jobs when a single user is specified.

       --usage
              Print a brief help message listing the squeue options.

       -v, --verbose
              Report details of squeues actions.

       -V , --version
              Print version information and exit.

       -w <hostlist>, --nodelist=<hostlist>
              Report only on jobs allocated to the specified node or list of nodes.  This may either be the NodeName or NodeHostname as defined in slurm.conf(5) in the event that they differ.  A node_name of
              localhost is mapped to the current host name.

       WaitingForScheduling  No reason has been set for this job yet.  Waiting for the scheduler to determine the appropriate reason.

JOB STATE CODES
       Jobs typically pass through several states in the course of their execution.  The typical states are PENDING, RUNNING, SUSPENDED, COMPLETING, and COMPLETED.  An explanation of each state follows.

       BF  BOOT_FAIL       Job terminated due to launch failure, typically due to a hardware failure (e.g. unable to boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued).

       CA  CANCELLED       Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator.  The job may or may not have been initiated.

       CD  COMPLETED       Job has terminated all processes on all nodes with an exit code of zero.

       CF  CONFIGURING     Job has been allocated resources, but are waiting for them to become ready for use (e.g. booting).

       CG  COMPLETING      Job is in the process of completing. Some processes on some nodes may still be active.

       DL  DEADLINE        Job terminated on deadline.

       F   FAILED          Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other failure condition.

       NF  NODE_FAIL       Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes.

       SI  SIGNALING       Job is being signaled.

       SE  SPECIAL_EXIT    The job was requeued in a special state. This state can be set by users, typically in EpilogSlurmctld, if the job has terminated with a particular exit value.

       SO  STAGE_OUT       Job is staging out files.

       ST  STOPPED         Job has an allocation, but execution has been stopped with SIGSTOP signal.  CPUS have been retained by this job.

       S   SUSPENDED       Job has an allocation, but execution has been suspended and CPUs have been released for other jobs.

       TO  TIMEOUT         Job terminated upon reaching its time limit.

PERFORMANCE
       Executing squeue sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from squeue or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmctld daemon come in at once, it can
       result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run squeue or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to squeue to the  minimum
       necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Some  squeue options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below. (Note: Command line options will always override these
       settings.)

       SLURM_BITSTR_LEN    Specifies the string length to be used for holding a job array's task ID expression.  The default value is 64 bytes.  A value of 0 will print the full expression  with  any  length
                           required.  Larger values may adversely impact the application performance.

       SLURM_CLUSTERS      Same as --clusters

       SLURM_CONF          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       SLURM_TIME_FORMAT   Specify  the  format used to report time stamps. A value of standard, the default value, generates output in the form "year-month-dateThour:minute:second".  A value of relative re‐
                           turns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.  For other dates in the current year it prints the "hour:minute" preceded by "Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name
                           of the day for the coming week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr").  For other years it returns a date month and year without a time (e.g.  "6 Jun 2012").
                           All of the time stamps use a 24 hour format.

                           A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of "%a %T" will report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

EXAMPLES
       Print the jobs scheduled in the debug partition and in the COMPLETED state in the format with six right justified digits for the job id followed by the priority with an arbitrary fields size:

              $ squeue -p debug -t COMPLETED -o "%.6i %p"
               JOBID PRIORITY
               65543 99993
               65544 99992
               65545 99991

       Print the job steps in the debug partition sorted by user:

              $ squeue -s -p debug -S u
                STEPID        NAME PARTITION     USER      TIME NODELIST

               65550.1      param1     debug  candice   1:43:21 dev[6-12]

       Print information only about jobs 12345, 12346 and 12348:

              $ squeue --jobs 12345,12346,12348
               JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST  TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
               12345     debug job1 dave  R   0:21     4 dev[9-12]
               12346     debug job2 dave PD   0:00     8 (Resources)
               12348     debug job3 ed   PD   0:00     4 (Priority)

       Print information only about job step 65552.1:

              $ squeue --steps 65552.1
                STEPID     NAME PARTITION    USER    TIME  NODELIST
               65552.1    test2     debug   alice   12:49  dev[1-4]
