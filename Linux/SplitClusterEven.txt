NAME
       AmpliconNoise - remove noise from high throughput nucleotide sequence data

VERSION
       This documentation refers to version 1.22

SYNOPSIS
       See /usr/share/doc/ampliconnoise/Doc.pdf.gz for details of how to run.

DESCRIPTION
       The following tools are included.  Most of them have an MPI equivalent, for example SeqNoise has an equivalent SeqNoiseM which can be used with mpirun.

       FastaUnique - dereplicates fasta file
         -in     string            input file name
        Options:

       FCluster
         -in    string            distance input file name
         -out   string            output file stub
        Options:
         -r                       resolution
