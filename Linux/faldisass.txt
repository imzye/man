NAME
       faldissass - The Falcon disassembler

SYNOPSIS
       faldissass [options] module_file.fam

DESCRIPTION
       The  faldissass  command  line tool disassembles a compiled .fam Falcon
       module.  The output human-readable Falcon Virtual Machine  assembly  is
       sent to the standard output.

       The tool has mainly two working modes. The standard mode procues an as‐
       sembly dump containing the PC counter address that will  be  associated
       with each instruction in the VM. This allows to see exactly on which VM
       instruction an error was raised (as the PC at error  raisal  is  always
       shown  in error dumps), or to debug the VM by following the PC register
       in step-by-step mode.

       The isomorphic mode creates a compilable assembly source that  can  the
       be feed into the falcon assembler to obtain a compiled module. In exam‐
       ple, this can be used for VM level hand-made finetuning optimizations.

OPTIONS
       -d     Dump the dependency table (list of load directives).

       -h     Show version and a short help.

       -i     Create an isomorphic version of the original assembly.

       -l     add line informations.

       -s     Dump the string table.

       -S     Write the strings inline instead of using #strid

       -y     Dump the symbol table.

FILES
       /usr/lib/libfalcon_engine.so
              Default location of the Falcon Engine loadable module.
