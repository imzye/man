NAME
       XML::Mini::Node - XML node for XML::Midi parser/generator

DESCRIPTION
       Nodes are used as atomic containers for numerical and text data and act as leaves in the XML tree.

       They have no name or children.

       They always exist as children of XML::MiniElements.  For example, <B>this text is bold</B> Would be represented as a XML::MiniElement named 'B' with a single child, a Node object which contains
       the string 'this text is bold'.

       a Node has

        - a parent
        - data (text OR numeric)

   getValue
       Returns the text or numeric value of this Node.

   text [SETTO [SETTOALT]]
       The text() method is used to get or set text data for this node.  If SETTO is passed, the node's content is set to the SETTO string.

       If the optional SETTOALT is passed and SETTO is false, the node's value is set to SETTOALT.

       Returns this node's text, if set or NULL

   numeric [SETTO [SETTOALT]]
       The numeric() method is used to get or set numerical data for this node.

       If SETTO is passed, the node's content is set to the SETTO string.

       If the optional SETTOALT is passed and SETTO is NULL, the node's value is set to SETTOALT.

       Returns this node's text, if set or NULL

   toString [DEPTH]
       Returns this node's contents as a string.  If the special DEPTH $XML::Mini::NoWhiteSpaces is passed, no whitespaces will be inserted.
