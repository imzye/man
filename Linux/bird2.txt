NAME
       bird - BIRD Internet Routing Daemon
       birdc - BIRD Internet Routing Daemon remote control
       birdcl - BIRD Internet Routing Daemon remote control light

SYNOPSIS

       bird [-c config-file] [-d] [-D debug-file] [-f] [-g group] [-l] [-p] [-P pid-file] [-R] [-s control-socket] [-u user]

       birdc [-l] [-r] [-s control-socket] [-v]

       birdcl [-l] [-r] [-s control-socket] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       bird is an Internet Routing Daemon. That is, it sends and receives messages using different protocols in order to discover and exchange routing information with other routing daemons present on
       the same network. It is able to talk the most widely known routing protocols (such as BGPv4, RIPv2, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3), both on IPv4 and IPv6 and it features a very powerful language for route
       filtering.

       birdc is a remote control for bird. While bird is running, the system administrator can connect to it using birdc, to inspect its internal status and reconfigure it. The two processes use a Unix
       socket to communicate. Once started, bird will give access to an interactive shell: commands can be completed with TAB and help can be requested by pressing the key `?'. More documentation on the
       available commands can be found on the website, see below.

       birdcl is a light version of birdc remote control for bird without readline/ncurses support. TAB completion isn't available.

OPTIONS
       The bird accepts these options:

       -c config-file
           Use given configuration file instead of the default /etc/bird/bird.conf.

       -d
           Enable debug messages to stderr, and run bird in foreground.

       -D debug-file
           Enable debug messages to given file.

       -f
           Run bird in foreground.

       -g group
           Run bird with given group ID.

       --help
           Display command-line options to bird.

       -l
           Look for a configuration file and a communication socket in the current working directory instead of in default system locations. However, paths specified by options -c, -s have higher
           priority.

       -p
           Just parse the config file and exit. Return value is zero if the config file is valid, nonzero if there are some errors.

       -P pid-file
           Create a PID file with given filename.

       -R
           Apply graceful restart recovery after start.

       -s control-socket
           Use given filename for a socket for communications with the client (remote control), default is /run/bird/bird.ctl.

       -u user
           Drop privileges and run as given user instead of root. The bird would keep CAP_NET_ADMIN and other network-related capabilities necessary for its function.

       --version
           Display bird version.

       birdc and birdcl accept these options:

       -l
           Look for a communication socket in the current working directory.

       -r
           Run birdc in restricted mode: only the `show ...' commands are allowed.

       -s control-socket
           Use given filename for a socket for communications with the server, default is /run/bird/bird.ctl.

       -v
           Numeric return codes are dumped along with messages, making them easily parsable by a program. See the programmer's documentation for information about their meanings.

FILES
       /etc/bird/bird.conf
           The system-wide configuration file to control the behaviour of bird. See the website for more documentation.
