NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Basic - The simplest level of serialization

VERSION
       version 0.53

SYNOPSIS
         package Point;
         use Moose;
         use MooseX::Storage;

         with Storage;

         has 'x' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
         has 'y' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');

         1;

         my $p = Point->new(x => 10, y => 10);

         ## methods to pack/unpack an
         ## object in perl data structures

         # pack the class into a hash
         $p->pack(); # { __CLASS__ => 'Point-0.01', x => 10, y => 10 }

         # unpack the hash into a class
         my $p2 = Point->unpack({ __CLASS__ => 'Point-0.01', x => 10, y => 10 });

         # unpack the hash, with injection of additional paramaters
         my $p3 = Point->unpack( $p->pack, inject => { x => 11 } );

DESCRIPTION
       This is the most basic form of serialization. This is used by default but the exported "Storage" function.

METHODS
       pack ([ disable_cycle_check = 1])>
           Providing  the "disable_cycle_check" argument disables checks for any cyclical references. The current implementation for this check is rather naive, so if you know what you are doing, you can
           bypass this check.

           This trait is applied on a perl-case basis. To set this flag for all objects that inherit from this role, see MooseX::Storage::Traits::DisableCycleDetection.

       unpack ($data [, inject = { key => val, ... } ] )>
           Providing the "inject" argument lets you supply additional arguments to the class' "new" function, or override ones from the serialized data.
