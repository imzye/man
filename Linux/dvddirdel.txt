NAME
       dvddirdel - Deletes a previously authored DVD directory structure in DIR

SYNOPSIS
       dvddirdel [ -o DIR ]

DESCRIPTION
       dvddirdel safely deletes a previously authored DVD directory structure in DIR. Only items that look like part of a DVD-Video directory structure are removed.

       If you just want to replace an existing output directory with a new one, dvdauthor(1) can do that directly with its -O option.

USAGE
       dvddirdel -o DIR

CAVEATS
       None.
