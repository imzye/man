NAME
       jdiff - Syntactic diff of goto programs obtained from Java bytecode

SYNOPSIS
       jdiff [-?] [-h] [--help]
              show help

       jdiff old new
              jars to be compared

DESCRIPTION
OPTIONS
   Diff options:
       --show-goto-functions
              show loaded goto program

       --list-goto-functions
              list loaded goto functions

       --show-properties
              show the properties, but don't run analysis

       --show-loops
              show the loops in the programs

       -u | --unified
              output unified diff

       --change-impact |

       --forward-impact |

       --backward-impact
              output unified diff with forward&backward/forward/backward dependencies

       --compact-output
              output dependencies in compact mode

   Program instrumentation options:
       --no-assertions
              ignore user assertions

       --no-assumptions
              ignore user assumptions

       --cover CC
              Add  instrumentation as used with jbmc(1) for creating test-suite with coverage criterion CC, where CC is one of assertion[s], assume[s], branch[es], condition[s], cover, decision[s], loca‐
              tion[s], or mcdc.

       --cover-failed-assertions
              do not stop coverage checking at failed assertions (this is the default for --cover assertions)

       --show-test-suite
              print test suite for coverage criterion (requires --cover)

   Other options:
       --version
              show version and exit

       --json-ui
              use JSON-formatted output

       --verbosity n
              verbosity level

       --timestamp [monotonic|wall]
              Print microsecond-precision timestamps.  monotonic: stamps increase monotonically.  wall: ISO-8601 wall clock timestamps.

ENVIRONMENT
       All tools honor the TMPDIR environment variable when generating temporary files and directories.
