NAME
       Acme::Brainfuck - Embed Brainfuck in your perl code

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Acme::Brainfuck;

        print 'Hello world!', chr ++++++++++. ;

DESCRIPTION
       Brainfuck is about the tiniest Turing-complete programming language you can get.  A language is Turing-complete if it can model the operations of a Turing machine--an abstract model of a computer
       defined by the British mathematician Alan Turing in 1936.  A Turing machine consists only of an endless sequence of memory cells and a pointer to one particular memory cell.  Yet it is
       theoretically capable of performing any computation. With this module, you can embed Brainfuck instructions delimited by whitespace into your perl code.  It will be translated into Perl as parsed.
       Brainfuck has just just 8 instructions (well more in this implementation, see "Extensions to ANSI Brainfuck" below.) which are as follows

   Instructions
       + Increment
           Increase the value of the current memory cell by one.

       - Decrement
           Decrease the value of the current memory cell by one.

       > Forward
           Move the pointer to the next memory cell.

       < Back
           Move the pointer to the previous memory cell.

       , Input
           Read a byte from Standard Input and store it in the current memory cell.

       . Output
           Write the value of the current memory cell to standard output.

       [ Loop
           If the value of the current memory cell is 0, continue to the cell after the next ']'.

       ] Next
           Go back to the last previous '['.

   Extensions to ANSI Brainfuck
       This implementation has extra instructions available.  In order to avoid such terrible bloat, they are only available if you use the verbose pragma like so:

       use Acme::Brainfuck qw/verbose/;

       The extra instructions are:

       ~ Reset
           Resets the pointer to the first memory cell and clear all memory cells.

       # Peek
           Prints the values of the memory pointer and the current memory cell to STDERR.  See also "Debugging" below.

   Debugging
       By using the debug pragma like this:

       use Acme::Brainfuck qw/debug/;

       you  can  dump  out  the  generated perl code.  (Caution: it is not pretty.)  The key to understanding it is that the memory pointer is represented by $p, and the memory array by @m  Therefore the
       value of the current memory cell is $m[$p].

RETURN VALUE
       Each sequence of Brainfuck instructions becomes a Perl block and returns the value of the current memory cell.

EXAMPLES
   JABH
        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Acme::Brainfuck;
        print "Just another ";
        ++++++[>++++++++++++++++<-]>
        ++.--
        >+++[<++++++>-]<.>[-]+++[<------>-]<
        +.-
        +++++++++.---------
        ++++++++++++++.--------------
        ++++++.------
        >+++[<+++++++>-]<.>[-]+++[<------->-]<
        +++.---
        +++++++++++.-----------
        print " hacker.\n";

   Countdown
        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use strict;
        use Acme::Brainfuck qw/verbose/;

        print "Countdown commencing...\n";
        ++++++++++[>+>+<<-]
        >>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<<
        ++++++++++[>>.-<.<-]
        print "We have liftoff!\n";

   Reverse
        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Acme::Brainfuck qw/verbose/;

        while(1)
        {
          print "Say something to Backwards Man and then press enter: ";
          +[->,----------]<
          print 'Backwards Man says, "';
          [+++++++++++.<]<
          print "\" to you too.\n";
          ~
        }

   Math
        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Acme::Brainfuck;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        my $answer = +++[>++++++<-]> ;

        print "3 * 6 = $answer \n";
