NAME
       memprobe - ROOT utility to examine memory usage

SYNOPSIS
       memprobe [options]

DESCRIPTION
       To  activate the memory checker you have to set in the .rootrc file the resource Root.MemCheck to 1 (e.g.: Root.MemCheck: 1) and you  have to link with libNew.so (e.g. use root-config --new --libs) or
       use rootn.exe.

       When all this is the case you will find at the end of the program execution a file memcheck.out in the directory where you started your ROOT program. Alternatively you can set the  resource  Root.Mem‐
       CheckFile  to the name of a file to which the leak information will be written. The contents of this memcheck.out file can be analyzed and transformed into printable  text via the memprobe program (in
       /usr/bin).
