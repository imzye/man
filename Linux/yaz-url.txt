NAME
       yaz-url - YAZ URL fetch utility

SYNOPSIS
       yaz-url [-H name:value] [-m method] [-O fname] [-p fname] [-R num] [-u user/password] [-v] [-x proxy] [url...]

DESCRIPTION
       yaz-url is utility to get web content. It is very limited in functionality compared to programs such as curl, wget.

       The options must precede the URL given on the command line, to take effect.

       Fetched HTTP content is written to stdout, unless option -O is given.

OPTIONS
       -H name:value
           Specifies HTTP header content with name and value. This option can be given multiple times (for different names, of course).

       -m method
           Specifies the HTTP method to be used for the next URL. Default is method "GET". However, option -p sets it to "POST".

       -O fname
           Sets output filename for HTTP content.

       -p fname
           Sets a file to be POSTed in the folloing URL.

       -R num
           Sets maximum number of HTTP redirects to be followed. A value of zero disables follow of HTTP redirects.

       -u user/password
           Specifies a user and a password to be uesd in HTTP basic authentication in the following URL fetch. The user and password must be separated by a slash (thus it is not possible to specify a user
           with a slash in it).

       -v
           Makes yaz-url dump each HTTP request/response to stdout.

       -x proxy
           Specifies a proxy to be used for URL fetch.
