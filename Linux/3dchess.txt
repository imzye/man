NAME
       3Dc - Program to play 3D chess for X

SYNOPSIS
       3Dc [-play:  white|black] [-altdisplay:|-ad: display]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly  the 3Dc command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  The Rules of
       3Dchess as played by this program can be found in /usr/share/doc/3dchess/3dc-rules.html on Debian GNU/Linux systems.

OPTIONS
       -play:white|black
              Tells the computer to play.  Requires a following parameter, either black or white, which tells the computer which colour to play.

       -altdisplay:display,-ad:display
              Tells the computer that you are playing as the white player in a network game.  It requires one additional parameter---the display to pop the black player's windows up on.  The  other  dis‐
              play must allow connections, via xhost or xauth.
