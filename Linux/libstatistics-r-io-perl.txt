Statistics::R::REXP::BaseEnvironment(3pm)                                           User Contributed Perl Documentation                                           Statistics::R::REXP::BaseEnvironment(3pm)

NAME
       Statistics::R::REXP::BaseEnvironment - the base R environment ("baseenv()")

VERSION
       version 1.0002

SYNOPSIS
           use Statistics::R::REXP::BaseEnvironment

           my $env = Statistics::R::REXP::BaseEnvironment->new;
           print $env->name;

DESCRIPTION
       An object of this class represents a special R environment ("ENVSXP") that is the environment of the base package itself.

       You shouldn't create instances of this class, it exists mainly to handle deserialization of "baseenv()" by the "IO" classes.

METHODS
       "Statistics::R::REXP::BaseEnvironment" inherits from Statistics::R::REXP::Environment, with the added restriction that it doesn't have attributes, enclosure, or any contents. Trying to create an
       BaseEnvironment instance that doesn't follow this restriction will raise an exception.

   ACCESSORS
       name
           Just as in R, the name of the BaseEnvironment is "R_BaseEnv".

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Classes in the "REXP" hierarchy are intended to be immutable. Please do not try to change their value or attributes.

       There are no known bugs in this module. Please see Statistics::R::IO for bug reporting.

SUPPORT
       See Statistics::R::IO for support and contact information.
