NAME
       Devel::OverloadInfo - introspect overloaded operators

VERSION
       version 0.008

DESCRIPTION
       Devel::OverloadInfo returns information about overloaded operators for a given class (or object), including where in the inheritance hierarchy the overloads are declared and where the code
       implementing them is.

FUNCTIONS
   is_overloaded
          if (is_overloaded($class_or_object)) { ... }

       Returns a boolean indicating whether the given class or object has any overloading declared.  Note that a bare "use overload;" with no actual operators counts as being overloaded.

       Equivalent to overload::Overloaded(), but doesn't trigger various bugs associated with it in versions of perl before 5.16.

   overload_op_info
           my $info = overload_op_info($class_or_object, $op);

       Returns a hash reference with information about the specified overloaded operator of the named class or blessed object.

       Returns "undef" if the operator is not overloaded.

       See "Overloadable Operations" in overload for the available operators.

       The keys in the returned hash are as follows:

       class
           The name of the class in which the operator overloading was declared.

       code
           A reference to the function implementing the overloaded operator.

       code_name
           The fully qualified name of the function implementing the overloaded operator.

       method_name (optional)
           The name of the method implementing the overloaded operator, if the overloading was specified as a named method, e.g. "use overload $op => 'method';".

       code_class (optional)
           The name of the class in which the method specified by "method_name" was found.

       value (optional)
           For the special "fallback" key, the value it was given in "class".

   overload_info
           my $info = overload_info($class_or_object);

       Returns  a hash reference with information about all the overloaded operators of specified class name or blessed object.  The keys are the overloaded operators, as specified in %overload::ops (see
       "Overloadable Operations" in overload), and the values are the hashes returned by "overload_op_info".

CAVEATS
       Whether the "fallback" key exists when it has its default value of "undef" varies between perl versions: Before 5.18 it's there, in later versions it's not.
