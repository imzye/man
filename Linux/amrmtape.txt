NAME
       amrmtape - remove a tape from the Amanda database

SYNOPSIS
       amrmtape [--changer changer-name] [--cleanup] [--dryrun] [-n] [--erase]
                [--external-copy] [--keep-label] [--list-retention]
                [--list-no-retention] [--remove-no-retention] [--quiet] [-q]
                [--verbose] [-v] config [label]*

DESCRIPTION
       Amrmtape invalidates the contents of an existing backup tape in the
       configuration database. This is meant as a recovery mechanism when a
       good backup is damaged either by faulty hardware or user error, e.g.
       the tape is eaten by the drive or is overwritten.

       See the amanda(8) man page for more details about Amanda.

OPTIONS
       --changer changer-name
           Specify which changer to use when erasing label

       --cleanup
           Remove logs and indexes associated with label. Otherwise, they'll
           remain until the next run of amdump.

       --dryrun, -n
           Generate new tapelist(5) and database files with label removed, but
           leave them in /tmp and do not update the original copies.

       --erase
           Attempt to erase the data contained on the volume with the given
           label. This requires that Amanda be able to find that volume using
           the tape changer. Erasure is not supported by all Amanda devices,
           and the erasure is not "secure" in the sense that the data can most
           likely be recovered by someone with the right tools.

       --external-copy
           The volume is erased but the label is kept in the tapelist and the
           log file. This function must be used if you manually made a copy of
           the volume that you can manually restore.

           You should also mark the label as noreuse.

       --keep-label
           Do not remove label from the tapelist. The volume become like a new
           labelled tape and can be reused by any storage using the same
           tape-pool.

       --list-retention
           List all labels that are required for the policy of each storage.

       --list-no-retention
           List all labels that are not required for the policy of each
           storage. They are the volumes that can be reused.

       --remove-no-retention
           Remove all labels that are not required for the policy of each
           storage. Useful with --keep-label and/or --erase.

       --verbose, -v
           List backups of hosts and disks that are being discarded. Enabled
           by default.

       --quiet, -q
           Opposite of -v.

EXAMPLE
       Remove tape labeled DAILY034 and DAILY035 from the DailySet1
       configuration.
       # amrmtape DailySet1 DAILY034 DAILY035
