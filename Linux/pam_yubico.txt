NAME
       pam_yubico - Module for YubiKey authentication

SYNOPSIS
       pam_yubico [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The module is for authentication of YubiKeys, either with online validation of OTP, or offline validation with HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response.

OPTIONS
       debug
           Turns on debugging.

       debug_file=file
           File name to write debug to, the file must exist and be a regular file. Defaults to stdout.

       mode=[client|challenge-response]
           Set the mode of operation, client for OTP validation and challenge-response for challenge-response validation, client is the default.

       authfile=file
           Set the location of the file that holds the mappings of Yubikey token IDs to user names. The format is username:first_public_id:second_public_id:... default location of the file is
           $HOME/.yubico/authorized_yubikeys.

       id=id
           Set to your client identity.

       key=key
           Set to your client key in base64 format. The client key is also known as API key, and provides integrity in the communication between the client (you) and the validation server. If you want to get
           one for use with the default YubiCloud service, please go to https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/

       alwaysok
           Set to enable all authentication attempts to succeed (aka presentation mode).

       try_first_pass
           Before prompting the user for their password, the module first tries the previous stacked module´s password in case that satisfies this module as well.

       use_first_pass
           The argument use_first_pass forces the module to use a previous stacked modules password and will never prompt the user - if no password is available or the password is not appropriate, the user
           will be denied access.

       nullok
           If set, don’t fail when there are no tokens declared for the user in the authorization mapping files or in LDAP. This can be used to make YubiKey authentication optional unless the user has
           associated tokens.

       urllist=list
           List of URL templates to be used. This is set by calling ykclient_set_url_bases. The list should be in the format:
           https://api1.example.com/wsapi/2.0/verify;https://api2.example.com/wsapi/2.0/verify

       url=url
           This option should not be used, please use the urllist option instead. Set the URL template to use, this is set by calling ykclient_set_url_template. The URL should be set in the format
           https://api.example.com/wsapi/2.0/verify?id=%d&otp=%s

       capath=path
           Specify the path where X509 certificates are stored. This is required if https or ldaps are used in url and ldap_uri respectively.

       proxy=proxy
           Specify a proxy to connect to the validation server. Valid schemes are http://, https://, socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h://. Socks5h asks the proxy to do the dns resolving. If no
           scheme or port is specified HTTP proxy port 1080 will be used. E.g. socks5h://user:pass@10.10.0.1:1080

       verbose_otp
           This argument is used to show the OTP (One Time Password) when it is entered, i.e. to enable terminal echo of entered characters. You are advised to not use this, if you are using two factor
           authentication because that will display your password on the screen. This requires the service using the PAM module to display custom fields. This option can not be used with OpenSSH.

       ldap_uri=uri
           Specify the LDAP server URI (e.g. ldap://localhost).

       ldap_server=server
           Specify the LDAP server host (default LDAP port is used).  Deprecated. Use ldap_uri instead.

       ldapdn=dn
           The dn where the users are stored (eg: ou=users,dc=domain,dc=com). If ldap_filter is used this is the base from which the subtree search will be performed.

       user_attr=attr
           The LDAP attribute used to store user names (eg:cn).

       yubi_attr=attr
           The LDAP attribute used to store the Yubikey id.

       yubi_attr_prefix=prefix
           The prefix of the LDAP attribute’s value, in case of a generic attribute, used to store several types of ids.

       token_id_length=length
           Length of ID prefixing the OTP (this is 12 if using the YubiCloud).

       ldap_bind_user=user
           The user to attempt a LDAP bind as.

       ldap_bind_password=password
           The password to use on LDAP bind.

       ldap_filter=filter
           An ldap filter to use for attempting to find the correct object in LDAP. In this string %u will be replaced with the username.

       ldap_cacertfile=cacertfile
           Ca certfile for the LDAP connection.

       chalresp_path=path
           Path of a system wide directory where challenge response files can be found for users. Default location is $HOME/.yubico/

EXAMPLES
           auth sufficient pam_yubico.so id=16 debug

           auth required pam_yubico.so mode=challenge-response

           auth required pam_yubico.so id=16 ldap_uri=ldaps://ldap.example.com ldap_filter=(uid=%u) yubi_attr=yubiKeyId

FILES
       $HOME/.yubico/authorized_yubikeys
           If authfile is not set this file is used for the mapping between YubiKey public id and in client mode.

       $HOME/.yubico/challenge, $HOME/.yubico/challenge-serial_number
           If chalresp_path is not set these files are used to hold next challenge and expected response for the user in challenge-response mode. If chalresp_path is set the filename will be username instead
           of challenge.
