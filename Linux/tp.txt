NAME
       tp - a pure perl pager

SYNOPSIS
           tp -[JSenrs] [-cols] [-f STR] [-j|+ #] [-p|+/ STR] [FILE]...

OPTIONS
       -e  Exit at end of file.

       -f STR
           If defined, the pager will pause when the character sequence specified by STR is encountered in the input text.

           The default value when enabled is formfeed i.e; ^L; in order to mimic traditional behavior of "1" in more, but due to the pecularities of Getopt::Long> you need to use the -- argument separator in
           order to to trigger this e.g;

               tp -f -- foo #pauses on lines in foo with "^L" in them

           You might also supply a regular expression as STR e.g;

               tp -f '[ie]t' bar #pauses on lines in bar with "it" or "et" in them

       -J  Add a column with markers indicating which lines match a search expression.

       -n  Display line numbering. Toggleable at run time with #.

       -r  Send raw control characters from input unadulterated to the terminal.  By default, chracters other than tab and newline will be converted to caret notation e.g; ^@ for null or ^L for form feed.

       -s  Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.

       -S  Do not fold long lines.

       -[ or --scrollbar
           Display an interactive scrollbar in the right-most column.

       -$ or --tail
           Keep checking the displayed file for new content.  Only available when paging a single file.

       --cols
           Set the number of columns for the pager.

           If absent, the terminal is queried directly with Term::ReadKey if loaded or "stty" or "tput", and if these fail it defaults to 80.

Options

ENVIRONMENT
       tp checks the LESS, MORE, TPOPT, TERM and TERMCAP variables.

       The TPOPT variable is used to set options explicitly for tp, by concatenating undecorated options together e.g; Sr for squished raw output.

       LESS and MORE are checked for options that tp supports, and if detected they are enabled.
