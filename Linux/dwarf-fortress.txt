NOTES
       Dwarf  Fortress  as published on http://bay12games.com/dwarves/ does not support installing data and library files to different locations.  This version of Dwarf Fortress works around this by
       creating a temporary directory in /tmp and symlinking all relevant game data and binaries there.  This makes it possible to supply additional data  files  in  /usr/local/share/dwarf-fortress/
       and $XDG_DATA_HOME/dwarf-fortress/.  Modifications made by Dwarf Fortress will be retained in the latter directory.
