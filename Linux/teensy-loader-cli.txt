NAME
       teensy_loader_cli - load and run programs onto your Teensy micro controller

SYNOPSIS
       teensy_loader_cli --mcu MCU [-w] [-r] [-s] [-n] [-b] [-v] [-h] file.hex

DESCRIPTION
       The  teensy loader cli is a command-line alternative to the graphical teensy loader which is included with Teensyduino. The cli version is preferred by advanced users who want to automate program‐
       ming, typically from within a Makefile or similar.

OPTIONS
       --mcu  Specify which connected Teensy controller to work with (e.g. TEENSY36). To list supported MCUs, use:

                   teensy_loader_cli --list-mcus

       -w     Wait for device to appear

       -r     Use hard reboot if device not online.

              This option requires another Teensy to be connected, running the rebootor firmware.

       -s     Use soft reboot if device not online (Teensy 3.x only)

       -n     No reboot after programming

       -b     Boot only, do not program

       -v     Verbose output
