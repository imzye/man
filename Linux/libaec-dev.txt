NAME
       aec - compress or expand files

SYNOPSIS
       aec [-3] [-b BYTES] [-d] [-j SAMPLES] [-m] [-n BITS] [-N] [-p] [-r BLOCKS] [-s] [-t] infile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       Aec performs lossless compression and decompression with Golomb-Rice coding as defined in the Space Data System recommended standard 121.0-B-3.

OPTIONS
        -3    24 bit samples are stored in 3 bytes

        -b BYTES
              internal buffer size in bytes

        -d    decompress infile; if option -d is not used then compress infile

        -j SAMPLES
              block size in samples

        -m    samples are MSB first; default is LSB first

        -n BITS
              bits per sample

        -N    disable pre/post processing

        -p    pad RSI to byte boundary

        -r BLOCKS
              reference sample interval in blocks

        -s    samples are signed; default is unsigned

        -t    use restricted set of code options

                                                                                                                                                                                                AEC(1)
