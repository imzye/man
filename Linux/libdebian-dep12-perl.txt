NAME
       Debian::DEP12 - interface to Debian DEP 12 format

SYNOPSIS
           use Debian::DEP12;

           my $meta = Debian::DEP12->new;
           $meta->set( 'Bug-Database',
                       'https://github.com/merkys/Debian-DEP12/issues' );

           $meta->validate;

DESCRIPTION
       Debian::DEP12 is an object-oriented interface for Debian DEP 12 format, also known as debian/upstream/metadata. Primary focus of the initial development is the validation and fixing of DEP 12
       data.

       DEP 12 is in draft state and the development is happening in its wiki page (<https://wiki.debian.org/UpstreamMetadata>). Thus Debian::DEP12 attempts to keep up with the DEP 12 specification. To
       keep track, the UTC timestamp of DEP 12 wiki page is stored in $DEP12_VERSION class variable.

       Contributions welcome!

METHODS
   new( $what )
       Creates a new Debian::DEP12 instance from either YAML, Text::BibTeX::Entry or Text::BibTeX::File instances, or plain Perl hash reference with DEP 12 fields and their values.

   fields()
       Returns an array of fields defined in the instance in any order.

   get( $field )
       Returns value of a field.

   set( $field, $value )
       Sets a new value for a field. Returns the old value.

   delete( $field )

   to_YAML()
       Returns a string with YAML representation.

   validate()
       Performs checks of DEP 12 data in the instance and returns an array of validation messages as instances of Debian::DEP12::ValidationWarning.
