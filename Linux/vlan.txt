NAME
       /etc/network/interfaces (vlan) - legacy VLAN extensions for the interfaces(5) file format

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/network/interfaces  contains network interface configuration information for the ifup(8) and ifdown(8) commands.  This manpage describes the VLAN extensions to the standard interfaces(5) file
       format.

       Primary extensions exist to make and destroy VLAN interfaces, secondary extensions exist for IPv4 interface manipulation which are generally needed when using (a lot of) VLANs.

VLAN CREATION
       VLAN interface definitions exist of the VLAN interface name, and an optional ´raw-device´ parameter.  Vlan interfaces are numbered 1 to 4095.  You have the option to  have  interface  names  zero-
       padded to 4 numbers, or just the plain digits without leading zero.  The following example shows four ways to create a VLAN with id 1 on interface eth0.  They all result in different names.

        iface eth0.1 inet static
             address 192.168.1.1
             netmask 255.255.255.0

        iface vlan1 inet static
             vlan-raw-device eth0
             address 192.168.1.1
             netmask 255.255.255.0

        iface eth0.0001 inet static
             address 192.168.1.1
             netmask 255.255.255.0

        iface vlan0001 inet static
             vlan-raw-device eth0
             address 192.168.1.1
             netmask 255.255.255.0

        # We don't have br support out of the box
        iface br0.2 inet static
             vlan-raw-device br0
             address 192.168.1.1
             netmask 255.255.255.0

        # Aliases are ignored
        iface br0.2:1 inet static
             address 192.168.1.1
             netmask 255.255.255.255

EXTRA IFACE OPTIONS
       Usually someone who uses vlans also wants to do some other manipulations with the ip stack or interface.

       vlan-raw-device devicename
              Indicates the device to create the vlan on.  This is ignored when the devicename is part of the vlan interface name.

       ip-proxy-arp 0|1
              Turn proxy-arp off or on for this specific interface.  This also works on plain ethernet like devices.

       ip-rp-filter 0|1|2
              Set the return path filter for this specific interface.  This also works on plain ethernet like devices.

       hw-mac-address mac-address
              This sets the mac address of the interface before bringing it up.  This works on any device that allows setting the hardware address with the ip command.
