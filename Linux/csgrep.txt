NAME
       csgrep - filter the list of defects by the specified regex-based predi‐
       cates

SYNOPSIS
       csgrep [options] [file1.err [...]], where options are:

DESCRIPTION
       --checker arg
              defect matches if its checker matches the given regex (each  de‐
              fect has assigned exactly one checker)

       --path arg
              defect  matches  if  the path of its key event matches the given
              regex

       --event arg
              defect matches if its key event matches the  given  regex  (each
              defect  has exactly one key event, which determines its location
              in the code)

       --error arg
              defect matches if the message of its key event matches the given
              regex

       --msg arg
              defect matches if any of its messages matches the given regex

       --annot arg
              defect matches if its annotation matches the given regex

       --src-annot arg
              defect matches if an annotation in the _source_ file matches the
              given regex

       --drop-scan-props
              do not propagate scan properties

       -U [ --embed-context ] arg
              embed a number of lines of context from the source file for  the
              key event

       --prune-events arg
              event  is  preserved  if  its verbosity level is below the given
              number

       -u [ --remove-duplicates ]
              remove defects that are not unique by their key event

       --strip-path-prefix arg
              string prefix to strip from path (applied after all filters)

       -i [ --ignore-case ]
              ignore case when matching regular expressions

       -v [ --invert-match ]
              select defects that do not match the selected criteria

       -n [ --invert-regex ]
              invert regular expressions in all predicates

       -f [ --filter-file ] arg
              read custom filtering rules from a file in JSON format

       --color
              use colorized console output (default if connected to  a  termi‐
              nal)

       --no-color
              do not use colorized console output

       -q [ --quiet ]
              do not report any parsing errors

       --mode arg (=grep)
              grep,   json,   evtstat,  files,  filestat,  grouped,  stat,  or
              dig_key_events

       --help print the usage of csgrep

       --version
              print the version of csgrep

OPTIONS
       The --filter-file option takes a list of JSON files  in  the  following
       format.  Missing replace entry is equal to replace : "".

           {
               "msg-filter" : [
                   {
                        "checker" : "DIVINE|SYMBIOTIC",
                        "regexp" : "memory"
                   },
                   {
                        "checker" : "COMPILER_WARNING",
                        "regexp" : "called on unallocated object",
                        "replace" : "called correctly, no UB here"
                   }
               ]
           }

EXIT STATUS
       csgrep  exits  with status 0 if arguments are valid and input files are
       parsed successfully.  It does  not  matter  whether  any  defects  were
       matched or not.

EXAMPLE - CHECKERS, EVENTS, MESSAGES
       Error: FORWARD_NULL (CWE-476):
       libhsm.c:1168: assign_zero: Assigning: key_handles = NULL.
       libhsm.c:1210: var_deref_op: Dereferencing null pointer key_handles.

       In  the  above  example,  FORWARD_NULL is the checker , assign_zero and
       var_deref_op are events , where  var_deref_op  is  the  key  event  and
       "Dereferencing  null  pointer  key_handles."  is the message associated
       with the key event.

DESCRIPTION OF AVAILABLE MODES
       dig_key_events - for each defect, print only the checker and key event

       evtstat - print overall checker/key_event statistics  for  the  matched
       defects

       files  -  print  only names of error files that contain the matched de‐
       fects

       filestat - print statistics of matched defects  per  individual  source
       files

       grep  -  print matched defects using the same format as expected on the
       input

       grouped - print matched defects, grouped by error files they  originate
       from

       json - print matched defects in a JSON format

       stat  -  print overall statistics of the matched defects in given error
       files
