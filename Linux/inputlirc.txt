NAME
       inputlircd — zeroconf LIRC daemon using input event devices

SYNOPSIS
       inputlircd [-d socket] [-f] [-c] [-r repeat-rate] [-g] [-m keycode] [-n device name] [-u username] [-t path] [-N rc name] device [device ...]

DESCRIPTION
       inputlircd is a small LIRC daemon that reads from /dev/input/eventX devices and sends the received keycodes to connecting LIRC clients.  inputlircd needs no configuration, it uses the standardised
       names for the keycodes as used by the kernel.  Many USB remote controls that present HID devices, as well as multimedia keyboards should work out of the box.

       inputlircd expects a list of input event devices as commandline parameters.  It will only read events from those devices.

OPTIONS
       -d socket
             Location of the UNIX socket to which LIRC clients can connect.  The default is /run/lirc/lircd.

       -f    Run in the foreground.

       -c    Capture  modifier  keys.   This  causes the CTRL, SHIFT, ALT and META keys to be treated as modifer keys that, when used in combination with another keys, change the LIRC event from that key
             rather than being sent as their own LIRC events.

       -r repeat-rate
             Set the repeat rate (in milliseconds) of the remote control.  The default is 0. Repeated keys that arrive less than repeat-rate milliseconds apart will be flagged as as repeat LIRC events.

       -g    Grab the input device(s).  This gives inputlircd exclusive access to the input devices and stops events from propagating any further.

       -m keycode
             Minimum keycode to send to LIRC clients.  Keycodes lower than this number are filtered out.  The default is 88, this filters out the alphanumeric section and the  keypad  section  of  normal
             keyboards, but allows all extended keys.  The rationale is that clients should not be able to grab normal keypresses, this could be a security risk.

       -n device name
             Name of an input device to read events from.  This scans all available input event devices, and if the symbolic name of an event device matches device name, adds it to the list of devices to
             read from.  The device name can contain wildcard patterns, see glob(7).  To get a list of available devices and their names, cat /proc/bus/input/devices or use lsinput(8).

       -u username
             Set user and group id to that of username after opening the devices and UNIX socket as root.  The default is nobody.

       -t path
             Provides  the  path to a file containing a mapping between input event key names and the commands which should be reported via lirc. The files should contain lines of the form KEY_FOO = bar.
             This is useful for backward compatibility.  The default is not to use a translation table.

       -N rc name
             Set the remote control name, that is, a value of the last field of LIRC broadcast messages.  If there is more than one input event device, the specified name will be used for  all  of  them.
             If rc name is not specified, the filesystem path of each input event device will be used as its remote control name.

       device
             One  or  more  input  event devices.  If you want to use inputlircd to process multimedia keys on the keyboard, then /dev/input/event0 is the most likely choice.  If you have other input de‐
             vices, such as USB remote controllers that act like a HID device, then you probably need one of the other event devices present.  See /proc/bus/input/devices for a list  of  available  input
             devices.  If unsure, you can add all available input event devices.

FILES
       /run/lirc/lircd
               Default location of the UNIX socket to which LIRC clients can connect.

       /dev/input/eventX
               The kernel input layer's event device files.

       /proc/bus/input/devices
               List of all input devices.
