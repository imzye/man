NAME
       axiom - A general purpose computer algebra system

SYNOPSIS

       [-ht |-noht]
              whether to use HyperDoc

       [-gr |-nogr]
              whether to use Graphics

              whether to use Clef

       [-nag |-nonag]
              whether to use NAG

       [-iw |-noiw]
              start in interpreter window

       [-ihere|-noihere]
              start an interpreter buffer in the original window.

       [-nox] don't use X Windows

       [-go |-nogo]

       [-ws wsname]
              use named workspace

       [-list]
              list workspaces only

       [-h]   show usage

       By default, the command axiom would start the process

DESCRIPTION
       axiom  is  a  fomerly proprietary, newly open-source, interactive computer algebra program.  Opensource axiom now has support for both graphics and the hyperdoc help system.  Please refer to these
       facilities for detailed usage instructions. This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       A good but slightly out of date source of documentation can be found in the book Axiom: The Scientific Computation System, by Richard D. Jenks and Robert S. Sutor available through amazon.com.   A
       pdf version of this book is now included in the axiom-doc package.

FILES
       ~/.axiom.input
              The personal Axiom initialization file, executed at startup
