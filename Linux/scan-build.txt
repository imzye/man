DESCRIPTION
     scan-build is a Perl script that invokes the Clang static analyzer.  Op‐
     tions used by scan-build or by the analyzer appear first, followed by the
     build_command and any build_options normally used to build the target
     system.

     The static analyzer employs a long list of checking algorithms, see
     CHECKERS.  Output can be written in standard .plist and/or HTML format.

     The following options are supported:

     -analyze-headers
             Also analyze functions in #included files.

     -enable-checker checker_name, -disable-checker checker_name
             Enable/disable checker_name.  See CHECKERS.

     -h, --help
             Display this message.

     --help-checkers
             List default checkers, see CHECKERS.

     --html-title[=title]
             Specify the title used on generated HTML pages.  A default title
             is generated if title is not specified.

     -k, --keep-going
             Add a “keep on going” option to build_command.  Currently sup‐
             ports make and xcodebuild. This is a convenience option; one can
             specify this behavior directly using build options.

     -o      Target directory for HTML report files.  Subdirectories will be
             created as needed to represent separate invocations of the ana‐
             lyzer.  If this option is not specified, a directory is created
             in /tmp (TMPDIR on Mac OS X) to store the reports.

     -plist  Output the results as a set of .plist files. (By default the out‐
             put of scan-build is a set of HTML files.)

     -plist-html
             Output the results as a set of HTML and .plist files

     --status-bugs
             Set exit status to 1 if it found potential bugs and 0 otherwise.
             By default the exit status of scan-build is that returned by
             build_command.

     --use-c++[=compiler_path]
             Guess the default compiler for your C++ and Objective-C++ code.
             Use this option to specify an alternate compiler.

     --use-cc[=compiler_path]
             Guess the default compiler for your C and Objective-C code. Use
             this option to specify an alternate compiler.

     -v      Verbose output from scan-build and the analyzer. A second and
             third v increases verbosity.

     -V, --view
             View analysis results in a web browser when the build completes.

     -constraints [model]
             Specify the contraint engine used by the analyzer.  By default
             the ‘range’ model is used.  Specifying ‘basic’ uses a simpler,
             less powerful constraint model used by checker-0.160 and earlier.

     -maxloop N
             Specify the number of times a block can be visited before giving
             up. Default is 4. Increase for more comprehensive coverage at a
             cost of speed.

     -no-failure-reports
             Do not create a ‘failures’ subdirectory that includes analyzer
             crash reports and preprocessed source files.

     -stats  Generates visitation statistics for the project being analyzed.

     -store [model]
             Specify the store model used by the analyzer. By default, the
             ‘region’ store model is used.  ‘region’ specifies a field- sensi‐
             tive store model. Users can also specify ‘basic’ which is far
             less precise but can more quickly analyze code.  ‘basic’ was the
             default store model for checker-0.221 and earlier.

EXIT STATUS
     scan-build returns the value returned by build_command unless
     --status-bugs or --keep-going is used.

CHECKERS
     The checkers listed below may be enabled/disabled using the
     -enable-checker and -disable-checker options.  A default group of check‐
     ers is run unless explicitly disabled.  Exactly which checkers constitute
     the default group is a function of the operating system in use; they are
     listed with --help-checkers.

EXAMPLE
     scan-build -o /tmp/myhtmldir make -j4

     The above example causes analysis reports to be deposited into a subdi‐
     rectory of /tmp/myhtmldir and to run make with the -j4 option.  A differ‐
     ent subdirectory is created each time scan-build analyzes a project.  The
     analyzer should support most parallel builds, but not distributed builds.
