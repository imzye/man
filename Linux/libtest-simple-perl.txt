NAME
       Test2::Bundle::More - ALMOST a drop-in replacement for Test::More.

DESCRIPTION
       This bundle is intended to be a (mostly) drop-in replacement for Test::More. See "KEY DIFFERENCES FROM Test::More" for details.

SYNOPSIS
           use Test2::Bundle::More;

           ok(1, "pass");

           ...

           done_testing;

PLUGINS
       This loads Test2::Plugin::ExitSummary.

TOOLS
       These are from Test2::Tools::Basic. See Test2::Tools::Basic for details.

       ok($bool, $name)
       pass($name)
       fail($name)
       skip($why, $count)
       $todo = todo($why)
       diag($message)
       note($message)
       plan($count)
       skip_all($why)
       done_testing()
       BAIL_OUT($why)

       These are from Test2::Tools::ClassicCompare. See Test2::Tools::ClassicCompare for details.

       is($got, $want, $name)
       isnt($got, $donotwant, $name)
       like($got, qr/match/, $name)
       unlike($got, qr/mismatch/, $name)
       is_deeply($got, $want, "Deep compare")
       cmp_ok($got, $op, $want, $name)

       These are from Test2::Tools::Class. See Test2::Tools::Class for details.

       isa_ok($thing, @classes)
       can_ok($thing, @subs)

       This is from Test2::Tools::Subtest. It is called subtest_streamed() in that package.

       subtest $name => sub { ... }

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM Test::More
       You cannot plan at import.
           THIS WILL NOT WORK:

               use Test2::Bundle::More tests => 5;

           Instead you must plan in a separate statement:

               use Test2::Bundle::More;
               plan 5;

       You have three subs imported for use in planning
           Use plan($count), skip_all($reason), or done_testing() for your planning.

       isa_ok accepts different arguments
           "isa_ok" in Test::More was:

               isa_ok($thing, $isa, $alt_thing_name);

           This was very inconsistent with tools like "can_ok($thing, @subs)".

           In Test2::Bundle::More, isa_ok() takes a $thing and a list of @isa.

               isa_ok($thing, $class1, $class2, ...);

   THESE FUNCTIONS AND VARIABLES HAVE BEEN REMOVED
       $TODO
           See todo().

       use_ok()
       require_ok()
           These are not necessary. Use "use" and "require" directly. If there is an error loading the module the test will catch the error and fail.

       todo_skip()
           Not necessary.

       eq_array()
       eq_hash()
       eq_set()
           Discouraged in Test::More.

       explain()
           This  started  a  fight  between  Test  developers,  who may now each write their own implementations in Test2. (See explain in Test::Most vs Test::More.  Hint: Test::Most wrote it first, then
           Test::More added it, but broke compatibility).

       new_ok()
           Not necessary.
