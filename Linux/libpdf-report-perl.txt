NAME
       PDF::Report - A wrapper written for PDF::API2

SYNOPSIS
               use PDF::Report;

           my $pdf = new PDF::Report(%opts);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a wrapper for Alfred Reibenschuh's PDF::API2 Defines methods to create PDF reports

VERSION
        1.36

METHODS
   new
       my $pdf = new PDF::Report(%opts);

               Creates a new pdf report object.
               If no %opts are specified the module
               will use the factory defaults.

       Example:

               my $pdf = new PDF::Report(PageSize => "letter",
                                         PageOrientation => "Landscape");

               my $pdf = new PDF::Report(File => $file);

       %opts:

               PageSize - '4A', '2A', 'A0', 'A1', 'A2',
                          'A3', 'A4', 'A5', 'A6', '4B',
                          '2B', 'B0', 'B1', 'B2', 'B3',
                          'B4', 'B5', 'B6', 'LETTER',
                          'BROADSHEET', 'LEDGER', 'TABLOID',
                          'LEGAL', 'EXECUTIVE', '36X36'

               PageOrientation - 'Portrait', 'Landscape'

   newpage
       $pdf->newpage($nopage);

       Creates a new blank page.  Pass $nopage = 1 to toggle page numbering.

   openpage
       $pdf->openpage($index);

       If no index is specified, this will open the last page of the document.

   importpage
       Import page from another PDF document, see PDF::API2

   clonepage
       Clone page within document, see PDF::API2

   getPageDimensions
       ($pagewidth, $pageheight) = $pdf->getPageDimensions();

       Returns the width and height of the page according to what page size chosen in "new".

   addRawText
       $pdf->addRawText($text, $x, $y, $color, $underline, $indent, $rotate);

       Add $text at position $x, $y with $color, $underline, $indent and/or $rotate.

       PDF::API2 Removes all space between every word in the string you pass and then rejoins each word with one space.  If you want to use a string with more than one space between words for formatting
       purposes, you can either use the hack below or change PDF::API2 (that's what I did ;).  The code below may or may not work according to what font you are using.  I used 2 \xA0 per space because
       that worked for the Helvetica font I was using.

       To use a fixed width string with more than one space between words, you can do something like:

           sub replaceSpace {
             my $text = shift;
             my $nbsp = "\xA0";
             my $new = '';
             my @words = split(/ /, $text);
             foreach my $word (@words) {
               if (length($word)) {
                 $new.=$word . ' ';
               } else {
                 $new.=$nbsp . $nbsp;
               }
             }
             chop($new);
             return $new;
           }

   setAddTextPos
       $pdf->setAddTextPos($hPos, $vPos);

       Set the position on the page.  Used by the addText function.

   getAddTextPos
       ($hPos, $vPos) = $pdf->getAddTextPos();

       Return the (x, y) value of the text position.

   setAlign
       $pdf->setAlign($align);

       Set the justification of the text.  Used by the addText function.

   getAlign
       $align = $pdf->getAlign();

       Returns the text justification.

   wrapText
       $newtext = $pdf->wrapText($text, $width);

       This is a helper function called by addText, which can be called by itself.  wrapText() wraps $text within $width.

   addText
       $pdf->addText($text, $hPos, $textWidth, $textHeight);

       Takes $text and prints it to the current page at $hPos.  You may just want to pass this function $text if the text is "pre-wrapped" and setAddTextPos has been called previously.  Pass a $hPos to
       change the position the text will be printed on the page.  Pass a  $textWidth and addText will wrap the text for you.  $textHeight controls the row height.

   addParagraph
       $pdf->addParagraph($text, $hPos, $vPos, $width, $height, $indent, $lead);

       Add $text at ($hPos, $vPos) within $width and $height, with $indent.  $indent is the number of spaces at the beginning of the first line.

   centerString
       $pdf->centerString($a, $b, $yPos, $text);

       Centers $text between points $a and $b at position $yPos.  Be careful how much text you try to jam between those points, this function shrinks the text till it fits!

   setRowHeight
   getStringWidth
       $pdf->getStringWidth($String);

       Returns the width of $String according to the current font and fontsize being used.

   addImg
       $pdf->addImg($file, $x, $y);

       Add image $file to the current page at position ($x, $y).

   addImgScaled
       $pdf->addImgScaled($file, $x, $y, $scale);

       Add image $file to the current page at position ($x, $y) scaled to $scale.

   setGfxLineWidth
       $pdf->setGfxLineWidth($width);

       Set the line width drawn on the page.

   getGfxLineWidth
       $width = $pdf->getGfxLineWidth();

       Returns the current line width.

   drawLine
       $pdf->drawLine($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2);

       Draw a line on the current page starting at ($x1, $y1) and ending at ($x2, $y2).

   drawRect
       $pdf->drawRect($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2);

       Draw a rectangle on the current page.  Top left corner is represented by ($x1, $y1) and the bottom right corner is ($x2, $y2).

   shadeRect
       $pdf->shadeRect($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, $color);

       Shade a rectangle with $color.  Top left corner is ($x1, $y1) and the bottom right corner is ($x2, $y2).

   drawPieGraph
       $pdf->drawPieGraph($x, $y, $size, $rData, $rLabels);

       Method to create a piegraph using a reference to an array of values.  It also takes a reference to an array for labels for each data value.  A legend with all the colors and labels will appear  if

   getcolors

   drawBarcode
       $pdf->drawBarcode($x, $y, $scale, $frame, $type, $code, $extn, $umzn,
                               $lmzn, $zone, $quzn, $spcr, $ofwt, $fnsz, $text);

       This  is  really not that complicated, trust me! ;) I am pretty unfamiliar with barcode lingo and types so if I get any of this wrong, lemme know!  This is a very flexible way to draw a barcode on
       your PDF document.  $x and $y represent the center of the barcode's position on the document.  $scale is the size of the entire barcode 1 being 1:1, which is all you'll need most likely.  $type is
       the type of barcode which can be codabar, 2of5int, 3of9, code128, or ean13.  $code is the alpha-numeric code which the barcode  will  represent.   $extn  is  the  extension  to  the  $code,  where
       applicable.   $umzn  is  the  upper  mending  zone and $lmzn is the lower mending zone. $zone is the the zone or height of the bars.  $quzn is the quiet zone or the space between the frame and the
       barcode.  $spcr is what to put between each number/character in the text.  $ofwt is the overflow width.  $fnsz is the fontsize used for the text.  $text is optional text beneathe the barcode.

   setFont
       $pdf->setFont($font);

       Creates a new font object of type $font to be used in the page.

   getFont
       $fontname = $pdf->getFont();

       Returns the font name currently being used.

   setSize
       $pdf->setSize($size);

       Sets the fontsize to $size.  Called before setFont().

   getSize
       $fontsize = $pdf->getSize();

       Returns the font size currently being used.

   pages
       $pages = $pdf->pages();

       The number of pages in the document.

   setInfo
       $pdf->setInfo(%infohash);

       Sets the info structure of the document.  Valid keys for %infohash: Creator, Producer, CreationDate, Title, Subject, Author, etc.

   getInfo
       %infohash = $pdf->getInfo();

       Gets meta-data from the info structure of the document.  Valid keys for %infohash: Creator, Producer, CreationDate, Title, Subject, Author, etc.

   saveAs
       Saves the document to a file.

         # Save the document as "file.pdf"
         my $fileName = "file.pdf";
         $pdf->saveAs($fileName);

   Finish
       Returns the PDF document as text.  Pass your own custom routine to do things on the footer of the page.  Pass 'roman' for Roman Numeral page numbering.

               # Hand the document to the web browser
               print "Content-type: application/pdf\n\n";
               print $pdf->Finish();

   getPDFAPI2Object
       Object method returns underlying PDF::API2 object
