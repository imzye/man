NAME
       ps_mem - Memory profiling tool

SYNOPSIS
       ps_mem [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Display the core memory used per program (not per process)

       In detail it reports:

              sum (private RAM for program processes) +
              sum (shared RAM for program processes)

       The  shared RAM is problematic to calculate, and the tool automatically
       selects the most accurate method available for the running kernel.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Show help message

       -p PID[,PID2,...PIDN]
              Show memory consumption for the specified processes

       -s --split-args
              Show and separate memory usage entries by command line arguments
              and not just the program name.

       -t --total
              Only  display  the  total  number of bytes for the selected pro‐
              cesses

       -w N   Report memory consumption every N seconds
