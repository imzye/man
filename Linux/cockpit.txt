NAME
       cockpit - Cockpit

DESCRIPTION
       Cockpit is a web accessible interactive admin interface for Linux machines. Cockpit can usually be accessed on port 9090 of the machine it's installed on. Cockpit starts on demand. Use your system
       credentials to log in.

COMPONENTS
       The cockpit-ws web service listens on port 9090 and is started on demand by systemd. The Cockpit web service authenticates the user, loads Cockpit into the browser, and starts cockpit-bridge in a
       Linux user session.

       The cockpit-bridge provides Cockpit in the web browser with access to the system APIs. It does this over its standard in and standard out. The bridge is started like a shell once per Linux user
       session.
