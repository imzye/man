DESCRIPTION
       The software package 4ti2 is a suite of command-line tools for addressing algebraic, geometric and combinatorial problems on linear spaces.

DATA STRUCTURE
       The  main  concept  of  4ti2  remains the same: a project is defined via a file foo[.mat] containing the problem matrix.  Related sets such as Graver basis or Markov basis are put into foo.gra and
       foo.mar, respectively.

       Input files and output files usually contain a matrix or a list of vectors (written as a matrix) in a standard encoding such as
         2 4
         1 1 1 1
         1 2 3 4

       There are only few exceptions, for example in a file foo.vars containing user specified variable names:
         3
         a b x
