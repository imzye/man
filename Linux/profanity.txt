NAME
       /connect - the Profanity /connect command.

DESCRIPTION
       Login to a chat service. If no account is specified, the default is used if one is configured. A local account is created with the JID as it's name if it doesn't already exist. In case you want to
       connect to a server via SASL ANONYMOUS (c.f. XEP-0175) you can also do that.

SYNOPSIS
       /connect [<account>]

       /connect <account> [server <server>] [port <port>] [tls force|allow|trust|legacy|disable] [auth default|legacy]

       /connect <server>

ARGUMENTS
       <account>
           The local account you wish to connect with, or a JID if connecting for the first time.

       server <server>
           Supply a server if it is different to the domain part of your JID.

       port <port>
           The port to use if different to the default (5222, or 5223 for SSL).

       <server>
           Connect to said server in an anonymous way. (Be aware: There aren't many servers that support this.)

       tls force
           Force TLS connection, and fail if one cannot be established, this is default behaviour.

       tls allow
           Use TLS for the connection if it is available.

       tls trust
           Force TLS connection and trust server's certificate.

       tls legacy
           Use legacy TLS for the connection. It means server doesn't support STARTTLS and TLS is forced just after TCP connection is established.

       tls disable
           Disable TLS for the connection.

       auth default
           Default authentication process.

       auth legacy
           Allow legacy authentication.
