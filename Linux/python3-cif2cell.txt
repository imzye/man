SYNOPSIS
       cif2cell FILE [-p PROGRAM] [other options]

DESCRIPTION
       A  program for generating input lattice structures to various electronic structure programs from a CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) file.  This code was published in Comput. Phys. Com‐
       mun. 182, 1183 (2011). Please cite generously.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --version
              Print version number.

       -v, --verbose
              Be as verbose as possible.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress all but explicitly requested screen output.  Overrides --verbose flag.

              General options:

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Input CIF file, unless given as first argument to the program.

       -p PROGRAM, --program=PROGRAM
              The electronic structure code you want to create input file(s) for. Currently supports: abinit, ase, atat, bmdl, castep, cellgen, cfg, cif, coo, cp2k, cpmd, crymol,  crystal09,  elk,  emto,
              exciting, fhi-aims, fleur, hutsepot, kfcd, kgrn, kstr, lammps, mopac, ncol, pwscf, quantum-espresso, rspt, shape, siesta, spacegroup, spc, sprkkr, vasp, xband, xyz. This keyword is case in‐
              sensitive.

       -o FILE, --outputfile=FILE
              Name of output file (if other than default for you electronic structure code).

       -a, --append
              Append the output to given output file rather than overwriting.

       --grammar=GRAMMAR
              Set the CIF grammar to be used when parsing the input file (default is 1.1).

       --which-filename
              If given together with the --program option, the name of the output file will be printed to screen.

       -b BLOCK, --block=BLOCK
              Block of data in input file (if there are more than one block in the CIF file).

              Cell generation options:

       --no-reduce
              Do not reduce to the primitive cell.

       --force
              Attempt  to force generation of output file despite problems and/or ambiguities in the input file. There are no guarantees that what you get makes sense, but the program makes an honest at‐
              tempt. Implies --forcealloy.

       --force-alloy
              Force generation of output file for an alloy compound for an electronic structure code that does not implement any alloy theory (such as CPA).

       --vca  Set up an alloy using the virtual crystal approximation (VCA). Currently only supported by the CASTEP interface.

       --cartesian
              Make the program generate any output in cartesian coordinates.

       --coordinate-tolerance=COORDTOL
              Parameter for determining when two coordinates are the same (default=0.0002).

       --setup-all
              Make a more complete setup, not just the geometrical part. This is currently only available for mopac, pwscf, quantum-espresso, rspt, vasp.

       --k-resolution=KRESOLUTION
              The desired resolution in k-space (default=0.2). Used for generating k-space grid options if --setup-all is specified.

       --transform-cell=[[],[],[]]
              Transformation matrix applied to the lattice vectors and the symmetry operations if you, for example, want to realign the cell.

       --body-centred-setting=0,1
              If set to 1, use the more symmetrical set of primitive translation vectors used for the bcc structure also for other body-centred crystals.

       --cubic-diagonal-z
              Set up cubic cell with [111] direction along the z-axis.

       --rhombohedral-diagonal
              Set up rhombohedral cell with threefold axis along pseudocubic [111] direction.

       --random-displacements=displacementsize
              Randomly displace all atoms. Depending on the distribution, the displacement size is either the maximal displacement (for uniform distribution) or the standard deviation (for gaussian  dis‐
              tribution) in Angstrom.

       --random-displacements-distribution=uniform/gaussian
              The distribution used for displacing the atoms.

       --export-cif-labels
              Export atom labels from the CIF file (currently only supported for castep and RSPt).

              Supercell generation options:

       --supercell=[k,l,m]/[[],[],[]]
              Three  integers  separated with commas and enclosed in square brackets that specify the dimensions of a supercell OR three vectors of integers that gives the map to the supercell to be con‐
              structed from the primitive cell. If combined with the --no-reduce option the supercell will instead be generated based on the conventional cell.

       --supercell-dimensions=[x,y,z]/[[],[],[]]
              Three numbers separated with commas and enclosed in square brackets that specify the desired ABSOLUTE dimensions of a supercell (in angstrom) OR three vectors of numbers that gives the  de‐
              sired lattice vectors. The program will automatically generate a supercell, attempting to get as close as possible to the desired dimensions.

       --supercell-vacuum=[k,l,m]
              Three numbers >=0 separated with commas and enclosed in square brackets that specify a number of unit cell units of vacuum to be added along the first, second or third of the generated lat‐
              tice vectors.

       --supercell-translation-vector=[k,l,m], --supercell-prevacuum-translation=[k,l,m]
              Three  numbers  separated with commas and enclosed in square brackets that specify a shift of all atomic positions in the cell prior to vacuum generation (in units of the lattice vectors of
              the supercell).

       --supercell-postvacuum-translation=[k,l,m]
              Three numbers separated with commas and enclosed in square brackets that specify a final shift of all atomic positions in the final cell (in units of the lattice vectors of the new cell).

       --supercell-realign=0,1
              Realign the supercell lattice vectors with respect to the cartesian reference frame. For orthorhombic cells, it puts the first, second and third lattice vectors along x, y  and  z,  respec‐
              tively.

       --supercell-sort=SUPERCELLSORT
              Sort  the  atom  positions by some scheme. Currently available are:  1) By cartesian coordinate - example: xzy will sort first on x then on z then on y.  2) by lattice vector - example: 132
              will sort first by lattice vector 1 then by lattice vector 3 and last by lattice vector 2.

              Surface generation options:

       --surface-wizard=[h,k,l]
              Three integers separated with commas and enclosed in square brackets that specify a (hkl) plane. The wizard will suggest a supercell map that gives the first  two  lattice  vectors  in  the
              (hkl) plane. The third lattice vector is selected as the [hkl] direction, or reasonably orthogonal to the (hkl) plane (if the [hkl] direction is far from orthogonal to this plane).

              Printing options:

       --print-digits=PRINTDIGITS
              Number of digits used when printing coordinates etc.  to screen (default=8). Useful if you need to tweak the screen output for cutting and pasting into some unsupported program. There is no
              point in going over 16 because of the floating point accuracy.

       --print-atomic-units
              Output lattice parameters in bohrradii rather than angstrom.

       --print-cartesian
              Atomic sites printed to screen in cartesian rather than lattice coordinates.

       --print-symmetry-operations
              Print symmetry operations of the generated cell.

       --print-seitz-matrices
              Print symmetry operations of the generated cell in Seitz matrix form.

       --print-charge-state, --print-oxidation-numbers
              Print information about the oxidation state from the CIF file.

       --print-reference-bibtex
              Print citation in BibTeX format and exit.

       --cellgen-map=[[k,l,m],[n,o,p],[q,r,s]]
              Nine integers separated with commas and enclosed three and three in square brackets (this is a matrix in Python) that specify the map to a supercell to be output for the RSPt supercell gen‐
              erator 'cellgen'.  Overrides --cellgen-supercell-dims.

       --cellgen-supercell-dimensions=[k,l,m]
              Three integers separated with commas and enclosed in square brackets that specify the dimensions of a supercell to be output to the RSPt supercell generator 'cellgen' (the diagonal elements

       --cellgen-reference-vector=[x,y,z]
