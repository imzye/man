NAME
       mha-decode - Decode MIME messages

SYNOPSIS
       mha-decode [options] mailfolder ...

       mha-decode [options] -single msg.822

DESCRIPTION
       mha-decode is a utility program that is part of the MHonArc software
       package.  mha-decode provides basic MIME decoding for mail messages.

       If given mail folders as input, all messages within in the mail folders
       will be decoded.  All message parts are written to files.  If a
       filename is specified for a message part, that filename will be used
       when writing the part to a file.  If no filename is specified in the
       message, a unique name will be used based upon the content-type of the
       message part.

       A single message can be decoded by using the "-single" option.

OPTIONS
       mha-decode takes options available to mhonarc, but only those options
       affect parsing of mail folders are applicable: "-conlen", "-mhpattern",
       "-msgsep", "-noconlen", "-outdir", "-perlinc", "-rcfile", "-single",
       "-umask".

       Also, mha-decode supports the following additional options:

       "-dcd-digest"
           Run in message digest mode.  When this option is specified, any
           embedded "message/rfc822" and "message/news" parts will be saved
           instead of recursively decoding any parts contained within.
