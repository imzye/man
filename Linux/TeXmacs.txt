NAME
       GNU TeXmacs - a WYSIWYG mathematical text editor

SYNOPSIS
       texmacs [OPTION]... [SOURCE]...

INTRODUCTION
       GNU  TeXmacs  is  a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured documents via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user
       friendly interface.  New styles may be created by the user. The program implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which help you to produce professionally looking documents.

       The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface for computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the  Guile/Scheme
       extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write your own extensions to the editor.

       TeXmacs  currently  runs on PC's and PPC's under Gnu/linux (a >200MHz processor and >32Mb of memory are recommended) and on sun computers. Converters exist for TeX/LaTeX and they are under development
       for Html/Mathml/Xml.  In the future, TeXmacs is planned to evoluate towards a complete scientific office suite, with spreadsheet capacities, a technical drawing editor and a presentation mode.

DESCRIPTION
       -b [file], --initialize-buffer [file]
              Uses [file] as a guile/scheme initialization file for TeXmacs buffers.

       -c [in] [out], --convert [in] [out]
              Convert input file [in] into output file [out].  The file formats are determined automatically from the suffixes and as a function of the contents of [in].  The argument list may  contain  sev‐
              eral conversion instructions and you will usually want to use this option in combination with --quit.

       -d, --debug
              Display most important debugging information.

       --debug-events
              Display all widget events.

       --debug-io
              Display all communicated data between TeXmacs and extern systems.

       --debug-all
              Turn all debugging flags on.

       --delete-cache
              This option deletes all files in the TeXmacs cache. TeXmacs uses several caches for speeding up font, file, directory and style file loading.  However, these optimizations may be incorrect when
              the user manually changes files in the TeXmacs distribution or when new fonts are added.  This is rarely the case for normal users, but sometimes necessary for TeXmacs developers.

       --delete-doc-cache
              This option is similar to --delete-cache, but only deletes the cache for accelerated help file loading.

       --delete-file-cache
              This option is similar to --delete-cache, but only deletes the cache for accelerated file loading.

       --delete-font-cache
              This option is similar to --delete-cache, but only deletes the cache for accelerated font loading.

       --delete-style-cache
              This option is similar to --delete-cache, but only deletes the cache for accelerated style file loading.

       -fn [font], --font [font]
              Sets the default TeX fonts for menus and so to [font].  The [font] is of the form [name], [name][size] or [name][size]@[dpi].  For instance, ecss11@400 would give a sans serif font at 400  dpi.
              By default, the [size] is 11 and the [dpi] 300.

       -g [geom], --geometry [geom]
              Suggested  geometry  for TeXmacs windows.  Here [geom] may be a size [width x height] in pixels, like in `texmacs -g 600x480'.  It may also take the form [width x height [+|-] xoff [+|-] yoff],
              like in `texmacs -g 800x600-100+100'.

       -h, --help
              Display a help message, which lists the command line options of TeXmacs.

       -i [file], --initialize [file]
              Uses [file] as a guile/scheme initialization file for TeXmacs.

       -Oc, --no-char-clipping
              Faster but less perfect displaying of anti-aliased fonts.

       +Oc, --char-clipping
              High quality displaying of anti-aliased fonts (default).

       -p, --path
              Echo the TeXmacs path.

       -q, --quit
              Shortcut for the option -x "(quit-TeXmacs)".

       -r, --reverse
              Reverse video mode. This mode inverts and weakens the intensity of all colors.  This option is only available as a global start-up option. You cannot change it while running TeXmacs.

       -s, --silent
              Silent execution: less messages to standard output.

       -S, --setup
              Rerun the setup program before starting TeXmacs.  The setup program analyzes your TeX/LaTeX distribution and the plugins which are installed on your system.

       -v, --version
              Display the current TeXmacs version.

       -V, --verbose
              Display some informative messages.

       -x, --execute [cmd]
              Execute the scheme command [cmd] just after startup.  If you specify several -x options, then the corresponding scheme commands are executed in the same order.
