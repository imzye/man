NAME
       thrift  - code generator/compiler for Thrift IDL

SYNOPSIS
       thrift [options] source_file

DESCRIPTION
       Thrift  is  a  framework for efficient serialization and RPC services.  The thrift compiler accepts a source file containing definitions of Thrift structs and services, and generates the language-
       specific code to implement them.

OPTIONS
       -version
           print the compiler version and exit

       -o DIRECTORY
           Set the output directory for gen-* packages (default: current directory)

       -out DIRECTORY
           Set the ouput location for generated files. (no gen-* folder will be created)

       -I DIRECTORY
           Add a directory to the list of directories searched for include directives

       -nowarn
           Suppress all compiler warnings (BAD!)

       -strict
           Strict compiler warnings on

       -v[erbose]
           Verbose mode

       -r[ecurse]
           Also generate included files

       -debug
           Parse debug trace to stdout

       --gen STRING
           Generate code with a dynamically-registered generator. STRING has the form language[:key1=val1[,key2,[key3=val3]]].  Keys and values are options passed to the generator.  Many options will not
           require values.  For a complete list of supported generators, run thrift without arguments.
