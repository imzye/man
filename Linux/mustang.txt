NAME
       mustang -  a multiple structural alignment algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       mustang [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mustang command.

       Mustang is a program that implements an algorithm for structural alignment of multiple protein structures. Given a set of PDB files, the program uses the spatial information in the Calpha atoms of
       the  set to produce a sequence alignment.  Based on a progressive pairwise heuristic the algorithm then proceeds through a number of refinement passes. Mustang reports the multiple sequence align‐
       ment and the corresponding superposition of structures.

       To keep the command line short the user can write the path and file names into a (description) file and supply the description file at the command line using the '-f' option. For example  see  the
       file used to test the installation: '/usr/share/doc/mustang/examples/test_zf-CCHH'.

       PATH  should have a prefix '>'. When the program parses this file, it looks for the line starting with '>' symbol (whitespaces are ignored before and after the symbol). The PATH containing the PDB
       files of the structures to be aligned should follow. See for example: /usr/share/doc/mustang/examples/test_zf-CCHH'.

       FILENAMES should have a prefix '+' (whitespaces are ignored before and after this symbol).  If PATH is specified then only the filenames should be provided after the '+' symbol.  However, if  PATH
       line is NOT provided, then the absolute/relative paths of the structure files should be provided.

       The description file format is described further under the -f CmdLine option).

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -p <path>
              Path to the directory holding the (PDB) structures to be aligned.

       -i <struct-1> <struct-2>...
              Input  structures  to  be  aligned. Note: if -p option is used in the command line, supply only the file names of the structures; if not give the absolute/relative path of each of the input
              structures.

       -f <description file>
              This option is used to AVOID entering the path (-p) and file name (-i) details in the command line.  Instead, to keep the command line short, the user can enter the path and file  name  de‐
              tails  in  a "description" file and supply it in the command line.  The format of the "description file" is furher discussed in the 'DESCRIPTION' section above. Note: the options { -p , -i}
              and {-f} are mutually exclusive.

       -o <output identifier>
              A common identifier for various outputs of the program.  Appropriate extentions (e.g. <identifier>.html, <identifier>.pdb, <identifier>.msf) will be added to this  identifier  depending  on
              the options the user specifies in the command line.  DEFAULT output identifier: 'results'

       -F <format>
              Alignment output format. The choices for <format> are: 'html', 'fasta', ´pir´, 'msf'.  DEFAULT format: 'html'

       -D [CA-CA diameter]
              Produce  an  HTML  file where the the residues are reported in lower case with grey background when the aligned(superposed) CA-CA diamter of residues in a column of alignment is > the CA-CA
              diameter threshold.

       -s [<ON>/<OFF>]
              Generate a PDB file containing optimal superposition of all the structures based on the alignment.  DEFAULT: 'ON'.

       -r [<ON>/<OFF>]
              Print to a file rmsd table of multiple superposition along with rotation matrix and translation vector corresponding to each input structure.  DEFAULT: 'OFF'.

       --help display a help message and exits.

       --version
              output version information and exits.
