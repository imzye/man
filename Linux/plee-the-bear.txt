NAME
       plee-the-bear — 2D platform game

SYNOPSIS
       plee-the-bear

DESCRIPTION
       Plee the Bear is a 2D platform game like those we found on consoles in the beginning of the 90's. The basis of the scenario fit in few lines:

       Plee  the  Bear  wakes  up  late one afternoon after dreaming of his earlier years, when he traveled across the world with his belle at his side. Craving an afternoon snack, he sticks his arm in a
       nearby honey pot — only to find it empty! Upon discovering that all the pots in his house are empty, Plee thinks of his mischievous son and swears, "I'm gonna find that boy and give him the wallop
       he deserves."

       Following honey drops left on the ground, Plee reaches the edge of the forest, and his adventure begins.

       The current version is a demo.
