YAPET_CONFIG(5)                                                                                 YAPET_CONFIG                                                                                YAPET_CONFIG(5)

NAME
       yapet_config - format of a YAPET configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       yapet(1) reads the configuration file $HOME/.yapet if it exists unless a different file is specified by using the -r option, see yapet(1). Options given on the command line override options given
       in a configuration file.

       The configuration file has the following syntax:

           option=value

       where option can be any of the following:

       colors
           (String) Set custom colors. See yapet_colors(5) for more information.

       load
           (String) The file to load upon start of yapet. Equivalent to providing a filename when invoking yapet. A ~ (tilde) sign as the first character of the pathname will be replaced by the home
           directory of the user running yapet.

           Default: not set

       locktimeout
           (Integer) A positive integer specifying the time of inactivity in seconds until the screen is locked. Equivalent to providing the -t option when invoking yapet.

           Default: 600

       pwinputtimeout
           (Integer) A positive integer specifying the time of inactivity in seconds until the password prompt for unlocking the screen will disappear.

           Default: 60

       allowlockquit
           (Boolean) A value of true allows the user to quit yapet from the locked screen (if no changes are pending).
           A value of false prevents the user from quitting yapet when the screen is locked.

           Default: true

       checkfsecurity
           (Boolean) A value of true enables the verification of the file owner and permissions when loading a file.
           A value of false disables the verification of the file owner and permissions when loading a file. Equivalent to providing the -S (same as true) or -s (same as false) options when invoking
           yapet.

           Default: true

       pwgen_pwlen
           (Integer) A positive integer greater than zero specifying the default password length used by the Password Generator Dialog.

           Default: 15

       pwgen_letters
           (Boolean) A value of true will preselect the Letters check box of the Password Generator Dialog.

           Default: true

       pwgen_digits
           (Boolean) A value of true will preselect the Digits check box of the Password Generator Dialog.

           Default: true

       pwgen_punct
           (Boolean) A value of true will preselect the Punctuation check box of the Password Generator Dialog.

           Default: true

       pwgen_special
           (Boolean) A value of true will preselect the Special check box of the Password Generator Dialog.

           Default: true

       pwgen_other
           (Boolean) A value of true will preselect Other check box of the Password Generator Dialog.

           Default: false

       argon2_memory
           (Integer) Memory used by the Argon2 hash algorithm in KB.

           Default: 262144

       argon2_parallelism
           (Integer) Number of threads used by the Argon2 hash algorithm.

           Default: 16

       argon2_iterations
           (Integer) Number of iterations performed by the Argon2 hash algorithm.

           Default: 5

       For Boolean values, 1, yes, true, enable, and enabled denote true. 0, false, no, disable, disabled denote false. Please note, Boolean values are case-sensitive.

       The argon2_* options only take effect when creating a new file or changing the master password of an existing file.

EXAMPLES
   Example of an yapet configuration file
           load=/home/joe/passwords
           locktimeout=300
           checkfsecurity=0
           pwgen_pwlen=8

       In this example, the file /home/joe/passwords will be loaded upon invocation of yapet. The timeout until the screen is locked is set to 300 seconds. File permissions will not be verified.

       The Password Generator Dialog will have preset the Password Length to 8 characters.

   Example of an yapet configuration file
           locktimeout=150
           checkfsecurity=yes
           pwgen_other=enable

       In this example, no file will be automatically loaded upon invocation of yapet. The timeout until the screen is locked is set to 150 seconds. File permissions and owner will be verified.

       The Password Generator Dialog will have preset the Other check box checked.

   Example 1 revisited
           load=~/passwords.pet
           locktimeout=300
           checkfsecurity=false
           pwgen_pwlen=8

       This example has the same effect as Example of an yapet configuration file. But instead of specifying the full path to the home directory, the ~ (tilde) sign is used, which is expanded to the home
       directory automatically. The .pet suffix can be specified, but if omitted it will be appended automatically.

FILES
       $HOME/.yapet
           The per-user configuration file. If existing, options are read from this file but can be overridden by the command line options.
           Processing of this file can be disabled by invoking yapet with the -i option.
