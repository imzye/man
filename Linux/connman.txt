NAME
       connman-vpn.conf - ConnMan-VPN configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/connman/connman-vpn.conf

DESCRIPTION
       connman-vpn.conf is a configuration file for ConnMan-VPN. The configuration file is optional but it can be used to set up various aspects of ConnMan-VPN's behavior. The location of the file may be
       changed through use of the --config= argument for connman-vpn(8).

       DAC privileges (user, group and supplementary groups) of a VPN binary ran by connman-vpn(8) can be controlled by this configuration.  Configuration in connman-vpn.conf is for all VPN types and can
       be  overridden  by  defining  separate  configs  into /etc/connman/vpn-plugin/ using the plugin name + .conf suffix using the same syntax. For example, for OpenVPN the path to config is /etc/conn‐
       man/vpn-plugin/openvpn.conf which will override any value in the main configuration.

FILE FORMAT
       The configuration file consists of sections (groups) of key-value pairs.  Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments.  Sections are started by a header line containing  the
       section enclosed in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next section or the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.

       Description of sections and available keys follows:

   [General]
       This section is the only mandatory section of the configuration file.

       InputRequestTimeout=secs
              Set  input  request timeout. Default is 300 seconds. The request for inputs like passphrase will timeout after certain amount of time. Use this setting to increase the value in case of dif‐
              ferent user interface designs.

   [DACPrivileges]
       This section controls the DAC privileges to use for a VPN binary used by a VPN plugin. DAC privileges that can be set are user, group and supplementary groups.

       User=username/uid
              User on the system to use for running VPN binary. Username or uid can be used.

       Group=groupname/gid
              The main group to use for running VPN binary. Group name or gid can be used.

       SupplementaryGroups=groupnames/gids
              Comma separated list of supplementary groups to set for the VPN binary. Groups can be defined with their names or gid's.

EXAMPLES
       The following example configuration sets InputRequestTimeout to 10 minutes, runs VPNs as user "vpn_user" of group "vpn" with additional supplementary groups "inet" and "net_admin".

       [General]
       InputRequestTimeout = 600

       [DACPrivileges]
       User = vpn_user
       Group = vpn
       SupplementaryGroups = inet, net_admin
