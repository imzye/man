NAME
       libvirt-tck - libvirt Technology Compatability Kit

SYNOPSIS
        # libvirt-tck [OPTIONS] [TESTS..]

       Run with default config, probing for URI to use

        # libvirt-tck

       Run with a custom config

        # libvirt-tck --config /etc/libvirt/other.cfg

       Run with verbose progress information

        # libvirt-tck -v

       Generate a formal XML document of results

        # libvirt-tck --format xml

       Generate a JUnit XML document of results

        # libvirt-tck --format junit

DESCRIPTION
       The "libvirt-tck" (libvirt Technology Compatability Kit) command provides the primary mechanism to run the functional, integration test suite for libvirt drivers.

   WARNING
       The test suite is intended to be moderately safe to run on arbitrary hosts and takes steps to avoid intentionally breaking things.

       All objects (guests, networks, storage pools, etc) that are created will  have a name prefix of "tck" to minimize risk of clashes. The test suite will only ever (intentionally) delete objects with a
       "tck" name prefix.

       Where a test suite needs access to a precious host resource (physical NIC, PCI device, USB device, block device), execution will be skipped until the admin has white listed one or more suitable
       resources in the "/etc/libvirt-tck/default.cfg" configuration file.

       Despite these precautions, running automated tests always carries some degree of risk to the host system. It is thus advisable to avoid executing this test suite on hosts with precious state.

   OPTIONS
       If invoked without any arguments the test suite will run using the default configuration file from "/etc/libvirt-tck/default.cfg" and will allow libvirt to probe for the hypervisor driver to run. If a
       reliably repeatable test result set is desired, it is recommended to always give an explicit libvirt connection URI to choose the driver.

       Any command line arguments that are not parsed as options will be considered paths to test scripts to invoke. If no paths are given, all tests under "/usr/share/libvirt-tck/tests" will be executed.

       The following options are available when running the "libvirt-tck" command

       -v, --verbose
           Display fine details of individual test progresss. Without this only the name of each test will be printed, along with details of failures.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not display any information about test progress, not even the name of each test case

       -c, --config FILE
           Specify the name of the configuration file to use, rather than the default "/etc/libvirt-tck/default.cfg"

       --format text|html|xml|junit
           Choose the output format for the test results. The default format is "text", producing human readable results on the console. The "html" option dumps an HTML file of results to STDOUT, while the
           "xml" option generates a formal XML document of results.

       --force
           Forcably remove all previously created objects, including guests, networks, storage pools, etc which have a "tck" name prefix.

           User created objects whose name does not start with "tck" will be left untouched.

       -a, --archive FILE
           Generate an archive containing all the raw test results. The filename given should end in either ".bz", ".tar.gz" or ".tgz"

       --timer
           Print elapsed time after each test.
