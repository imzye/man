NAME
       a+ - A+ interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       a+ [files]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the a+ command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it
       has documentation in HTML format; install the package aplus-fsf-doc then open /usr/share/doc/aplus-fsf-doc/html/index.html.

AUTHOR
       This manual page was written by Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>, for the Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).
