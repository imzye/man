NAME
       ample.conf - configuration file for Ample

DESCRIPTION
       This  file,  by  default /etc/ample.conf, is read by Ample at startup. There are three categories of values than can be defined: strings, numbers and boolean values. Valid boolean values are (case
       insensitive) yes, no, true and false. Lines that start with # are considered to be comments and ignored.

EXAMPLE
              # An example of a Ample config file
              #

              # Port number to use
              port = 1234

              # Should files be ordered when playing a mixed stream?
              order = true

              # Amount of simultaneous clients allowed
              clients = 5

              # Path to logfile if syslog isn't used
              logfile = /var/log/ample

              # Path(s) to MP3 dir/file or M3U file
              mp3path = /home/mp3
              mp3path = /home/moremp3/zztop.mp3
              mp3path = /home/favourites.m3u

              # Path to the HTML file to use as a template
              htmlfile = /etc/ample.html

              # Should the MP3 dir(s) be recursively scanned?
              recursive = true

              # Name of the server
              # (displayed to clients here and there)
              servername = Ample

              # Address of the server
              # (only if your server can't be resolved)
              serveraddress = 192.168.0.1

              # Username and password, if these are specified, Ample
              # will automatically ask for username/password
              username = MusicLover
              password = Pekaboo

              # Filter to pass each music file through
              # (before they are sent to the client)
              filter = /usr/bin/lame -b64 --quiet "@FPATH@" -

              # The end

OPTIONS
       port=NUM
              Listen to TCP port NUM, default is 1234.

       order=BOOL
              When a list of files is requested, and this option is TRUE, play them in alphabetical order.

       clients=NUM
              Allow a maximum of NUM clients to be connected at the same time.

       logfile=FILE
              Use FILE as logfile if syslogd(8) isn't used.

       mp3path=PATH
              These are path(s) to files or directories that Ample can use to populate it's list of MP3's. If PATH is a directory, all files (possibly recursively, see the -n option above) will be added.
              If PATH is a regular file ending with .mp3 it will be added and if it is a regular file ending with .m3u (MP3 playlist) the files listed in it will be added. You can specify  several  paths
              by adding several mp3path=PATH lines to this config file.

       htmlfile=FILE
              This is the path to the file which Ample should use as it's base for creating HTML pages. See ample.html(5) for more information.

       recursive=BOOL
              If TRUE, all directories that Ample index:es will be scanned recursively (meaning that all subdirs will be checked for files as well)

       servername=STRING
              The name of the server will be set to STRING instead of "Ample" (the servername is displayed to clients in various places).

       serveraddress=STRING
              STRING should be the IP address of the server where Ample is run. This is only needed if DNS resolving your server, for some reason, doesn't work.

       username=STRING
              If both username and password is specified in the config file, HTTP authentication will be enabled. This means that if a client wants to connect to ample, it must do so with a username  and
              password in order to be granted access. If username or password is missing, HTTP authentication will be disabled.

       password=STRING
              See the description of username above.

       filter=STRING
              Specifies  an  optional  filter to run each file through before it is sent to the client.  As an example, this could be used to downgrade the bitrate of a music file if you have a lousy net
              connection but lots of CPU cycles to spare. If STRING contains the word @FPATH@ it will be replaced with the absolute path of the file.
