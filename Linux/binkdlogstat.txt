       binkdlogstat is a program which generates reports of the activity of the binkd daemon. It analyzes binkd log files and prints to stdout a formatted report with the following information for each node:

       - number of successful incoming sessions

       - number of failed incoming sessions

       - number of successful outgoing sessions

       - number of failed outgoing sessions

       - outgoing traffic in bytes

       - incoming traffic in bytes

       - number of sent files

       - number of recieved files

       - average CPS with node

       It also provides total informations for these categories for the log file.

       binkdlogstat uses stdin as a source and stdout as a result file, so it can be used as a filter.
