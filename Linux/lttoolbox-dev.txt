NAME
       lt-trim — compiled dictionary trimmer for Apertium

SYNOPSIS
       lt-trim analyser_binary bidix_binary trimmed_analyser_binary

DESCRIPTION
       lt-trim  is the application responsible for trimming compiled dictionaries.  The analyses (right-side when compiling lr) of analyser_binary are trimmed to the input side of bidix_binary (left-side
       when compiling lr, right-side when compiling rl), such that only analyses which would pass through ‘lt-proc(1) -b bidix_binary’ are kept.

       Both compound tags (“<compound-only-L>”, “<compound-R>”) and join elements (“<j/>” in XML, “+” in the stream) and the group element (“<g/>” in XML, “#” in the stream) should be handled  correctly,
       even combinations of + followed by # in monodix are handled.

       Some minor caveats: If you have the capitalised lemma “Foo” in the monodix, but “foo” in the bidix, an analysis “^Foo<tag>$” would pass through bidix when doing lt-proc(1) -b, but will not make it
       through  trimming.  Make sure your lemmas have the same capitalisation in the different dictionaries.  Also, you should not have literal ‘+’ or ‘#’ in your lemmas.  Since lt-comp(1) doesn't escape
       these, lt-trim cannot know that they are different from “<j/>” or “<g/>”, and you may get @-marked output this way.  You can analyse ‘+’ or ‘#’ by having the literal symbol in the “<l>”  part  and
       some other string (e.g., “plus”) in the “<r>”.

       You should not trim a generator unless you have a very simple translator pipeline, since the output of bidix seldom goes unchanged through transfer.

OPTIONS
       -s, --match-section
               A  section  with  this name (id@type) in the analyser will only be trimmed against a section with the same id in the bidix. (The default is to trim all sections of the analyser against all
               sections of the bidix.) Using this option can some times speed up trimming considerably. For example, if you have some complicated regular expressions, try putting them in a

                 <section id="regex" type="standard">

               in both .dix files and passing “regex@standard” to --match-section.

               This argument may be used multiple times to specify multiple sections that must match by name.
