NAME
       claws-mail-pdf-viewer - display PDF and PostScript® attachments

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-pdf-viewer package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-pdf-viewer is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin enables rendering of Portable Document Format (PDF) and PostScript® attachments within the message view of Claws Mail.

       PDF rendering is done using the poppler library.

       PostScript® rendering requires gs tool for converting to PDF. If gs not available only PDF attachments will be displayed.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named pdf_viewer.so, and press the
       “Open” button.
