NAME
       krazy2all - Sanity checks KDE source code.

SYNOPSIS
       krazy2all [options]

DESCRIPTION
       krazy2all finds all supported files within the current directory tree and runs the krazy2 checker on all of them, producing 1 concise report in the specified export format.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Print help message and exit.

       --version
           Print version information and exit.

       --list
           Print a list of all available checker programs and exit.

       --list-types
           Print a list of the support file types and exit.

       --list-sets
           Print a list of all the checker sets and exit.

       --list-set <set>
           Print the list of available checkers for the specified set and exit.

       --priority <low|normal|high|important|all>
           Tell each checker program to report issues with the specified priority only.  This option is useful to help put issues into "fix-first" order.

           Supported priorites are:
                low -> print low priority issues only
                normal -> print normal priority issues only
                high -> print high priority issues only
                important -> print issues with normal or high priority
                all -> print all issues (default)

       --strict <normal|super|all>
           Tell each checker program to report issues match the strictness level only.  Use this option to help filter out issues of less importance.

           Support strictness levels are:
                normal -> print non-super strict issues only
                super -> print super strict issues only
                all -> print all issues (default)

       --explain
           For each checker program, if any issues are found, print an explanation of the problem along with solving instructions.  May be used in conjunction with the --list option to provide a more
           detailed description of the checker programs.

       --ignorerc
           Ignore .krazy files.

       --config <krazyrc>
           Read settings from the specified krazyrc configuration file only.  All other configuration files will be ignored, including those found in the user's home directory or in the current working
           directory.

       --dry-run
           With this option the checker programs aren't run; instead, the command line for each check that would be run is printed.

       --check <prog[,prog1,prog2,...,progN]>
           Run the specified checker program(s) only.  You may not combine this option with --check-sets.

           Use the --list option to show the list of available checkers.

       --check-sets <set[,set1,set2,...,setN]>
           Run the checker programs belonging to the specified set(s) only.  You may not combine this option with --check.

           Use the --list-sets option to see the list of available check sets and programs.

       --exclude <prog[,prog1,prog2,...,progN]>
           Do NOT run the specified checker program(s).

       --extra <prog[,prog1,prog2,...,progN]>
           Add the specified "extra" program(s) to the list of checkers to run.  Use the --list option to show the list of available "extra" checkers; they will be marked with the tag [EXTRA] by the checker
           description line.

       --types <type[,type1,type2,...,typeN]>
           Check the specified file type(s) only.

       --exclude-types <type[,type1,type2,...,typeN]>
           Do NOT check the specified file type(s).

       --export <text|textlist|textedit|xml>
           Output in one of the following formats:
                text (default)
                textlist -> plain old text, 1 offending file-per-line
                textedit -> text formatted for IDEs, 1 issue-per-line (file:line:issue)
                xml -> XML formatted

       --title
           Give the output report a project title.

       --cms
           An acronym for "component/module/subdir".  Used to write the breadcrumbs line in the XML output.  Must be a slash-delimited triple containing the component, module, and subdir which is being
           scanned.

       --brief
           Only print the output for checkers that have at least 1 issue.

       --no-brief
           Print the result of all checks i.e, the opposite of --brief.  This is the default output setting.

       --quiet
           Suppress all output messages.

       --verbose
           Print the offending content for each file processed

ENVIRONMENT
       KRAZY_PLUGIN_PATH - this is a colon-separated list of paths which is searched when locating plugins. By default, plugins are searched for in the path $TOP/lib/krazy2/krazy-plugins:krazy-plugins.

       KRAZY_EXTRA_PATH - this is a colon-separated list of paths which is searched when locating "extra" plugins. By default, the "extras" are searched for in the path
       $TOP/lib/krazy2/krazy-extras:krazy-extras.

       KRAZY_SET_PATH - this is a colon-separated list of paths which is searched when locating checker sets. By default, the sets are searched for in the path $TOP/lib/krazy2/krazy-sets:krazy-sets.

       where $TOP is the top-level installation directory (eg. /usr/local, /usr/local/Krazy2)

EXIT STATUS
       In normal operation, krazy2all exits with a status 0.

       If a command line option was incorrectly provided, krazy2all exits with status=1.

       If krazy2all was envoked with the --help, --version  --list or --list-types options it will exit with status=0.

FILES
       .krazy (see krazyrc(3))

       krazy2all looks up the current working directory tree for a .krazy file in the project subdirectory.  Only .krazy files found at the project subdirectory level are read.

       For example, if the current working dir is /my/kde/trunk/KDE/kdepimlibs/kcal/versit, then krazy2all will look for /my/kde/trunk/KDE/kdepimlibs/kcal/.krazy, since kcal is the project within the
       kdepimlibs module.

       If the current working dir is not within a KDE module, or if the current working dir is above a project subdir, then a .krazy file will not be read.
