NAME
       myproxy-server.config - myproxy-server configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The myproxy-server.config file sets the policy for the myproxy-server(8), specifying what credentials may be stored in the server's repository, who is authorized to retrieve credentials, and other
       configurable  server  behaviors.   By  default,  the  myproxy-server(8)  looks  for  this file in /etc/myproxy-server.config and if it is not found there, it looks in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/myproxy-
       server.config.  A template is provided at $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/myproxy-server.config.  The myproxy-server -c option can be used to specify an alternative location.

       The following lines set access control policies according to the client's certificate subject distinguished name (DN).  Note that MyProxy uses non-standard regular  expressions  for  distinguished
       name (DN) matching. See the REGULAR EXPRESSIONS section below for details.

       accepted_credentials “DN regex”
              Each  of  these  lines  allows  any clients whose DNs match the given limited regex to connect to the myproxy-server and store credentials with it for future retrieval.  Any number of these
              lines may appear.  For backwards compatibility, these lines can also start with allowed_clients instead of accepted_credentials.  If no accepted_credentials lines are specified, the  server
              will not allow any clients to store credentials.

       authorized_retrievers “DN regex”
              Each of these lines allows the server administrator to set server-wide policies for credential retrievers. If the client DN does not match the given limited regex, the client is not allowed
              to  retrieve  credentials  from the server.  In addition to the server-wide policy, myproxy also provides support for per-credential policy. The user can specify the regex DN of the allowed
              retrievers of the credential when uploading the credential (using myproxy-init(1) or myproxy-store(1)).  The retrieval client DN must also match the user specified regex. In  order  to  re‐
              trieve  credentials the client also needs to know the name and pass phrase provided by the client when the credentials were stored. Any number of these lines may appear.  For backwards com‐
              patibility, these lines can also start with allowed_services instead of authorized_retrievers.  If no authorized_retrievers lines are specified, the server will not allow any clients to re‐
              trieve credentials.

       default_retrievers “DN regex”
              Each of these lines allows the server administrator to set server-wide default policies. The regex specifies the clients who can access the credentials. The default retriever policy is  en‐
              forced  if  a  per-credential policy is not specified on upload (using myproxy-init(1) or myproxy-store(1)).  In other words, the client can override this policy for a credential on upload.
              The per-credential policy is enforced in addition to the server-wide policy specified by the authorized_retrievers line (which clients can not override).  Any number of these lines  may  be
              present.   For  backwards compatibility, if no default_retrievers line is specified, the default policy is "*", which allows any client to pass the per-credential policy check.  (The client
              must still pass the authorized_retrievers check.)

       authorized_renewers “DN regex”
              Each of these lines allows the server administrator to set server-wide policies for authorized renewers. If the client DN does not match the given limited regex the client is not allowed to
              renew the credentials previously stored by a client.  See allow_self_authorization below for a further restriction on this policy.  In addition to the server-wide policy, myproxy also  pro‐
              vides  support  for  per-credential  policy. The user can specify the regex DN of the allowed renewers of the credential on upload (using myproxy-init(1)).  The renewal client DN must match
              both this regex and the user specified regex. In this case, the client must also already have a credential with a DN matching the DN of the credentials to be retrieved, to be used in a sec‐
              ond authorization step (see the -a options for myproxy-logon(1) and myproxy-retrieve(1)).

       default_renewers “DN regex”
              Each of these lines allows the server administrator to set server-wide default renewer policies. The regex specifies the clients who can renew the credentials. The default renewer policy is
              enforced if a per-credential policy is not specified on upload (using myproxy-init(1)).  This is enforced in addition to the server-wide policy specified by  the  authorized_renewers  line.
              Any  number  of these lines may appear.  For backwards compatibility, if no default_renewers line is specified, the default policy is "*", which allows any client to pass the per-credential
              policy check.  (The client must still pass the authorized_renewers check.)

       authorized_key_retrievers “DN regex”
              This policy controls who can retrieve credentials (certificates and keys) directly from the repository using myproxy-retrieve(1).  Clients must also match the authorized_retrievers  policy.
              If no authorized_key_retrievers lines are specified, the server will not allow any clients to retrieve keys directly from the repository.

       default_key_retrievers “DN regex”
              This  policy applies if a per-credential policy is not specified on upload (using myproxy-init(1) or myproxy-store(1)).  In other words, the client can override this policy for a credential
              on upload.  The per-credential policy is enforced in addition to the server-wide policy specified by the authorized_key_retrievers line (which clients can  not  override).   Any  number  of
              these  lines  may  be present.  If no default_key_retrievers line is specified, the default policy is "*", which allows any client to pass the per-credential policy check.  (The client must
              still pass the authorized_key_retrievers check.)

       trusted_retrievers “DN regex”
              This policy controls who can retrieve credentials without further authentication.  By default, clients that match authorized_retrievers  must  perform  additional  authentication  (such  as
              passphrase, PAM, or SASL) to retrieve credentials.  However, authenticated clients that match both authorized_retrievers and trusted_retrievers do not need to perform additional authentica‐
              tion,  unless  the  credentials  are protected by a passphrase, in which case the passphrase is still required.  Note: The myproxy-server(8) will fail on startup or reconfig with an "unsafe
              policy" error if a policy of trusted_retrievers “*” is specified without also specifying a restrictive default_trusted_retrievers policy, to avoid an unsafe policy that would  release  cre‐
              dentials to all clients without additional authentication.  See also allow_self_authorization below for a further restriction on this policy.

       default_trusted_retrievers “DN regex”
              If  a user doesn't set a trusted retrieval policy with the credential on upload (via 'myproxy-init -Z'), the myproxy-server(8) will apply the following policy in addition to the trusted_re‐
              trievers policy.  If no default_trusted_retrievers policy is set, then only the trusted_retrievers policy is applied.

       The following lines in the configuration file set other server options.

       passphrase_policy_program full-path-to-script
              This line specifies a program to run whenever a passphrase is set or changed for implementing a local password policy.  The program is passed the new passphrase via stdin and is passed  the
              following  arguments: username, distinguished name, credential name (if any), per-credential retriever policy (if any), and per-credential renewal policy (if any).  If the passphrase is ac‐
              ceptable, the program should exit with status 0.  Otherwise, it should exit with non-zero status, causing the operation in progress (credential load, passphrase change) to fail with the er‐
              ror message provided by the program's stdout.  Note: You must specify the full path to the external program.  $GLOBUS_LOCATION can't be used in the  myproxy-server.config  file.   A  sample
              program is installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/myproxy-passphrase-policy but is not enabled by default.

              Be sure to follow secure coding practices for this call-out:
              - Don't allow input to overflow fixed-size buffers.
              - Don't pass unchecked input to a shell command.

       cert_dir full-path-to-certificates-directory
              Specifies the path to the CA certificates directory to be returned to clients requesting trust roots (such as via the myproxy-logon(1) -T option).

       max_proxy_lifetime hours
              This  line  specifies a server-wide maximum lifetime for retrieved proxy credentials.  By default, no server-wide maximum is enforced.  However, if this option is specified, the server will
              limit the lifetime of any retrieved proxy credentials to the value given.

       max_cred_lifetime hours
              This line specifies a server-wide maximum lifetime for stored credentials.  By default, no server-wide maximum is enforced.  However, if this option is specified, the server will limit  the
              lifetime of any stored credentials to the value given.

       ignore_globus_limited_proxy_flag boolean
              By  default,  MyProxy  will  respect the policy of "limited" proxy certificates as follows.  If a client authenticates with a limited proxy, the client should only be able to obtain another
              limited proxy, not a full proxy or end entity certificate.  Thus, the MyProxy CA will not accept limited proxies for authentication.  However, if this option is set to  true,  MyProxy  will
              treat limited proxy certificates as if they were full proxy certificates.

       allow_self_authorization boolean
              By  default,  MyProxy  will disallow trusted_retrievers and authorized_renewers whose DN matches the identity of the stored credential, so a proxy by itself can not be refreshed or renewed.
              However, if this option is set to true, this restriction is lifted.

       syslog_ident name
              You can optionally specify the string to be prepended to every message written to the syslog.  If not specified, the name defaults to the the program name, i.e. myproxy-server.

       syslog_facility name
              By default, the myproxy-server will log to the syslog "daemon" facility. With this option you can specify an alternate syslog facility, such as "auth", "user", "security", or "local0".  The
              facility can also be specified numerically as with the logger(1) command.

       request_timeout seconds
              Specifies the maximum time a myproxy-server(8) child process should spend servicing a client request before aborting.  By default, child processes will abort after 120 seconds.  A  negative
              value will disable the timeout.

       request_size_limit bytes
              Limits  the  amount of incoming application-level protocol data the myproxy-server(8) will accept from clients, to avoid memory exhaustion under heavy load. Specified in bytes.  Defaults to
              1MB (1048576 bytes).  A zero or negative value disables the limit.

       proxy_extfile full-path-to-extension-file
              Optionally specifies the full path to a file containing an OpenSSL formatted set of certificate extensions to include in all proxy certificates issued from the MyProxy repository (analogous
              to certificate_extfile for the CA module).

       proxy_extapp full-path-to-extension-callout-program
              This is the call-out version of proxy_extfile.  It optionally specifies the full path to a call-out program for specifying proxy certificate extensions.  It will be passed the authenticated
              username and the proxy credential location as the two command arguments.  On success, it should write the OpenSSL formatted set of certificate extensions to stdout and exit with  zero  sta‐
              tus.  On error, it should write to stderr and exit with nonzero status.  Either proxy_extfile or proxy_extapp can be specified but not both.

              Be sure to follow secure coding practices for this call-out:
              - Don't allow input to overflow fixed-size buffers.
              - Don't pass unchecked input to a shell command.

       voms_userconf full-path-to-voms-configuration-file
              Optionally specifies the full path to the VOMS configuration file containing VOMS server information. It is usually specified in the environmental variable VOMS_USERCONF.

       allow_voms_attribute_requests boolean
              If  this  parameter is set to true and a GET request includes VONAME and (optionally) VOMSES parameters, call-out to VOMS to add the requested attributes to the issued certificate. Requires
              linking with VOMS libraries. By default, VONAME and VOMSES parameters in requests will be ignored unless this parameter is set to true.

       The MyProxy server can be optionally configured for authentication based on Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) and/or the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL).  Kerberos is  one  of
       the supported SASL authentication methods.  The following options control the use of PAM and SASL.

       pam option
              This  line  governs  the use of PAM to check passphrases.  MyProxy will attempt to authenticate via PAM, with the supplied username and passphrase.  Note that PAM will need to be configured
              externally for the application "myproxy" (usually in /etc/pam.d/), or for the application named by pam_id, below.  Accepted values:

              required
                     PAM password authentication is required under all conditions.  If the credential is unencrypted (that is, it has no passphrase), a PAM password check is still required for  authenti‐
                     cation.  If the credential is encrypted, its passphrase must match the PAM password.

              sufficient
                     The  user's  passphrase may match either the credential passphrase or, if the credential is unencrypted, the PAM passphrase.  If the credential is encrypted, then the PAM password is
                     not relevant.

              disabled (default)
                     PAM is not used to check passphrases.

       pam_id string
              The name that myproxy uses to identify itself to PAM.  Default is "myproxy".  For example, on most Unix-like systems, if pam_id is set to "login", MyProxy will authenticate against the sys‐
              tem's own usernames and passwords.

       sasl option
              This line governs the use of SASL authentication.  Accepted values:

              required
                     SASL authentication is required for retrieving credentials.

              sufficient
                     SASL authentication is sufficient for retrieving credentials, but other authentication methods may be used instead.

              disabled (default)
                     SASL authentication isn't used.

       sasl_mech mechanism
              Forces the use of a single SASL mechanism, overriding the SASL configuration file. (Typically not required.)

       sasl_serverFQDN hostname
              Configures the SASL server fully-qualified domain name for multi-homed servers. (Typically not required.)

       sasl_user_realm realm
              Configures the SASL user realm. (Typically not required.)

       The MyProxy server can also be configured to act as a Certificate Authority (CA) to issue credentials to clients.  The following parameters enable and configure the CA functionality.

       certificate_issuer_cert full-path-to-certificate
              This line specifies the full path to the issuer certificate to optionally configure the myproxy-server to act as an online certificate authority.

       certificate_issuer_key full-path-to-key
              When specifying certificate_issuer_cert above, you must also give the name of the CA private key for signing certificates.  This is normally path to a CA private key in PEM format,  but  if
              you are using an OpenSSL engine (see certificate_openssl_engine_id ) then it can be the key name.

       certificate_issuer_key_passphrase “passphrase”
              If the certificate_issuer_key is encrypted, give the passphrase here.

       certificate_issuer_subca_certfile full-path-to-subca-certificate-file
              If you would like an intermediate/sub-CA certificate chain to be sent along with the EEC (End Entity Certificate) generated using a local intermediate/sub-CA, specify the file that contains
              those certificates in PEM format. This is meant to aid scenarios where the CA used is an intermediate CA (i.e. not a root CA) and the client may not have the intermediate CA(s) in its trust
              store. The client will write out the chain into the same file as the EEC, following the EEC.

       certificate_issuer_hashalg algorithm
              Specifies the hash algorithm to use when signing end-entity certificates.  Defaults to "sha256".

       certificate_issuer_email_domain “domain”
              If set, specifies the domain part of the X509v3 Subject Alternative Name email address included in issued certificates.

       certificate_openssl_engine_id engineId

       certificate_openssl_engine_pre pre-initialization-commands

       certificate_openssl_engine_post post-initialization-commands
              These  commands  can be used to allow any OpenSSL engine to be used with MyProxy.  This enables the use of hardware tokens and signing modules to sign certificates.  Given the parameters of
              an OpenSSL "engine" command, the first argument, the identity of the engine becomes the argument to certificate_openssl_engine_id and -pre  commands  are  listed  in  order  using  certifi‐
              cate_openssl_engine_pre and -post commands are listed in order using certificate_openssl_engine_post.  For example the command-line:

                 openssl engine dynamic -pre SO_PATH:/usr/lib/engines/engine_pkcs11.so -pre ID:pkcs11 -pre LIST_ADD:1 -pre LOAD -pre MODULE_PATH:/usr/lib/opensc-pksc11.so

              becomes:

                 certificate_openssl_engine_id "dynamic"

                 certificate_openssl_engine_pre "SO_PATH:/usr/lib/engines/engine_pkcs11.so" "ID:pkcs11" "LIST_ADD:1" "LOAD" "MODULE_PATH:/usr/lib/opensc-pksc11.so"

              Please note that any shared library engines loaded through the "dynamic" engine MUST be compiled againt the correct version of OpenSSL.

       certificate_openssl_engine_lockfile full-path-to-file
              If  your  hardware  token or HSM is unable to handle simultaneous operations, provide a path to a lockfile for synchronizing operations to the engine device.  The myproxy-server will create
              the file if it does not already exist.

       certificate_issuer_program full-path-to-script
              This line specifies the path to a program to issue certificates for authenticated clients that don't have credentials stored.  This optionally configures the myproxy-server to act as an on‐
              line certificate authority, allowing programmatic control over the certificate issuance process.  You can either specify certificate_issuer_cert or certificate_issuer_program.

              Be sure to follow secure coding practices for this call-out:
              - Don't allow input to overflow fixed-size buffers.
              - Don't pass unchecked input to a shell command.

       certificate_serialfile full-path-to-serial-file
              Specifies the path to a file to store the serial number counter for issued certificates.  Defaults to /var/lib/myproxy/serial.

       certificate_serial_skip increment
              Specifies the number to add to the serial number each time a certificate is issued. Use this to stagger serial numbers across multiple CA instances to avoid serial number clashes.  Defaults
              to 1.

       certificate_out_dir full-path-to-putput-directory
              Specifies the path to a directory where new certificates will be archived.

       max_cert_lifetime hours
              Specifies the maximum lifetime (in hours) for certificates issued by the CA module.  Defaults to 12 hours.

       min_keylen bits
              Specifies the minimum RSA key length (in bits) for certificates issued by the CA module.

       certificate_extfile full-path-to-extension-file
              Optionally specifies the full path to a file containing an OpenSSL formatted set of certificate extensions to include in all issued certificates.  For example:
                 keyUsage=digitalSignature,keyEncipherment,dataEncipherment
                 subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
                 authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer:always
                 crlDistributionPoints=URI:http://ca.ncsa.uiuc.edu/4a6cd8b1.r0
                 basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
              If not set, the MyProxy CA will include a basic set of extensions in issued certificates.

       certificate_extapp full-path-to-extension-callout-program
              This is the call-out version of certificate_extfile.  It optionally specifies the full path to a call-out program for specifying certificate extensions.  It will be passed the authenticated
              username  as the single command argument.  On success, it should write the OpenSSL formatted set of certificate extensions to stdout and exit with zero status.  On error, it should write to
              stderr and exit with nonzero status.  Either certificate_extfile or certificate_extapp can be specified but not both.

              Be sure to follow secure coding practices for this call-out:
              - Don't allow input to overflow fixed-size buffers.
              - Don't pass unchecked input to a shell command.

       certificate_mapfile full-path-to-mapfile
              When specifying certificate_issuer_cert above, you can map account names to certificate subject distinguished names for the issued certificates using this mapfile, which has the same format
              as used by other Grid Community Toolkit services.  By default, /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile is used.  The Grid Community Toolkit grid-mapfile-add-entry and grid-mapfile-delete-entry com‐
              mands can be used to manage the grid-mapfile.

       certificate_mapapp full-path-to-mapapp
              When specifying certificate_issuer_cert above, you can map account names to certificate subject distinguished names for the issued certificates using this call-out.  It will be  passed  the
              authenticated  username  as the single command argument.  On success, it should write the distinguished name in OpenSSL one line format (for example, "/C=US/O=National Computational Science
              Alliance/CN=Jim Basney") to stdout and exit with zero status.  On error, it should write to stderr and exit with nonzero status.  If it is not defined, then mapfile lookup will be  executed
              instead (see certificate_mapfile above).  An example is installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/myproxy-certificate-mapapp.

              Be sure to follow secure coding practices for this call-out:
              - Don't allow input to overflow fixed-size buffers.
              - Don't pass unchecked input to a shell command.

       certificate_request_checker full-path-to-callout-program
              This  CA  call-out can be used to perform checks on incoming certificate requests. It will be passed the certificate request in PEM format on stdin. If it returns a nonzero exit status, the
              CA will abort without signing the request.  When returning a nonzero exit  status,  the  callout  should  indicate  the  problem  on  stderr.   An  example  is  installed  in  $GLOBUS_LOCA‐
              TION/share/myproxy/myproxy-certreq-checker.

       certificate_issuer_checker full-path-to-callout-program
              This  CA call-out can be used to perform checks on issued certificates before the certificate is returned to the client.  It will be passed the certificate in PEM format on stdin. If it re‐
              turns a nonzero exit status, the CA will abort without returning the signed certificate to the client. When returning a nonzero exit status, the  callout  should  indicate  the  problem  on
              stderr.  An example is installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/myproxy-cert-checker.

       If OpenLDAP support is built-in to the myproxy-server(8), the following parameters can be used to configure the CA module to map account names to certificate subject distinguished names via LDAP.

       ca_ldap_server “ldap://localhost:389/”
              This  parameter specifies the URI to the LDAP server to use for username to DN resolution in the CA module.  Both ldap:// and ldaps:// protocols are supported.  A port number may optionally
              be specified as well.  Defining this directive is the "trigger" that causes the name resolution module to use LDAP querying.  If it is not defined, then mapfile lookup will be executed  in‐
              stead (see certificate_mapfile above).

       ca_ldap_uid_attribute “uid”
              The name of the record attribute that maps to the MyProxy username.  Required for LDAP username to DN resolution.

       ca_ldap_searchbase “ou=people,dc=bullwinkle,dc=lbl,dc=gov”
              The DN of the region of the ldap database to be searched.  Required for LDAP username to DN resolution.

       ca_ldap_dn_attribute “subjectDN”
              If this directive is set, the LDAP resolver will pull the DN from the specified attribute in the returned record.  If it is not set, the default is to use the DN of the record itself.

       ca_ldap_connect_dn “cn=MyProxy,ou=ldapusers,dc=lbl,dc=gov”
              DN for LDAP basic authentication (optional).

       ca_ldap_connect_passphrase “passphrase”
              Passphrase for LDAP basic authentication (optional).

       The following parameters control server replication with the myproxy-replicate(1) utility.

       slave_servers server:port;
              This  value  is for use with the myproxy-replicate(1) utility.  This tag provides a list of servers that will be used as secondary repositories for the MyProxy database.  Each server should
              be separated by a ";".  Also, a port may be provided if the slave server is using a port other then the default.  The server name maybe a recognized DNS or an IP address.

       The following parameters are used primarily when utilizing MyProxy as a delegation service for web portals.

       accepted_credentials_mapfile full-path-to-mapfile
              This parameter points to a grid-mapfile, which is possibly different from other mapfiles above. When specified, this mapfile is utilized during puts/stores (e.g.  with  myproxy-init(1)  and
              myproxy-store(1)).   A  credential  is  authorized  to be put/stored only under the username specified in the mapfile.  This prevents storing a user's credential under a different username.
              Note that the credential checked for the presence of a SubjectDN/Username entry in the mapfile is the credential utilized to secure the connection between client and server, NOT the  actual
              credential  being  stored.   As  the  credential which secures the TLS connection is typically the same as the credential being stored, this should not be a major issue.  The Grid Community
              Toolkit grid-mapfile-add-entry and grid-mapfile-delete-entry commands can be used to manage the grid-mapfile.

       accepted_credentials_mapapp full-path-to-mapapp
              As an alternative to the accepted_credentials_mapfile option above, you can specify a call-out which is passed two parameters: a certificate subject distinguished name and  a  username  (in
              that  order).   In  essence,  the  call-out  performs a lookup in a 'virtual' accepted_credentials_mapfile.  If the SubjectDN/Username line would appear in such a mapfile, then the call-out
              should exit with zero status indicating that a credential with the given SubjectDN is allowed to be stored under the given Username.  Otherwise, the call-out should exit with nonzero status
              indicating error.  An example is installed in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/myproxy-accepted-credentials-mapapp.

              Be sure to follow secure coding practices for this call-out:
              - Don't allow input to overflow fixed-size buffers.
              - Don't pass unchecked input to a shell command.

       check_multiple_credentials boolean
              Typically when a credential is accessed by a client, the server checks only one credential for possible access authorization, even if there are multiple credentials stored under  the  given
              username.   If  this option is set to "true" AND the client does not specify a credential name for a MyProxy GET operation (i.e., from myproxy-logon(1)), then the server will check multiple
              credentials with the given username.  If a credential is found to be authorized for client access, then that one will be used during processing.   The  default  value  for  this  option  is
              "false".

       The following parameters enable OCSP status checking of stored credentials in the myproxy-server(8) repository, to avoid use of expired credentials.

       ocsp_policy policy
              Controls  the  policy  for checking certificate validity via OCSP before credentials may be delegated.  Currently, only the status of the end entity certificate is checked via OCSP (and not
              any proxy certificates or CA certificates).  OCSP will not be used unless ocsp_responder_url and/or ocsp_policy are set.  Supported policies are:
                "aia" - use OCSP responder in certificate AIA extension, if
                        present; otherwise use ocsp_responder_url, if set

       ocsp_responder_url URL
              Specifies the URL of an OCSP responder to use to check the validity of credentials stored in the myproxy-server repository before they may be delegated, so that revoked credentials can  not
              be  retrieved  and used where their revocation status may not be checked.  Currently, only the status of the end entity certificate is checked via OCSP (and not any proxy certificates or CA
              certificates).  In any case, CRL checks are always performed.  Both http and https urls are supported.  OCSP will not be used unless ocsp_responder_url and/or ocsp_policy are set.

       ocsp_responder_cert path
              Specifies the path to the certificate of a trusted OCSP responder.  This is needed if the OCSP responder must be explicitly trusted in cases where standard path  validation  fails  for  the
              OCSP responder's certificate.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       For matching distinguished names (DNs) in access control policies, MyProxy uses POSIX Extended Regular Expressions (see re_format(7)), with custom processing of '*', '?', and '.' metacharacters to
       simulate  Unix shell style wildcard processing (for backward compatibility and other historical reasons).  MyProxy's custom regular expressions are converted to POSIX EREs according to the follow‐
       ing rules:

         [ MyProxy regex ] => [ POSIX ERE ]
         ----------------------------------
                '*'        =>      '.*'
                '?'        =>      '.'
                '.'        =>      '\.'
                '\*'       =>      '*'
                '\?'       =>      '?'
                '\.'       =>      '.'

       Additionally, MyProxy wraps all regular expressions inside '^(' and ')$' to require full DN matching.

       Be aware that parentheses are metacharacters according to POSIX, so escaping is required for literal matching. For example:

         "*/CN=Jim Basney \(admin\)"

       The following examples illustrate how MyProxy regular expressions are converted to POSIX EREs:

            [ MyProxy regex ]     =>    [ POSIX ERE ]
         ------------------------------------------------------------
         "*/CN=Jim Basney"        => "^(.*/CN=Jim Basney)$"
         "*/CN=Test User ?"       => "^(.*/CN=Test User .)$"
         "*/CN=James A. Basney"   => "^(.*/CN=James A\. Basney)$"
         "/O=Test/CN=[:alnum:]\*" => "^(/O=Test/CN=[:alnum:]*)$"

         "*/CN=Jim Basney|*/CN=James Basney" =>
             "^(.*/CN=Jim Basney|.*/CN=James Basney)$"
