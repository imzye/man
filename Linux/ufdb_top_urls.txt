NAME
       ufdb_top_urls - retrieve the most frequently used URLs from the log files

SYNOPSIS
       ufdb_top_urls [options] <logfiles>

DESCRIPTION
       ufdb_top_urls is a log analysis utility which scans one or more log files of ufdbguardd and prints the most frequently used URLs.

       The various options control which URLs are included in the output.

OPTIONS
       -domain-only
              Do not use the full URL but only the domainname.

       -report-size <N>
              specifies the number of lines of the report.  The default is 20 lines.

       -count-passed (default), -no-count-passed
              specifies whether or not to include URLs that are PASSed.

       -count-blocked, -no-count-blocked (default)
              specifies whether or not to include URLs that are BLOCKed.

WARNINGS
       Retrieval of top urls is slow since (very) large log files are processed.  It may take 50 seconds to process 400 MB on a common server.
