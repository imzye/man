NAME
       makehmmerdb - build a HMMER binary database file from a sequence file

SYNOPSIS
       makehmmerdb [options] <seqfile> <binaryfile>

DESCRIPTION
       makehmmerdb  is  used  to  create  a binary file from a DNA sequence file. This binary file may be used as a target database for the DNA search tool nhmmer.Usingdefaultsettingsin nhmmer, this yields a
       roughly 10-fold acceleration with small loss of sensitivity on benchmarks. (This method has been extensively tested, but should still be treated as somewhat experimental.)

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

OTHER OPTIONS
       --informat <s>
              Assert that the sequence database file is in format <s>.  Accepted formats include fasta, embl, genbank, ddbj, uniprot, stockholm, pfam, a2m, and afa.  The default is to autodetect  the  format
              of the file.

       --bin_length <n>
              Bin length. The binary file depends on a data structure called the FM index, which organizes a permuted copy of the sequence in bins of length <n>.  Longer bin length will lead to smaller files
              (because data is captured about each bin) and possibly slower query time. The default is 256. Much more than 512 may lead to notable reduction in speed.

       --sa_freq <n>
              Suffix array sample rate. The FM index structure also samples from the underlying suffix array for the sequence database. More frequent sampling (smaller value for <n>) will yield  larger  file
              size and faster search (until file size becomes large enough to cause I/O to be a bottleneck). The default value is 8. Must be a power of 2.

       --block_size <n>
              The  input  sequence  is  broken  into blocks of size <n> million letters. An FM index is built for each block, rather than building an FM index for the entire sequence database. Default is 50.
              Larger blocks do not seem to yield substantial speed increase.
