NAME
       treesheets - data organizer

SYNOPSIS
       treesheets [options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Treesheets is a data organizer designed to replace spreadsheets, mind mappers, outliners, PIMs, text editors and small databases.

       treesheets starts the program, opening the filename if given. If TreeSheets is already running, it will pass the file (if given) to the existing instance, then quit with a non-zero exit code.

OPTIONS
       -p     This starts TreeSheets in "portable" mode, where it writes settings to TreeSheets.ini in the current working directory rather than to ~/.TreeSheets

FILES
       ~/.TreeSheets
              Stores the settings for TreeSheets.

       ~/.treesheets-single-instance-check
              Stores the process id of the running instance.
