NAME
       firebuild - accelerate build

SYNOPSIS

       firebuild [OPTIONS] {BUILD COMMAND}

DESCRIPTION
       Execute BUILD COMMAND with Firebuild instrumentation

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -c, --config-file=FILE
           use FILE as configuration file

       -C, --directory=DIR
           change directory before running the command

       -d, --debug-flags=list
           comma separated list of debug flags, -d help to get a list.

       -D, --debug-filter=list
           Comma separated list of commands to debug. Debug messages related to processes which are not listed are suppressed.

       -g, --gc
           Garbage collect the cache. Keeps debugging entries related to kept files when used together with --debug cache.

       -r, --generate-report=[HTML]
           Generate a report on the build command execution. The report's filename can be specified (firebuild-build-report.html by default).

       -h, --help
           show this help

       -o, --option=key=val
           Add or replace a scalar in the config

       -o, --option=key=[]
           Clear an array in the config

       -o, --option=key+=val
           Append to an array of scalars in the config

       -o, --option=key-=val
           Remove from an array of scalars in the config

       -q, --quiet
           Quiet; print error messages only from firebuild. The BUILD COMMAND's messages are not affected.

       -s, --show-stats
           Show cache hit statistics. When used together with BUILD COMMAND, the statistics of the current run are shown. Without a BUILD COMMAND it shows the cumulative statistics of all prior runs
           (since the creation of the used cache directory).

       -z, --zero-stats
           Zero cache hit statistics before performing any other action.

       -i, --insert-trace-markers
           Perform open("/FIREBUILD debug message", 0) calls to let users find unintercepted calls using strace or ltrace. This works in debug builds only.

       --version
           output version information and exit

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status of the BUILD COMMAND or 1 in case of failure in firebuild.
