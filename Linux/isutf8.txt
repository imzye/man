NAME
       isutf8 - check whether files are valid UTF-8

SYNOPSIS
       isutf8 [-hqliv] [--help] [--quiet] [--list] [--invert] [--verbose] [[file...]]

DESCRIPTION
       isutf8 checks whether files are syntactically valid UTF-8. Input is either files named on the command line, or the standard input. Notices about files with invalid UTF-8 are printed to standard
       output.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Print out a help summary.

       -q, --quiet
           Don't print messages telling which files are invalid UTF-8, merely indicate it with the exit status.

       -l, --list
           Print only the names of files containing invalid UTF-8.

       -i, --invert
           Invert the selection: list UTF-8 compatible files.

       -v, --verbose
           Also print an hexdump-like view of the error and some context.

EXIT STATUS
       If the file is valid UTF-8, the exit status is zero. If the file is not valid UTF-8, or there is some error, the exit status is non-zero.
