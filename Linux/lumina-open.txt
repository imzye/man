DESCRIPTION
     Given a file with an absolute pathway or URL, the lumina-open utility finds the appropriate application to open the file.  If the file is a *.desktop application shortcut, lumina-open starts the appli‐
     cation automatically.  lumina-open can also perform specific system operations.  Here are all flags and descriptions:
