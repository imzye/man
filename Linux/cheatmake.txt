NAME
       cheatmake - fool make into not rebuilding certain files

SYNOPSIS
       cheatmake [hidechangefile] [show] [whyfile]

DESCRIPTION
       cheatmake is used to save time when recompiling. It can fool make into skipping files that haven't changed in a meaningful way. This can be used for instance when you change a comment in a file but
       none of the actual code.

       This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.

OPTIONS
       hidechange file
           Hides the fact that file was changed by setting the timestamp into the past. Use with care!

       show
           Lists what files make currently needs to rebuild

       why file
           Explains why make must rebuild file

ENVIRONMENT
       One of the following variables (but not both) should be set if the source directory is different from the build directory. If the build directory is simply a subdirectory of the source directory, the
       simpler variable OBJ_SUBDIR should be used.

       OBJ_SUBJDIR
           Indicates that the build directory is in the given subdirectory of the source directory. For instance, if the source directory is kdesdk and the build directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux, then
           OBJ_SUBDIR should be set to obj-i386-linux.

       OBJ_REPLACEMENT
           A sed expression that is used to transform the source directory into the build directory. For instance, if the source directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux, then OBJ_REPLACEMENT should be set to
           s#kdesdk#kdesdk-obj#.
