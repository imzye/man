NAME
       openlierox - real-time, excessive clone of Worms with network support.

DESCRIPTION
       OpenLieroX  is  based  on  Jason  Boettcher's famous Liero Xtreme.  Jason B. has released his work in 2006 under the zlib-licence and after some months of work, we ported and enhanced his work and got
       OpenLieroX.

SYNOPSIS
       openlierox [options]

OPTIONS
       OpenLieroX reads all the configuration options from a configuration file at startup but you can override from command line a few of the options:

       -help  Show commandline help.

       -opengl
              Use OpenGL for drawing.

       -noopengl
              Explicitly disable using OpenGL.

       -fullscreen

       -dedicated

              script which operates the OpenLieroX server.  It is located in default directory '/usr/share/games/OpenLieroX' , but may be overridden by user as '~/.OpenLieroX/scripts/dedicated_control'.

       -connect SERVER-ADDRESS
