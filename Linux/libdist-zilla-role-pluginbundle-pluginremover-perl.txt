NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::PluginRemover - Add '-remove' functionality to a bundle

VERSION
       version 0.105

SYNOPSIS
         # in Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::MyBundle

         with (
           'Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle', # or PluginBundle::Easy
           'Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::PluginRemover'
         );

         # PluginRemover should probably be last
         # (unless you're doing something more complex)

DESCRIPTION
       This role enables your Dist::Zilla Plugin Bundle to automatically remove any plugins specified by the "-remove" attribute (like @Filter does):

         [@MyBundle]
         -remove = PluginIDontWant
         -remove = OtherDumbPlugin

       If you want to use an attribute named "-remove" for your own bundle you can override the "plugin_remover_attribute" sub to define a different attribute name:

         # in your bundle package
         sub plugin_remover_attribute { 'scurvy_cur' }

       This role adds a method modifier to "bundle_config", which is the method that the root "PluginBundle" role requires, and that "PluginBundle::Easy" wraps.

METHODS
   plugin_remover_attribute
       Returns the name of the attribute containing the array ref of plugins to remove.

       Defaults to "-remove".

   remove_plugins
         $class->remove_plugins(\@to_remove, @plugins);
         $class->remove_plugins(['Foo'], [Foo => 'DZP::Foo'], [Bar => 'DZP::Bar']);

       Takes an arrayref of plugin names to remove (like what will be in the config payload for "-remove"), removes them from the list of plugins passed, and returns the remaining plugins.

       This is used by the "bundle_config" modifier but is defined separately in case you would like to use the functionality without the voodoo that occurs when consuming this role.

       The plugin name to match against all plugins can be given as either the plugin moniker (like you might provide in your config file, expanded via "expand_config" in Dist::Zilla::Util), or the
       unique plugin name used to differentiate multiple plugins of the same type. For example, in this configuration:

           [Foo::Bar / plugin 1]
           [Foo::Bar / plugin 2]

       passing 'Foo::Bar' to "remove_plugins" will remove both these plugins from the configuration, but only the first is removed when passing 'plugin 1'.
