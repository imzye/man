NAME
       nona-mask - Wrapper around nona for managing external masks

Synopsis
         nona-mask [options] -o output project_file (image files)

DESCRIPTION
       Wrapper around nona.  Usage is exactly the same as for nona, except that if files named '<prefix>_mask.tif' exist, they are inserted as alpha masks before stitching.

       Some examples of valid image pairs:

         DSC_1234.tif DSC_1234_mask.tif
         IMG_5678.JPG IMG_5678_mask.tif

       Note masks can be any bit depth, but must have no alpha channel.  Black indicates areas to be ignored, any other colour indicates areas that may be blended.

       Note also that only masks need to be TIFF files, input images can be any filetype supported by nona.

       Requires Panotools::Script, nona and ImageMagick.
