              USAGE: bedmap [process-flags] [overlap-option] <operation(s)...> <ref-file> [map-file]

              Any input file must be sorted per the sort-bed utility.  The program accepts BED and Starch file formats.  You may use '-' for a BED file to indicate the input comes from stdin.

              Traverse <ref-file>, while applying <operation(s)> on qualified, overlapping elements from

       <map-file>.
              Output is one line for each line in <ref-file>, sent to standard output.  There

              is no limit on the number of operations you can specify to compute in one bedmap call.

              If <map-file> is omitted, the given file is treated as both the <ref-file> and <map-file>.

              This usage is more efficient than specifying the same file twice.

              Arguments may be given in any order before the input file(s).

              Process Flags:

       --------

       --chrom <chromosome>
              Jump to and process data for given <chromosome> only.

       --delim <delim>
              Change output delimiter from '|' to <delim> between columns (e.g. '\t').

       --ec   Error check all input files (slower).

       --faster
              (advanced) Strong input assumptions are made.  Compatible with: --bp-ovr, --range, --fraction-both, and --exact overlap options only.

       --header
              Accept headers (VCF, GFF, SAM, BED, WIG) in any input file.

       --help Print this message and exit successfully.

       --min-memory
              Minimize memory usage (slower).

       --multidelim <delim>
              Change delimiter of multi-value output columns from ';' to <delim>.

       --prec <int>
              Change the post-decimal precision of scores to <int>.  0 <= <int>.

       --sci  Use scientific notation for score outputs.

       --skip-unmapped
              Print no output for a row with no mapped elements.

       --sweep-all
              Ensure <map-file> is read completely (helps to prevent broken pipes).

       --unmapped-val <val>
              Print <val> on unmapped --echo-map* and --min/max-element* operations.  The default is to print nothing.

       --version
              Print program information.

       Overlap Options (At most, one may be selected.
              By default, --bp-ovr 1 is used):

       --------

       --bp-ovr <int>
              Require <int> bp overlap between elements of input files.

       --exact
              First 3 fields from <map-file> must be identical to <ref-file>'s.

       --fraction-both <val>
              Both --fraction-ref <val> and --fraction-map <val> must be true to qualify as overlapping.  Expect 0 < val <= 1.

       --fraction-either <val>
              Either --fraction-ref <val> or --fraction-map <val> must be true to qualify as overlapping.  Expect 0 < val <= 1.

       --fraction-map <val>
              The fraction of the element's size from <map-file> that must overlap the element in <ref-file>.  Expect 0 < val <= 1.

       --fraction-ref <val>
              The fraction of the element's size from <ref-file> that must overlap an element in <map-file>.  Expect 0 < val <= 1.

       --range <int>
              Grab <map-file> elements within <int> bp of <ref-file>'s element, where 0 <= int.  --range 0 is an alias for --bp-ovr 1.

       Operations:
              (Any number of operations may be used any number of times.)

       ----------

              SCORE:

              <ref-file> must have at least 3 columns and <map-file> 5 columns.

       --cv   The result of --stdev divided by the result of --mean.

       --kth <val>
              Generalized  median. Report the value, x, such that the fraction <val> of overlapping elements' scores from <map-file> is less than x, and the fraction 1-<val> of scores is greater than x.  0 <
              val <= 1.

       --mad <mult=1>
              The median absolute deviation of overlapping elements in <map-file>.  Multiply mad score by <mult>.  0 < mult, and mult is 1 by default.

       --max  The highest score from overlapping elements in <map-file>.

       --max-element
              A (non-random) highest-scoring and overlapping element in <map-file>.

       --max-element-rand
              A random highest-scoring and overlapping element in <map-file>.

       --mean The average score from overlapping elements in <map-file>.

       --median
              The median score from overlapping elements in <map-file>.

       --min  The lowest score from overlapping elements in <map-file>.

       --min-element
              A (non-random) lowest-scoring and overlapping element in <map-file>.

       --min-element-rand
              A random lowest-scoring and overlapping element in <map-file>.

       --stdev
              The square root of the result of --variance.

       --sum  Accumulated scores from overlapping elements in <map-file>.

       --tmean <low> <hi>
              The mean score from overlapping elements in <map-file>, after ignoring the bottom <low> and top <hi> fractions of those scores.  0 <= low <= 1.  0 <= hi <= 1.  low+hi <= 1.

       --variance
              The variance of scores from overlapping elements in <map-file>.

       --wmean
              Weighted mean, scaled in proportion to the coverage of the <ref-file> element by each overlapping <map-file> element.

       ----------

              NON-SCORE:

              <ref-file> must have at least 3 columns.  For --echo-map-id/echo-map-id-uniq, <map-file> must have at least 4 columns.  For --echo-map-score, <map-file> must have at least 5 columns.   For  all
              others, <map-file> requires at least 3 columns.
