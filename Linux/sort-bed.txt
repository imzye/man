       USAGE: sort-bed [--help] [--version] [--check-sort] [--max-mem <val>] [--tmpdir <path>] [--unique] [--duplicates] <file1.bed> <file2.bed> <...>

              Sort BED file(s).  May use '-' to indicate stdin.  Results are sent to stdout.

              <val> for --max-mem may be 8G, 8000M, or 8000000000 to specify 8 GB of memory.  --tmpdir is useful only with --max-mem.  --unique can be used to print only unique BED elements (similar to 'sort
              -u'). Cannot be used with --duplicates.  --duplicates can be used to print only duplicated or repeated elements (similar to 'uniq -d'). Cannot be used with --unique.
