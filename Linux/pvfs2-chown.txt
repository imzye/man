PVFS2-CHOWN(1)              General Commands Manual             PVFS2-CHOWN(1)

NAME
       pvfs2-chown – modify the owner and group of files in OrangeFS volumes

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-chown [-v] user group filename(s)

DESCRIPTION
       The  pvfs2-chown  utility  modifies the owner and group of the OrangeFS
       files specified.  The user and group are either numerical or  symbolic.
       Symbolic names will be looked up on the local system.

       The options are as follows:

       -v     Print version number and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       PVFS2_DEBUGFILE
              If set to the path of a local file, redirect debug output to it.

       PVFS2_DEBUGMASK
              Set  the  OrangeFS debug mask.  Possible masks are documented in
              pvfs2-set-debugmask(1).

       PVFS2TAB_FILE
              If set, the full pathname for an alternate pvfs2tab file

FILES
       /etc/passwd

       /etc/pvfs2tab

EXAMPLES
       Set a file's owner to user and group to group.

             pvfs2-chown user group /mnt/foo

CAVEATS
       In a network of multiple clients, if the user database is  not  sychro‐
       nized  between  systems, these settings will have little meaning.  They
       will be enforced, which can cause problems if this is not wanted.

       Note that because OrangeFS is a network  file  system,  any  user  with
       access to the network may be able to circumvent file permissions.
