NAME
       SVN::Class::File - represents a file in a Subversion workspace

SYNOPSIS
        # see SVN::Class;

DESCRIPTION
       This class subclasses Path::Class::File::Stat and SVN::Class.  A SVN::Class::File object behaves like a Path::Class::File::Stat object, but with the extra Subversion functionality of SVN::Class.

METHODS
       There are no new methods implemented in this class.

       The following methods are overridden to return SVN::Class-derived objects instead of Path::Class-derived objects.

       new
       dir
