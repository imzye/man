NAME
       myrescue-stat - Block bitmap statistics for myrescue

SYNOPSIS
       myrescue-stat bitmap-file

DESCRIPTION
       myrescue-stat reads a block bitmap from myrescue(1) and prints the number and percentage of blocks for the different conditions.

       Possible conditions are:

       0 = Block has not yet been handled.

       1 = Block was successfully copied.

       2 = Block was successfully copied, but took a long time to read.
              (This usually indicates that the block is almost dead.)

       Negative values = Attempts to read the block have so far failed.
              The absolute value indicate the number of failed read attempts.
