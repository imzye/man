NAME
       adddebug - Modifies Makefile(s) to add debug info

SYNOPSIS
       adddebug [-k] [-r] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       adddebug modifies the Makefile in the current directory (and optionally in its subdirectories) to add debug info (-g3). It will also remove optimisations (-O[1-9]).

       This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.

OPTIONS
       -k
           Keep optimisations (do not remove -O[1-9]?  flags which are removed by default).

       -r
           Recursively search through all subdirectories of the current directory and operate on every Makefile that is found.

       -n
           compile without NDEBUG and NO_DEBUG being defined (makes kDebug calls work)
