NAME
       newaliases - Sendmail compatibility program

SYNOPSIS
       newaliases

DESCRIPTION
       This program is provided to keep Sendmail compatibility. It is provided by the msmtp-mta package. As msmtp does not deliver local mails, this is a program which does nothing. It is a symlink to
       /bin/true.
