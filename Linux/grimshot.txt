NAME
       grimshot - a helper for screenshots within sway

SYNOPSIS
       grimshot [--notify] [--cursor] [--wait N] (copy|save) [TARGET] [FILE]
       grimshot check
       grimshot usage

OPTIONS
       --notify
           Show notifications to the user that a screenshot has been taken.

       --cursor
           Include cursors in the screenshot.

       --wait N
           Wait for N seconds before taking a screenshot. Waits after any manual selection is made. Recommended to combine with --notify in order to know when the screenshot has been taken.

       save
           Save  the  screenshot  into a regular file. Grimshot will write image files to XDG_SCREENSHOTS_DIR if this is set (or defined in user-dirs.dir), or otherwise fall back to XDG_PICTURES_DIR. Set
           FILE to '-' to pipe the output to STDOUT.

       copy
           Copy the screenshot data (as image/png) into the clipboard.

       savecopy
           Save the screenshot into a regular file (see save documentation) and copy the screenshot data into the clipboard (see copy documentation).

DESCRIPTION
       Grimshot is an easy-to-use screenshot utility for sway. It provides a convenient interface over grim, slurp and jq, and supports storing the screenshot either directly to the clipboard  using  wl-
       copy or to a file.

EXAMPLES
       An example usage pattern is to add these bindings to your sway config:

           # Screenshots:
           # Super+P: Current window
           # Super+Shift+p: Select area
           # Super+Alt+p Current output
           # Super+Ctrl+p Select a window

           bindsym Mod4+p       exec grimshot save active
           bindsym Mod4+Shift+p exec grimshot save area
           bindsym Mod4+Mod1+p  exec grimshot save output
           bindsym Mod4+Ctrl+p  exec grimshot save window

TARGETS
       grimshot can capture the following named targets:

       active
           Captures the currently active window.

       screen
           Captures the entire screen. This includes all visible outputs.

       area
           Allows manually selecting a rectangular region, and captures that.

       window
           Allows manually selecting a single window (by clicking on it), and captures it.

       output
           Captures the currently active output.

       anything
           Allows manually selecting a single window (by clicking on it), an output (by clicking outside of all windows, e.g. on the status bar), or an area (by using click and drag).

OUTPUT
       Grimshot will print the filename of the captured screenshot to stdout if called with the save or savecopy subcommands.
