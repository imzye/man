              @file ... = response file(s) containing command-line arguments -i <nsin> = input scalar volume to render (nrrd); default: ""

       -vi <nvin> = input vector volume to render (nrrd); default: ""

       -ti <ntin> = input tensor volume to render (nrrd); default: ""

       -txf <nin ...> = one or more transfer functions (1 or more nrrds)

       -fr <eye pos> = camera eye point (3 doubles)

       -at <at pos> = camera look-at point (3 doubles); default: "0 0 0"

       -up <up dir> = camera pseudo-up vector (3 doubles); default: "0 0 1"

              -rh = use a right-handed UVN frame (V points down) -or = orthogonal (not perspective) projection

       -dn <near> = distance to near clipping plane (double)

       -di <image> = distance to image plane (double)

       -df <far> = distance to far clipping plane (double)

              -ar = near, image, and far plane distances are relative to the

              *at* point, instead of the eye point

       -ur <uMin uMax> = range in U direction of image plane (2 doubles)

       -vr <vMin vMax> = range in V direction of image plane (2 doubles)

       -fv <field of view> = angle (in degrees) vertically subtended by view window

              (double); default: "20"

              -offfr = the given eye point ("-fr") is to be interpreted as an

              offset from the at point.

       -ffr <fake from> = eye point to use for view-dependent transfer functions.
              By default (not using this option), the point used is the normally specified camera eye point. (3 doubles)

       -turn <angle> = angle (degrees) by which to rotate the from point around
              true up, for making stereo pairs. Positive means move towards positive U (the right) (double); default: "0.0"

       -am <ambient> = ambient light color (3 floats); default: "1 1 1"

       -ld <light pos> = view space light position (extended to infinity)
              (3 floats); default: "0 0 -1"

       -is <image size> = image dimensions (2 ints); default: "256 256"

       -iss <scale> = scaling of image size (from "is") (float);
              default: "1.0"

       -ads <ka kd ks> = phong components (3 floats); default: "0.1 0.6 0.3"

       -sp <spec pow> = phong specular power (double); default: "30"

       -k00 <kernel> = value reconstruction kernel (kernel specification);

       -k22 <kernel> = second derivative kernel (kernel specification);
              default: "cubicdd:1,0"

       -ss <shading spec> = how to do shading (string);
              default: "phong:gage(scalar:n)"

       -ns <normal spec> = "normal" to use for those miteVal's that need one
              (string); default: ""

   -side <normal side> = how to interpret gradients as normals:
            o "1": normal points to lower values (higher == more "inside"o "0": "two-sided": dot-products are abs()'o "-1": normal points to higher values (lower == more "inside") (int) default: "1"

              -rn = renormalize kernel weights at each new sample location.

              "Accurate" kernels don't need this; doing it always makes things go slower

       -gmc <min gradmag> = For curvature-based transfer functions, set curvature to
              zero when gradient magnitude is below this (double); default: "0.0"

       -step <size> = step size along ray in world space (double);
              default: "0.01"

       -ref <size> = "reference" step size (world space) for doing opacity
              correction in compositing (double); default: "0.01"

       -vp <verbose pixel> = pixel for which to turn on verbose messages (2 ints);

              default: "-1 -1"

       -n1 <near1> = opacity close enough to 1.0 to terminate ray (double);
              default: "0.99"

       -nt <# threads> = number of threads hoover should use (int); default: "1"

       -o <filename> = file to write output nrrd to (string)
