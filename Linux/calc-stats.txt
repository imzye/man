NAME
       calc-stats - a series of wrappers for performing basic statistic calculations on files or standard input containing numbers, using awk

SYNOPSIS
       calc-min [FILE]

       calc-max [FILE]

       calc-mean [FILE]

       calc-avg [FILE]

       calc-median [FILE]

       calc-mode [FILE]

       calc-stdev [FILE]

       calc-histogram [FILE]

       calc-sum [FILE]

OPTIONS
       While none of these have options, the input may be specified either as a FILE argument, or as standard input.

DESCRIPTION
       This suite of simple tools will perform efficient statistics calculations on either a file or standard input containing numbers (integers or floats), one per line.

        * calc-min will print the largest numeric value from input

        * calc-max will print the smallest numeric value from input

        * calc-mean (and avg) will print the arithmetic mean (average) value from input

        * calc-mode will print the most frequently occurring value from input

        * calc-median will print the middle value of the sorted input

        * calc-stdev will print the standard deviation of all values in the input

        * calc-histogram will print a reverse sorted, weighted distribution of input values

        * calc-sum will calculate the sum of all input values

SEE ALSO
       awk(1), sort(1), uniq(1)
