NAME
       claws-mail-acpi-notifier - mail notification using laptop's mail LED

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-acpi-notifier package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-acpi-notifier is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       Enables mail notification via the mail LED available on some laptops.  LED can be set to blinking or on when new mail is received. Also can be set to blinking when user interaction is required.

USAGE
       Some kernel module has to be loaded first for this plugin to be able to work properly. Supported modules include: acerhk, acer_acpi (ACER); asus_acpi, asus_acpi (ASUS); ibm_acpi (IBM); tm_smapi
       (Lenovo) and apanel (Fujitsu).

       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...” button and select the plugin file, named acpi_notifier.so, and press the
       “Open” button.
