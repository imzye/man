NAME
     caesar, rot13 — decrypt caesar ciphers

SYNOPSIS
     caesar [rotation]

DESCRIPTION
     The caesar utility attempts to decrypt caesar ciphers using English let‐
     ter frequency statistics.  caesar reads from the standard input and
     writes to the standard output.

     The optional numerical argument rotation may be used to specify a spe‐
     cific rotation value.

     The frequency (from most common to least) of English letters is as fol‐
     lows:

     Their frequencies as a percentage are as follows:

           E(13),  T(10.5),  A(8.1),  O(7.9),  N(7.1), R(6.8), I(6.3), S(6.1),
           H(5.2), D(3.8),  L(3.4),  F(2.9),  C(2.7),  M(2.5),  U(2.4),  G(2),
           P(1.9),  Y(1.9),  W(1.5),  B(1.4),  V(.9),  K(.4),  X(.15), J(.13),
           Q(.11), Z(.07).

     Rotated postings to USENET and some of the databases used by the
     fortune(6) program are rotated by 13 characters.
