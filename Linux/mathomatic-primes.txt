NAME
       matho-sum - sum large integers

SYNOPSIS
       matho-sum [integers]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command-line utility is optionally part of the mathomatic(1) package.  It uses Python to sum many large integers separated by spaces or newlines.  The size of the integers is only limited by
       the available memory of the computer.  The single integer result is output to standard output, followed by a newline.

       The integers to sum may be specified on the command line or read from standard input.
