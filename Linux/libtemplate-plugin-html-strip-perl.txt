NAME
       Template::Plugin::HTML::Strip - HTML::Strip filter for Template Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
         [% USE HTML.Strip %]

         [% FILTER html_strip %]
         <title>People for the Preservation of Presentational Markup</title>
         <h1>HTML::Strip - A cause for concern?</h1>
         [% END %]

         [% USE HTML.Strip 'strip'
             striptags   = [ 'script' 'iframe' ]
             emit_spaces = 0
         %]

         [% FILTER strip %]
         <p>A call to arms against the removal of our elements!</p>
         [% END %]

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a Template Toolkit dynamic filter, which uses HTML::Strip to remove markup (primarily HTML, but also SGML, XML, etc) from filtered content during template processing.

       By default, the installed filter's name is 'html_strip'.  This can be changed by specifying a new name as the first positional argument during plugin usage:

         [% USE HTML.Strip 'strip' %]

         [% '<div>Our very existence is under threat.</div>' | strip %]

       The filter can optionally take configuration options, which will be passed to HTML::Strip's constructor method:

         [% USE HTML.Strip
             striptags   = [ 'applet' 'strong' ]
             emit_spaces = 0
         %]

         [% FILTER html_strip %]
         <strong>Are we next!?</strong>
         [% END %]

       For more details on available configuration options, please refer to HTML::Strip.

METHODS
   init
       Creates a dynamic filter and installs the filter under the value provided for the first positional argument, otherwise uses 'html_strip'.

   filter
       Receives a reference to the plugin object, along with the text to be filtered and configuration options.  Using HTML::Strip, returns the filtered (stripped) text.
