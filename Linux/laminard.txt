NAME
       laminard - Laminar CI server

SYNOPSIS
       laminard [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Start Laminar CI server in the foreground. If option -v is specified, verbose logging is enabled. Other aspects of operation are controlled by environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT
       LAMINAR_HOME
               Root location containing laminar configuration, database, build workspaces and archive.

               Default: /var/lib/laminar

       LAMINAR_BIND_HTTP
               Interface on which laminard will bind to serve the Web UI.  May be of the form IP:PORT, unix:PATH/TO/SOCKET or unix-abstract:NAME

               Default: *:8080

       LAMINAR_BIND_HRPC
               Interface on which laminard will bind to accept RPC from laminarc.  May be of the form IP:PORT, unix:PATH/TO/SOCKET or unix-abstract:NAME

               Default: unix-abstract:laminar

       LAMINAR_TITLE
               Page title to show in web frontend

       LAMINAR_KEEP_RUNDIRS
               Setting this prevents the immediate deletion of job rundirs $LAMINAR_HOME/run/$JOB/$RUN. Value should be an integer represeting the number of rundirs to keep.

               Default: 0

       LAMINAR_ARCHIVE_URL
               Base  url  used to request artifacts. Laminar can serve build artifacts (and it will if you leave this unset), but it uses a very naive and inefficient method. Best to let a real web‐
               server handle serving those requests.

FILES
       /etc/laminar.conf
               Variable assignments in this file are exported by systemd or other init system before launching the system-wide installation of Laminar.
