NAME
       xtrkcad - model railroad track CAD program

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xtrkcad command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because the original program did not have a
       manual page.

       xtrkcad is a program that can be used to design a model railroad layout.

       For more information on xtrkcad, go read the online documentation under /usr/share/doc/xtrkcad.

LICENSE
       The xtrkcad program was originally a product of Sillub.  See www.sillub.com for more information.  It is now maintained by a community effort on SourceForge.

AUTHOR
       This (incredibly lame) manual page was written by Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com>, for the Debian GNU/Linux system.
