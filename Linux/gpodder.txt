NAME
       gpo - Text mode interface of gPodder

SYNOPSIS
       gpo [--verbose|-v|--quiet|-q] [COMMAND] [params...]

DESCRIPTION
       gpo is the text mode interface of gPodder. Run it without any arguments to start the interactive shell (see below). Use "gpo help" to get a list of supported commands.

       gpo can be used to manage podcasts from the command line without having to start gPodder. It can also be used to automate tasks such as downloading or updating feeds.

       The database and files are the same as used by the GUI, gpodder(1).

INTERACTIVE SHELL MODE
       If  you run "gpo" without COMMAND it will enter its interactive shell mode. From there, you can type commands directly. When readline is available, this shell supports completion using <Tab>. Pod‐
       cast feed URLs are also completed for commands that take the URL of a podcast as argument.

       Some commands (e.g. search and toplist) will provide a query in interactive shell mode (to subscribe to podcasts). These queries will not be shown when started directly from the command line.

COMMAND PREFIXES
       For all commands, you can use only the first few characters instead of the full command, as long as the command is unique. If not, gpo will show you all matching commands and the  shortest  prefix
       of each.

       Please  note  that  future additions to the command set could change the shortest prefix of any given command, so usage of the full command in scripts is recommended (e.g. use "gpo update" and not
       "gpo up" in scripts and cronjobs).  The short command prefixes are mostly useful for interactive usage.

EXAMPLES
       gpo
           Enter interactive shell mode

       gpo update && gpo download
           Check for new episodes, then download all new episodes

       gpo search linux outlaws
           Search the directory for podcasts named "linux outlaws"

       gpo youtube http://youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0
           Print download URL of a YouTube video to stdout
