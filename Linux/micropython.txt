NAME
       micropython - a lean and efficient Python implementation for microcontrollers and constrained systems

SYNOPSIS
       micropython [<opts>] [-X <implopt>] [-c <command>] [<filename>]

DESCRIPTION
       MicroPython  is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and
       in constrained environments.

       MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension, generators, exception handling and more. Yet it  is  com‐
       pact enough to fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.

       MicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system.

OPTIONS
       -v     verbose (trace various operations); can be multiple

       -O[N]  apply bytecode optimizations of level N

       -X     Implementation specific options:

                     compile-only
                            parse and compile only

                     emit={bytecode,native,viper}
                            set the default code emitter

                     heapsize=<n>[w][K|M]
                            set the heap size for the GC (default 2097152)
