NAME
       megaraid_lsmplugin -- LibstorageMgmt MegaRAID plugin

DESCRIPTION
       LibstorageMgmt  megaraid  plugin allows user to manage LSI MegaRAID via
       vendor tool storcli[1] or Dell PERC via perccli[2].  The 'megaraid_lsm‐
       plugin'  executable  file  is for libStorageMgmt daemon to execute when
       client user specifies megaraid plugin in the URI.

       Extra SELinux actions are required to allowing plugin access the  hard‐
       ware.

       When  both storcli and percli is installed, the plugin will use storcli
       by default even that will result  in  no  system  found  on  Dell  PERC
       server.  In this case, please remove storcli.

       Please  be  noted, current volume ID is just for temperate use, we will
       change to use volume VPD83 as volume ID once vendor provide so.

       To use this plugin, users should set their URI to this format:

                     of  storcli/perccli  tool.   By default, this plugin will
