NAME
       sam_data_store - Store user data

SYNOPSIS
       #include <corosync/sam.h>

       cs_error_t sam_data_store (const void *data, size_t size);

DESCRIPTION
       The sam_data_store function is used to store data, which survives between instances.

       The data parameter is pointer to memory with data to store. Data are stored in newly allocated memory inside library, so caller can safely remove them after call of function.

       You can use NULL as parameter to remove and free previously saved data. In this case size argument is ignored.

       The size parameter is length of data.

       Use sam_data_getsize(3) to find out length of stored data and sam_data_restore(3) to restore stored data.

RETURN VALUE
       This call return CS_OK value if successful, otherwise and error is returned.

ERRORS
       CS_ERR_BAD_HANDLE
              component was not initialized by calling sam_initialize(3) or it was finalized.

       CS_ERR_NO_MEMORY
              internal malloc/realloc failed because data are too large

       CS_ERR_LIBRARY
              some internal error appeared (mostly because communication with parent process failed)
