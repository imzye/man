NAME hamexam - Study guide for USA FCC amateur radio (ham radio) license examinations.
SYNOPSIS
       hamexam {t,g,e,q}

DESCRIPTION
       hamexam presents questions in random order from the selected question pool, and terminates when all questions have been answered correctly. The session may be terminated with end-of-file (^D), and
       restarted later.

       Some  questions  refer  to figures. The figures for the selected question pool are displayed in a separate window using $PNG_VIEWER, if it is executable. If $PNG_VIEWER is undefined, eog(1), gwen‐
       view(1), gpicview(1), ristretto(1), will be used, whichever is first found to be an executable command. If $PNG_VIEWER is not an executable command (e.g. ""), or if none of the other  viewers  are
       installed, then questions which refer to figures will be noted and skipped.

       Licenses are issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but examinations are administered by Volunteer Examiners.

OPTIONS
       If no pool is specified, usage, version, and help information is displayed.

       In normal usage, one of the following options should be specified:

              t Element 2, the Technician Class pool (for examinations administered July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2026). This is the entry-level license.

              g Element 3, the General Class pool (for examinations administered July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2027). Element 2 is also required.

              e Element 4, the Extra Class pool (for examinations administered July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2028). Elements 2 and 3 are also required.

              q The question pool is selected interactively.
