Aspect::Pointcut::Highest(3pm)                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                      Aspect::Pointcut::Highest(3pm)

NAME
       Aspect::Pointcut::Highest - Pointcut for preventing recursive matching

SYNOPSIS
         use Aspect;

         # High-level creation
         my $pointcut1 = highest;

         # Manual creation
         my $pointcut2 = Aspect::Pointcut::Highest->new;

DESCRIPTION
       For aspects including timers and other Aspect::Advice::Around-based advice, recursion can be significant problem.

       The "highest" pointcut solves this problem by matching only on the highest invocation of a function. If the function is called again recursively within the first call, at any depth, the deeper
       calls will be not match and the advice will not be executed.
