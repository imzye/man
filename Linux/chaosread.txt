NAME
       chaosread - read raw noise source from chaoskey

SYNOPSIS
       chaosread

DESCRIPTION
       chaosread reads ADC values from the noise source on the attached ChaosKey device.

OPTIONS
       -s serial | --serial serial
              This selects a ChaosKey by serial number instead of using the first one found.

       -l length | --length length
              Set the amount of data to read. Suffixes 'k', 'M' and 'G' are supported. The default is 1k.

       -i | --infinite
              Keep reading forever (or until the process is killed).

       -b | --bytes
              Read 16-bits little endian values and write out one byte per sample from bits 1-8 of the sample (zero-based, so shift right by one).

       -b | --cooked
              Read values from the 'cooked' endpoint, which is the source used by the kernel driver that contains trimmed and whitened data which has 8 bits of entropy per byte.

       -b | --raw
              Read from the raw RNG source endpoint, which is best for testing the hardware on the device. This is the default

       -b | --firmware
              Read from the device firmware. This can be used to verify that the firmware in the device has the expected contents.

USAGE
       chaosread reads noise data.
