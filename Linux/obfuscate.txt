NAME
       obfuscate - censor images

SYNOPSIS
       obfuscate

DESCRIPTION
       obfuscate  allows to censor images. Currently, only images (and not PDFs) are supported. For this, two tools are available: blur and fill. Blur only adds a blurred transparent overlay over the se‐
       lected area and should not be used for sensitive data. Fill blacks out the selected area, effectively censoring it. Currently, only rectangular selection of the area to censor is  supported.   The
       keybords shortcuts can be viewed by pressing CTRL+?.
