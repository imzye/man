NAME
       gamemode-simulate-game - simulate a game using gamemode

SYNOPSIS
       gamemode-simulate-game

DESCRIPTION
       GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a
       set of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.

       The design has a clear cut abstraction between the host daemon and  li‐
       brary  (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemod‐
       eauto and gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe usage without  worry‐
       ing  about whether the daemon is installed or running. This design also
       means that while the host library currently relies on systemd  for  ex‐
       changing  messages with the daemon, it's entirely possible to implement
       other internals that still work with the same clients.

       GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
       the  Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended
       to be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are  a  wealth
       of automation tasks one might want to apply.

USAGE
       The  executable starts gamemode, sleeps for 10 seconds and stops it. It
       will exit with zero if everything works fine, else it will print an er‐
       ror and exit with one.

       To  use  this with a CI you might need to start a dbus session by hand.
       This can be done with:

           dbus-run-session -- gamemode-simulate-game

       Note that this might output to stderr, even if it exits with zero.
