       getdap4 ‐ test driver for the libdap library DAP4 protocol

1mSYNOPSIS0m

       1mgetdap4 [‐VvksM] 4m22mfile24m 1m...0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mgetdap4   22mA  command  line  interface  for  DAP4, the
follow‐on to DAP2.
       While getdap can be used to access DAP2 response   objects
and  process
       those responses with the libdap client‐side software, get‐
dap4 fills the
       same role for DAP4.

       In the first form of the command, dereference the URL  and
perform  the
       requested   operations.   This   includes  routing the re‐
turned information
       through the DAP processing library (parsing the   returned
objects,  et
       c.).   If   neither   of  d or D are used with a URL, then
the DAP library
       routines are NOT used and the URLs contents are dumped  to
standard out‐
       put.

       In   the  second form of the command, assume the files are
DAP4 Data ob‐
       jects (stored in files or read  from  pipes)  and  process
them  as  if  ‐D
       were  given.  In  this  case  the information must contain
valid MIME header
       in order to be processed or ‐M should be used.

1mOPTIONS0m
       ‐i     For each URL, get the server version.

       ‐d     For each URL, get the the DAP4 DMR response.

       ‐D     For each URL, get the the DAP4 Data response.

       ‐v     Verbose output.

       ‐V     Version of this client; see ’i’ for server version.

       ‐c expr
              4mexpr24m is a  constraint  expression.  Used  with
‐D/X.  You can use  a
              ‘?’ for the CE also.

       ‐k     Keep temporary files created by libdap.

       ‐m num Request the same URL 4mnum24m times

       ‐z     Ask the server to compress data.

       ‐s     Print Sequences using numbered rows.

       ‐M      Assume  data  read from a file has no MIME headers
(the default is
              to assume the headers are present).

1mFILES0m
       4m~/.dodsrc0m
              The 4m.dodsrc24m file contains various   parameters
that  affect  the
              runtime  behavior  for  DAP  clients.   See  1mdod‐
src22m(5) for further de‐
              tails.

1mENVIRONMENT0m
       DODS_CONF
              Specifies an alternate file or  directory  for  the
4m.dodsrc24m file.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       Various self‐explanatory messages may be issued on stderr.

1mBUGS0m
       The command name should have been chosen more carefully to
reflect  its
       purpose.

       The dodsrc man page needs to be written.
