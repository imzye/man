NAME
       metamonger - Save, diff, and restore filesystem metadata

SYNOPSIS
       metamonger [--config|--debug|-v|--verbose]

       metamonger {diff | restore | save | status} [-L|--derefence|-P|--no-dereference] [-n|--no-act] [--untracked=[no|normal|all]] [<path>]

       metamonger {help | version}

DESCRIPTION
       metamonger allows you to store file metadata as returned by stat(1) in a text file.

       By default, it saves only mtime on files.  Other attributes an

   Storage format
       The storage format is plain JSON, but reformatted so that every entry and all its data is on one line.  This allows for easy integration with git(1), svn(1), and other VCS.  It also allows for
       editing by hand should you so please.

   Name
       metamonger stands for monging metadata.  "meta" as in metadata; "monging" as in dealing with or selling something (fishmonger) and pushing for something unpleasant (warmonger).

OPTIONS
       --config
               Specify custom config file.

       --debug Print debug messages.

       --dereference|-L
               Always follow symlinks. This is the default.

       --no-dereference|-P
               Never follow symlinks.

       --no-act|-n
               Do not act; print results only.

       --untracked
               Show untracked files: None, default, or all.

       --verbose|-v
               Print verbose messages.

COMMANDS
       diff [path]
               Diff between stored and live metadata.

       help    Display this help.

       restore [path]
               Restore metadata to file system.

       save [path]
               Write metadata to file.

       status [path]
               Show status

       version Display version information.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       metamonger  can  set  metadata  on  files.   This means it is able to add/remove write permissions.  It can also change the modification times of files, potentially making make(1) ignore them in a
       rebuild.  Don't act stupidly, as metamonger will happily allow you to shoot yourself in the foot; same as rm(1).

BUGS
       None are known at this time, but reports and/or patches are more than welcome.
