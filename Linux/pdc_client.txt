NAME
       pdc_client - work with a PDC instance

SYNOPSIS
       pdc_client -s SERVER [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdc_client provides access a given PDC instance for reading and writing data.  If you have a Kerberos ticket, it will automatically obtain an access token.

OPTIONS
       -s, --server=SERVER
              Set  which  URL  to connect to.  There are shortcuts available for RedHat hosted instances (prod, stage, qa, dev).  The server URL needs to include path to the API root (usually /rest_api/v1/).
              This argument is always required.

       -x, --request=METHOD
              Select which method to perform on the resource.  This maps directly to HTTP methods, so GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE are available.  Default is GET.

       -r, --resource=RESOURCE
              Select which resource to manipulate.  If omitted, a list of available resource is printed.  For accessing a single instance of a resource, specify RESOURCE_NAME/INSTANCE_ID.  The instance iden‐
              tifier depends on what resource you are operating on.

       -d, --data=DATA
              Specify data to be sent to the server.  The data must be formatted as JSON.

       -f, --file=FILE
              Like -d, but reads data from file instead of command line argument.  If FILE is specified as -, standard input will be read.  Only one of -d and -f can be used simultaneously.

       -t, --traceback
              Print traceback information in case of an error.

       --debug
              Show details about performed requests.

FILES
       /etc/pdc/client_config.json
              Site-wide host configuration file. Has to be valid JSON.
       $HOME/.config/pdc/client_config.json
              Personal host configuration file which overrides identical keys from site-wide configuration file.
