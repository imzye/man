NAME
       khmer - k-mer counting, filtering and graph traversal FTW!

SYNOPSIS
           khmer `<prog_name>` [options] <args>

       eg.

           khmer `load-into-counting` -x 1e8 -k 20 reads.ct reads.fa.gz

USAGE
       This manpage only describes the khmer wrapper script. To find out about the software and how to use it please see /usr/share/doc/khmer or else http://khmer.readthedocs.org/.

       On Debian/Ubuntu, package maintainers avoid putting large collections of scripts directly into the system PATH. Rather, a single wrapper script is used to launch the script you want to use;
       therefore if the khmer instructions say to run load-into-counting.py ...whatever... you need to prefix this command with khmer. Furthermore, the .py extension may be omitted, resulting in a
       command of the format shown above.

       If you don’t like this, simply add /usr/lib/khmer/bin to your personal PATH.

AUTHOR
       This wrapper and manpage were written by Tim Booth, who takes no credit for khmer itself.
