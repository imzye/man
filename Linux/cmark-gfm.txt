NAME
       cmark - convert CommonMark formatted text with GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions to HTML

SYNOPSIS

       cmark-gfm [options] file*

DESCRIPTION
       cmark-gfm converts Markdown formatted plain text to either HTML, groff man, CommonMark XML, LaTeX, or CommonMark, using the conventions described in the CommonMark spec.  It reads input from stdin
       or the specified files (concatenating their contents) and writes output to stdout.

OPTIONS
       --to, -t FORMAT
                   Specify output format (html, man, xml, latex, commonmark).

       --width WIDTH
                   Specify a column width to which to wrap the output. For no wrapping, use the value 0 (the default).  This option currently only affects the commonmark, latex, and man renderers.

       --hardbreaks
                   Render  soft  breaks (newlines inside paragraphs in the CommonMark source) as hard line breaks in the target format.  If this option is specified, hard wrapping is disabled for Common‐
                   Mark output, regardless of the value given with --width.

       --nobreaks  Render soft breaks as spaces.  If this option is specified, hard wrapping is disabled for all output formats, regardless of the value given with --width.

       --sourcepos Include source position attribute.

       --normalize Consolidate adjacent text nodes.

       --extension, -e EXTENSION_NAME
                   Specify an extension name to use.

       --list-extensions
                   List available extensions and quit.

       --validate-utf8
                   Validate UTF-8, replacing illegal sequences with U+FFFD.

       --smart     Use smart punctuation.  Straight double and single quotes will be rendered as curly quotes, depending on their position.  -- will be rendered as an en-dash.  --- will be rendered as an
                   em-dash.  ... will be rendered as ellipses.

       --unsafe    Render raw HTML and potentially dangerous URLs.  (Raw HTML is not replaced by a placeholder comment; potentially dangerous URLs are not replaced by empty strings.)  Dangerous URLs  are
                   those that begin with `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, or `data:` (except for `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/jpeg`, or `image/webp` mime types).

       --github-pre-lang
                   Use GitHub-style <pre lang> for code blocks.

       --strikethrough-double-tilde
                   Only parse strikethrough (if enabled) with two tildes.

       --table-prefer-style-attributes
                   Use style attributes to align table cells instead of align attributes.

       --full-info-string
                   Include remainder of code block info string in a separate attribute.

       --help      Print usage information.

       --version   Print version.
