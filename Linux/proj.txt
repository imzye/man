NAME
       proj - Cartographic projection filter

SYNOPSIS
          proj [-beEfiIlmorsStTvVwW] [args]] [+opt[=arg] ...] file ...

          invproj [-beEfiIlmorsStTvVwW] [args]] [+opt[=arg] ...] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       proj and invproj perform respective forward and inverse conversion of cartographic data to or from cartesian data with a wide range of selectable projection functions.

       invproj may not be available on all platforms; in this case use proj -I instead.

       The following control parameters can appear in any order

       -b     Special  option  for  binary  coordinate data input and output through standard input and standard output. Data is assumed to be in system type double floating point words. This option is to be
              used when proj is a child process and allows bypassing formatting operations.

       -d <n>

       New in version 5.2.0: Specify the number of decimals in the output.

       -i     Selects binary input only (see -b).

       -I     Alternate method to specify inverse projection. Redundant when used with invproj.

       -o     Selects binary output only (see -b).

       -t<a>  Where a specifies a character employed as the first character to denote a control line to be passed through without processing. This option applicable to ASCII input only.  (#  is  the  default
              value).

       -e <string>
              Where string is an arbitrary string to be output if an error is detected during data transformations. The default value is a three character string: *\t*.  Note that if the -b, -i or -o options
              are employed, an error is returned as HUGE_VAL value for both return values.

       -E     Causes the input coordinates to be copied to the output line prior to printing the converted values.

       -l<[=id]>
              List projection identifiers that can be selected with +proj. proj -l=id gives expanded description of projection id, e.g. proj -l=merc.

       -lp    List of all projection id that can be used with the +proj parameter.  Equivalent to proj -l.

       -lP    Expanded description of all projections that can be used with the +proj parameter.

       -le    List of all ellipsoids that can be selected with the +ellps parameters.

       -lu    List of all distance units that can be selected with the +units parameter.

       -ld    List of datums that can be selected with the +datum parameter.

       -r     This options reverses the order of the expected input from longitude-latitude or x-y to latitude-longitude or y-x.

       -s     This options reverses the order of the output from x-y or longitude-latitude to y-x or latitude-longitude.

       -S     Causes estimation of meridional and parallel scale factors, area scale factor and angular distortion, and maximum and minimum scale factors to be listed between <> for  each  input  point.  For
              conformal projections meridional and parallel scales factors will be equal and angular distortion zero. Equal area projections will have an area factor of 1.

       -m <mult>
              The cartesian data may be scaled by the mult parameter. When processing data in a forward projection mode the cartesian output values are multiplied by mult otherwise the input cartesian values
              are divided by mult before inverse projection. If the first two characters of mult are 1/ or 1: then the reciprocal value of mult is employed.

       -f <format>
              Where format is a printf format string to control the form of the output values.  For inverse projections, the output will be in degrees when this option is  employed.  The  default  format  is
              "%.2f" for forward projection and DMS for inverse.

       -w<n>  Where n is the number of significant fractional digits to employ for seconds output (when the option is not specified, -w3 is assumed).

       -W<n>  Where n is the number of significant fractional digits to employ for seconds output. When -W is employed the fields will be constant width with leading zeroes.

       -v     Causes a listing of cartographic control parameters tested for and used by the program to be printed prior to input data.

       -V     This option causes an expanded annotated listing of the characteristics of the projected point. -v is implied with this option.

       The  +opt  run-line arguments are associated with cartographic parameters.  Additional projection control parameters may be contained in two auxiliary control files: the first is optionally referenced
       with the +init=file:id and the second is always processed after the name of the projection has been established from either the run-line or the  contents  of  +init  file.  The  environment  parameter
       PROJ_LIB establishes the default directory for a file reference without an absolute path. This is also used for supporting files like datum shift files.

       One or more files (processed in left to right order) specify the source of data to be converted. A - will specify the location of processing standard input. If no files are specified, the input is as‐
       sumed to be from stdin.  For ASCII input data the two data values must be in the first two white space separated fields and when both input and output are ASCII all trailing portions of the input line
       are appended to the output line.

       Input  geographic data (longitude and latitude) must be in DMS format and input cartesian data must be in units consistent with the ellipsoid major axis or sphere radius units. Output geographic coor‐
       dinates will be in DMS (if the -w switch is not employed) and precise to 0.001" with trailing, zero-valued minute-second fields deleted.

EXAMPLE
       The following script

          proj +proj=utm +lon_0=112w +ellps=clrk66 -r <<EOF
          45d15'33.1" 111.5W
          45d15.551666667N -111d30
          +45.25919444444 111d30'000w
          EOF

       will perform UTM forward projection with a standard UTM central meridian nearest longitude 112W. The geographic values of this example are equivalent and meant as examples of various forms of DMS  in‐
       put. The x-y output data will appear as three lines of:

          460769.27     5011648.45

OTHER PROGRAMS
       The proj program is limited to converting between geographic and projected coordinates within one datum.

       The cs2cs program operates similarly, but allows translation between any pair of definable coordinate reference systems, including support for datum translation.
