NAME
       TM-score - an algorithm to calculate the similarity of topologies of two protein structures

VERSION
       This documentation refers to TM-score version released on 2011/01/30

SYNOPSIS
       1. Run TM-score to compare 'model' and 'native':

           TMscore model native

       2. Run TM-score with an assigned d0, e.g. 5 Angstroms:

           TMscore model native -d 5

       3. Run TM-score with superposition output, e.g. 'TM.sup', and view in Rasmol:

           TMscore model native -o TM.sup
           rasmol -script TM.sup

DESCRIPTION
       This program is to compare two protein structures and identify the best superposition that has the highest TM-score. Input structures must be in the PDB format. By default, TM-score is normalized by
       the second protein. Users can obtain a brief instruction by simply running the program without arguments.

OPTIONS
           -o filename.sup Outputs the superposition to the specified file,
              suitable for use in rasmol.

           -d value Sets d0 to the specified number of angstroms.
