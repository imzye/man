NAME
       rancid_intro - introduction to the Really Awesome New Cisco confIg Differ

INTRODUCTION
       rancid  is  really more than just a Cisco configuration differ.  It handles several different device's configurations; currently including Alteon, Arista, Bay Networks (Nortel), Cisco, Extreme, F5
       BigIP, Force10, Fortinet, Foundry, HP Procurve switches, Hauwei VRP, Hitachi, Juniper Routers and edge (ERX) routers, MRTd daemon, Microtik routers, Netscaler load balancers, Netscreen  firewalls,
       Redback, SMC switches, Xirrus arrays, Zebra routing software, and the ADC-Kentrox EZ-T3 mux.

       rancid uses an expect script to login using ssh, telnet, or rsh to each of a list of devices and run a set of commands for that device-type and collects the output.  The output is run through some
       filtering to summarize, reformat, and/or snip unwanted or security related data such as chassis temperature and easily reverse-able passwords.

       Named  after  the  device's name in the group's configuration file (router.db), the resulting files are saved in the directory <group>/configs.  Except for the data filtered from the configuration
       file for security reasons, such as reversable passwords, these files are suitable for loading directly to restore a lost configuration.  See rancid.conf(5) for more information on <group>s.

       After filtering, a uni-diff (see diff(1)) of the result is produced for each of the devices in a group against that of the previous run of rancid  and  is  e-mailed  to  that  group's  mail  list,
       "rancid-<group>".  This e-mail will also include any differences of the device list in the group's configuration file, router.db.

       Lastly,  all  the updated files are checked into the revision control system (CVS, Subversion, or git).  And, administrative messages, such as collections that are failing for longer than OLDTIME,
       are mailed to "rancid-admin-<group>".

       Additional utilities, including a looking glass, come with rancid.  See rancid's share directory ( share/rancid).

EXAMPLE E-MAIL
       Below is a sample of a uni-diff produced from the group "shrubbery" for the device named dfw.shrubbery.net, which happens to be a Cisco GSR.

       In this example, we see that a Gigabit Ethernet linecard was removed from slot 6.  However, since this data is collected from "show" commands on the router, it could just as  easily  be  that  the
       card crashed so the RP can not communicate with it to collect information.

GETTING STARTED
       Installation  instructions are included in the distribution's top-level directory in the README file (which will be installed in share/rancid).  Once the installation is complete, start by reading
       the man pages listed below or follow the basic instructions included in the README file.

       See http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid for information on new versions, mail lists, etc.

ADDING NEW GROUPS
       Follow this procedure for adding new groups:

       o      Update the LIST_OF_GROUPS variable in etc/rancid.conf (see rancid.conf(5)).

       o      Run rancid-cvs(1).

       o      Update the system's mail aliases file /etc/aliases (see rancid.conf(5)).
