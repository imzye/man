NAME
       cmunipack - CCD astrophotometry software package

DESCRIPTION
       The  software  package  C-Munipack presents the complete system for reduction of images carried out by CCD camera, oriented at the observation of variable stars. The specific programs of reduction
       process can be called from command line or via intuitive graphical user interface. For developers a dynamic-link library with powerful interface is available.

       The project is based on the previous Munipack package, the programs have the same name, but contrary to Munipack, it is coded in C language and it contains a several new functions and tools in ad‐
       dition. Assignment of the command-line parameters and the configuration files is similar in both projects, exceptions are described in the project documentation.

AUTHORS
       The project manager David Motl is also the author of the most part of the source codes. Some algorithms originates from Munipack package, coded by Filip Hroch. Algorithms for  aperture  photometry
       originates from Daophot software by P. B. Stetson. Munifind algorithm originates from Varfind tool written by Rudolf Novak and Lukas Kral.

       The package uses the FITSIO library (Dr. William Pence, NASA), and the James Clark´s EXPAT library.

       The english version of the documentation was written by David Motl with great help of Petr Lutcha and Jitka Kudrnacova.
