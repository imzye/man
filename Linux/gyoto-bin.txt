NAME
       Gyoto - the General relativitY Orbit Tracer of Observatoire de Paris

SYNOPSIS
       gyoto-mpi-worker.SOVERS [MPI options]

DESCRIPTION
       Gyoto  is  a  framework for computing geodesics in curved space-times. The gyoto-mpi-worker helper program is not meant to be executed directly by the user. It is spawned by the MPI frawework when
       using multi-processing. It does not process any command-line parameter, but passes them to MPI_Init(3). gyoto-mpi-worker is bound to a specific version of the Gyoto  application  binary  interface
       (ABI). To allow for co-installation of several versions of the Gyoto library, the SO information digits are appended to the executable name.
