NAME
       linuxvnc - export a tty to any VNC client

SYNOPSIS
       linuxvnc [tty_number [args]]

DESCRIPTION
       It follows the same idea as WinVNC, x11vnc or OSXvnc, i.e. it takes an existing desktop and exports it via RFB (VNC), just that LinuxVNC exports text.

       If you want to export another tty, specify it as 'tty_number'.  You can also pass VNC options to tune what encodings are used for the VNC session. You can read x11vnc man page for more infor‐
       mation on this.
