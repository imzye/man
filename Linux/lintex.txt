NAME
       lintex - removes TeX-related garbage files

SYNOPSIS
       lintex [ -i ] [ -r ] [ -b ext ] [ -p ]  [ -k ] [ -o ] [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -d ]  [ dir [ dir ... ]]

DESCRIPTION
       lintex  is  a program that removes TeX-related auxiliary files, normally not needed after a successful TeX run (i.e. log, aux, dvi, ... files); they are actually removed only if their modification
       timestamp is more recent than the one of the related TeX source and if they aren't readonly.  In addition, all the backup files that your favorite editor has generated are also removed.

OPTIONS
       -i     Asks the user permission before actually removing any file.

       -r     The given directories are scanned recursively; i.e., if they contain any subdirectory structure, all the tree will be cleaned up.

       -b ext ext is the trailer string (the ´extension´) that identifies the backup files generated by your editor, e.g.  -b .bak; ext defaults to ~ (the tilde character), i.e. to the emacs  convention.
              If  ext  includes  characters  having a special meaning for the shell, it must be enclosed in quotes: e.g.  -b "~" (equivalent to the default).  Specifying the null string, as in -b "", in‐
              hibits the cleanup of any special file.

       -p     Pretends, show what files would be removed but don't actually remove them.

       -k     Keeps final documents (.pdf, .ps, .dvi).

       -o     Permits the removal of files older than their sources.

       -q     Quiet, only prints error messages.

       -v     Verbose, prints which files were removed and which weren't.

       -d     Debug, prints the answers to all of life's questions.

PARAMETERS
       dir    The name(s), separated by whitespace, of one or more directories to be cleaned; if missing, the default is the current directory.

EXTENSIONS THAT GET REMOVED
       All files ending in the following extensions may be removed when appropriate:

          .aux, .bbl, .bcf, .blg, .dvi, .idx, .ilg, .ind, .lof, .log, .lot, .nav, .out, .pdf, .ps, .snm, .thm, .toc, .toc.old, .synctex.gz, .xyc

ENVIRONMENT
       The HOME environment variable determines the location of the configuration file, see FILES below.

FILES
       Users can create a configuration file $HOME/.lintexrc which optionally contains the keys remove-exts and keep-exts, each followed by a Python style list of extensions  to  additionally  remove  or
       keep,  respectively.   Each extension must be preceded by a period, e.g. ".pdf" and not "pdf".  The keep-exts key is only used when the keep option (-k) is passed.  Note that the extensions listed
       in the keep-exts field replace the defaults used by the -k option. The keep-exts option also takes precedence over remove-exts: no file ending in an extension removed by default or listed  in  re‐
       move-exts will be deleted if its extension is listed in keep-exts and the -k option was passed. For example, the configuration file

           keep-exts = [".pdf", ".ps", ".log"];
           remove-exts = [".txt", ".1"];

       will  keep any file ending in ".pdf", ".ps" or ".log" when lintex is called with the -k option (but not files ending in ".dvi"), and adds ".txt" and ".1" to the list of extensions to check for re‐
       moval. The following configuration file provides lintex with its default behaviour:

           keep-exts = [".pdf", ".ps", ".dvi"];
           remove-exts = [];

BUGS
       lintex cannot handle extensions containing periods, for example, ".toc.old" and ".synctex.gz", since it splits filenames at the last period to find the extension,  treating  "foo.toc.old"  as  the
       file "foo.toc" with the extension ".old".
