NAME
       pmall - show all installed versions and descs

SYNOPSIS
           pmall [-d] [-w] [-a] [-s]

       pmall - show all installed versions and descs

DESCRIPTION
       This program runs through all your installed modules and tells you what
       they're for and what version number they are at.

       The following options are honored:

       -v  give debug info

       -w  warn about missing descriptions on modules

       -a  include relative paths

       -s  sort output within each directory

HISTORICAL NOTE
       This program used to be called pmdesc and is included in The Perl
       Cookbook under that name.  However, that name has been usurped by a
       simpler program.

       For example, to find the versions of what is in your site-specific
       directory, the simpler pmdesc might be preferred:

           $ pmdesc `pminst -s | perl -lane 'print $F[1] if $F[0] =~ /site/'`
           XML::Parser::Expat (2.19) - Lowlevel access to James Clark's expat XML parser
           XML::Parser (2.19) - A perl module for parsing XML documents

KNOWN BUGS
       This program takes a long time to run.

       Some modules don't work right (CPAN.pm, ExtUtils) because of noisy
       things they do at compile time or poor formatting of the pod.
