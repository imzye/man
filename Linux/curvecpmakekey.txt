NAME
       CurveCP — Message-handling programs

SYNOPSIS
       curvecpmakekey [keydir]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the CurveCP commands.

       A  traditional UNIX-style server such as ftpd handles just one network connection, reading input from stdin and writing output to stdout. A "superserver" such as inetd or tcpserver listens for network
       connections and starts a separate server process for each connection.

       curvecpmakekey creates keys needed for curvecpclient can use programs other than curvecpserver.

OPTIONS
       How to use curvecpmakekey:

       keydir    a directory where CurveCP keys are going to be created. The direcoty must not exists before keys creation.
