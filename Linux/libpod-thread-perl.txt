NAME
       pod2thread - Convert POD data to the HTML macro language thread.

SYNOPSIS
       pod2thread [-chn] [-s style] [-t title]
           [input [output]]

DESCRIPTION
       pod2thread is a front-end for Pod::Thread.  It uses that module to generate thread source from POD source.

       input is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in code).  If input isn't given, it defaults to STDIN.  output, if given, is the file to which to write the thread output.  If
       output isn't given, the output is written to STDOUT.

OPTIONS
       -c, --contents
           Generate a table of contents as the first section of the resulting thread file, with links to each top-level heading.

       -n, --navbar
           Generate a navigation bar at the top of the resulting thread file, with links to each top-level heading.

       -h, --help
           Print out usage information and exit.

       -s style, --style=style
           In the generated thread source, include a reference to the style sheet style.  If this option is not given, no style sheet reference will be included.

       -t title, --title=title
           Use title as the title of the page rather than looking for a NAME section in the POD document.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If pod2thread fails with errors, see Pod::Thread and Pod::Simple for information about what those errors might mean.  Internally, it can also produce the following diagnostic:

       Unknown option: %s
           (F) An unknown command line option was given.

       In addition, other Getopt::Long error messages may result from invalid command-line options.
