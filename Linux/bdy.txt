NAME
       bdy - boundary curve finder

SYNOPSIS
       bdy [precision]

DESCRIPTION
       Bdy  is a filter used to find boundary curves in Geomview objects.  The
       program reads a geomview object from standard input and prints the  re‐
       sultant  vector  object  to standard output.  Bdy finds the segments of
       the vector by first converting the given object into  a  polylist  (See
       anytooff(1)).   Then, it finds all edges used once and only once in the
       polylist and combines these edges into a vector object.   The  optional
       precision  arguement  specifies  the  maximum distance between vertices
       that are to be considered identical.  By default, it is set to 0.0, in‐
       dicating that the vertices must be numerically identical.  It may some‐
       times be necessary to set it to a higher value to compensate for float‐
       ing-point error.

       The vector object is always black.

BUGS
       The  vector  object is not a particularly compact representation of it‐
       self, since it contains many 2-vertex segments which could be combined.
