BOTCH-BUILD-FIXPOINT(1)                                                                           botch tools                                                                           BOTCH-BUILD-FIXPOINT(1)

NAME
       botch-build-fixpoint - find build order until dependency cycles occur

SYNOPSIS
       botch-build-fixpoint [options] --available=AvailablePackages Packages.. Sources

DESCRIPTION
       Given a list of source packages Sources, return the list of binary packages that can be built without having to break a dependency cycle. The algorithm repeatedly attempts to satisfy build
       dependencies of all source packages using the available binary packages from AvailablePackages and adds the binary packages of those source packages that satisfy their build dependencies to the set of
       available binary packages.

OPTIONS
       --version
           show program's version and exit

       -h, --help
           show this help message and exit

       -v, --verbose
           print additional information

       --quiet
           do no print any messages

       -A, --available=AvailablePackages
           List of available packages (arch:all, crossed...) in control file format (setting this argument is required). Packages in this list have to be part of Packages.

       --deb-drop-b-d-indep
           Drop Build-Depends-Indep dependencies

       --deb-drop-b-d-arch
           Drop Build-Depends-Arch dependencies

       --allowsrcmismatch
           If a binary package is without a source package but there is a source package of same name but different version, match this binary package to that source package.

       --output-order=FILE
           instead of stderr, write the calculated build order to this file.

       --fg=PKGS
           Additional Packages lists that are checked and used for resolving dependencies (can be repeated)

       --bg=PKGS
           Additional Packages lists that are NOT checked but used for resolving dependencies (can be repeated)

       -o, --outfile=FILE
           Set the output file FILE

       --deb-native-arch=ARCH
           Native architecture ARCH

       --deb-host-arch=arch
           Host architecture arch. Defaults to native architecture.

       --deb-foreign-archs=archs
           Comma-separated foreign architectures in addition to native and host architectures.

EXAMPLE
       Calculate the source packages that can be built in a given state:

        botch-build-fixpoint --deb-native-arch=amd64 --available packages-arch-all --output-order=order.lst packages sources
