NAME
       scsieject - control SCSI tape devices

SYNOPSIS
       scsieject [-f <scsi-generic-device>] commands

DESCRIPTION
       The scsieject command controls SCSI devices in a platform-independent manner. As long as 'mtx' works on the platform, so does 'scsieject'.

OPTIONS
       The  first  argument,  given  following  -f , is the SCSI generic device corresponding to your tape drive.  Consult your operating system's documentation for more information (for example, under Linux
       these are generally /dev/sg0 through /dev/sg15, under FreeBSD these are /dev/pass0 through /dev/passX. Under Solaris this is usually the same as your tape drive (Solaris has a SCSI passthrough ioctl).
       You can set the STAPE or TAPE environment variable rather than use -f.

COMMANDS
       load      Load the medium into the drive.  When this command is issued to a CD/DVD drive and the tray is extended the tray will be retracted if the drive is capable of it.

       unload    Unload the medium from the drive (also known as eject).  When this command is issued to a CD/DVD drive or a tape drive the media will be ejected if the device supports it.

       start     Start the device.  Some devices require a start command after a media changer has loaded new media into the device.

       stop      Stop the device.  Some devices require a stop command prior to unloading the medium from the device when using a media changer.

       lock      Lock the device.  Locks the device so that the medium cannot be removed manually.

       unlock    Unlock the device.  Unlocks the device so that the medium can be removed manually.

AUTHORS
       This  program  was written by Robert Nelson <robertnelson@users.sourceforge.net> based on the scsitape program written by Eric Lee Green <eric@badtux.org>.  Major portions of the 'mtxl.c' library used
       herein were written by Leonard Zubkoff.

HINTS
       Under Linux, cat /proc/scsi/scsi will tell you what SCSI devices you have.  You can then refer to them as /dev/sga, /dev/sgb, etc. by the order they are reported.

       Under FreeBSD, camcontrol devlist will tell you what SCSI devices you have, along with which pass device controls them.

       Under Solaris 7 and 8, /usr/sbin/devfsadm -C will clean up your /devices directory. Then find /devices -name 'st@*' -print will return a list of all tape drives. /dev on Solaris is apparently only  of
       historical interest.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       There are no known bugs or limitations.

AVAILABILITY
