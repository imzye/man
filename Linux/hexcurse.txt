NAME
       hexcurse - an ncurses-based hex editor

SYNOPSIS
       hexcurse [ -?  |  -help ] [ -a ] [ -r rnum ] [ -o outputfile ] [ [ -i ] inputfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       hexcurse is an ncurses-based hexeditor utility that is able to open, modify, and save a file to disk while providing useful editing and searching options.

OPTIONS
       -?  |  -help   Prints out the command usage info

       -a             Specifies the addresses to be output in decimal format initially.

       -r rnum        Specifies  the number of characters per line that the hexeditor should output.  If rnum is either less than 1 or greater than the columns of the current terminal, hexcurse will fill
                      the terminal width, just as if the -r was not specified.

       -o outputfile  Specifies the output file to be written to by default.

       [-i] inputfile Specifies the input file to be read in.  -i is not needed if inputfile is the last argument on the line.

INTERACTIVE OPTIONS
       F1 | ctrl+?    Shows key command help.

       F2 | ctrl+s    Save the current file.

       F3 | ctrl+o    Opens a file.

       F4 | ctrl+g    Goto a certain location in the current file.  Depending on which way the addresses are being viewed at the moment, the search will behave differently.  If  the  addresses  are  cur‐
                      rently  in  hex  format, the search will search as if the input was given in hexadecimal format.  If the addresses are in decimal format, the function will search for the address in
                      decimal.

       F5 | ctrl+f    Search for a certain string in the current file.  Depending on which window the user is currently editing in, this search will behave differently.  If editing in the hex window, the
                      input should only be in hexadecimal, and it will search for the hexadecimal "string."  If the current editing window is the ASCII window, the input should be ASCII  characters,  and
                      the search will find that ASCII string in the file.

       F6 | ctrl+a    Switch between hexadecimal address values and decimal address values.

       F7 | TAB       Switch between the hexadecimal and ASCII editing windows.

       F8 | ctrl+q | ctrl+x
                      Exit out of the program.

       Page Up | ctrl+u
                      Scroll one 'page' up.

       Page Down | ctrl+d
                      Scroll one 'page' down.

       Home | ctrl+t  Returns to the top of the file.

       End | ctrl+b   Jumps to the bottom of the file.

       ctrl+z         Undo the last modification.  Can be used multiple times.

       Esc            Escapes out of the save, open, goto, and find prompts.

BUGS
       On some terminals the function keys will not work.

       Support  for resizable terminals is still a bit rudimentary.  At this time, when the terminal is resized, the cursor is positioned at the beginning of the file.  This will be corrected in the next
       release.  There is also an issue where the labels on the bottom of the screen do not resize correctly.  A fix for the latter is in the works.

TODO
       When we get the time, we would like to implement the ability to insert and delete data from the file.  Please e-mail us with any additional suggestions.
