NAME
       tdc - stand alone clock that is designed to run as a dock application but is not required to

SYNOPSIS
       tdc [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Tiny Dockable Clock (tdc) is a simple and tiny dockable clock.

       TDC is a stand-alone clock to X Window Systemd/X11 (e.g. XOrg or XFree86). It has minimal build and run-time dependencies. TDC works with virtually any EWMH-compliant window manager.

       The behavior and the look of TDC can be configured either via command line options or via configuration file. As usual, command-line options have precedence over options that are specified in the
       configuration file.
