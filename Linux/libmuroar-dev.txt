libmuroar(7)                                                       System Manager's Manual: MuRoar                                                      libmuroar(7)

NAME
       libmuroar - minimalist RoarAudio sound library

SYNOPSIS
        #include <muroar.h>

DESCRIPTION
       libmuroar  is a client side implementation of the RoarAudio protocol.  It is used to comunicate with RoarAudio servers. As the name suggests it only supports
       a subset of the protocol. This is by design. Any application needing more features of the protocol needs to use libroar(7) or any other client library imple‐
       mentation providing the features they need.

LICENSE
       libmuroar  is  licensed  under the GNU LGPL version 3 (with "or later" option).  This allows non-free applications to use this library while libroar doesn't.
       See the license text for details.

EXAMPLES
       The source code of the provided program muroarstream(1) can be used as example how to use this library.

SERVER ADDRESS
       Depending on which features are compiled into MuRoar different server address types are supported.

       For UNIX Domain Sockets the address is in form /path/to/sock. At least one slash needs to be included.  For TCP/IP connections host:port is used.  While  the
       port  (and  the  colon) is optional.  For DECnet connections the address is in form node::object. Both node and object are optional.  When they are not given
       defaults are used (local node, and default object).

       In addition the special addresses "+default", "+invalid" and "+abstract" are supported.  The "+default" address does the same as passing a NULL  pointer  but
       is used to work around applications not letting the user to pass a NULL pointer in some way.  The "+invalid" address is used to tell the connection to always
       fail. This is useful for testing and debugging. The "+abstract" address is a special kind of UNIX Domain Socket, requesting to connect to the abstract  name‐
       space.

PROTOCOL FEATURES
       The following features are supported by this library. Some of them may not be compiled in depending on the build time configuration and target Operating Sys‐
       tem.

       Protocol constants
              A lot protocol constants are exported in the header. This includes default server addresses, default audio profiles, command IDs, flags needed by com‐
              mands, stream direction parameter and codec IDs.

              The exported constants are not limited to what this library needs internally.

       Opening a control connection
              Control connections to a server can be opend using muroar_connect(3).  The function does all the basic protocol setup including sending client name.

       Closing a control or data connection
              The functions muroar_quit(3) and muroar_close(3) close a control or data connection.

       Opening a data connection
              The function muroar_stream(3) is used to transform a control connection into a data connection (using the EXEC command).

       Notify Beeps
              Notify Beeps (sounds) can be send using muroar_beep(3). This function requests the server to emit a beep to notify the user about some event.

       Pinging and Keep-Alive
              The server can be pinged via muroar_noop(3). This can be used to messure effective latency between the client and server. It can also be used as Keep-
              Alive on long living connections.

       Setting volume
              Using muroar_setvolume(3) the volume of a stream can be set.  This function is limited to setting mono or stereo volumes but not limited to  mono  and
              stereo  streams.  If the number of channels does not match the volume is set using the UNMAPPED mode in which the channel setup is converted automati‐
              cally (the developer do not need to care).  (Since version 0.1.8.)

       I/O Abstraction
              The functions muroar_write(3) and muroar_read(3) are provided to do portable I/O on the data connection as provided by this library.  They  should  be
              used.  See section PORTABILITY NOTES for details.

PORTABILITY NOTES
       This  library  is designed to be portable. It should work well on all kind of POSIX systems including UNIX and GNU/Linux. It is also maintained for Win32 and
       was ported to OpenVMS.  Porting to YIFF is work in process.  It should work on all CPUs only depending on the Operating System to provided the needed  inter‐
       faces.

       The library exports most of it's internal I/O-abstraction to enable writing portable clients.  This should be used and seems to be important on Win32.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following variables are used in libmuroar itself so they are common to all clients using libmuroar.

       HOME   The user's home directory. This is used to locate the user's local socket ($HOME/.roar).

       ROAR_SERVER
              The address of the server to use.  See section SERVER ADDRESS for details.

FILES
       /etc/roarserver
              This is a symlink to the server socket.  If all types of server addresses are supported.  Example:
               ln -s /tmp/roar /etc/roarserver
               ln -s somehost /etc/roarserver
               ln -s mynode:: /etc/roarserver

NOTES
       This library should not be confused with the similar named server implementation "MuRoarD".
