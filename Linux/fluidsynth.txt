NAME
       FluidSynth - a SoundFont synthesizer

SYNOPSIS
       fluidsynth [options] [ SoundFonts ] [ midifiles ]

DESCRIPTION
       FluidSynth  is  a  real-time MIDI synthesizer based on the SoundFont(R) 2 specifications.  It can be used to render MIDI input or MIDI files to audio.  The MIDI events are read from a MIDI device.
       The sound is rendered in real-time to the sound output device.

       The easiest way to start the synthesizer is to give it a SoundFont on the command line: 'fluidsynth soundfont.sf2'.  fluidsynth will load the SoundFont and read MIDI events from the  default  MIDI
       device  using  the default MIDI driver.  Once FluidSynth is running, it reads commands from the stdin.  There are commands to send MIDI events manually, to load or unload SoundFonts, and so forth.
       All the available commands are discussed below.

       FluidSynth can also be used to play a list of MIDI files.  Simply run FluidSynth with the SoundFont and the list of MIDI files to play.  In this case you might not want to open the MIDI device  to
       read  external  events.   Use the -n option to deactivate MIDI input.  If you also want to deactivate the use of the shell, start FluidSynth with the -i option: 'fluidsynth -ni soundfont.sf2 midi‐
       file1.mid midifile2.mid'.

       Run fluidsynth with the --help option to check for changes in the list of options.

SHELL COMMANDS
       GENERAL

       help   Prints out list of help topics (type "help <topic>" to view details on available commands)

       quit   Quit the synthesizer

       SOUNDFONTS

       load filename [reset] [bankofs]
              Load  a  SoundFont onto the SoundFont stack. If reset is 1 (which is the implicit default), all currently in-use SoundFont presets will be re-evaluated with the newly loaded SoundFont taken
              into account.  Optionally, you can specify a non-zero bank offset for the new SoundFont. For example the command load soundfont.sf2 0 10 will load the soundfont.sf2 with a bank offset of 10
              without re-evaluating the presets.

       unload number
              Unload a SoundFont.  The number is the index of the SoundFont on the stack.

       fonts  Lists the current SoundFonts on the stack

       inst number
              Print out the available instruments for the SoundFont.

       MIDI ROUTER

       router_default
              Reloads the default MIDI routing rules (input channels are mapped 1:1 to the synth)

       router_clear
              Deletes all MIDI routing rules.

       router_begin [note|cc|prog|pbend|cpress|kpress]
              Starts a new routing rule for events of the given type

       router_chan min max mul add
              Limits the rule for events on min <= chan <= max.  If the channel falls into the window, it is multiplied by 'mul', then 'add' is added.

       router_par1 min max mul add
              Limits parameter 1 (for example note number in a note events).  Similar to router_chan.

       router_par2 min max mul add
              Limits parameter 2 (for example velocity in a note event).  Similar to router_chan

       router_end
              Finishes the current rule and adds it to the router.

       Router examples

       router_clear

       router_begin note

       router_chan 0 7 0 15

       router_end
              Will accept only note events from the lower 8 MIDI channels.  Regardless of the channel, the synthesizer plays the note on ch 15 (synthchannel=midichannel*0+15)

       router_begin cc

       router_chan 0 7 0 15

       router_par1 1 1 0 64

       router_add
              Configures the modulation wheel to act as sustain pedal (transforms CC 1 to CC 64 on the lower 8 MIDI channels, routes to ch 15)
