NAME
       Libravatar::URL - Make URLs for Libravatars from an email address

SYNOPSIS
           use Libravatar::URL;

           my $url = libravatar_url( email => 'larry@example.org' );

DESCRIPTION
       See <http://www.libravatar.org> for more information.

Functions
       libravatar_url

           # By email
           my $url = libravatar_url( email => $email, %options );

           # By OpenID
           my $url = libravatar_url( openid => $openid, %options );

       Constructs a URL to fetch the Libravatar for the given $email address or $openid URL.

       %options are optional.  "libravatar_url" will accept all the options of "gravatar_url" in Gravatar::URL except for "rating" and "border".

       The available options are...

       size

       Specifies the desired width and height of the avatar (they are square).

       Valid values are from 1 to 512 inclusive. Any size other than 80 may cause the original image to be downsampled using bicubic resampling before output.

           size    => 40,  # 40 x 40 image

       default

       The url to use if the user has no avatar.

           default => "http://www.example.org/nobody.jpg"

       Relative URLs will be relative to the base (ie. libravatar.org), not your web site.

       Libravatar defines special values that you may use as a default to produce dynamic default images. These are "identicon", "monsterid", "wavatar" and "retro".  "404" will cause the URL to return an
       HTTP 404 "Not Found" error instead and "mm" will display the same "mystery man" image for everybody.  See <http://www.libravatar.org/api> for more info.

       If omitted, Libravatar will serve up their default image, the orange butterfly.

       base

       This is the URL of the location of the Libravatar server you wish to grab avatars from.  Defaults to <http://cdn.libravatar.org/avatar/> for HTTP and <https://seccdn.libravatar.org/avatar/> for
       HTTPS.

       short_keys

       If true, use short key names when constructing the URL.  "s" instead of "size", "d" instead of "default" and so on.

       short_keys defaults to true.

       https

       If true, serve avatars over HTTPS instead of HTTP.

       You should select this option if your site is served over HTTPS to avoid browser warnings about the presence of insecure content.

       https defaults to false.
