SENDPAGE(1p)                                                     User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                    SENDPAGE(1p)

NAME
       sendpage - listen for pages via SNPP, and send pages via modem

SYNOPSIS
       sendpage [OPTIONS] [recipient ...]

OPTIONS
       -bd Start sendpage in "daemon mode" where it will start all the Paging Central queues and wait for pages to be delivered.  When sendpage runs as a daemon, it
           must be running as the 'sendpage' user as specified in the sendpage.cf file.

       -bp Display all the pages waiting in the Paging Central queues.

       -bv Try to expand the "recipient" name, using the recipient aliases specified in the configuration file.

       -bs Shutdown the running sendpage daemon and all its children.  If a Paging Central is in the middle of delivering a page, it will finish up and exit as soon
           as its current page is handled.

       -br This will send a SIGHUP to the master daemon.  When the master gets the SIGHUP, it will re-read its configuration file, and restart all the Paging
           Centrals.  It will wait for any busy Paging Centrals to finish before continuing.

       -bq This displays the state of the running daemons: Running or Not running.  If a pid file is stale (the file exists, but the process doesn't), it will mark
           that pid as "Stale".

       -q[R pc]
           This will send a SIGUSR1 signal to either the master daemon, or, if the Paging Central is specified, just that Paging Central in particular.  When the
           master gets a SIGUSR1, it will send it to each of the running Paging Centrals.  If the Paging Central is not busy, it will immediately start a queue run.

       -C FILE
           Read the configuration file FILE instead of the default /etc/sendpage/sendpage.cf

       -h  Display a summary of all the available command line options.

       -d  Turn on debugging (like "debug=true" in /etc/sendpage/sendpage.cf)

       -f USER
           Show that the sent page is coming from USER.  Default is the current user.

       -m MESSAGE
           Send the given MESSAGE instead of reading text from stdin.

       -n  Do not notify the 'from' user about the status of the page.

DESCRIPTION
       Sendpage can run as the delivery agent, or as a client to insert a page into the paging queue.  For the various command-line arguments, the idea here was to
       use sendmail-style arguments where I can, not to fully implement every option that sendmail has.  I just want the learning curve of sendpage to be small for
       people already familiar with sendmail.

FILES
       /etc/sendpage/sendpage.cf
           Default location for sendpage.cf, which holds all the configuration information for sendpage, including Paging Central definitions, recipients, and
           various other behaviors.

       /var/spool/sendpage
           Default directory for all the Paging Central queues and pid files.

       /var/lock
           Default directory to keep the UUCP-style device locks.

BUGS
       Oh, I bet this code is crawling with them.  :)  I've done my best to test this code, but I'm only one person.  If you find strange behavior, please let me
       know.
