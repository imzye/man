NAME
       llvm-exegesis - LLVM Machine Instruction Benchmark

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-exegesis [options]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-exegesis is a benchmarking tool that uses information available in LLVM to measure host machine instruction characteristics like latency, throughput, or
       port decomposition.

       Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, llvm-exegesis generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) as  possible  so
       that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop decomposition) of the instruction.  The code snippet is jitted and executed on the host subtar‐
       get. The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML to the standard output.

       The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM’s TableDef scheduling models. To that end, we also provide analysis of the results.

       llvm-exegesis can also benchmark arbitrary user-provided code snippets.

EXAMPLE 1: BENCHMARKING INSTRUCTIONS
       Assume you have an X86-64 machine. To measure the latency of a single instruction, run:

          $ llvm-exegesis -mode=latency -opcode-name=ADD64rr

       Measuring the uop decomposition or inverse throughput of an instruction works similarly:

          $ llvm-exegesis -mode=uops -opcode-name=ADD64rr
          $ llvm-exegesis -mode=inverse_throughput -opcode-name=ADD64rr

       The output is a YAML document (the default is to write to stdout, but you can redirect the output to a file using -benchmarks-file):

          ---
          key:
            opcode_name:     ADD64rr
            mode:            latency
            config:          ''
          cpu_name:        haswell
          llvm_triple:     x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
          num_repetitions: 10000
          measurements:
            - { key: latency, value: 1.0058, debug_string: '' }
          error:           ''
          info:            'explicit self cycles, selecting one aliasing configuration.
          Snippet:
          ADD64rr R8, R8, R10
          '
          ...

       To measure the latency of all instructions for the host architecture, run:

          $ llvm-exegesis -mode=latency -opcode-index=-1

EXAMPLE 2: BENCHMARKING A CUSTOM CODE SNIPPET
       To measure the latency/uops of a custom piece of code, you can specify the snippets-file option (- reads from standard input).

          $ echo "vzeroupper" | llvm-exegesis -mode=uops -snippets-file=-

       Real-life code snippets typically depend on registers or memory.  llvm-exegesis checks the liveliness of registers (i.e. any register use has a corresponding
       def or is a “live in”). If your code depends on the value of some registers, you have two options:

       • Mark the register as requiring a definition. llvm-exegesis will automatically assign a value to the register. This can be done using the directive LLVM-EX‐
         EGESIS-DEFREG <reg name> <hex_value>, where <hex_value> is a bit pattern used to fill <reg_name>. If <hex_value> is smaller than  the  register  width,  it
         will be sign-extended.

       • Mark  the  register  as a “live in”. llvm-exegesis will benchmark using whatever value was in this registers on entry. This can be done using the directive
         LLVM-EXEGESIS-LIVEIN <reg name>.

       For example, the following code snippet depends on the values of XMM1 (which will be set by the tool) and the memory buffer passed in RDI (live in).

          # LLVM-EXEGESIS-LIVEIN RDI
          # LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG XMM1 42
          vmulps        (%rdi), %xmm1, %xmm2
          vhaddps       %xmm2, %xmm2, %xmm3
          addq $0x10, %rdi

EXAMPLE 3: ANALYSIS
       Assuming you have a set of benchmarked instructions (either latency or uops) as YAML in file /tmp/benchmarks.yaml, you can analyze the results using the fol‐
       lowing command:

            $ llvm-exegesis -mode=analysis \
          -benchmarks-file=/tmp/benchmarks.yaml \
          -analysis-clusters-output-file=/tmp/clusters.csv \
          -analysis-inconsistencies-output-file=/tmp/inconsistencies.html

       This  will  group the instructions into clusters with the same performance characteristics. The clusters will be written out to /tmp/clusters.csv in the fol‐
       lowing format:

          cluster_id,opcode_name,config,sched_class
          ...
          2,ADD32ri8_DB,,WriteALU,1.00
          2,ADD32ri_DB,,WriteALU,1.01
          2,ADD32rr,,WriteALU,1.01
          2,ADD32rr_DB,,WriteALU,1.00
          2,ADD32rr_REV,,WriteALU,1.00
          2,ADD64i32,,WriteALU,1.01
          2,ADD64ri32,,WriteALU,1.01
          2,MOVSX64rr32,,BSWAP32r_BSWAP64r_MOVSX64rr32,1.00
          2,VPADDQYrr,,VPADDBYrr_VPADDDYrr_VPADDQYrr_VPADDWYrr_VPSUBBYrr_VPSUBDYrr_VPSUBQYrr_VPSUBWYrr,1.02
          2,VPSUBQYrr,,VPADDBYrr_VPADDDYrr_VPADDQYrr_VPADDWYrr_VPSUBBYrr_VPSUBDYrr_VPSUBQYrr_VPSUBWYrr,1.01
          2,ADD64ri8,,WriteALU,1.00
          2,SETBr,,WriteSETCC,1.01
          ...

       llvm-exegesis will also analyze the clusters to point out inconsistencies in the scheduling information. The output is an html file. For example, /tmp/incon‐
       sistencies.html will contain messages like the following : [image]

       Note  that the scheduling class names will be resolved only when llvm-exegesis is compiled in debug mode, else only the class id will be shown. This does not
       invalidate any of the analysis results though.

OPTIONS
       -help  Print a summary of command line options.

       -opcode-index=<LLVM opcode index>
              Specify the opcode to measure, by index. Specifying -1 will result in measuring every existing opcode. See example 1 for details.   Either  opcode-in‐
              dex, opcode-name or snippets-file must be set.

       -opcode-name=<opcode name 1>,<opcode name 2>,...
              Specify  the  opcode to measure, by name. Several opcodes can be specified as a comma-separated list. See example 1 for details.  Either opcode-index,
              opcode-name or snippets-file must be set.

       -snippets-file=<filename>
              Specify the custom code snippet to measure. See example 2 for details.  Either opcode-index, opcode-name or snippets-file must be set.

       -mode=[latency|uops|inverse_throughput|analysis]
              Specify the run mode. Note that some modes have additional requirements and options.

              latency mode can be  make use of either RDTSC or LBR.  latency[LBR] is only available on X86 (at least Skylake).  To run in latency mode,  a  positive
              value must be specified for x86-lbr-sample-period and –repetition-mode=loop.

              In analysis mode, you also need to specify at least one of the -analysis-clusters-output-file= and -analysis-inconsistencies-output-file=.

       -x86-lbr-sample-period=<nBranches/sample>
              Specify  the LBR sampling period - how many branches before we take a sample.  When a positive value is specified for this option and when the mode is
              latency, we will use LBRs for measuring.  On choosing the “right” sampling period, a small value is preferred, but throttling could occur if the  sam‐
              pling is too frequent. A prime number should be used to avoid consistently skipping certain blocks.

       -repetition-mode=[duplicate|loop|min]
              Specify  the  repetition  mode.  duplicate  will  create  a  large, straight line basic block with num-repetitions instructions (repeating the snippet
              num-repetitions/snippet size times). loop will, optionally, duplicate the snippet until the loop body contains at least  loop-body-size  instructions,
              and  then  wrap  the result in a loop which will execute num-repetitions instructions (thus, again, repeating the snippet num-repetitions/snippet size
              times). The loop mode, especially with loop unrolling tends to better hide the effects of the CPU frontend on architectures  that  cache  decoded  in‐
              structions,  but consumes a register for counting iterations. If performing an analysis over many opcodes, it may be best to instead use the min mode,
              which will run each other mode, and produce the minimal measured result.

       -num-repetitions=<Number of repetitions>
              Specify the target number of executed instructions. Note that the actual repetition count of the snippet will be num-repetitions/snippet size.  Higher
              values lead to more accurate measurements but lengthen the benchmark.

       -loop-body-size=<Preferred loop body size>
              Only  effective  for  -repetition-mode=[loop|min].  Instead of looping over the snippet directly, first duplicate it so that the loop body contains at
              least this many instructions. This potentially results in loop body being cached in the CPU Op Cache / Loop Cache, which  allows  to  which  may  have
              higher throughput than the CPU decoders.

       -max-configs-per-opcode=<value>
              Specify  the  maximum configurations that can be generated for each opcode.  By default this is 1, meaning that we assume that a single measurement is
              enough to characterize an opcode. This might not be true of all instructions: for example, the performance characteristics of the LEA  instruction  on
              X86  depends  on  the value of assigned registers and immediates. Setting a value of -max-configs-per-opcode larger than 1 allows llvm-exegesis to ex‐
              plore more configurations to discover if some register or immediate assignments lead to different performance characteristics.

       -benchmarks-file=</path/to/file>
              File to read (analysis mode) or write (latency/uops/inverse_throughput modes) benchmark results. “-” uses stdin/stdout.

       -analysis-clusters-output-file=</path/to/file>
              If provided, write the analysis clusters as CSV to this file. “-” prints to stdout. By default, this analysis is not run.

       -analysis-inconsistencies-output-file=</path/to/file>
              If non-empty, write inconsistencies found during analysis to this file. - prints to stdout. By default, this analysis is not run.

       -analysis-clustering=[dbscan,naive]
              Specify the clustering algorithm to use. By default DBSCAN will be used.  Naive clustering algorithm is better for doing further work on  the  -analy‐
              sis-inconsistencies-output-file= output, it will create one cluster per opcode, and check that the cluster is stable (all points are neighbours).

       -analysis-numpoints=<dbscan numPoints parameter>
              Specify the numPoints parameters to be used for DBSCAN clustering (analysis mode, DBSCAN only).

       -analysis-clustering-epsilon=<dbscan epsilon parameter>
              Specify the epsilon parameter used for clustering of benchmark points (analysis mode).

       -analysis-inconsistency-epsilon=<epsilon>
              Specify the epsilon parameter used for detection of when the cluster is different from the LLVM schedule profile values (analysis mode).

       -analysis-display-unstable-clusters
              If  there  is  more than one benchmark for an opcode, said benchmarks may end up not being clustered into the same cluster if the measured performance
              characteristics are different. by default all such opcodes are filtered out.  This flag will instead show only such unstable opcodes.

       -ignore-invalid-sched-class=false
              If set, ignore instructions that do not have a sched class (class idx = 0).

       -mcpu=<cpu name>
              If set, measure the cpu characteristics using the counters for this CPU. This is useful when creating new sched models (the host  CPU  is  unknown  to
              LLVM).

       --dump-object-to-disk=true
              By default, llvm-exegesis will dump the generated code to a temporary file to enable code inspection. You may disable it to speed up the execution and
              save disk space.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-exegesis returns 0 on success. Otherwise, an error message is printed to standard error, and the tool returns a non 0 value.
