ARGUMENTS
       The following arguments are optional:

       FILE
           The name of the input (mid/kar/wrk/ove) file.

       -p|--port= client:port

       -style= style
           sets the application GUI style. Possible values are motif, windows,
           and platinum. If you compiled Qt with additional styles or have
           additional styles as plugins these will be available to the -style
           command line option

       -stylesheet= stylesheet
           sets the application styleSheet. The value must be a path to a file
           that contains the Style Sheet. Note: Relative URLs in the Style
           Sheet file are relative to the Style Sheet file's path.

       -session= session
           restores the application from an earlier session.

       -widgetcount
           prints debug message at the end about number of widgets left
           undestroyed and maximum number of widgets existed at the same time

       -reverse
           sets the application's layout direction to Qt::RightToLeft

       -graphicssystem
           sets the backend to be used for on-screen widgets and QPixmaps.
           Available options are raster and opengl.

       -display display
           sets the X display (default is $DISPLAY).

       -geometry geometry
           sets the client geometry of the first window that is shown.

       -fn|-font font
           defines the application font. The font should be specified using an
           X logical font description.

       -bg|-background color
           sets the default background color and an application palette (light
           and dark shades are calculated).

       -fg|-foreground color
           sets the default foreground color.

       -btn|-button color
           sets the default button color.

       -name name
           sets the application name.

       -title title
           sets the application title.

       -visual TrueColor
           forces the application to use a TrueColor visual on an 8-bit
           display.

       -ncols count
           limits the number of colors allocated in the color cube on an 8-bit
           display, if the application is using the QApplication::ManyColor
           color specification. If count is 216 then a 6x6x6 color cube is
           used (i.e. 6 levels of red, 6 of green, and 6 of blue); for other
           values, a cube approximately proportional to a 2x3x1 cube is used.

       -cmap
           causes the application to install a private color map on an 8-bit
           display.

       -im
           sets the input method server (equivalent to setting the XMODIFIERS
           environment variable)

       -inputstyle
           defines how the input is inserted into the given widget, e.g.,
           onTheSpot makes the input appear directly in the widget, while
           overTheSpot makes the input appear in a box floating over the
           widget and is not inserted until the editing is done.
