NAME
       numatop - a tool for memory access locality characterization and analysis.

SYNOPSIS
       numatop [-s] [-l] [-f] [-d]

       numatop [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the numatop command.

       Most  modern systems use a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) design for multiprocessing. In NUMA systems, memory and processors are organized in such a way that some parts of memory are closer to a
       given processor, while other parts are farther from it. A processor can access memory that is closer to it much faster than the memory that is farther from  it.  Hence,  the  latency  between  the
       processors and different portions of the memory in a NUMA machine may be significantly different.

       numatop  is  an observation tool for runtime memory locality characterization and analysis of processes and threads running on a NUMA system. It helps the user to characterize the NUMA behavior of
       processes and threads and to identify where the NUMA-related performance bottlenecks reside. The tool uses hardware performance counter sampling technologies and associates  the  performance  data
       with Linux system runtime information to provide real-time analysis in production systems. The tool can be used to:

       A) Characterize the locality of all running processes and threads to identify those with the poorest locality in the system.

       B)  Identify  the "hot" memory areas, report average memory access latency, and provide the location where accessed memory is allocated. A "hot" memory area is where process/thread(s) accesses are
       most frequent. numatop has a metric called "ACCESS%" that specifies what percentage of memory accesses are attributable to each memory area.

       Note: numatop records only the memory accesses which have latencies greater than a predefined threshold (128 CPU cycles).

       C) Provide the call-chain(s) in the process/thread code that accesses a given hot memory area.

       D) Provide the call-chain(s) when the process/thread generates certain counter events (RMA/LMA/IR/CYCLE). The call-chain(s) helps to locate the source code that generates the events.

       RMA: Remote Memory Access.
       LMA: Local Memory Access.
       IR: Instruction Retired.
       CYCLE: CPU cycles.

       E) Provide per-node statistics for memory and CPU utilization. A node is: a region of memory in which every byte has the same distance from each CPU.

       F) Show, using a user-friendly interface, the list of processes/threads sorted by some metrics (by default, sorted by CPU utilization), with the top process having the highest CPU  utilization  in
       the system and the bottom one having the lowest CPU utilization.  Users can also use hotkeys to resort the output by these metrics: RMA, LMA, RMA/LMA, CPI, and CPU%.

       RMA/LMA: ratio of RMA/LMA.
       CPI: CPU cycle per instruction.
       CPU%: CPU utilization.

       numatop is a GUI tool that periodically tracks and analyzes the NUMA activity of processes and threads and displays useful metrics. Users can scroll up/down by using the up or down key to navigate
       in  the  current window and can use several hot keys shown at the bottom of the window, to switch between windows or to change the running state of the tool.  For example, hotkey 'R' refreshes the
       data in the current window.

       Below is a detailed description of the various display windows and the data items that they display:

       [WIN1 - Monitoring processes and threads]:
       Get the locality characterization of all processes. This is the first window upon startup, it's numatop's "Home" window. This window displays a list of processes. The top process has  the  highest
       system  CPU utilization (CPU%), while the bottom process has the lowest CPU% in the system. Generally, the memory-intensive process is also CPU-intensive, so the processes shown in this window are
       sorted by CPU% by default. The user can press hotkeys '1', '2', '3', '4', or '5' to resort the output by "RMA", "LMA", "RMA/LMA", "CPI", or "CPU%".

       [KEY METRICS]:
       RMA(K): number of Remote Memory Access (unit is 1000).

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported by numatop:

       -s sampling_precision
       normal: balance precision and overhead (default)
       high: high sampling precision (high overhead)
       low: low sampling precision, suitable for high load system

       -l log_level
       Specifies the level of logging in the log file. Valid values are:
       1: unknown (reserved for future use)
       2: all

       -f log_file
       Specifies the log file where output will be written. If the log file is not writable, the tool will prompt "Cannot open '<file name>' for writting.".

       -d dump_file
       Specifies the dump file where the screen data will be written. Generally the dump file is used for automated test. If the dump file is not writable, the tool will prompt "Cannot open  <file  name>
       for dump writing."

       -h Displays the command's usage.

       -t duration
       Specifies run time duration in seconds.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: Launch numatop with high sampling precision
       numatop -s high

       Example 2: Write all warning messages in /tmp/numatop.log
       numatop -l 2 -o /tmp/numatop.log

       Example 3: Dump screen data in /tmp/dump.log
       numatop -d /tmp/dump.log

EXIT STATUS
       0: successful operation.
       Other value: an error occurred.

USAGE
       You must have root privileges to run numatop.
       Or set -1 in /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

       Note: The perf_event_paranoid setting has security implications and a non-root user probably doesn't have authority to access /proc. It is highly recommended that the user runs numatop as root.

VERSION
       numatop requires a patch set to support PEBS Load Latency functionality in the kernel. The patch set has not been integrated in 3.8. Probably it will be integrated in 3.9. The following steps show
       how to get and apply the patch set.

       1. git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git
       2. cd tip
       3. git checkout perf/x86
       4. build kernel as usual

       numatop  supports  the Intel Xeon processors: 5500-series, 6500/7500-series, 5600 series, E7-x8xx-series, and E5-16xx/24xx/26xx/46xx-series.  Note: CPU microcode version 0x618 or 0x70c or later is
       required on E5-16xx/24xx/26xx/46xx-series. It also supports IBM Power8, Power9, Power10 and Power11 processors.

                                                                                               August 1, 2024                                                                                    NUMATOP(8)
