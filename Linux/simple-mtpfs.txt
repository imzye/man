NAME
       SIMPLE-MTPFS - filesystem driver for MTP based devices

SYNOPSIS
   mounting
       simple-mtpfs <device> mountpoint [options]

   unmounting
       fusermount -u mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       SIMPLE-MTPFS  (Simple Media Transfer Protocol FileSystem) is a file system for Linux (and other operating systems with a FUSE implementation, such as Mac OS X or FreeBSD) capable of operating on files
       on MTP devices attached via USB to local machine. On the local computer where the SIMPLE-MTPFS is mounted, the implementation makes use of the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) kernel module.  The  prac‐
       tical effect of this is that the end user can seamlessly interact with MTP device files.

OPTIONS
   general options:
       -o opt,[opt...]
              mount options

       -h   --help
              print help

       -V   --version
              print version

   SIMPLE-MTPFS options:
       -l   --list-devices
              list available MTP devices

            --device
              select device no. to mount

       -o enable-move
              enable move operation, which can be very slow (depends on the moved content)

   FUSE options:
       -d   -o debug
              enable debug output (implies -f)

       -f     foreground operation

       -o allow_other
              allow access to other users

       -o allow_root
              allow access to root

       -o nonempty
              allow mounts over non-empty file/dir

       -o default_permissions enable permission checking by kernel

       -o fsname=NAME
              set filesystem name

       -o subtype=NAME
              set filesystem type

       -o large_read
              issue large read requests (2.4 only)

       -o max_read=N
              set maximum size of read requests

       -o hard_remove
              immediate removal (don't hide files)

       -o use_ino
              let filesystem set inode numbers

       -o readdir_ino
              try to fill in d_ino in readdir

       -o direct_io
              use direct I/O

       -o kernel_cache
              cache files in kernel

       -o [no]auto_cache
              enable caching based on modification times

       -o umask=M
              set file permissions (octal)

       -o uid=N
              set file owner

       -o gid=N
              set file group

       -o entry_timeout=T
              cache timeout for names (1.0s)

       -o negative_timeout=T
              cache timeout for deleted names (0.0s)

       -o attr_timeout=T
              cache timeout for attributes (1.0s)

       -o ac_attr_timeout=T
              auto cache timeout for attributes (attr_timeout)

       -o intr
              allow requests to be interrupted

       -o intr_signal=NUM
              signal to send on interrupt (10)

       -o modules=M1[:M2...]
              names of modules to push onto filesystem stack

       -o max_write=N
              set maximum size of write requests

       -o max_readahead=N
              set maximum readahead

       -o async_read
              perform reads asynchronously (default)

       -o sync_read
              perform reads synchronously
