DESCRIPTION
       cyr_backup is a tool for inspecting the contents of a Cyrus backup.

       cyr_backup  reads  its  configuration  options out of the imapd.conf(5)
       file unless specified otherwise by -C.

       In all invocations, backup is interpreted according  to  the  specified
       MODE.  See Modes below.

       cyr_backup provides the following sub-commands:

       list

              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup list chunks
              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup list mailboxes
              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup list messages
              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup list all

              List chunks, mailboxes, or messages contained in backup.

       show

              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup show mailboxes [ mboxname | uniqueid ]...
              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup show messages guid...

              show  mailboxes shows the contents (i.e. the contained messages)
              of mailboxes matching each given mboxname  or  uniqueid  in  the
              named  backup.  The uid, expunged time, and guid of each message
              are shown.

              show messages shows details of messages matching each given guid
              in  the  named backup.  The guid, containing mailboxes, and MIME
              headers of each message are shown.

       dump

              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup dump chunk id
              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup dump message guid

              Dump the contents of the specified chunk or message contained in
              the  named  backup to standard out.  Chunks are output as uncom‐
              pressed backup data format  (which  is  a  replication  protocol
              stream).  Messages are output in their on-disk format (typically
              MIME).

              dump chunk is mainly useful for diagnostic purposes.

              dump message may be useful as part of a manual message  restora‐
              tion  process, when the restoration destination does not support
              the restore(8) command.

       json

              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup json chunks
              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup json mailboxes
              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup json messages
              cyr_backup [OPTIONS] [MODE] backup json headers guid...

              Dump information about the chunks, mailboxes  or  messages  con‐
              tained in the named backup to standard out, in JSON format.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -v     Increase the verbosity.  Can be specified multiple times.

MODES
       -f     backup is interpreted as a filename.  The named  file  does  not
              need to be known about in the backups database.

       -m     backup  is interpreted as a mailbox name.  There must be a known
              backup for the user whose mailbox this is.

              Known backups are recorded in  the  database  specified  by  the
              backup_db and backup_db_path configuration options.

       -u     backup is interpreted as a userid.  There must be a known backup
              for the specified user.

              This is the default if no mode is specified.
