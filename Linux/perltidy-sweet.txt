NAME
       perltidy-sweet - Script to execute Perl::Tidy::Sweetened cleanup

DESCRIPTION
       This script is a drop in replacement for Perl::Tidy's "perltidy" which uses Perl::Tidy::Sweetened to cleanup Perl code with a more "modern" syntax (ie, Method::Signatures::Simple,
       MooseX::Method::Signatures, MooseX::Declare, Kavorka, etc).

       See the documentation for Perl::Tidy and perltidy for usage. See Perl::Tidy::Sweetened for more information about the changes introduced.
