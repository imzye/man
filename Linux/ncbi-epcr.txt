NAME
       re-PCR — Find sequence tagged sites (STS) in DNA sequences

SYNOPSIS
       re-PCR [-hV] -p hash-file [-g gaps] [-n mism] [-lq] [primer ...]

       re-PCR [-hV] -P hash-file [-g gaps] [-n mism] [-l] [-m margin] [-O+|-] [-C batchcnt] [-o outfile] [-r+|-] [primers-file ...]

       re-PCR [-hV] -s hash-file [-g gaps] [-n mism] [-lq] [-m margin] [-o outfile] [-r+|-] [left right lo[-hi] [...]]

       re-PCR [-hV] -S hash-file [-g gaps] [-n mism] [-lq] [-m margin] [-O+|-] [-C batchcnt] [-o outfile] [-r+|-] [stsfile ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Implements reverse searching (called Reverse e-PCR) to make it feasible to search the human genome sequence and other large genomes by performing STS and primer searches.

OPTIONS
       -p=hash-file
                 Perform primer lookup using hash-file

       -P=hash-file
                 Perform primer lookup using hash-file

       -s=hash-file
                 Perform STS lookup using hash-file

       -S=hash-file
                 Perform STS lookup using hash-file

       -n=mism   Set max allowed mismatches per primer for lookup

       -g=gaps   Set max allowed indels per primer for lookup

       -m=margin Set variability for STS size for lookup

       -l        Use presize alignments (only if gaps>0)

       -G        Print alignments in comments

       -d=min-max
                 Set default STS size

       -r=+|-    Enable/disable reverse STS lookup

       -O=+|-    Enable/disable syscall optimisation

       -C=batchcnt
                 Set number of STSes per batch

       -o=outfile
                 Set output file name

       -q        Quiet (no progress indicator)

EXAMPLE
        famap -tN -b genome.famap org/chr_*.fa

        fahash -b genome.hash -w 12 -f3 ${PWD}/genome.famap

        re-PCR -s genome.hash -n1 -g1 ACTATTGATGATGA AGGTAGATGTTTTT 120-200
