NAME
       slv2 - SLV2

SYNOPSIS
Detailed Description
       SLV2 is written in standard C99, and depends only on the Redland RDF library (http://librdf.org). It should be portable to any system with Redland, and is tested on various GNU/Linux distributions
       (often), and MacOS X (occasionally).

       The data (RDF) and code (shared library) functionality in SLV2 is strictly separated so it is simple to control where each is used (e.g. it is possible to discover/investigate plugins and related data
       without loading any shared libraries, avoiding the associated risks).

       The SLV2 documentation is broken into several pages:

       • slv2_world  - Global library initialisation, state, plugin discovery, etc.
       • slv2_util  - Generally useful utility functions
       • slv2_collections  - Collections of values (literals and URIs) and objects
       • slv2_data  - Access to plugin RDF data
       • slv2_library  - Access to plugin shared libraries
