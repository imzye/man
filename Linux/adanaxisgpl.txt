NAME
       adanaxisgpl - Action game in 4 spatial dimensions

SYNOPSIS
       adanaxisgpl [--safe] [--recover] [--doc] [--help] [commands]

DESCRIPTION
       Documentation  for this command can be found in the About Adanaxis PDF,
       which   is   installed   in    the    documentation    area    (usually
       /usr/share/doc/adanaxisgpl-<version>).

       This is the GPL version of the game - other versions may be available.

OPTIONS
       --help Displays help.

       --doc  Opens the program documentation, if possible.

       --safe, --recover
              Start  in 'recovery mode'.  This option resets the configuration
              to a very basic one, and  disables  program  features  that  may
              cause  problems.  After quitting, the game can be restarted nor‐
              mally by omitting this option and features  re-enabled  via  the
              program Options menu.

       commands
              Commands  are passed to the internal intepreter.  If no commands
              are given, the program executes the start.txt file from its sys‐
              tem directory (usually /usr/share/adanaxisgpl/system).
