NAME
       stalonetray - stand-alone system tray (notification area) implementation. This document covers 0.8 version of stalonetray.

SYNOPSIS

       stalonetray [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       Stalonetray is a stand-alone system tray (notification area) for X Window System/X11 (e.g. XOrg or XFree86). It has minimal build and run-time dependencies: an X11 lib only. Complete XEMBED
       support is under development. Stalonetray works with virtually any EWMH-compliant window manager.

       The behaviour and the look of stalonetray can be configured either via command line options or via configuration file. As usual, command-line options have precedence over options that are
       specified in the configuration file.

       Names of command line parameter may have two variants: short (-o) and long (--option). Write -ovalue or -ovalue to pass a value using the short name of a parameter; to pass a value using a long
       name, write --optionvalue or --option=value. All flag-like parameters have optional boolean value that when ommited is assumed to be "true". Write "true", "yes", "1", for positive boolean values,
       and "false", "no", "0" for negative ones.

       Default configuration file is $HOME/.stalonetrayrc. A configuration file contains case-insensetive keyword-argument pairs, one per line. Lines starting with '#' and empty lines are ignored.
       Alternatively, confiuration file can specified via -c or --config command-line options.

       Below is the list of possible command line/configuration file options. Options starting with hyphens are command-line parameters others are configuration file keywords. Options that are new in 0.8
       version are marked with "NEW in 0.8".

OPTIONS
       -bg color, --background color, background color
           Use color for tray`s background.  color can be specified as an HTML hex triplet or as a name from rgb.txt (note that '#' must be quoted). Default value: #777777.

       -c filename, --config filename
           Read configuration from filename instead of default $HOME/.stalonetrayrc.

       -d decspec, --decorations decspec, decorations decspec
           Specify visiblie tray window decorations. Possible values for decspec are: all, title, border, none (default).

       -display display, display display
           Use X display display.

       --dockapp-mode [mode], dockapp_mode [mode]
           Set dockapp mode, which can be either simple for e.g. OpenBox, wmaker for WindowMaker, or none (default).

       -f [level], --fuzzy-edges [level], fuzzy_edges [level]
           Enable fuzzy edges of tray window and set fuzziness level which can range from 0 (disabled, default) to 3. When ommited, the value of level defaults to 2.

       --geometry geometry_spec, geometry geometry_spec
           Set tray`s initial geometry to geometry_spec, specified in standard X notation: widthxheight[+x[+y]], where width and height are specified in icon slot multiples. Default value: 1x1+0-0.

       --grow-gravity gravity, grow_gravity gravity
           Specify icon positioning gravity (eigher N, S, W, E, NW, NE, SW, SE). Grow gravity specifies directions in which the tray's window may grow. For instance, if you specify NW the tray's window
           will grow down vertically and to the right horizontally (these are sides that are opposite to upper-left or North-West corner of the window); with W the tray's window will grow horizontally to
           the left side only, and it will vertically grow both upwards and downwards maintaining position of its center. Please note that the latter behaviour is new in 0.8. Default value: NW.

       --icon-gravity gravity, icon_gravity gravity
           Specify icon positioning gravity (either NW, NE, SW, SE). If you specify, e.g SW, then icons will appear starting from the lower-left corner of the tray's window. Default value: NW.

       -i n, --icon-size n, icon_size n
           Set default icon size to n. Default value: 24. Minimum: 16.

       -h, --help
           Show help message.

       --log-level level, log_level level
           Set the amount of info to be output by stalonetray. Possible values for level: err (default), info, and trace. For the trace option to be available, stalonetray must be configured with
           --enable-debug at build-time.

       --kludges kludge [,kludge...]
           Enable specific kludges to work around non-conforming WMs and/or stalonetray bugs. Argument is a comma-separated list of:

           •   fix_window_pos — fix tray window position on erroneous moves by WM

           •   force_icons_size — ignore resize events on all icons; force their size to be equal to icon_size

           •   use_icons_hints — use icon window hints to determine icon size

       --max-geometry geometry_spec, max_geometry geometry_spec
           Set tray`s maximal geometry to geometry_spec Default value: 0x0, no limit.

       --no-shrink, no_shrink [bool]
           Do not shrink tray window back after icon removal. Useful when tray is swallowed by another window like FvwmButtons. Default value: false.

       -p, --parent-bg, parent_bg [bool]
           Use the parent's window as a background of the tray's window. Default value: false.

       --pixmap-bg path_to_xpm, pixmap_bg path_to_xpm
           Use the pixmap from an XPM file specified by path_to_xpm for the tray`s window background (pixmap will be tiled to fill the entire window).

       -r name, --remote-click-icon name
           Remote control/click. When this option is specified, stalonetray sends a fake click to the icon with a window named name and exits. The icon is searched for in the currently active tray for
           the current screen. By default, stalonetray sends a single click with the 1st mouse button to the center of the icon. See the options below for additional information on how to alter the
           defaults.

       --remote-click-button n
           Sets the remote click's button number to n (in the X11 numbering order).

       --remote-click-position xxy
           Sets the remote click's position.

       --remote-click-type type
           Sets the remote click's type. Possible values: single and double.

       -s n, --slot-size n, slot_size n
           Set grid slot size to n, which cannot be less then icon_size. By default, the slot size is the same as the icon size.

       --scrollbars mode, scrollbars mode
           Set scrollbar mode. Possible values: vertical, horizontal, all, or none (default). Scrollbars appear as additional space at tray borders that can be clicked to scroll icon area. Mouse wheel
           also works.

       --scrollbars-highlight mode, scrollbars_highlight mode
           Set scrollbars highlight mode. Possible values: a color spec, or disable.

       --scrollbars-size n, scrollbars_size n
           Set scrollbar size to n pixels. By default, the size is 1/4 of slot_size.

       --scrollbars-step n, scrollbars_step n
           Set scrollbar step to n pixels. Default is 1/2 of slot_size.

       --skip-taskbar, skip_taskbar [bool]
           Hide tray`s window from the taskbar. Default value: false.

       --sticky, sticky [bool]
           Make tray`s window sticky across multiple desktops/pages. Default value: false.

           Sets the EWMH-compliant layer of tray`s window. Possible values for layer: bottom, normal, top. Default value: normal.

       --window-strut mode, window_strut mode
           Enable window struts for tray window (to avoid covering of tray window by maximized windows). Mode defines to which screen border tray window will be attached. It can be either top, bottom,
           left, right, none, or auto (default).

       --window-type type, window_type type
           Sets the EWMH-compliant type of tray`s window. Possible values for type: desktop, dock, normal, toolbar, utility. Default value: dock.
