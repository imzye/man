DESCRIPTION
       Multilingual file viewer
              lv is a powerful multilingual file viewer.  Apparently, lv looks like less (1), a representative file viewer on UNIX as you know, so UNIX people (and less people on other OSs) don't have to
              learn  a burdensome new interface.  lv can be used on MSDOS ANSI terminals and almost all UNIX platforms.  lv is a currently growing software, so your feedback is welcome and helpful for us
              to refine the future lv.

       Multiple coding systems
              lv can decode and encode multilingual streams through many coding systems, for example, ISO 2022 based coding systems such as iso-2022-jp, and EUC (Extended Unix Code) like euc-japan.  Fur‐
              thermore, localized coding systems such as shift-jis, big5 and HZ are also supported.  lv can be used not only as a file viewer but also as a coding-system translation filter like  nkf  (1)
              and tcs (1).

       Multilingual regular expressions / Multilingual grep
              lv can recognize multi-byte patterns as regular expressions, and lv also provides multilingual grep (1) functionality by giving it another name, lgrep.  Pattern matching is conducted in the
              charset level, so an EUC fragment, for example, can be found in the ISO 2022 tailored streams, of course.

       Supporting the Unicode standard
              lv  provides  Unicode facilities which enables you to handle Unicode streams encoded in UTF-7 or UTF-8, and lv can also convert their code-points between Unicode and other charsets.  So you
              can display Unicode or foreign texts on your terminal, using the code conversion function to your favorite charsets via Unicode.  (However, MSDOS version of lv has none of the  Unicode  fa‐
              cility.)

       ANSI escape sequence through
              lv  can  recognize  ANSI escape sequences for text decoration.  So you can look ANSI-decorated streams such as colored source codes generated by another software just like intended image on
              ANSI terminals.

       Completely original
              lv is a completely original software including no code drawn from less and grep and other programs at all.

OPTIONS
       -A<coding-system>
              Set all coding systems to coding-system.

       -I<coding-system>
              Set input coding system to coding-system.

       -K<coding-system>
              Set keyboard coding system to coding-system.  If it is not set, output coding system will be applied to it.

       -O<coding-system>
              Set output coding system to coding-system.

       -P<coding-system>
              Set pathname coding system to coding-system.

       -D<coding-system>
              Set default (fall-back) coding system to coding-system.

       coding-system:
              a: auto-select
              c: iso-2022-cn
              j: iso-2022-jp
              k: iso-2022-kr
              ec: euc-china
              ej: euc-japan
              ek: euc-korea
              et: euc-taiwan
              u7: UTF-7
              u8: UTF-8
              l1..9: iso-8859-1..9
              l0: iso-8859-10
              lb,ld,le,lf,lg: iso-8859-11,13,14,15,16
              s: shift-jis
              b: big5
              h: HZ
              r: raw mode

       Examples:
              -Il2: input coding system is iso-8859-2
              -Ks:  keyboard coding system is shift-jis
              -Oek: output coding system is euc-korea
              -Ab:  all coding systems are big5

       Coding-system translations / Code-points conversions:
              iso-2022-cn, -jp, -kr can be converted into euc-china or -taiwan, euc-japan, euc-korea, respectively (and vice versa).  shift-jis uses the same internal code-points as iso-2022-jp and  euc-
              japan.

              Since  big5  characters  can be converted into CNS 11643-1992 with negligible incompleteness, big5 streams can be translated into iso-2022-cn or euc-taiwan (and vice versa) with code-points
              conversion.  Note that the iso-2022-cn referred here is not GB sequence, only just CNS one.  You should remember that lv cannot translate big5 into GB directly.

              The search function of lv may not work correctly when lv additionally performs ``code-points'' conversion (not ``coding-system'' translation), because visible code  and  internal  code  are
              different from each other.  lv will try to avoid this problem with converting charsets of search patterns automatically, but this function is not always perfect.

       -W<number>
              Screen width

       -H<number>
              Screen height

       -E'<editor>' (default 'vi -c %d')
              Editor name (default 'vi -c %d')
              ``%d'' means the line number of current position in a file.

       -q     Assert there is delete/insert-lines control.
              Please set this option on a MSDOS ANSI terminal that has capability to delete and/or insert lines.  As to termcap and terminfo version, it will be set automatically.

       -Ss<seq>
              Set ANSI Standout sequence to seq  (default "7")

       -Sr<seq>
              Set ANSI Reverse sequence to seq   (default "7")

       -Sb<seq>
              Set ANSI Blink sequence to seq     (default "5")

       -Su<seq>
              Set ANSI Underline sequence to seq (default "4")

       -Sh<seq>
              Set ANSI Highlight sequence to seq (default "1")

              These sequences are inserted between ``ESC ['' and ``m'' to construct full ANSI escape sequences.

       -T<number>
              Set  Threshold-code which divides Unicode code-points in two regions. Characters belonging to the lower region are assumed to have a width of one, and the higher characters are equated to a
              width of two. (Default: 12288, = 0x3000)

       -m     Force Unicode code-points which have the same glyphs as iso-8859-* to be Mapped to iso-8859-* in a conversion from Unicode to another character set which also has  the  corresponding  code-
              points, in particular, Asian charsets.

       -a     Adjust character set for search pattern (default)

       -c     Allow ANSI escape sequences for text decoration (Color)

       -d, -i Make regexp-searches ignore case (case folD search) (default)

       -f     Substitute Fixed strings for regular expressions

       -k     Convert X0201 Katakana to X0208 while decoding

       -l     Allow physical lines of each logical line printed on the screen to be concatenated for cut and paste after screen refresh

       -s     Force old pages to be swept out from the screen smoothly

       -u     Unify several character sets, eg. JIS X0208 and C6226.  In addition, lv equates ISO 646 variants, eg. JIS X0201-Roman, and unknown charsets with ASCII.

       -g     Turn on lgrep mode.

       -n     Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file on lgrep.

       -v     Invert the sense of matching on lgrep.

       -z     Enable HZ auto-detection (also enabled by run-time C-t).

       -+     Clear all options
              You can also turn OFF specified options, using ``+<option>'' like +c, +d, ... +z.

       -      Treat the following arguments as filenames

       grep-pattern
              lv works like grep (1) when its name is lgrep

       +number
              Jump to the specified line immediately when lv is invoked.

       +/grep-pattern
              Search  the specified pattern immediately when lv is invoked.

       -V     Show lv version

       -h     Show this help

CONFIGURATION
       Options  can be described in configuration file ``.lv'' (``_lv'' on MSDOS) located in your HOME directory.  If and only if you use MSDOS, you can locate ``_lv'' at current working directory.  They

       respectively. Mutually overlapping ranges (or charset) are not guaranteed.
