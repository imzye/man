NAME
       lordsawar-game-host-server - Serve up networked lordsawar games.

SYNOPSIS
       lordsawar-game-host-server [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       Allow remote and local users to start their networked lordsawar games on your computer.  The command-line tool lordsawar-game-host-client is used to send commands to this server.

       -f, --foreground
              Do not detach from the controlling terminal.

       -h, --host HOST
              Specify the hostname that others can reach this machine on.

       -p, --port NUMBER
              Start the server on the given port.

       -m, --members FILE
              Allow the profile ids in this file to host games.  The format of FILE is one id per line, with any lines starting with # being ignored.

       -?, --help
              Give this help list.

       When a --port is not specified, the server starts on port 22998.  The server will search for the lordsawar binary in your path and execute it to begin hosting new games.
