NAME
       yacg - Yet Another Configuration Generator

SYNOPSIS
       yacg [OPTIONS] PATH

       yacg --help|--manual|--version

DESCRIPTION
       yacg reads the given high-level configuration file, carefully validates it and generates ready-to-use (configuration) files.

       The high-level configuration file can be altered using the --set, --unset and --merge options. It can be inspected using the --dump option.

       The files can be generated at their final location (by default) or elsewhere (using the --rootdir option). yacg can also be instructed to check the files without changing them via the --noaction
       option.

       yacg can use a "manifest" file to keep track of which files it generated so that it can later remove the files that it does not generate anymore, see the --manifest and --clean options.

       yacg by itself does not know how to generate files. The --home option (and optionally the --include option) must be used to tell the program where to find domain specific modules knowing how to
       translate the high-level configuration into individual ready-to-use files.

OPTIONS
       --clean
           remove the files present in the old "manifest" file but not in the new one

       --debug, -d
           show debugging information

       --dump
           instead of generating files, dump the high-level configuration; this option can be given multiple times:

           1: dump after loading the configuration
           2: dump after hacking the configuration
           3: dump after validating the configuration
       --dump-format NAME
           set the output format for the --dump option; possible values: "Config::General" (default) and "JSON"

       --help, -h, -?
           show some help

       --home, -H PATH
           set the home directory where the "cfg", "lib" and "tpl" sub-directories may be located

       --include, -I PATH
           add the given directory to the list of paths that will be looked at to find configuration files, Config::Generator modules or templates; this option can be given multiple times

       --manifest PATH
           store the list of files that yacg handled in the given "manifest" file

       --manual, -m
           show this manual

       --merge PATH=VALUE
           hack the loaded configuration to merge the given value at the given path

       --noaction, -n
           print what would be done but do not actually touch the generated files

       --quiet, -q
           set the verbosity level to 0

       --rndfile PATH
           set the path of the file that will be used as seed to generate random data

       --rootdir PATH
           set the path specifying where the generated files will be put

       --set PATH=VALUE
           hack the loaded configuration to set the given value at the given path

       --spec PATH
           store the list of files that yacg handled in the given "spec" file (same format as rpm's spec %files)

       --unset PATH
           hack the loaded configuration to unset the given path

       --verbose, -v
           increase the verbosity level (default: 1)

       --version
           display version information
