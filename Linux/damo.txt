NAME
       damo - Data Access Monitoring Operator

SYNOPSIS
       damo [-h] <command> ...

DESCRIPTION
       `damo`  is  a user space tool for DAMON, a data access monitoring subsystem for the Linux kernel. Using this, you can monitor the data access patterns of your system or workloads and make data ac‐
       cess-aware memory management optimizations.

       Control DAMON and show its results
