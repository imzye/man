NAME
       Data::ICal::Entry::TimeZone - Represents a time zone definition in an iCalendar file

SYNOPSIS
           my $vtimezone = Data::ICal::Entry::TimeZone->new();
           $vtimezone->add_properties(
               tzid => "US-Eastern",
               tzurl => "http://zones.stds_r_us.net/tz/US-Eastern"
           );

           $vtimezone->add_entry($daylight); # daylight/ standard not yet implemented
           $vtimezone->add_entry($standard); # :-(

           $calendar->add_entry($vtimezone);

DESCRIPTION
       A Data::ICal::Entry::TimeZone object represents the declaration of a time zone in an iCalendar file.  (Note that the iCalendar RFC refers to entries as "components".)  It is a subclass of
       Data::ICal::Entry and accepts all of its methods.

       This module is not yet useful, because every time zone declaration needs to contain at least one "STANDARD" or "DAYLIGHT" component, and these have not yet been implemented.

METHODS
   ical_entry_type
       Returns "VTIMEZONE", its iCalendar entry name.

   optional_unique_properties
       According to the iCalendar standard, the following properties may be specified at most one time for a time zone declaration:

               last-modified tzurl

   mandatory_unique_properties
       According to the iCalendar standard, the "tzid" property must be specified exactly one time in a time zone declaration.
