NAME
       yaz-iconv - YAZ Character set conversion utility

SYNOPSIS
       yaz-iconv [-f from] [-t to] [-v] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       yaz-iconv converts data in the character set specified by from to output in the character set as specified by to.

       This yaz-iconv utility is similar to the iconv found on many POSIX systems (Glibc, Solaris, etc).

       If no file is specified, yaz-iconv reads from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -ffrom]
           Specify the character set from of the input file. Should be used in conjunction with option -t.

       -tto]
           Specify the character set of of the output. Should be used in conjunction with option -f.

       -v
           Print more information about the conversion process.

ENCODINGS
       The yaz-iconv command and the API as defined in yaz/yaz-iconv.h is a wrapper for the library system call iconv. But YAZ' iconv utility also implements conversions on its own. The table below lists
       characters sets (or encodings) that are supported by YAZ. Each character set is marked with either encode or decode. If an encoding is encode-enabled, YAZ may convert to the designated encoding. If an
       encoding is decode-enabled, YAZ may convert from the designated encoding.

       marc8 (encode, decode)
           The MARC8[1] encoding as defined by the Library of Congress. Most MARC21/USMARC records use this encoding.

       marc8s (encode, decode)
           Like MARC8 but conversion prefers non-combined characters in the Latin-1 plane over combined characters.

       marc8lossy (encode)
           Lossy encoding of MARC-8.

       marc8lossless (encode)
           Lossless encoding of MARC8.

       utf8 (encode, decode)
           The most commonly used UNICODE encoding on the Internet.

       iso8859-1 (encode, decode)
           ISO-8859-1, AKA Latin-1.

       iso5426 (decode)
           ISO 5426. Some MARC records (UNIMARC) use this encoding.

       iso5428:1984 (encode, decode)
           ISO 5428:1984.

       advancegreek (encode, decode)
           An encoding for Greek in use by some vendors (Advance).

       danmarc (decode)
           Danmarc (in danish)[2] is an encoding based on UNICODE which is used for DanMARC2 records.

EXAMPLES
       The following command converts from ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) to UTF-8.

               yaz-iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 <input.lst >output.lst
