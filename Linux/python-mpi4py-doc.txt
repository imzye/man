   Abstract
       MPI for Python provides Python bindings for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, allowing Python applications to exploit multiple processors on workstations, clusters and supercomputers.

       This  package  builds on the MPI specification and provides an object oriented interface resembling the MPI-2 C++ bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective (broadcasts,
       scatters, gathers) communication of any picklable Python object, as well as efficient communication of Python objects exposing the Python buffer interface (e.g. NumPy arrays and builtin  bytes/ar‐
       ray/memoryview objects).

INTRODUCTION
       Over  the  last  years,  high  performance computing has become an affordable resource to many more researchers in the scientific community than ever before. The conjunction of quality open source
       software and commodity hardware strongly influenced the now widespread popularity of Beowulf class clusters and cluster of workstations.

       Among many parallel computational models, message-passing has proven to be an effective one.  This paradigm is specially suited for (but not limited to) distributed  memory  architectures  and  is
       used  in  today’s most demanding scientific and engineering application related to modeling, simulation, design, and signal processing.  However, portable message-passing parallel programming used
       to be a nightmare in the past because of the many incompatible options developers were faced to.  Fortunately, this situation definitely changed after the MPI Forum released its standard  specifi‐
       cation.

       High performance computing is traditionally associated with software development using compiled languages. However, in typical applications programs, only a small part of the code is time-critical
       enough  to  require  the efficiency of compiled languages. The rest of the code is generally related to memory management, error handling, input/output, and user interaction, and those are usually
       the most error prone and time-consuming lines of code to write and debug in the whole development process.  Interpreted high-level languages can be really advantageous for this kind of tasks.

       For implementing general-purpose numerical computations, MATLAB [1] is the dominant interpreted programming language. In the open source side, Octave and Scilab are well known, freely  distributed
       software  packages  providing compatibility with the MATLAB language. In this work, we present MPI for Python, a new package enabling applications to exploit multiple processors using standard MPI
       “look and feel” in Python scripts.

   What is MPI?
       MPI, [mpi-using] [mpi-ref] the Message Passing Interface, is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computers. The  standard  defines
       the syntax and semantics of library routines and allows users to write portable programs in the main scientific programming languages (Fortran, C, or C++).

       Since  its release, the MPI specification [mpi-std1] [mpi-std2] has become the leading standard for message-passing libraries for parallel computers.  Implementations are available from vendors of
       high-performance computers and from well known open source projects like MPICH [mpi-mpich] and Open MPI [mpi-openmpi].

   What is Python?
       Python is a modern, easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming with dynamic typing
       and dynamic binding. It supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. Python’s elegant syntax, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal  language
       for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

       The  Python  interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed. It is easily extended with
       new functions and data types implemented in C or C++. Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

       Python is an ideal candidate for writing the higher-level parts of large-scale scientific applications [Hinsen97] and driving simulations in parallel architectures  [Beazley97]  like  clusters  of
       PC’s or SMP’s. Python codes are quickly developed, easily maintained, and can achieve a high degree of integration with other libraries written in compiled languages.

   Related Projects
       As this work started and evolved, some ideas were borrowed from well known MPI and Python related open source projects from the Internet.

       • OOMPI

         • It has no relation with Python, but is an excellent object oriented approach to MPI.

         • It is a C++ class library specification layered on top of the C bindings that encapsulates MPI into a functional class hierarchy.

         • It provides a flexible and intuitive interface by adding some abstractions, like Ports and Messages, which enrich and simplify the syntax.

       • Pypar

         • Its interface is rather minimal. There is no support for communicators or process topologies.

         • It does not require the Python interpreter to be modified or recompiled, but does not permit interactive parallel runs.

         • General (picklable) Python objects of any type can be communicated. There is good support for numeric arrays, practically full MPI bandwidth can be achieved.

       • pyMPI

         • It rebuilds the Python interpreter providing a built-in module for message passing. It does permit interactive parallel runs, which are useful for learning and debugging.

         • It provides an interface suitable for basic parallel programming.  There is not full support for defining new communicators or process topologies.

         • General (picklable) Python objects can be messaged between processors. There is native support for numeric arrays.

       • Scientific Python

         • It provides a collection of Python modules that are useful for scientific computing.

         • There is an interface to MPI and BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming).

         • The interface is simple but incomplete and does not resemble the MPI specification. There is support for numeric arrays.

       Additionally, we would like to mention some available tools for scientific computing and software development with Python.

       • NumPy is a package that provides array manipulation and computational capabilities similar to those found in IDL, MATLAB, or Octave. Using NumPy, it is possible to write many efficient numerical
         data processing applications directly in Python without using any C, C++ or Fortran code.

       • SciPy  is  an open source library of scientific tools for Python, gathering a variety of high level science and engineering modules together as a single package. It includes modules for graphics
         and plotting, optimization, integration, special functions, signal and image processing, genetic algorithms, ODE solvers, and others.

       • Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python language as easy as Python itself. The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython additionally  supports
         calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code. This makes Cython the ideal language for
         wrapping for external C libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.

       • SWIG  is  a  software  development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages like Perl, Tcl/Tk, Ruby and Python. Issuing header files to
         SWIG is the simplest approach to interfacing C/C++ libraries from a Python module.

OVERVIEW
       MPI for Python provides an object oriented approach to message passing which grounds on the standard MPI-2 C++ bindings. The interface was designed with focus in translating MPI syntax and  seman‐
       tics of standard MPI-2 bindings for C++ to Python. Any user of the standard C/C++ MPI bindings should be able to use this module without need of learning a new interface.

   Communicating Python Objects and Array Data
       The Python standard library supports different mechanisms for data persistence. Many of them rely on disk storage, but pickling and marshaling can also work with memory buffers.

       The pickle modules provide user-extensible facilities to serialize general Python objects using ASCII or binary formats. The marshal module provides facilities to serialize built-in Python objects
       using a binary format specific to Python, but independent of machine architecture issues.

       MPI  for  Python  can communicate any built-in or user-defined Python object taking advantage of the features provided by the pickle module. These facilities will be routinely used to build binary
       representations of objects to communicate (at sending processes), and restoring them back (at receiving processes).

       Although simple and general, the serialization approach (i.e., pickling and unpickling) previously discussed imposes important overheads in memory as well as processor  usage,  especially  in  the
       scenario  of  objects  with large memory footprints being communicated. Pickling general Python objects, ranging from primitive or container built-in types to user-defined classes, necessarily re‐
       quires computer resources.  Processing is also needed for dispatching the appropriate serialization method (that depends on the type of the object) and doing the actual packing. Additional  memory
       is always needed, and if its total amount is not known a priori, many reallocations can occur.  Indeed, in the case of large numeric arrays, this is certainly unacceptable and precludes communica‐
       tion of objects occupying half or more of the available memory resources.

       MPI  for  Python  supports direct communication of any object exporting the single-segment buffer interface. This interface is a standard Python mechanism provided by some types (e.g., strings and
       numeric arrays), allowing access in the C side to a contiguous memory buffer (i.e., address and length) containing the relevant data. This feature, in conjunction with the capability of construct‐
       ing user-defined MPI datatypes describing complicated memory layouts, enables the implementation of many algorithms involving multidimensional numeric arrays (e.g., image processing, fast  Fourier
       transforms, finite difference schemes on structured Cartesian grids) directly in Python, with negligible overhead, and almost as fast as compiled Fortran, C, or C++ codes.

   Communicators
       In  MPI for Python, Comm is the base class of communicators. The Intracomm and Intercomm classes are subclasses of the Comm class.  The Comm.Is_inter method (and Comm.Is_intra, provided for conve‐
       nience but not part of the MPI specification) is defined for communicator objects and can be used to determine the particular communicator class.

       The two predefined intracommunicator instances are available: COMM_SELF and COMM_WORLD. From them, new communicators can be created as needed.

       The number of processes in a communicator and the calling process rank can be respectively obtained with methods Comm.Get_size and Comm.Get_rank. The associated process group can be retrieved from
       a communicator by calling the Comm.Get_group method, which returns an instance of the Group class. Set operations with Group objects like like Group.Union, Group.Intersection and  Group.Difference
       are fully supported, as well as the creation of new communicators from these groups using Comm.Create and Intracomm.Create_group.

       New communicator instances can be obtained with the Comm.Clone, Comm.Dup and Comm.Split methods, as well methods Intracomm.Create_intercomm and Intercomm.Merge.

       Virtual  topologies  (Cartcomm, Graphcomm and Distgraphcomm classes, which are specializations of the Intracomm class) are fully supported. New instances can be obtained from intracommunicator in‐
       stances with factory methods Intracomm.Create_cart and Intracomm.Create_graph.

   Point-to-Point Communications
       Point to point communication is a fundamental capability of message passing systems. This mechanism enables the transmission of data between a pair of processes, one side sending,  the  other  re‐
       ceiving.

       MPI  provides  a set of send and receive functions allowing the communication of typed data with an associated tag.  The type information enables the conversion of data representation from one ar‐
       chitecture to another in the case of heterogeneous computing environments; additionally, it allows the representation of non-contiguous data layouts and user-defined datatypes, thus  avoiding  the
       overhead of (otherwise unavoidable) packing/unpacking operations. The tag information allows selectivity of messages at the receiving end.

   Blocking Communications
       MPI provides basic send and receive functions that are blocking.  These functions block the caller until the data buffers involved in the communication can be safely reused by the application pro‐
       gram.

       In  MPI  for Python, the Comm.Send, Comm.Recv and Comm.Sendrecv methods of communicator objects provide support for blocking point-to-point communications within Intracomm and Intercomm instances.
       These methods can communicate memory buffers. The variants Comm.send, Comm.recv and Comm.sendrecv can communicate general Python objects.

   Nonblocking Communications
       On many systems, performance can be significantly increased by overlapping communication and computation. This is particularly true on systems where communication can be executed  autonomously  by
       an intelligent, dedicated communication controller.

       MPI  provides  nonblocking  send  and  receive functions. They allow the possible overlap of communication and computation.  Non-blocking communication always come in two parts: posting functions,
       which begin the requested operation; and test-for-completion functions, which allow to discover whether the requested operation has completed.

       In MPI for Python, the Comm.Isend and Comm.Irecv methods initiate send and receive operations, respectively. These methods return a Request instance, uniquely identifying  the  started  operation.
       Its completion can be managed using the Request.Test, Request.Wait, and Request.Cancel methods. The management of Request objects and associated memory buffers involved in communication requires a
       careful, rather low-level coordination. Users must ensure that objects exposing their memory buffers are not accessed at the Python level while they are involved in nonblocking message-passing op‐
       erations.

   Persistent Communications
       Often a communication with the same argument list is repeatedly executed within an inner loop. In such cases, communication can be further optimized by using persistent communication, a particular
       case  of nonblocking communication allowing the reduction of the overhead between processes and communication controllers. Furthermore , this kind of optimization can also alleviate the extra call
       overheads associated to interpreted, dynamic languages like Python.

       In MPI for Python, the Comm.Send_init and Comm.Recv_init methods create persistent requests for a send and receive operation, respectively.  These methods return an instance of the Prequest class,
       a subclass of the Request class. The actual communication can be effectively started using the Prequest.Start method, and its completion can be managed as previously described.

   Collective Communications
       Collective communications allow the transmittal of data between multiple processes of a group simultaneously. The syntax and semantics of collective functions  is  consistent  with  point-to-point
       communication. Collective functions communicate typed data, but messages are not paired with an associated tag; selectivity of messages is implied in the calling order.

       The more commonly used collective communication operations are the following.

       • Barrier synchronization across all group members.

       • Global communication functions

         • Broadcast data from one member to all members of a group.

         • Gather data from all members to one member of a group.

         • Scatter data from one member to all members of a group.

       • Global reduction operations such as sum, maximum, minimum, etc.

       In  MPI  for  Python,  the  Comm.Bcast,  Comm.Scatter,  Comm.Gather,  Comm.Allgather, Comm.Alltoall methods provide support for collective communications of memory buffers. The lower-case variants
       Comm.bcast, Comm.scatter, Comm.gather, Comm.allgather and Comm.alltoall can communicate general Python objects.  The vector variants (which can  communicate  different  amounts  of  data  to  each
       process) Comm.Scatterv, Comm.Gatherv, Comm.Allgatherv, Comm.Alltoallv and Comm.Alltoallw are also supported, they can only communicate objects exposing memory buffers.

       Global  reduction  operations  on  memory  buffers are accessible through the Comm.Reduce, Comm.Reduce_scatter, Comm.Allreduce, Intracomm.Scan and Intracomm.Exscan methods. The lower-case variants
       Comm.reduce, Comm.allreduce, Intracomm.scan and Intracomm.exscan can communicate general Python objects; however, the actual required reduction computations  are  performed  sequentially  at  some
       process. All the predefined (i.e., SUM, PROD, MAX, etc.)  reduction operations can be applied.

   Support for GPU-aware MPI
       Several MPI implementations, including Open MPI and MVAPICH, support passing GPU pointers to MPI calls to avoid explicit data movement between host and device. On the Python side, support for han‐
       dling  GPU  arrays  have  been implemented in many libraries related GPU computation such as CuPy, Numba, PyTorch, and PyArrow. To maximize interoperability across library boundaries, two kinds of
       zero-copy data exchange protocols have been defined and agreed upon: DLPack and CUDA Array Interface (CAI).

       MPI for Python provides an experimental support for GPU-aware MPI.  This feature requires:

       1. mpi4py is built against a GPU-aware MPI library.

       2. The Python GPU arrays are compliant with either of the protocols.

       See the Tutorial section for further information. We note that

       • Whether or not a MPI call can work for GPU arrays depends on the underlying MPI implementation, not on mpi4py.

       • This support is currently experimental and subject to change in the future.

   Dynamic Process Management
       In the context of the MPI-1 specification, a parallel application is static; that is, no processes can be added to or deleted from a running application after it  has  been  started.  Fortunately,
       this limitation was addressed in MPI-2. The new specification added a process management model providing a basic interface between an application and external resources and process managers.

       This  MPI-2  extension  can  be really useful, especially for sequential applications built on top of parallel modules, or parallel applications with a client/server model. The MPI-2 process model
       provides a mechanism to create new processes and establish communication between them and the existing MPI application. It also provides mechanisms to establish communication between two  existing
       MPI applications, even when one did not start the other.

       In  MPI  for Python, new independent process groups can be created by calling the Intracomm.Spawn method within an intracommunicator.  This call returns a new intercommunicator (i.e., an Intercomm
       instance) at the parent process group. The child process group can retrieve the matching intercommunicator by calling the Comm.Get_parent class method. At each side, the new intercommunicator  can
       be used to perform point to point and collective communications between the parent and child groups of processes.

       Alternatively,  disjoint  groups  of  processes  can  establish  communication  using a client/server approach. Any server application must first call the Open_port function to open a port and the
       Publish_name function to publish a provided service, and next call the Intracomm.Accept method.  Any client applications can first find a published service by  calling  the  Lookup_name  function,
       which  returns  the port where a server can be contacted; and next call the Intracomm.Connect method. Both Intracomm.Accept and Intracomm.Connect methods return an Intercomm instance. When connec‐
       tion between client/server processes is no longer needed, all of them must cooperatively call the Comm.Disconnect method. Additionally, server applications should release resources by calling  the
       Unpublish_name and Close_port functions.

   One-Sided Communications
       One-sided  communications  (also  called  Remote  Memory  Access,  RMA) supplements the traditional two-sided, send/receive based MPI communication model with a one-sided, put/get based interface.
       One-sided communication that can take advantage of the capabilities of highly specialized network hardware. Additionally, this extension lowers latency and software overhead in applications  writ‐
       ten using a shared-memory-like paradigm.

       The  MPI specification revolves around the use of objects called windows; they intuitively specify regions of a process’s memory that have been made available for remote read and write operations.
       The published memory blocks can be accessed through three functions for put (remote send), get (remote write), and accumulate (remote update or reduction) data items. A much larger number of func‐
       tions support different synchronization styles; the semantics of these synchronization operations are fairly complex.

       In MPI for Python, one-sided operations are available by using instances of the Win class. New window objects are created by calling the Win.Create method at all processes  within  a  communicator
       and specifying a memory buffer . When a window instance is no longer needed, the Win.Free method should be called.

       The  three  one-sided  MPI operations for remote write, read and reduction are available through calling the methods Win.Put, Win.Get, and Win.Accumulate respectively within a Win instance.  These
       methods need an integer rank identifying the target process and an integer offset relative the base address of the remote memory block being accessed.

       The one-sided operations read, write, and reduction are implicitly nonblocking, and must be synchronized by using two primary modes.  Active target synchronization requires the origin  process  to
       call  the  Win.Start  and Win.Complete methods at the origin process, and target process cooperates by calling the Win.Post and Win.Wait methods. There is also a collective variant provided by the
       Win.Fence method. Passive target synchronization is more lenient, only the origin process calls the Win.Lock and Win.Unlock methods. Locks are used to protect remote accesses to the locked  remote
       window and to protect local load/store accesses to a locked local window.

   Parallel Input/Output
       The  POSIX standard provides a model of a widely portable file system. However, the optimization needed for parallel input/output cannot be achieved with this generic interface. In order to ensure
       efficiency and scalability, the underlying parallel input/output system must provide a high-level interface supporting partitioning of file data among processes and a collective interface support‐
       ing complete transfers of global data structures between process memories and files. Additionally, further efficiencies can be gained via support for asynchronous input/output, strided accesses to
       data, and control over physical file layout on storage devices. This scenario motivated the inclusion in the MPI-2 standard of a custom interface in order to support more elaborated  parallel  in‐
       put/output operations.

       The  MPI  specification for parallel input/output revolves around the use objects called files. As defined by MPI, files are not just contiguous byte streams. Instead, they are regarded as ordered
       collections of typed data items. MPI supports sequential or random access to any integral set of these items. Furthermore, files are opened collectively by a group of processes.

       The common patterns for accessing a shared file (broadcast, scatter, gather, reduction) is expressed by using user-defined datatypes.  Compared to the communication patterns of point-to-point  and
       collective  communications,  this  approach has the advantage of added flexibility and expressiveness. Data access operations (read and write) are defined for different kinds of positioning (using
       explicit offsets, individual file pointers, and shared file pointers), coordination (non-collective and collective), and synchronism (blocking, nonblocking, and  split  collective  with  begin/end
       phases).

       In MPI for Python, all MPI input/output operations are performed through instances of the File class. File handles are obtained by calling the File.Open method at all processes within a communica‐
       tor and providing a file name and the intended access mode.  After use, they must be closed by calling the File.Close method.  Files even can be deleted by calling method File.Delete.

       After creation, files are typically associated with a per-process view. The view defines the current set of data visible and accessible from an open file as an ordered set of elementary datatypes.
       This data layout can be set and queried with the File.Set_view and File.Get_view methods respectively.

       Actual  input/output operations are achieved by many methods combining read and write calls with different behavior regarding positioning, coordination, and synchronism. Summing up, MPI for Python
       provides the thirty (30) methods defined in MPI-2 for reading from or writing to files using explicit offsets or file pointers (individual or shared), in blocking or nonblocking and collective  or
       noncollective versions.

   Environmental Management
   Initialization and Exit
       Module  functions  Init or Init_thread and Finalize provide MPI initialization and finalization respectively. Module functions Is_initialized and Is_finalized provide the respective tests for ini‐
       tialization and finalization.

       NOTE:
          MPI_Init() or MPI_Init_thread() is actually called when you import the MPI module from the mpi4py package, but only if MPI is not already initialized. In such case, calling Init or  Init_thread
          from Python is expected to generate an MPI error, and in turn an exception will be raised.

       NOTE:
          MPI_Finalize()  is  registered  (by  using  Python C/API function Py_AtExit()) for being automatically called when Python processes exit, but only if mpi4py actually initialized MPI. Therefore,
          there is no need to call Finalize from Python to ensure MPI finalization.

   Implementation Information
       • The MPI version number can be retrieved from module function Get_version. It returns a two-integer tuple (version, subversion).

       • The Get_processor_name function can be used to access the processor name.

       • The values of predefined attributes attached to the world communicator can be obtained by calling the Comm.Get_attr method within the COMM_WORLD instance.

   Timers
       MPI timer functionalities are available through the Wtime and Wtick functions.

   Error Handling
       In order to facilitate handle sharing with other Python modules interfacing MPI-based parallel libraries, the predefined MPI error handlers ERRORS_RETURN and ERRORS_ARE_FATAL can  be  assigned  to
       and  retrieved  from  communicators  using  methods  Comm.Set_errhandler  and  Comm.Get_errhandler,  and  similarly  for  windows  and  files.  New  custom  error  handlers  can  be  created  with
       Comm.Create_errhandler.

       When the predefined error handler ERRORS_RETURN is set, errors returned from MPI calls within Python code will raise an instance of the exception class Exception, which is a subclass of the  stan‐
       dard Python exception RuntimeError.

       NOTE:
          After import, mpi4py overrides the default MPI rules governing inheritance of error handlers. The ERRORS_RETURN error handler is set in the predefined COMM_SELF and COMM_WORLD communicators, as
          well  as  any new Comm, Win, or File instance created through mpi4py. If you ever pass such handles to C/C++/Fortran library code, it is recommended to set the ERRORS_ARE_FATAL error handler on
          them to ensure MPI errors do not pass silently.

       WARNING:
          Importing with from mpi4py.MPI import * will cause a name clashing with the standard Python Exception base class.

       TIP:
          Rolf Rabenseifner at HLRS developed a comprehensive MPI-3.1/4.0 course with slides and a large set of exercises including solutions. This material is available online for self-study. The slides
          and exercises show the C, Fortran, and Python (mpi4py) interfaces. For performance reasons, most Python exercises use NumPy arrays and communication routines involving buffer-like objects.

       TIP:
          Victor Eijkhout at TACC authored the book Parallel Programming for Science and Engineering. This book is available online in PDF and HTML formats. The book covers parallel programming with  MPI
          and OpenMP in C/C++ and Fortran, and MPI in Python using mpi4py.

       MPI  for  Python supports convenient, pickle-based communication of generic Python object as well as fast, near C-speed, direct array data communication of buffer-provider objects (e.g., NumPy ar‐
       rays).

       • Communication of generic Python objects

         You have to use methods with all-lowercase names, like Comm.send, Comm.recv, Comm.bcast, Comm.scatter, Comm.gather . An object to be sent is passed as a parameter to the communication call,  and
         the received object is simply the return value.

         The Comm.isend and Comm.irecv methods return Request instances; completion of these methods can be managed using the Request.test and Request.wait methods.

         The  Comm.recv and Comm.irecv methods may be passed a buffer object that can be repeatedly used to receive messages avoiding internal memory allocation. This buffer must be sufficiently large to
         accommodate the transmitted messages; hence, any buffer passed to Comm.recv or Comm.irecv must be at least as long as the pickled data transmitted to the receiver.

         Collective calls like Comm.scatter, Comm.gather, Comm.allgather, Comm.alltoall expect a single value or a sequence of Comm.size elements at the root or all process. They return a single value, a
         list of Comm.size elements, or None.

         NOTE:
            MPI for Python uses the highest protocol version available in the Python runtime (see the HIGHEST_PROTOCOL constant in the pickle module).  The default protocol can be changed at import  time
            by setting the MPI4PY_PICKLE_PROTOCOL environment variable, or at runtime by assigning a different value to the PROTOCOL attribute of the pickle object within the MPI module.

       • Communication of buffer-like objects

         You have to use method names starting with an upper-case letter, like Comm.Send, Comm.Recv, Comm.Bcast, Comm.Scatter, Comm.Gather.

         In  general,  buffer  arguments  to these calls must be explicitly specified by using a 2/3-list/tuple like [data, MPI.DOUBLE], or [data, count, MPI.DOUBLE] (the former one uses the byte-size of
         data and the extent of the MPI datatype to define count).

         For vector collectives communication operations like Comm.Scatterv and Comm.Gatherv, buffer arguments are specified as [data, count, displ, datatype], where count and displ are sequences of  in‐
         tegral values.

         Automatic MPI datatype discovery for NumPy/GPU arrays and PEP-3118 buffers is supported, but limited to basic C types (all C/C99-native signed/unsigned integral types and single/double precision
         real/complex  floating  types)  and availability of matching datatypes in the underlying MPI implementation. In this case, the buffer-provider object can be passed directly as a buffer argument,
         the count and MPI datatype will be inferred.

         If mpi4py is built against a GPU-aware MPI implementation, GPU arrays can be passed to upper-case methods as long as they  have  either  the  __dlpack__  and  __dlpack_device__  methods  or  the
         __cuda_array_interface__  attribute that are compliant with the respective standard specifications. Moreover, only C-contiguous or Fortran-contiguous GPU arrays are supported. It is important to
         note that GPU buffers must be fully ready before any MPI routines operate on them to avoid race conditions. This can be ensured by using the synchronization API of  your  array  library.  mpi4py
         does not have access to any GPU-specific functionality and thus cannot perform this operation automatically for users.

   Running Python scripts with MPI
       Most MPI programs can be run with the command mpiexec. In practice, running Python programs looks like:

          $ mpiexec -n 4 python script.py

       to run the program with 4 processors.

   Point-to-Point Communication
       • Python objects (pickle under the hood):

            from mpi4py import MPI

            comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
            rank = comm.Get_rank()

            if rank == 0:
                data = {'a': 7, 'b': 3.14}
                comm.send(data, dest=1, tag=11)
            elif rank == 1:
                data = comm.recv(source=0, tag=11)

       • Python objects with non-blocking communication:

            from mpi4py import MPI

            comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
            rank = comm.Get_rank()

            if rank == 0:
                data = {'a': 7, 'b': 3.14}
                req = comm.isend(data, dest=1, tag=11)
                req.wait()
            elif rank == 1:
                req = comm.irecv(source=0, tag=11)
                data = req.wait()

       • NumPy arrays (the fast way!):

            from mpi4py import MPI
            import numpy

            comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
            rank = comm.Get_rank()

            # passing MPI datatypes explicitly
            if rank == 0:
                data = numpy.arange(1000, dtype='i')
                comm.Send([data, MPI.INT], dest=1, tag=77)
            elif rank == 1:
                data = numpy.empty(1000, dtype='i')
                comm.Recv([data, MPI.INT], source=0, tag=77)

            # automatic MPI datatype discovery
            if rank == 0:
                data = numpy.arange(100, dtype=numpy.float64)
                comm.Send(data, dest=1, tag=13)
            elif rank == 1:
                data = numpy.empty(100, dtype=numpy.float64)
                comm.Recv(data, source=0, tag=13)

MPI4PY
       The MPI for Python package.

       The  Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computers. The MPI standard defines the syntax and se‐
       mantics of library routines and allows users to write portable programs in the main scientific programming languages (Fortran, C, or C++). Since its release, the MPI specification has  become  the
       leading standard for message-passing libraries for parallel computers.

       MPI  for  Python provides MPI bindings for the Python programming language, allowing any Python program to exploit multiple processors.  This package build on the MPI specification and provides an
       object oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++ bindings.

   Runtime configuration options
       mpi4py.rc
              This object has attributes exposing runtime configuration options that become effective at import time of the MPI module.

       Example

       MPI for Python features automatic initialization and finalization of the MPI execution environment. By using the mpi4py.rc object, MPI initialization and finalization can be  handled  programmati‐
       cally:

          import mpi4py
          mpi4py.rc.initialize = False  # do not initialize MPI automatically
          mpi4py.rc.finalize = False    # do not finalize MPI automatically

          from mpi4py import MPI # import the 'MPI' module

          MPI.Init()      # manual initialization of the MPI environment
          ...             # your finest code here ...
          MPI.Finalize()  # manual finalization of the MPI environment

   Environment variables
       The following environment variables override the corresponding attributes of the mpi4py.rc and MPI.pickle objects at import time of the MPI module.

       NOTE:
          For variables of boolean type, accepted values are 0 and 1 (interpreted as False and True, respectively), and strings specifying a YAML boolean value (case-insensitive).

   Miscellaneous functions
       mpi4py.profile(name, *, path=None)
              Support for the MPI profiling interface.

              Parameters

                     • name (str) – Name of the profiler library to load.

                     • path (sequence of str, optional) – Additional paths to search for the profiler.

              Return type
                     None

       mpi4py.get_include()
              Return the directory in the package that contains header files.

              Extension modules that need to compile against mpi4py should use this function to locate the appropriate include directory. Using Python distutils (or perhaps NumPy distutils):

                 import mpi4py
                 Extension('extension_name', ...
                           include_dirs=[..., mpi4py.get_include()])

              Return type
                     str

       mpi4py.get_config()
              Return a dictionary with information about MPI.

              Changed  in  version 4.0.0: By default, this function returns an empty dictionary. However, downstream packagers and distributors may alter such behavior.  To that end, MPI information must
              be provided under an mpi section within a UTF-8 encoded INI-style configuration file mpi.cfg located at the top-level package directory.  The configuration file is read and parsed using the
              configparser module.

              Return type
                     dict[str, str]

MPI4PY.FUTURES
       Added in version 3.0.0.

       This package provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables on a pool of worker processes using MPI for inter-process communication.

       The mpi4py.futures package is based on concurrent.futures from the Python standard library. More precisely, mpi4py.futures provides the MPIPoolExecutor class as a concrete  implementation  of  the
       abstract class Executor.  The submit() interface schedules a callable to be executed asynchronously and returns a Future object representing the execution of the callable.  Future instances can be
       queried for the call result or exception. Sets of Future instances can be passed to the wait() and as_completed() functions.

       SEE ALSO:

          Module concurrent.futures
                 Documentation of the concurrent.futures standard module.

   MPIPoolExecutor
       The  MPIPoolExecutor  class  uses  a pool of MPI processes to execute calls asynchronously. By performing computations in separate processes, it allows to side-step the global interpreter lock but
       also means that only picklable objects can be executed and returned. The __main__ module must be importable by worker processes, thus MPIPoolExecutor instances may not work in the interactive  in‐
       terpreter.

       MPIPoolExecutor  takes  advantage  of the dynamic process management features introduced in the MPI-2 standard. In particular, the MPI.Intracomm.Spawn method of MPI.COMM_SELF is used in the master
       (or parent) process to spawn new worker (or child) processes running a Python interpreter. The master process uses a separate thread (one for each MPIPoolExecutor instance) to communicate back and
       forth with the workers.  The worker processes serve the execution of tasks in the main (and only) thread until they are signaled for completion.

       NOTE:
          The worker processes must import the main script in order to unpickle any callable defined in the __main__ module and submitted from the master process. Furthermore, the callables may need  ac‐
          cess  to other global variables. At the worker processes, mpi4py.futures executes the main script code (using the runpy module) under the __worker__ namespace to define the __main__ module. The
          __main__ and __worker__ modules are added to sys.modules (both at the master and worker processes) to ensure proper pickling and unpickling.

       WARNING:
          During the initial import phase at the workers, the main script cannot create and use new MPIPoolExecutor instances. Otherwise, each worker would attempt to spawn a new pool of workers, leading
          to infinite recursion. mpi4py.futures detects such recursive attempts to spawn new workers and aborts the MPI execution environment. As the main script code is run under  the  __worker__  name‐
          space, the easiest way to avoid spawn recursion is using the idiom if __name__ == '__main__': ... in the main script.

       class mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor(max_workers=None, initializer=None, initargs=(), **kwargs)
              An  Executor  subclass  that  executes  calls  asynchronously  using  a  pool  of  at  most  max_workers  processes.   If  max_workers is None or not given, its value is determined from the
              MPI4PY_FUTURES_MAX_WORKERS environment variable if set, or the MPI universe size if set, otherwise a single worker process is spawned.  If max_workers is lower than or equal to 0, then a  ‐
              ValueError will be raised.

              initializer is an optional callable that is called at the start of each worker process before executing any tasks; initargs is a tuple of arguments passed to the initializer. If initializer
              raises an exception, all pending tasks and any attempt to submit new tasks to the pool will raise a BrokenExecutor exception.

              Other parameters:

              • python_exe: Path to the Python interpreter executable used to spawn worker processes, otherwise sys.executable is used.

              • python_args:  list  or  iterable  with  additional  command  line flags to pass to the Python executable. Command line flags determined from inspection of sys.flags, sys.warnoptions and ‐
                sys._xoptions in are passed unconditionally.

              • mpi_info: dict or iterable yielding (key, value) pairs.  These (key, value) pairs are passed (through an MPI.Info object) to the MPI.Intracomm.Spawn call used to spawn  worker  processes.
                This  mechanism  allows  telling the MPI runtime system where and how to start the processes. Check the documentation of the backend MPI implementation about the set of keys it interprets
                and the corresponding format for values.

              • globals: dict or iterable yielding (name, value) pairs to initialize the main module namespace in worker processes.

              • main: If set to False, do not import the __main__ module in worker processes. Setting main to False prevents worker processes from accessing definitions in the parent __main__ namespace.

              • path: list or iterable with paths to append to sys.path in worker processes to extend the module search path.

              • wdir: Path to set the current working directory in worker processes using os.chdir(). The initial working directory is set by the MPI implementation. Quality  MPI  implementations  should
                honor a wdir info key passed through mpi_info, although such feature is not mandatory.

              • env:  dict or iterable yielding (name, value) pairs with environment variables to update os.environ in worker processes.  The initial environment is set by the MPI implementation. MPI im‐
                plementations may allow setting the initial environment through mpi_info, however such feature is not required nor recommended by the MPI standard.

              • use_pkl5: If set to True, use pickle with  out-of-band  buffers  for  interprocess  communication.  If  use_pkl5  is  set  to  None  or  not  given,  its  value  is  determined  from  the
                MPI4PY_FUTURES_USE_PKL5 environment variable. Using pickle with out-of-band buffers may benefit applications dealing with large buffer-like objects like NumPy arrays. See mpi4py.util.pkl5
                for additional information.

              • backoff:  float value specifying the maximum number of seconds a worker thread or process suspends execution with time.sleep() while idle-waiting. If not set, its value is determined from
                the MPI4PY_FUTURES_BACKOFF environment variable if set, otherwise the default value of 0.001 seconds is used. Lower values will reduce latency and increase execution throughput  for  very
                short-lived tasks, albeit at the expense of spinning CPU cores and increased energy consumption.

              submit(fn, /, *args, **kwargs)
                     Schedule the callable fn to be executed as fn(*args, **kwargs) and returns a Future object representing the execution of the callable.

                        executor = MPIPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)
                        future = executor.submit(pow, 321, 1234)
                        print(future.result())

              map(fn, *iterables, timeout=None, chunksize=1, buffersize=None, **kwargs)
                     Similar to map(fn, *iterables) except:

                     • The  iterables  are  consumed  immediately rather than lazily, unless buffersize is specified to limit the number of submitted tasks whose results have not yet been yielded. If the
                       task buffer is full, the caller blocks and iteration over the iterables pauses until a result is yielded from the buffer.

                     • fn is executed asynchronously and several calls to fn may be made concurrently, out-of-order, in separate processes.

                     The returned iterator raises a TimeoutError if __next__() is called and the result isn’t available after timeout seconds from the original call to map().  timeout can be an int or  a
                     float.  If timeout is not specified or None, there is no limit to the wait time.

                     If fn raises an exception, then that exception will be raised when its value is retrieved from the iterator.

                     This  method chops iterables into a number of chunks which it submits to the pool as separate tasks. The (approximate) size of these chunks can be specified by setting chunksize to a
                     positive integer. For very long iterables, using a large value for chunksize can significantly improve performance compared to the default size of one.

                     By default, the returned iterator yields results in-order, waiting for successive tasks to complete . This behavior can be changed by passing the keyword argument unordered as  True,
                     then the result iterator will yield a result as soon as any of the tasks complete.

                        executor = MPIPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)
                        for result in executor.map(pow, [2] * 32, range(32)):
                            print(result)

                     Changed in version 4.1.0: Added the buffersize parameter.

              starmap(fn, iterable, timeout=None, chunksize=1, buffersize=None, **kwargs)
                     Similar  to  itertools.starmap(fn,  iterable).  Used  instead of map() when argument parameters are already grouped in tuples from a single iterable (the data has been “pre-zipped”).
                     map(fn, *iterable) is equivalent to starmap(fn, zip(*iterable)).

                        executor = MPIPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)
                        iterable = ((2, n) for n in range(32))
                        for result in executor.starmap(pow, iterable):
                            print(result)

                     Changed in version 4.1.0: Added the buffersize parameter.

              shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=False)
                     Signal the executor that it should free any resources that it is using when the currently pending futures are done executing.  Calls to submit() and map() made after shutdown()  will
                     raise RuntimeError.

                     If  wait  is  True then this method will not return until all the pending futures are done executing and the resources associated with the executor have been freed.  If wait is False
                     then this method will return immediately and the resources associated with the executor will be freed when all pending futures are done executing.  Regardless of the value  of  wait,
                     the entire Python program will not exit until all pending futures are done executing.

                     If  cancel_futures  is  True, this method will cancel all pending futures that the executor has not started running. Any futures that are completed or running won’t be cancelled, re‐
                     gardless of the value of cancel_futures.

                     You can avoid having to call this method explicitly if you use the with statement, which will shutdown the executor instance (waiting as if shutdown() were called with wait set to  ‐
                     True).

                        import time
                        with MPIPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:
                            future = executor.submit(time.sleep, 2)
                        assert future.done()

              bootup(wait=True)
                     Signal  the  executor  that it should allocate eagerly any required resources (in particular, MPI worker processes). If wait is True, then bootup() will not return until the executor
                     resources are ready to process submissions.  Resources are automatically allocated in the first call to submit(), thus calling bootup() explicitly is seldom needed.

              num_workers
                     Number or worker processes in the pool.

       MPI4PY_FUTURES_MAX_WORKERS
              If the max_workers parameter to MPIPoolExecutor is None or not given, the MPI4PY_FUTURES_MAX_WORKERS environment variable provides a fallback value for the  maximum  number  of  MPI  worker
              processes to spawn.

              Added in version 3.1.0.

       MPI4PY_FUTURES_USE_PKL5
              If  the  use_pkl5  keyword argument to MPIPoolExecutor is None or not given, the MPI4PY_FUTURES_USE_PKL5 environment variable provides a fallback value for whether the executor should use ‐
              pickle with out-of-band buffers for interprocess communication. Accepted values are 0 and 1 (interpreted as False and True, respectively),  and  strings  specifying  a  YAML  boolean  value
              (case-insensitive). Using pickle with out-of-band buffers may benefit applications dealing with large buffer-like objects like NumPy arrays. See mpi4py.util.pkl5 for additional information.

              Added in version 4.0.0.

       MPI4PY_FUTURES_BACKOFF
              If  the  backoff  keyword  argument  to  MPIPoolExecutor is not given, the MPI4PY_FUTURES_BACKOFF environment variable can be set to a float value specifying the maximum number of seconds a
              worker thread or process suspends execution with time.sleep() while idle-waiting. If not set, the default backoff value is 0.001 seconds. Lower values will reduce latency and increase  exe‐
              cution throughput for very short-lived tasks, albeit at the expense of spinning CPU cores and increased energy consumption.

              Added in version 4.0.0.

       NOTE:
          As  the master process uses a separate thread to perform MPI communication with the workers, the backend MPI implementation should provide support for MPI.THREAD_MULTIPLE. However, some popular
          MPI implementations do not support yet concurrent MPI calls from multiple threads. Additionally, users may decide to initialize MPI with a lower level of thread support. If the level of  thread
          support  in  the  backend  MPI is less than MPI.THREAD_MULTIPLE, mpi4py.futures will use a global lock to serialize MPI calls. If the level of thread support is less than MPI.THREAD_SERIALIZED,
          mpi4py.futures will emit a RuntimeWarning.

       WARNING:
          If the level of thread support in the backend MPI is less than MPI.THREAD_SERIALIZED (i.e, it is either MPI.THREAD_SINGLE or MPI.THREAD_FUNNELED),  in  theory  mpi4py.futures  cannot  be  used.
          Rather  than raising an exception, mpi4py.futures emits a warning and takes a “cross-fingers” attitude to continue execution in the hope that serializing MPI calls with a global lock will actu‐
          ally work.

   MPICommExecutor
       Legacy MPI-1 implementations (as well as some vendor MPI-2 implementations) do not support the dynamic process management features introduced in the MPI-2 standard.  Additionally,  job  schedulers
       and batch systems in supercomputing facilities may pose additional complications to applications using the MPI_Comm_spawn() routine.

       With  these  issues in mind, mpi4py.futures supports an additional, more traditional, SPMD-like usage pattern requiring MPI-1 calls only. Python applications are started the usual way, e.g., using
       the mpiexec command. Python code should make a collective call to the MPICommExecutor context manager to partition the set of MPI processes within a MPI communicator in one  master  processes  and
       many  workers  processes.  The master process gets access to an MPIPoolExecutor instance to submit tasks. Meanwhile, the worker process follow a different execution path and team-up to execute the
       tasks submitted from the master.

       Besides alleviating the lack of dynamic process management features in legacy MPI-1 or partial MPI-2 implementations, the MPICommExecutor context manager may be useful in classic MPI-based  Python
       applications willing to take advantage of the simple, task-based, master/worker approach available in the mpi4py.futures package.

       class mpi4py.futures.MPICommExecutor(comm=None, root=0)
              Context  manager  for  MPIPoolExecutor. This context manager splits a MPI (intra)communicator comm (defaults to MPI.COMM_WORLD if not provided or None) in two disjoint sets: a single master
              process (with rank root in comm) and the remaining worker processes. These sets are then connected through an intercommunicator.  The target of the with  statement  is  assigned  either  an
              MPIPoolExecutor instance (at the master) or None (at the workers).

                 from mpi4py import MPI
                 from mpi4py.futures import MPICommExecutor

                 with MPICommExecutor(MPI.COMM_WORLD, root=0) as executor:
                     if executor is not None:
                        future = executor.submit(abs, -42)
                        assert future.result() == 42
                        answer = set(executor.map(abs, [-42, 42]))
                        assert answer == {42}

       WARNING:
          If MPICommExecutor is passed a communicator of size one (e.g., MPI.COMM_SELF), then the executor instance assigned to the target of the with statement will execute all submitted tasks in a sin‐
          gle  worker thread, thus ensuring that task execution still progress asynchronously. However, the GIL will prevent the main and worker threads from running concurrently in multicore processors.
          Moreover, the thread context switching may harm noticeably the performance of CPU-bound tasks. In case of I/O-bound tasks, the GIL is not usually an issue, however, as a single worker thread is
          used, it progress one task at a time. We advice against using MPICommExecutor with communicators of size one and suggest refactoring your code to use instead a ThreadPoolExecutor.

   Command line
       Recalling the issues related to the lack of support for dynamic process management features in MPI implementations, mpi4py.futures supports an alternative usage pattern where Python  code  (either
       from scripts, modules, or zip files) is run under command line control of the mpi4py.futures package by passing -m mpi4py.futures to the python executable.  The mpi4py.futures invocation should be
       passed  a  pyfile  path  to a script (or a zipfile/directory containing a __main__.py file).  Additionally, mpi4py.futures accepts -m mod to execute a module named mod, -c cmd to execute a command
       string cmd, or even - to read commands from standard input (sys.stdin).  Summarizing, mpi4py.futures can be invoked in the following ways:

       • $ mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py.futures pyfile [arg] ...

       • $ mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py.futures -m mod [arg] ...

       • $ mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py.futures -c cmd [arg] ...

       • $ mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py.futures - [arg] ...

       Before starting the main script execution, mpi4py.futures splits MPI.COMM_WORLD in one master (the process with rank 0 in MPI.COMM_WORLD) and numprocs - 1 workers and connects them through an  MPI
       intercommunicator.   Afterwards,  the  master process proceeds with the execution of the user script code, which eventually creates MPIPoolExecutor instances to submit tasks. Meanwhile, the worker
       processes follow a different execution path to serve the master.  Upon successful termination of the main script at the master, the entire MPI execution environment exists gracefully. In  case  of
       any unhandled exception in the main script, the master process calls MPI.COMM_WORLD.Abort(1) to prevent deadlocks and force termination of entire MPI execution environment.

       WARNING:
          Running  scripts  under command line control of mpi4py.futures is quite similar to executing a single-process application that spawn additional workers as required. However, there is a very im‐
          portant difference users should be aware of. All MPIPoolExecutor instances created at the master will share the pool of workers. Tasks submitted at the master from many different executors will
          be scheduled for execution in random order as soon as a worker is idle. Any executor can easily starve all the workers (e.g., by calling MPIPoolExecutor.map() with long iterables). If that ever
          happens, submissions from other executors will not be serviced until free workers are available.

   Parallel tasks
       The mpi4py.futures package favors an embarrassingly parallel execution model involving a series of sequential tasks independent  of  each  other  and  executed  asynchronously.  Albeit  unnatural,
       MPIPoolExecutor can still be used for handling workloads involving parallel tasks, where worker processes communicate and coordinate each other via MPI.

       mpi4py.futures.get_comm_workers()
              Access an intracommunicator grouping MPI worker processes.

       Executing parallel tasks with mpi4py.futures requires following some rules, cf. highlighted lines in example cpi.py :

       • Use MPIPoolExecutor.num_workers to determine the number of worker processes in the executor and submit exactly one callable per worker process using the MPIPoolExecutor.submit() method.

       • The submitted callable must use get_comm_workers() to access an intracommunicator grouping MPI worker processes. Afterwards, it is highly recommended calling the Barrier() method on the communi‐
         cator. The barrier synchronization ensures that every worker process is executing the submitted callable exactly once. Afterwards, the parallel task can safely perform any kind of point-to-point
         or collective operation using the returned communicator.

       • The Future instances returned by MPIPoolExecutor.submit() should be collected in a sequence.  Use wait() with the sequence of Future instances to ensure logical completion of the parallel task.

   Utilities
       The mpi4py.futures package provides additional utilities for handling Future instances.

       mpi4py.futures.collect(fs)
              Gather a collection of futures in a new future.

              Parameters
                     fs – Collection of futures.

              Returns
                     New future producing as result a list with results from fs.

       mpi4py.futures.compose(future, resulthook=None, excepthook=None)
              Compose the completion of a future with result and exception handlers.

              Parameters

                     • future – Input future instance.

                     • resulthook  –  Function to be called once the input future completes with success. Once the input future finish running with success, its result value is the input argument for re‐
                       sulthook. The result of resulthook is set as the result of the output future.  If resulthook is None, the output future is completed directly with the result of the input future.

                     • excepthook – Function to be called once the input future completes with failure. Once the input future finish running with failure, its exception value is the  input  argument  for
                       excepthook.   If  excepthook returns an Exception instance, it is set as the exception of the output future.  Otherwise, the result of excepthook is set as the result of the output
                       future.  If excepthook is None, the output future is set as failed with the exception from the input future.

              Returns
                     Output future instance to be completed once the input future is completed and either resulthook or excepthook finish executing.

   Examples
   Computing the Julia set
       The following julia.py script computes the Julia set and dumps an image to disk in binary PGM format. The code starts by importing MPIPoolExecutor  from  the  mpi4py.futures  package.  Next,  some
       global  constants  and  functions implement the computation of the Julia set. The computations are protected with the standard if __name__ == '__main__': ... idiom.  The image is computed by whole
       scanlines submitting all these tasks at once using the map method. The result iterator yields scanlines in-order as the tasks complete. Finally, each scanline is dumped to disk.

       julia.py

          from mpi4py.futures import MPIPoolExecutor

          x0, x1, w = -2.0, +2.0, 640*2
          y0, y1, h = -1.5, +1.5, 480*2
          dx = (x1 - x0) / w
          dy = (y1 - y0) / h

          c = complex(0, 0.65)

          def julia(x, y):
              z = complex(x, y)
              n = 255
              while abs(z) < 3 and n > 1:
                  z = z**2 + c
                  n -= 1
              return n

          def julia_line(k):
              line = bytearray(w)
              y = y1 - k * dy
              for j in range(w):
                  x = x0 + j * dx
                  line[j] = julia(x, y)
              return line

          if __name__ == '__main__':

              with MPIPoolExecutor() as executor:
                  image = executor.map(julia_line, range(h))
                  with open('julia.pgm', 'wb') as f:
                      f.write(b'P5 %d %d %d\n' % (w, h, 255))
                      for line in image:
                          f.write(line)

       The recommended way to execute the script is by using the mpiexec command specifying one MPI process (master) and (optional but recommended) the desired MPI universe  size,  which  determines  the
       number  of  additional  dynamically  spawned processes (workers). The MPI universe size is provided either by a batch system or set by the user via command-line arguments to mpiexec or environment
       variables. Below we provide examples for MPICH and Open MPI implementations [1]. In all of these examples, the mpiexec command launches a single master process running the Python  interpreter  and
       executing  the  main  script.  When required, mpi4py.futures spawns the pool of 16 worker processes. The master submits tasks to the workers and waits for the results. The workers receive incoming
       tasks, execute them, and send back the results to the master.

       When using MPICH implementation or its derivatives based on the Hydra process manager, users can set the MPI universe size via the -usize argument to mpiexec:

          $ mpiexec -n 1 -usize 17 python julia.py

       or, alternatively, by setting the MPIEXEC_UNIVERSE_SIZE environment variable:

          $ env MPIEXEC_UNIVERSE_SIZE=17 mpiexec -n 1 python julia.py

       In the Open MPI implementation, the MPI universe size can be set via the -host argument to mpiexec:

          $ mpiexec -n 1 -host localhost:17 python julia.py

       Another way to specify the number of workers is to use the mpi4py.futures-specific environment variable MPI4PY_FUTURES_MAX_WORKERS:

          $ env MPI4PY_FUTURES_MAX_WORKERS=16 mpiexec -n 1 python julia.py

       Note that in this case, the MPI universe size is ignored.

       Alternatively, users may decide to execute the script in a more traditional way, that is, all the MPI processes are started  at  once.  The  user  script  is  run  under  command-line  control  of
       mpi4py.futures passing the -m flag to the python executable:

          $ mpiexec -n 17 python -m mpi4py.futures julia.py

       As explained previously, the 17 processes are partitioned in one master and 16 workers. The master process executes the main script while the workers execute the tasks submitted by the master.

       [1]  When using an MPI implementation other than MPICH or Open MPI, please check the documentation of the implementation and/or batch system for the ways to specify the desired MPI universe size.

   Computing Pi (parallel task)
       The number \pi can be approximated via numerical integration with the simple midpoint rule, that is:

                                                                                 \pi = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{4}{1+x^2} \,dx \approx
       \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{4}{1 + \left[\frac{1}{n} \left(i-\frac{1}{2}\right) \right]^2} .

       The  following  cpi.py script computes such approximations using mpi4py.futures with a parallel task involving a collective reduction operation. Highlighted lines correspond to the rules discussed
       in Parallel tasks.

                  # Submit exactly one callable per worker
                  P = executor.num_workers
                  fs = [executor.submit(compute_pi, n) for _ in range(P)]

                  # Wait for all workers to finish
                  wait(fs)

                  # Get result from the first future object.
                  # In this particular example, due to using reduce-to-all,
                  # all the other future objects hold the same result value.
                  pi = fs[0].result()
                  print(
                      f"pi: {pi:.16f}, error: {abs(pi - math.pi):.3e}",

   mpi4py.util.pkl5
       Added in version 3.1.0.

       pickle protocol 5 (see PEP 574) introduced support for out-of-band buffers, allowing for more efficient handling of certain object types with large memory footprints.

       MPI  for Python uses the traditional in-band handling of buffers. This approach is appropriate for communicating non-buffer Python objects, or buffer-like objects with small memory footprints. For
       point-to-point communication, in-band buffer handling allows for the communication of a pickled stream with a single MPI message, at the expense of additional CPU and memory overhead in the  pick‐
       ling and unpickling steps.

       The  mpi4py.util.pkl5  module  provides  communicator  wrapper classes reimplementing pickle-based point-to-point and collective communication methods using pickle protocol 5. Handling out-of-band
       buffers necessarily involves multiple MPI messages, thus increasing latency and hurting performance in case of small size data. However, in case of  large  size  data,  the  zero-copy  savings  of
       out-of-band buffer handling more than offset the extra latency costs.  Additionally, these wrapper methods overcome the infamous 2 GiB message count limit (MPI-1 to MPI-3).

   mpi4py.util.pool
       Added in version 4.0.0.

       SEE ALSO:
          This  module  intends  to  be a drop-in replacement for the multiprocessing.pool interface from the Python standard library.  The Pool class exposed here is implemented as a thin wrapper around
          MPIPoolExecutor.

       NOTE:
          The mpi4py.futures package offers a higher level interface for asynchronously pushing tasks to MPI worker process, allowing for a clear separation between submitting tasks and waiting  for  the
          results.

   mpi4py.util.sync
       Added in version 4.0.0.

       The mpi4py.util.sync module provides parallel synchronization utilities.

   Sequential execution
       class mpi4py.util.sync.Sequential
              Sequential execution.

              Context manager for sequential execution within a group of MPI processes.

              The implementation is based in MPI-1 point-to-point communication. A process with rank i waits in a blocking receive until the previous process rank i-1 finish  executing  and  signals  the
              next rank i with a send.

              __init__(comm, tag=0)
                     Initialize sequential execution.

                     Parameters

                            • comm (Intracomm) – Intracommunicator context.

                            • tag (int) – Tag for point-to-point communication.

                            exc (object)

                     Return type
                            None

                     Return type
                            None

              end()  End sequential execution.

                     Return type
                            None

       class mpi4py.util.sync.Counter
              Global counter.

              Produce consecutive values within a group of MPI processes. The counter interface is close to that of itertools.count.

              The implementation is based in MPI-3 one-sided operations. A root process (typically rank 0) holds the counter, and its value is queried and incremented with an atomic RMA fetch-and-add op‐
              eration.

              __init__(start=0, step=1, *, typecode='i', comm=COMM_SELF, info=INFO_NULL, root=0)
                     Initialize global counter.

                     Parameters

                            • start (int) – Start value.

                            • step (int) – Increment value.

                            • typecode (str) – Type code as defined in the array module.

                            • info (Info) – Info object for RMA context creation.

                            • root (int) – Process rank holding the counter memory.

                     Return type
                            None

                     Return type
                            int

              next(incr=None)
                     Return current value and increment.

                     Parameters

              free() Free counter resources.

                     Return type
                            None

   Mutual exclusion
       class mpi4py.util.sync.Mutex
              Mutual exclusion.

              Establish a critical section or mutual exclusion among MPI processes.

              The  mutex interface is close to that of threading.Lock and threading.RLock, allowing the use of either recursive or non-recursive mutual exclusion. However, a mutex should be used within a
              group of MPI processes, not threads.

              In non-recursive mode, the semantics of Mutex are somewhat different than these of threading.Lock:

              • Once acquired, a mutex is held and owned by a process until released.

              • Trying to acquire a mutex already held raises RuntimeError.

              • Trying to release a mutex not yet held raises RuntimeError.

              This mutex implementation uses the scalable and fair spinlock algorithm from [mcs-paper] and took inspiration from the MPI-3 RMA implementation of [uam-book].

              __init__(*, recursive=False, comm=COMM_SELF, info=INFO_NULL)
                     Initialize mutex object.

                     Parameters

                            • comm (Intracomm) – Intracommunicator context.

                            • recursive (bool) – Whether to allow recursive acquisition.

                            • info (Info) – Info object for RMA context creation.

                     Return type
                            None

                     Returns
                            True if the mutex is held, False otherwise.

   Condition variable
       class mpi4py.util.sync.Condition
              Condition variable.

              A condition variable allows one or more MPI processes to wait until they are notified by another processes.

              The condition variable interface is close to that of threading.Condition, allowing the use of either recursive or non-recursive mutual exclusion.  However, the condition variable should  be
              used within a group of MPI processes, not threads.

              This condition variable implementation uses a MPI-3 RMA-based scalable and fair circular queue algorithm to track the set of waiting processes.

              __init__(mutex=None, *, recursive=True, comm=COMM_SELF, info=INFO_NULL)
                     Initialize condition variable.

   Semaphore object
       class mpi4py.util.sync.Semaphore
              Semaphore object.

              A  semaphore  object  manages  an internal counter which is decremented by each acquire() call and incremented by each release() call. The internal counter never reaches a value below zero;
              when acquire() finds that it is zero, it blocks and waits until some other process calls release().

              The semaphore interface is close to that of threading.Semaphore and threading.BoundedSemaphore, allowing the use of either bounded (default) or unbounded semaphores. With  a  bounded  sema‐
              phore, the internal counter never exceeds its initial value; otherwise release() raises ValueError.

              This semaphore implementation uses a global Counter and a Condition variable to handle waiting and and notification.

              __init__(value=1, *, bounded=True, comm=COMM_SELF, info=INFO_NULL)
                     Initialize semaphore object.

                     Parameters

                            • value (int) – Initial value for internal counter.

                            • bounded (bool) – Bound internal counter to initial value.

                            • comm (Intracomm) – Intracommunicator context.

                            • info (Info) – Info object for RMA context creation.

                     Return type
                            None

              __enter__()
                     Acquire semaphore.

                     Return type
                            Self

              __exit__(*exc)
                     Release semaphore.

              acquire(blocking=True)
                     Acquire semaphore, decrementing the internal counter by one.

                     Parameters
                            blocking (bool) – If True, block until the semaphore is acquired.

                     Returns
                            True if the semaphore is acquired, False otherwise.

                     Return type
                            bool

              release(n=1)
                     Release semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one or more.

                     Parameters
                            n (int) – Increment for the internal counter.

                     Return type
                            None

   Examples
       test-sync-1.py

          from mpi4py import MPI
          from mpi4py.util.sync import Counter, Sequential

          comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD

          counter = Counter(comm)
          with Sequential(comm):
             value = next(counter)
          counter.free()

          assert comm.rank == value

       test-sync-2.py

          from mpi4py import MPI
          from mpi4py.util.sync import Counter, Mutex

          comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD

          mutex = Mutex(comm)
          counter = Counter(comm)
          with mutex:
             value = next(counter)
          counter.free()
          mutex.free()

          assert (
             list(range(comm.size)) ==
             sorted(comm.allgather(value))
          )

MPI4PY.RUN
       Added in version 3.0.0.

       At import time, mpi4py initializes the MPI execution environment calling MPI_Init_thread() and installs an exit hook to automatically call MPI_Finalize() just before the Python process terminates.
       Additionally,  mpi4py  overrides  the default ERRORS_ARE_FATAL error handler in favor of ERRORS_RETURN, which allows translating MPI errors in Python exceptions. These departures from standard MPI
       behavior may be controversial, but are quite convenient within the highly dynamic Python programming environment. Third-party code using mpi4py can just from mpi4py  import  MPI  and  perform  MPI
       calls  without the tedious initialization/finalization handling.  MPI errors, once translated automatically to Python exceptions, can be dealt with the common try…except…finally clauses; unhandled
       MPI exceptions will print a traceback which helps in locating problems in source code.

       Unfortunately, the interplay of automatic MPI finalization and unhandled exceptions may lead to deadlocks. In unattended runs, these deadlocks will drain the battery of your laptop, or  burn  pre‐
       cious allocation hours in your supercomputing facility.

   Exceptions and deadlocks
       Consider the following snippet of Python code. Assume this code is stored in a standard Python script file and run with mpiexec in two or more processes.

       deadlock.py

          from mpi4py import MPI
          assert MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size() > 1
          rank = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()
          if rank == 0:
              1/0
              MPI.COMM_WORLD.send(None, dest=1, tag=42)
          elif rank == 1:
              MPI.COMM_WORLD.recv(source=0, tag=42)

       Process  0  raises  ZeroDivisionError  exception  before performing a send call to process 1. As the exception is not handled, the Python interpreter running in process 0 will proceed to exit with
       non-zero status. However, as mpi4py installed a finalizer hook to call MPI_Finalize() before exit, process 0 will block waiting for other processes to also enter  the  MPI_Finalize()  call.  Mean‐
       while, process 1 will block waiting for a message to arrive from process 0, thus never reaching to MPI_Finalize(). The whole MPI execution environment is irremediably in a deadlock state.

       To  alleviate  this  issue, mpi4py offers a simple, alternative command line execution mechanism based on using the -m flag and implemented with the runpy module. To use this features, Python code
       should be run passing -m mpi4py in the command line invoking the Python interpreter. In case of unhandled exceptions, the finalizer hook will call MPI_Abort() on the  MPI_COMM_WORLD  communicator,
       thus effectively aborting the MPI execution environment.

       WARNING:
          When  a  process  is forced to abort, resources (e.g. open files) are not cleaned-up and any registered finalizers (either with the atexit module, the Python C/API function Py_AtExit(), or even
          the C standard library function atexit()) will not be executed. Thus, aborting execution is an extremely impolite way of ensuring process termination. However, MPI provides no  other  mechanism
          to recover from a deadlock state.

   Command line
       The use of -m mpi4py to execute Python code on the command line resembles that of the Python interpreter.

       • mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py pyfile [arg] ...

       • mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py -m mod [arg] ...

       • mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py -c cmd [arg] ...

       • mpiexec -n numprocs python -m mpi4py - [arg] ...

       <pyfile>
              Execute  the  Python  code  contained  in  pyfile,  which  must  be a filesystem path referring to either a Python file, a directory containing a __main__.py file, or a zipfile containing a
              __main__.py file.

       -m <mod>
              Search sys.path for the named module mod and execute its contents.

       -c <cmd>
              Execute the Python code in the cmd string command.

INSTALLATION
   Wheel packages
       The mpi4py project builds and publishes binary wheels able to run in a variety of:

       • operating systems: Linux, macOS, Windows;

       • processor architectures: AMD64, ARM64;

       • MPI implementations: MPICH, Open MPI, MVAPICH, Intel MPI, HPE Cray MPICH, Microsoft MPI;

       • Python implementations: CPython, PyPy.

       These mpi4py wheels are distributed via the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be installed with Python package managers like pip:

          python -m pip install mpi4py

       The mpi4py wheels can be installed in standard Python virtual environments. The MPI runtime can be provided by other wheels installed in the same virtual environment.

       TIP:
          Intel publishes production-grade Intel MPI wheels for Linux (x86_64) and Windows (AMD64).  mpi4py and MPI wheels can be installed side by side to get a ready-to-use Python+MPI environment:

              python -m pip install mpi4py impi-rt

       TIP:
          The  mpi4py  project  publishes  MPICH wheels and Open MPI wheels for Linux (x86_64/aarch64) and macOS (arm64/x86_64).  mpi4py and MPI wheels can be installed side by side to get a ready-to-use
          Python+MPI environment:

              python -m pip install mpi4py mpich    # for MPICH
              python -m pip install mpi4py openmpi  # for Open MPI

          WARNING:
              The MPI wheels are distributed with special focus on ease of use, convenience, compatibility, and interoperability. The Linux wheels are built in somewhat constrained environments with rel‐
              atively dated Linux distributions (manylinux container images). Therefore, they may lack support for features like GPU awareness (CUDA/ROCm) and C++/Fortran bindings. In production  scenar‐
              ios, it is recommended to use external (either custom-built or system-provided) MPI installations.

       The  mpi4py  wheels can also be installed (with pip) in conda environments and they should work out of the box, without any special tweak to environment variables, for any of the MPI packages pro‐
       vided by conda-forge.

       Externally-provided MPI implementations may come from a system package manager, sysadmin-maintained builds accessible via module files, or customized user builds. Such usage is supported  and  en‐
       couraged.  However, there are a few platform-specific considerations to take into account.

   Linux
       The Linux (x86_64/aarch64) wheels require one of

       • MPICH or any other ABI-compatible derivative, like MVAPICH, Intel MPI, HPE Cray MPICH

       • Open MPI or any other ABI-compatible derivative, like NVIDIA HPC-X

       Users may need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable such that the dynamic linker is able to find at runtime the MPI shared library file (libmpi.so.*).

   Fedora/RHEL
       On  Fedora/RHEL  systems, both MPICH and Open MPI are available for installation. There is no default or preferred MPI implementation.  Instead, users must select their favorite MPI implementation
       by loading the proper MPI module.

          module load mpi/mpich-$(arch)    # for MPICH
          module load mpi/openmpi-$(arch)  # for Open MPI

       After loading the requested MPI module, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable should be properly setup.

   Debian/Ubuntu
       On Debian/Ubuntu systems, Open MPI is the default MPI implementation and most of the MPI-based applications and libraries provided by the distribution depend on Open  MPI.  Nonetheless,  MPICH  is
       also available to users for installation.

       In Ubuntu 22.04 and older, due to legacy reasons, the MPICH ABI is slightly broken: the MPI shared library file is named libmpich.so.12 instead of libmpi.so.12 as required by the MPICH ABI Compat‐
       ibility Initiative.

       Users without sudo access can workaround this issue creating a symbolic link anywhere in their home directory and appending to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

          mkdir -p ~/.local/lib
          libdir=/usr/lib/$(arch)-linux-gnu
          ln -s $libdir/libmpich.so.12 ~/.local/lib/libmpi.so.12
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.local/lib

       A system-wide fix for all users requires sudo access:

          libdir=/usr/lib/$(arch)-linux-gnu
          sudo ln -sr $libdir/libmpi{ch,}.so.12

   HPE Cray OS
       On HPE Cray systems, users must load the cray-mpich-abi module.  For further details, refer to man intro_mpi.

   macOS
       The macOS (arm64/x86_64) wheels require

       • MPICH or Open MPI installed (either manually or via a package manager) in the standard system prefix /usr/local

       • MPICH or Open MPI installed via Homebrew in the default prefix /opt/homebrew

       • MPICH or Open MPI installed via MacPorts in the default prefix /opt/local

   Windows
       The Windows (AMD64) wheels require one of

       • Intel MPI

       • Microsoft MPI

       User may need to set the I_MPI_ROOT or MSMPI_BIN environment variables such that the MPI dynamic link library (DLL) (impi.dll or msmpi.dll) can be found at runtime.

       Intel  MPI  is  under active development and supports recent versions of the MPI standard. Intel MPI can be installed with pip (see the impi-rt package on PyPI), being therefore straightforward to
       get it up and running within a Python environment. Intel MPI can also be installed system-wide as part of the Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit for Windows or via standalone online/offline installers.

   Conda packages
       The conda-forge community provides ready-to-use binary packages from an ever growing collection of software libraries built around the multi-platform conda package manager.  Four  MPI  implementa‐
       tions  are available on conda-forge: Open MPI (Linux and macOS), MPICH (Linux and macOS), Intel MPI (Linux and Windows), and Microsoft MPI (Windows).  You can install mpi4py and your preferred MPI
       implementation using the conda package manager:

       • to use MPICH do:

            conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py mpich

       • to use Open MPI do:

            conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py openmpi

       • to use Intel MPI do:

            conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py impi_rt

       • to use Microsoft MPI do:

            conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py msmpi

       MPICH and many of its derivatives are ABI-compatible. You can provide the package specification mpich=X.Y.*=external_* (where X and Y are the major and minor version numbers) to request the  conda
       package manager to use system-provided MPICH (or derivative) libraries. Similarly, you can provide the package specification openmpi=X.Y.*=external_* to use system-provided Open MPI libraries.

       The  openmpi  package on conda-forge has built-in CUDA support, but it is disabled by default. To enable it, follow the instruction outlined during conda install. Additionally, UCX support is also
       available once the ucx package is installed.

       WARNING:
          The MPI conda-forge packages are built with special focus on compatibility. The MPICH and Open MPI packages are built in a constrained environment with relatively dated  OS  images.  Therefore,
          they may lack support for high-performance features like cross-memory attach (XPMEM/CMA). In production scenarios, it is recommended to use external (either custom-built or system-provided) MPI
          installations. See the relevant conda-forge documentation about using external MPI libraries .

   System packages
       mpi4py is readily available through system package managers of most Linux distributions and the most popular community package managers for macOS.

   Linux
       On Fedora Linux systems (as well as RHEL and their derivatives using the EPEL software repository), you can install binary packages with the system package manager:

       • using dnf and the mpich package:

            sudo dnf install python3-mpi4py-mpich

       • using dnf and the openmpi package:

            sudo dnf install python3-mpi4py-openmpi

       Please remember to load the correct MPI module for your chosen MPI implementation:

       • for the mpich package do:

            module load mpi/mpich-$(arch)
            python -c "from mpi4py import MPI"

       • for the openmpi package do:

            module load mpi/openmpi-$(arch)
            python -c "from mpi4py import MPI"

       On Ubuntu Linux and Debian Linux systems, binary packages are available for installation using the system package manager:

          sudo apt install python3-mpi4py

       On Arch Linux systems, binary packages are available for installation using the system package manager:

          sudo pacman -S python-mpi4py

   macOS
       macOS users can install mpi4py using the Homebrew package manager:

          brew install mpi4py

       Note that the Homebrew mpi4py package uses Open MPI. Alternatively, install the mpich package and next install mpi4py from sources using pip.

       Alternatively, mpi4py can be installed from MacPorts:

          sudo port install py-mpi4py

   Building from sources
       Installing  mpi4py  from pre-built binary wheels, conda packages, or system packages is not always desired or appropriate. For example, the mpi4py wheels published on PyPI may not be interoperable
       with non-mainstream, vendor-specific MPI implementations; or a system mpi4py package may be built with a alternative, non-default MPI implementation. In such scenarios, mpi4py  can  still  be  in‐
       stalled from its source distribution (sdist) using pip:

          python -m pip install --no-binary=mpi4py mpi4py

       You can also install the in-development version with:

          python -m pip install git+https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py

       or:

          python -m pip install https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py/tarball/master

       NOTE:
          Installing  mpi4py  from  its source distribution (available on PyPI) or Git source code repository (available on GitHub) requires a C compiler and a working MPI implementation with development
          headers and libraries.

       WARNING:
          pip keeps previously built wheel files in its cache for future reuse. If you want to reinstall the mpi4py package from its source distribution using a different or updated  MPI  implementation,
          you have to either first remove the cached wheel file:

              python -m pip cache remove mpi4py
              python -m pip install --no-binary=mpi4py mpi4py

          or ask pip to disable the cache:

              python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --no-binary=mpi4py mpi4py

   Build backends
       mpi4py  supports  three  different  build  backends:  setuptools  (default),  scikit-build-core  (CMake-based),  and  meson-python  (Meson-based).  The build backend can be selected by setting the
       MPI4PY_BUILD_BACKEND environment variable.

       MPI4PY_BUILD_BACKEND

              Choices
                     "setuptools", "scikit-build-core", "meson-python"

              Default
                     "setuptools"

              Request a build backend for building mpi4py from sources.

   Using setuptools
       TIP:
          Set the MPI4PY_BUILD_BACKEND environment variable to "setuptools" to use the setuptools build backend.

       When using the default setuptools build backend, mpi4py relies on the legacy Python distutils framework to build C extension modules.  The following environment variables affect the build configu‐
       ration.

       MPI4PY_BUILD_MPICC
              The mpicc compiler wrapper command is searched for in the executable search path (PATH environment variable) and used to compile the mpi4py.MPI C extension module.  Alternatively,  use  the
              MPI4PY_BUILD_MPICC environment variable to the full path or command corresponding to the MPI-aware C compiler.

       MPI4PY_BUILD_MPILD
              The  mpicc  compiler  wrapper command is also used for linking the mpi4py.MPI C extension module.  Alternatively, use the MPI4PY_BUILD_MPILD environment variable to specify the full path or
              command corresponding to the MPI-aware C linker.

       MPI4PY_BUILD_MPICFG
              If the MPI implementation does not provide a compiler wrapper, or it is not installed in a default system location, all relevant build information like include/library locations and library
              lists can be provided in an ini-style configuration file under a [mpi] section. mpi4py can then be asked to use the custom build information by setting the  MPI4PY_BUILD_MPICFG  environment
              variable to the full path of the configuration file. As an example, see the mpi.cfg file located in the top level mpi4py source directory.

       MPI4PY_BUILD_CONFIGURE
              Some  vendor MPI implementations may not provide complete coverage of the MPI standard, or may provide partial features of newer MPI standard versions while advertising support for an older
              version.  Setting the MPI4PY_BUILD_CONFIGURE environment variable to a non-empty string will trigger the run of exhaustive checks for the availability of all MPI constants, predefined  han‐
              dles, and routines.

       MPI4PY_BUILD_MPIABI
              Setting  the  MPI4PY_BUILD_MPIABI environment variable to "1" enables enhanced support for the MPI 5.0 standard ABI and the MPICH or Open MPI legacy ABIs. The mpi4py.MPI extension module is
              then able to dynamically link at runtime with older versions (down to the MPI 3.0 standard) of the corresponding MPI implementation used at compile time. This feature is only  available  on
              Linux, macOS, and Windows. POSIX-like systems other than Linux and macOS are not currently supported, although they could easily be: all what is needed is for the platform to either support
              weak symbols in shared modules/libraries, or support the standard POSIX dlopen()/dlsym() APIs.

       MPI4PY_BUILD_PYSABI
              Build  with  the CPython 3.10+ Stable ABI.  Setting the MPI4PY_BUILD_PYSABI environment variable to a string "{major}.{minor}" defines the Py_LIMITED_API value to use for building extension
              modules.

       The following environment variables are aliases for the ones described above. Having shorter names, they are convenient for occasional use in the command line. Its usage is not recommended in  au‐
       tomation scenarios like packaging recipes, deployment scripts, and container image creation.

       MPICC  Convenience alias for MPI4PY_BUILD_MPICC.

       MPILD  Convenience alias for MPI4PY_BUILD_MPILD.

       MPICFG Convenience alias for MPI4PY_BUILD_MPICFG.

   Using scikit-build-core
       TIP:
          Set the MPI4PY_BUILD_BACKEND environment variable to "scikit-build-core" to use the scikit-build-core build backend.

       When  using the scikit-build-core build backend, mpi4py delegates all of MPI build configuration to CMake’s FindMPI module. Besides the obvious advantage of cross-platform support, this delegation
       to CMake may be convenient in build environments exposing vendor software stacks via intricate module systems. Note however that mpi4py will not be able to look for MPI routines  available  beyond
       the  MPI  standard  version  the MPI implementation advertises to support (via the MPI_VERSION and MPI_SUBVERSION macro constants in the mpi.h header file), any missing MPI constant or symbol will
       prevent a successful build.

   Using meson-python
       TIP:
          Set the MPI4PY_BUILD_BACKEND environment variable to "meson-python" to use the meson-python build backend.

       When using the meson-python build backend, mpi4py delegates build tasks to the Meson build system.

       WARNING:
          mpi4py support for the meson-python build backend is experimental. For the time being, users must set the CC environment variable to the command or path corresponding to the  mpicc  C  compiler
          wrapper.

DEVELOPMENT
   Prerequisites
       You need to have the following software properly installed to develop MPI for Python:

       • Python 3.8 or above.

       • The Cython compiler.

       • A working MPI implementation like MPICH or Open MPI, preferably supporting MPI-4 and built with shared/dynamic libraries.

       Optionally, consider installing the following packages:

       • NumPy for enabling comprehensive testing of MPI communication.

       • CuPy for enabling comprehensive testing with a GPU-aware MPI.

       • Sphinx to build the documentation.

       TIP:
          Most  routine development tasks like building, installing in editable mode, testing, and generating documentation can be performed with the spin developer tool. Run spin at the top level source
          directory for a list of available subcommands.

   Building
       MPI for Python uses setuptools-based build system that relies on the setup.py file. Some setuptools commands (e.g., build) accept additional options:

       --mpi= Lets you pass a section with MPI configuration within a special configuration file. Alternatively, you can use the MPICFG environment variable.

       --mpicc=
              Specify the path or name of the mpicc C compiler wrapper.  Alternatively, use the MPICC environment variable.

       --mpild=
              Specify the full path or name for the MPI-aware C linker.  Alternatively, use the MPILD environment variable. If not set, the mpicc C compiler wrapper is used for linking.

       --configure
              Runs exhaustive tests for checking about missing MPI types, constants, and functions. This option should be passed in order to build MPI for Python against old MPI-1, MPI-2, or MPI-3 imple‐
              mentations, possibly providing a subset of MPI-4.

       If you use a MPI implementation providing a mpicc C compiler wrapper (e.g., MPICH or Open MPI), it will be used for compilation and linking. This is the preferred and easiest way to build MPI  for
       Python.

       If mpicc is found in the executable search path (PATH environment variable), simply run the build command:

          $ python setup.py build

       If  mpicc  is  not in your search path or the compiler wrapper has a different name, you can run the build command specifying its location, either via the --mpicc command option or using the MPICC
       environment variable:

          $ python setup.py build --mpicc=/path/to/mpicc
          $ env MPICC=/path/to/mpicc python setup.py build

       Alternatively, you can provide all the relevant information about your MPI implementation by editing the mpi.cfg file located in the top level source directory. You can  use  the  default  section
       [mpi] or add a new custom section, for example [vendor_mpi] (see the examples provided in the mpi.cfg file as a starting point to write your own section):

          [mpi]
          include_dirs         = /usr/local/mpi/include
          libraries            = mpi
          library_dirs         = /usr/local/mpi/lib
          runtime_library_dirs = /usr/local/mpi/lib

          [vendor_mpi]
          include_dirs         = /opt/mpi/include ...
          libraries            = mpi ...
          library_dirs         = /opt/mpi/lib ...
          runtime_library_dirs = /opt/mpi/lib ...

          ...

       and then run the build command specifying you custom configuration section:

          $ python setup.py build --mpi=vendor_mpi
          $ env MPICFG=vendor_mpi python setup.py build

   Installing
       MPI for Python can be installed in editable mode:

          $ python -m pip install --editable .

       After modifying Cython sources, an in-place rebuild is needed:

          $ python setup.py build --inplace

   Testing
       To quickly test the installation:

          $ mpiexec -n 5 python -m mpi4py.bench helloworld
          Hello, World! I am process 0 of 5 on localhost.
          Hello, World! I am process 1 of 5 on localhost.
          Hello, World! I am process 2 of 5 on localhost.
          Hello, World! I am process 3 of 5 on localhost.
          Hello, World! I am process 4 of 5 on localhost.

          $ mpiexec -n 5 python -m mpi4py.bench ringtest -l 10 -n 1048576
          time for 10 loops = 0.00361614 seconds (5 processes, 1048576 bytes)

       If you installed from a git clone or the source distribution, issuing at the command line:

          $ mpiexec -n 5 python demo/helloworld.py

       will launch a five-process run of the Python interpreter and run the demo script demo/helloworld.py from the source distribution.

       You can also run all the unittest scripts:

          $ mpiexec -n 5 python test/main.py

       or, if you have the pytest unit testing framework installed:

          $ mpiexec -n 5 pytest

GUIDELINES
   Fair play
   Summary
       This section defines Rules of Play for companies and outside developers that engage with the mpi4py project. It covers:

       • Restrictions on use of the mpi4py name.

       • How and whether to publish a modified distribution.

       • How to make us aware of patched versions.

       After  reading  this section, companies and developers will know what kinds of behavior the mpi4py developers and contributors would like to see, and which we consider troublesome, bothersome, and
       unacceptable.

       This document is a close adaptation of NumPy NEP 36.

   Motivation
       Occasionally, we learn of modified mpi4py versions and binary distributions circulated by outsiders. These patched versions can cause problems to mpi4py users (see, e.g., mpi4py/mpi4py#508).  When
       issues like these arise, our developers waste time identifying the problematic release, locating alterations, and determining an appropriate course of action.

       In  addition, packages on the Python Packaging Index are sometimes named such that users assume they are sanctioned or maintained by the mpi4py developers. We wish to reduce the number of such in‐
       cidents.

   Scope
       This document aims to define a minimal set of rules that, when followed, will be considered good-faith efforts in line with the expectations of the mpi4py developers and contributors.

       Our hope is that companies and outside developers who feel they need to modify mpi4py will first consider contributing to the project, or use alternative  mechanisms  for  patching  and  extending
       mpi4py.

       When in doubt, please talk to us first. We may suggest an alternative; at minimum, we’ll be informed and we may even grant an exception if deemed appropriate.

   Fair play rules
       1. Do not reuse the mpi4py name for projects not affiliated with the mpi4py project.

          At  time  of  writing,  there  are  only a handful of mpi4py-named packages developed by the mpi4py project, including mpi4py and mpi4py-fft. We ask that outside packages not include the phrase
          mpi4py, i.e., avoid names such as mycompany-mpi4py or mpi4py-mycompany.

          To be clear, this rule only applies to modules (package names); it is perfectly acceptable to have a submodule of your own package named mycompany.mpi4py.

       2. Do not publish binary mpi4py wheels on PyPI (https://pypi.org/).

          We ask companies and outside developers to not publish binary mpi4py wheels in the main Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/) under names such mpi4py-mpich,  mpi4py-openmpi,  or  mpi4py-ven‐
          dor_mpi.

          The  usual  approaches  to build binary Python wheels involve the embedding of dependent shared libraries. While such an approach may seem convenient and often is, in the particular case of MPI
          and mpi4py it is ultimately harmful to end users. Embedding the MPI shared libraries would prevent the use of external, system-provided MPI installations  with  hardware-specific  optimizations
          and site-specific tweaks.

          The MPI Forum is currently discussing the standardization of a proposal for an Application Binary Interface (ABI) for MPI, see [mpi-abi-paper] and [mpi-abi-issue]. Such standardization will al‐
          low  for  any binary dependent on the MPI library to be used with multiple MPI backends. Once this proposal becomes part of the MPI standard, the mpi4py project will consider publishing on PyPI
          binary wheels capable of using any backend MPI implementation supporting the new MPI ABI specification. In the mean time, mpi4py is currently distributing experimental  MPI  and  mpi4py  binary
          wheels on https://anaconda.org/mpi4py.

       3. Do not republish modified versions of mpi4py.

          Modified versions of mpi4py make it very difficult for the developers to address bug reports, since we typically do not know which parts of mpi4py have been modified.

          If you have to break this rule (and we implore you not to!), then make it clear in the __version__ tag that you have modified mpi4py, e.g.:

             >>> print(mpi4py.__version__)
             '4.0.0+mycompany.13`

          We understand that minor patches are often required to make a library work inside of a package ecosystem. This is totally acceptable, but we ask that no substantive changes are made.

       4. Do not extend or modify mpi4py’s API.

          If you absolutely have to break the previous rule, please do not add additional functions to the namespace, or modify the API of existing functions. Having additional functions exposed in  dis‐
          tributed versions is confusing for users and developers alike.

CHANGES
   Release 4.1.0 [2025-06-25]
       • New features:

         • Publish binary wheel packages on PyPI with support for multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows), processor architectures (AMD64, ARM64), MPI implementations  (MPICH,  Open  MPI,  and
           their ABI-compatible derivatives), and Python implementations (CPython, PyPy).

         • Add support for the MPI 5.0 standard.

           • MPI handle serialization with integral values.

           • Fixed-size Fortran LOGICAL datatypes.

           • Query ABI version/info and Fortran ABI info.

         • MPI.Datatype.Create_contiguous now uses BigMPI’s approach when using MPI implementations that do not yet support the MPI 4.0 large-count APIs.

         • Add support for MPI.FLOAT16_T and MPI.BFLOAT16_T datatypes.  These datatypes are not yet standard but available as extensions in MPI implementations.

         • Add MPI.Status.tomemory to expose the status contents as a memoryview object.

       • Enhancements:

         • Support (opt-in via MPI4PY_BUILD_PYSABI) for building with Py_LIMITED_API under Python 3.10+ (requires Cython 3.1+).

         • Support  (opt-in via MPI4PY_BUILD_MPIABI) for building with the MPI 5.0 standard ABI and the MPICH or Open MPI legacy ABIs. The MPI extension module will be able to dynamically link at runtime
           with older versions (down to the MPI 3.0 standard) of the MPI implementation used at compile time. Only available on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

         • Support a buffersize parameter in the MPIPoolExecutor.map() and MPIPoolExecutor.starmap() methods to limit the number of pending tasks.

         • Improve ownership management of DLPack capsules.

         • Reimplement MPI DLL search path on Windows.

         • Minor fixes to typing stubs and documentation.

       • Backward-incompatible changes:

         • Python 3.8+ is required.

         • The MPI.Exception class is now a heap type.

         • The types of the MPI.BOTTOM, MPI.IN_PLACE, and MPI.BUFFER_AUTOMATIC are no longer subclasses of int.

       • Minor fixes to typing support.

       • Minor fix to documentation.

   Release 4.0.1 [2024-10-11]
       • Update support for Python 3.13:

         • Enable Cython 3.1 support for free-threaded CPython.

         • Allow compiling Cython-generated C sources with the full Python C-API.

         • Fix MPI DLL path workarounds on Windows after changes to locals().

       • Enhancements to test suite:

         • Support XML reports via unittest-xml-reporting.

         • Add command line options to exclude tests by patterns and files.

         • Refactor Python 2 code to use Python 3 constructs using pyupgrade.

       • Miscellaneous:

         • Minor and mostly inconsequential subclass fix in mpi4py.util.pkl5.

         • Update compatibility workarounds for legacy MPICH 3.0 release.

   Release 4.0.0 [2024-07-28]
       • New features:

         • Add support for the MPI-4.0 standard.

           • Use large count MPI-4 routines.

           • Add persistent collective communication.

           • Add partitioned point-to-point communication.

           • Add new communicator constructors.

           • Add the Session class and its methods.

           • Support for removal of error classes/codes/strings.

           • Support for querying hardware resource information.

         • Add preliminary support for the upcoming MPI-5.0 standard.

           • User-level failure mitigation (ULFM).

         • mpi4py.util.pool: New drop-in replacement for multiprocessing.pool.

         • mpi4py.util.sync: New synchronization utilities.

         • Add runtime check for mismatch between mpiexec and MPI library.

         • Support scikit-build-core as an alternative build backend.

         • Support meson-python as an alternative build backend.

       • Enhancements:

         • mpi4py.futures: Support for parallel tasks.

         • mpi4py.futures: Report exception tracebacks in workers.

         • mpi4py.util.pkl5: Add support for collective communication.

         • Add methods Datatype.fromcode(), Datatype.tocode() and attributes Datatype.typestr, Datatype.typechar to simplify NumPy interoperability for simple cases.

         • Add methods Comm.Create_errhandler(), Win.Create_errhandler(), and File.Create_errhandler() to create custom error handlers.

         • Add support for pickle serialization of instances of MPI types.  All instances of Datatype, Info, and Status can be serialized. Instances of Op can be serialized only if created through mpi4py
           by calling Op.Create(). Instances of other MPI types can be serialized only if they reference predefined handles.

         • Add handle attribute and fromhandle() class method to MPI classes to ease interoperability with external code. The handle value is an unsigned integer  guaranteed  to  fit  on  the  platform’s
           uintptr_t C type.

         • Add  lowercase  free()  method  to MPI classes to ease MPI object deallocation and cleanup. This method eventually attempts to call Free(), but only if the object’s MPI handle is not a null or
           predefined handle, and such call is allowed within the World Model init/finalize.

       • Backward-incompatible changes:

         • Python 2 is no longer supported, Python 3.6+ is required, but typing stubs are supported for Python 3.8+.

         • The Intracomm.Create_group() method is no longer defined in the base Comm class.

         • Group.Compare() and Comm.Compare() are no longer class methods but instance methods. Existing codes using the former class methods are expected to continue working.

         • Group.Translate_ranks() is no longer a class method but an instance method. Existing codes using the former class method are expected to continue working.

         • The LB and UB datatypes are no longer available, use Datatype.Create_resized() instead.

         • The HOST predefined attribute key is no longer available.

         • The MPI.memory class has been renamed to MPI.buffer. The old name is still available as an alias to the new name.

         • The mpi4py.dl module is no longer available.

         • The mpi4py.get_config function returns an empty dictionary.

       • Miscellaneous:

         • The project is now licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license. This change is fairly inconsequential for users and distributors. It simply adds an  additional  clause  against  using  contributor
           names for promotional purposes without their consent.

         • Add a new guidelines section to documentation laying out new fair play rules. These rules ask companies and outside developers to refrain from reusing the mpi4py name in unaffiliated projects,
           publishing  binary mpi4py wheels on the main Python Package Index (PyPI), and distributing modified versions with incompatible or extended API changes. The primary motivation of these rules is
           to avoid fragmentation and end-user confusion.

         • mpi4py.run: Run Python code and abort execution in case of unhandled exceptions to prevent deadlocks.

         • mpi4py.bench: Run basic MPI benchmarks and tests.

       • Enhancements:

         • Lowercase, pickle-based collective communication calls are now thread-safe through the use of fine-grained locking.

         • The  MPI  module  now exposes a memory type which is a lightweight variant of the builtin memoryview type, but exposes both the legacy Python 2 and the modern Python 3 buffer interface under a
           Python 2 runtime.

         • The MPI.Comm.Alltoallw() method now uses count=1 and displ=0 as defaults, assuming that messages are specified through user-defined datatypes.

         • The Request.Wait[all]() methods now return True to match the interface of Request.Test[all]().

         • The Win class now implements the Python buffer interface.

       • Backward-incompatible changes:

         • The buf argument of the MPI.Comm.recv() method is deprecated, passing anything but None emits a warning.

         • The MPI.Win.memory property was removed, use the MPI.Win.tomemory() method instead.

         • Executing python -m mpi4py in the command line is now equivalent to python -m mpi4py.run. For the former behavior, use python -m mpi4py.bench.

         • Python 2.6 and 3.2 are no longer supported. The mpi4py.MPI module may still build and partially work, but other pure-Python modules under the mpi4py namespace will not.

         • Windows: Remove support for legacy MPICH2, Open MPI, and DeinoMPI.

   Release 2.0.0 [2015-10-18]
       • Support for MPI-3 features.

         • Matched probes and receives.

         • Nonblocking collectives.

         • Neighborhood collectives.

         • New communicator constructors.

         • Request-based RMA operations.

         • New RMA communication and synchronisation calls.

         • New window constructors.

         • New datatype constructor.

         • New C++ boolean and floating complex datatypes.

       • Support for MPI-2 features not included in previous releases.

         • Generalized All-to-All collective (Comm.Alltoallw())

         • User-defined data representations (Register_datarep())

       • New scalable implementation of reduction operations for Python objects. This code is based on binomial tree algorithms using point-to-point communication and duplicated communicator contexts. To
         disable this feature, use mpi4py.rc.fast_reduce = False.

       • Backward-incompatible changes:

         • Python 2.4, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.1 are no longer supported.

         • Default MPI error handling policies are overridden. After import, mpi4py sets the ERRORS_RETURN error handler in COMM_SELF and COMM_WORLD, as well as any new Comm, Win, or File  instance  cre‐
           ated  through mpi4py, thus effectively ignoring the MPI rules about error handler inheritance.  This way, MPI errors translate to Python exceptions.  To disable this behavior and use the stan‐
           dard MPI error handling rules, use mpi4py.rc.errors = 'default'.

         • Change signature of all send methods, dest is a required argument.

         • Change signature of all receive and probe methods, source defaults to ANY_SOURCE, tag defaults to ANY_TAG.

         • Change signature of send lowercase-spelling methods, obj arguments are not mandatory.

         • Change signature of recv lowercase-spelling methods, renamed ‘obj’ arguments to ‘buf’.

         • Change Request.Waitsome() and Request.Testsome() to return None or list.

         • Change signature of all lowercase-spelling collectives, sendobj arguments are now mandatory, recvobj arguments were removed.

         • Reduction operations MAXLOC and MINLOC are no longer special-cased in lowercase-spelling methods Comm.[all]reduce() and Comm.[ex]scan(), the input object must be specified as a tuple (obj, lo‐
           cation).

         • Change signature of name publishing functions.  The new signatures are Publish_name(service_name, port_name, info=INFO_NULL) and Unpublish_name(service_name, port_name, info=INFO_NULL)`.

         • Win instances now cache Python objects exposing memory by keeping references instead of using MPI attribute caching.

         • Change signature of Win.Lock().  The new signature is Win.Lock(rank, lock_type=LOCK_EXCLUSIVE, assertion=0).

         • Move Cartcomm.Map() to Intracomm.Cart_map().

         • Move Graphcomm.Map() to Intracomm.Graph_map().

         • Remove the mpi4py.MPE module.

         • Rename the Cython definition file for use with cimport statement from mpi_c.pxd to libmpi.pxd.

   Release 1.3.1 [2013-08-07]
       • Regenerate C wrappers with Cython 0.19.1 to support Python 3.3.

       • Install *.pxd files in <site-packages>/mpi4py to ease the support for Cython’s cimport statement in code requiring to access mpi4py internals.

       • As a side-effect of using Cython 0.19.1, ancient Python 2.3 is no longer supported. If you really need it, you can install an older Cython and run python setup.py build_src --force.

   Release 1.3 [2012-01-20]
       • Now Comm.recv() accept a buffer to receive the message.

       • Add Comm.irecv() and Request.{wait|test}[any|all]().

       • Add Intracomm.Spawn_multiple().

       • Better buffer handling for PEP 3118 and legacy buffer interfaces.

       • Add support for attribute attribute caching on communicators, datatypes and windows.

       • Install MPI-enabled Python interpreter as <path>/mpi4py/bin/python-mpi.

       • Windows: Support for building with Open MPI.

   Release 1.2.2 [2010-09-13]
       • Add mpi4py.get_config() to retrieve information (compiler wrappers, includes, libraries, etc) about the MPI implementation employed to build mpi4py.

       • Workaround Python libraries with missing GILState-related API calls in case of non-threaded Python builds.

       • Windows: look for MPICH2, DeinoMPI, Microsoft HPC Pack at their default install locations under %ProgramFiles.

       • MPE: fix hacks related to old API’s, these hacks are broken when MPE is built with a MPI implementations other than MPICH2.

       • HP-MPI: fix for missing Fortran datatypes, use dlopen() to load the MPI shared library before MPI_Init()

       • Many distutils-related fixes, cleanup, and enhancements, better logics to find MPI compiler wrappers.

       • Support for pip install mpi4py.

   Release 1.2.1 [2010-02-26]
       • Fix declaration in Cython include file. This declaration, while valid for Cython, broke the simple-minded parsing used in conf/mpidistutils.py to implement configure-tests  for  availability  of
         MPI symbols.

       • Update SWIG support and make it compatible with Python 3. Also generate an warning for SWIG < 1.3.28.

       • Fix distutils-related issues in Mac OS X. Now ARCHFLAGS environment variable is honored of all Python’s config/Makefile variables.

       • Fix issues with Open MPI < 1.4.2 related to error checking and MPI_XXX_NULL handles.

   Release 1.2 [2009-12-29]
       • Automatic MPI datatype discovery for NumPy arrays and PEP-3118 buffers. Now buffer-like objects can be messaged directly, it is no longer required to explicitly pass a 2/3-list/tuple like [data,
         MPI.DOUBLE],  or  [data,  count,  MPI.DOUBLE]. Only basic types are supported, i.e., all C/C99-native signed/unsigned integral types and single/double precision real/complex floating types. Many
         thanks to Eilif Muller for the initial feedback.

       • Nonblocking send of pickled Python objects. Many thanks to Andreas Kloeckner for the initial patch and enlightening discussion about this enhancement.

       • Request instances now hold a reference to the Python object exposing the buffer involved in point-to-point communication or parallel I/O. Many thanks to Andreas Kloeckner for the  initial  feed‐
         back.

       • Support for logging of user-defined states and events using MPE. Runtime (i.e., without requiring a recompile!)  activation of logging of all MPI calls is supported in POSIX platforms implement‐
         ing dlopen().

       • Support for all the new features in MPI-2.2 (new C99 and F90 datatypes, distributed graph topology, local reduction operation, and other minor enhancements).

       • Fix the annoying issues related to Open MPI and Python dynamic loading of extension modules in platforms supporting dlopen().

       • Fix SLURM dynamic loading issues on SiCortex. Many thanks to Ian Langmore for providing me shell access.

   Release 1.1.0 [2009-06-06]
       • Fix bug in Comm.Iprobe() that caused segfaults as Python C-API calls were issued with the GIL released (issue #2).

       • Add Comm.bsend() and Comm.ssend() for buffered and synchronous send semantics when communicating general Python objects.

       • Now  the  call  Info.Get(key)  return a single value (i.e, instead of a 2-tuple); this value is None if key is not in the Info object, or a string otherwise. Previously, the call redundantly re‐
         turned (None, False) for missing key-value pairs; None is enough to signal a missing entry.

       • Add support for parametrized Fortran datatypes.

       • Add support for decoding user-defined datatypes.

       • Add support for user-defined reduction operations on memory buffers. However, at most 16 user-defined reduction operations can be created. Ask the author for more room if you need it.

   Release 1.0.0 [2009-03-20]
       This is the fist release of the all-new, Cython-based, implementation of MPI for Python. Unfortunately, this implementation is not backward-compatible with the previous one. The list below  summa‐
       rizes the more important changes that can impact user codes.

       • Some  communication  calls  had  overloaded  functionality. Now there is a clear distinction between communication of general Python object with pickle, and (fast, near C-speed) communication of
         buffer-like objects (e.g., NumPy arrays).

         • for communicating general Python objects, you have to use all-lowercase methods, like send(), recv(), bcast(), etc.

         • for communicating array data, you have to use Send(), Recv(), Bcast(), etc. methods. Buffer arguments to these calls must be explicitly specified by using a 2/3-list/tuple like [data, MPI.DOU‐
           BLE], or [data, count, MPI.DOUBLE] (the former one uses the byte-size of data and the extent of the MPI datatype to define the count).

       • Indexing a communicator with an integer returned a special object associating the communication with  a  target  rank,  alleviating  you  from  specifying  source/destination/root  arguments  in
         point-to-point and collective communications. This functionality is no longer available, expressions like:

            MPI.COMM_WORLD[0].Send(...)
            MPI.COMM_WORLD[0].Recv(...)
            MPI.COMM_WORLD[0].Bcast(...)

         have to be replaced by:

            MPI.COMM_WORLD.Send(..., dest=0)
            MPI.COMM_WORLD.Recv(..., source=0)
            MPI.COMM_WORLD.Bcast(..., root=0)

       • Automatic  MPI initialization (i.e., at import time) requests the maximum level of MPI thread support (i.e., it is done by calling MPI_Init_thread() and passing MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE). In case you
         need to change this behavior, you can tweak the contents of the mpi4py.rc module.

       • In order to obtain the values of predefined attributes attached to the world communicator, now you have to use the Get_attr() method on the MPI.COMM_WORLD instance:

            tag_ub = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_attr(MPI.TAG_UB)

       • In the previous implementation, MPI.COMM_WORLD and MPI.COMM_SELF were associated to duplicates of the (C-level) MPI_COMM_WORLD and MPI_COMM_SELF predefined communicator handles. Now this  is  no
         longer the case, MPI.COMM_WORLD and MPI.COMM_SELF proxies the actual MPI_COMM_WORLD and MPI_COMM_SELF handles.

       • Convenience aliases MPI.WORLD and MPI.SELF were removed. Use instead MPI.COMM_WORLD and MPI.COMM_SELF.

       • Convenience constants MPI.WORLD_SIZE and MPI.WORLD_RANK were removed. Use instead MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size() and MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank().
