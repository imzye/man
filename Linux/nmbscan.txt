DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nmbscan command.

       nmbscan   scans   the  shares  of  a  SMB/NetBIOS  network,  using  the
       NMB/SMB/NetBIOS protocols. It is useful for acquiring information on  a
       local area network for such purposes as security auditing.

       It can obtain such information as NMB/SMB/NetBIOS/Windows host name, IP
       address, IP  host  name,  Ethernet  MAC  address,  Windows  user  name,
       NMB/SMB/NetBIOS/Windows domain name, and master browser.

       It  can  discover all the NMB/SMB/NetBIOS/Windows hosts on a local area
       network by using the hosts lists maintained by master browsers.
