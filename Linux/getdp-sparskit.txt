NAME
       GetDP - a General environment for the treatment of Discrete Problems

SYNOPSIS
       getdp-sparskit [file] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       GetDP  is  a  general finite element solver using mixed elements to discretize de Rham-type complexes in one, two and three dimensions. The main feature of GetDP is the closeness between the input
       data defining discrete problems (written by the user in ASCII data files) and the symbolic mathematical expressions of these problems.

       GetDP is a command-line program. See Gmsh for a graphical front-end.

       getdp-sparskit is GetDP version compiled with sparskit support.

WARNING
       This man page does not describe the syntax of the input files: you should refer to the info documentation for this (e.g. with info getdp). Up-to-date versions of the manual in various formats  are
       available at http://www.geuz.org/getdp/.
