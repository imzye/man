NAME
       RIG - Random Identity Generator

USAGE
       rig [ -f | -m ] [ -d datadir ] [ -c num ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rig  is  a  utility  that  will piece together a random first name, last name, street number and address, along with a geographically consistant (ie, they all match the same area) city, state, ZIP
       code, and area code.

       It is suitable for such applications as feeding the NY times registration page to fend off junk (snail) mail and telemarketers, or for registering on BBS's to which you don't wish to  reveal  your
       real information.

OPTIONS
       -f, -m Respectively, use female and male names. If neither or both options are selected, RIG uses both female and male names.

       -d datadir
              Use data files found in datadir. Without this option, the default directory of /usr/share/rig is assumed.

       -c num Output num identities. Default is 1.

FILES
       /usr/share/rig/locdata.idx
       /usr/share/rig/street.idx
       /usr/share/rig/fnames.idx
       /usr/share/rig/mnames.idx
       /usr/share/rig/lnames.idx

HISTORY
       Based on "fake" written for MS-DOS. Unfortunately the author and publish date are unknown.

       First UNIX version written from scratch in 1999.

       This manpage based on RIG version 1.10.

AUTHORS
       UNIX  version (c) 1999-2002 Ian Turner with contributions from Ian Prowell, Nick Rusnov, and Schneelocke.  Geography Database is from the original version and I believe it to be held in the public
       domain.  Names database is from the US Census at http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/ , courtesy of Trent Stanley.
