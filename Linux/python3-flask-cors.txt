NAME
       flask-cors - Flask-Cors Documentation

       A Flask extension for handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making cross-origin AJAX possible.

       This package has a simple philosophy: when you want to enable CORS, you wish to enable it for all use cases on a domain.  This means no mucking around with different allowed headers, methods,
       etc.

       By default, submission of cookies across domains is disabled due to the security implications.  Please see the documentation for how to enable credential'ed requests, and please make sure you
       add some sort of CSRF protection before doing so!

INSTALLATION
       Install the extension with using pip, or easy_install.

          $ pip install -U flask-cors

USAGE
       This  package  exposes  a  Flask  extension which by default enables CORS support on all routes, for all origins and methods.  It allows parameterization of all CORS headers on a per-resource
       level.  The package also contains a decorator, for those who prefer this approach.

   Simple Usage
       In the simplest case, initialize the Flask-Cors extension with default arguments in order to allow CORS for all domains on all routes.  See the full list of options in the documentation.

          from flask import Flask
          from flask_cors import CORS

          app = Flask(__name__)
          CORS(app)

          @app.route("/")
          def helloWorld():
            return "Hello, cross-origin-world!"

   Resource specific CORS
       Alternatively, you can specify CORS options on a resource and origin level of granularity by passing a dictionary as the resources option, mapping paths to a set of  options.   See  the  full
       list of options in the documentation.

          app = Flask(__name__)
          cors = CORS(app, resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": "*"}})

          @app.route("/api/v1/users")
          def list_users():
            return "user example"

   Route specific CORS via decorator
       This  extension also exposes a simple decorator to decorate flask routes with.  Simply add @cross_origin() below a call to Flask's @app.route(..) to allow CORS on a given route.  See the full
       list of options in the decorator documentation.

          @app.route("/")
          @cross_origin()
          def helloWorld():
            return "Hello, cross-origin-world!"

TROUBLESHOOTING
       If things aren't working as you expect, enable logging to help understand what is going on under the hood, and why.

          logging.getLogger('flask_cors').level = logging.DEBUG

TESTS
       A simple set of tests is included in test/.  To run, install nose, and simply invoke nosetests or python setup.py test to exercise the tests.

       If nosetests does not work for you, due to it no longer working with newer python versions.  You can use pytest to run the tests instead.

   Configuration
       Flask-CORS can be configured at four different locations.  Configuration values are determined in the following order:

          1. Resource level settings (e.g when passed as a dictionary)

          2. Keyword argument settings

          3. App level configuration settings (e.g. CORS_*)

          4. Default settings

       See below for more information.

   Configuration options
       Configuration options are consistently named across the various locations where they can be set.  A configuration option called example can be set with the resource dictionary key example, as
       the keyword argument example or as the Flask app configuration key CORS_EXAMPLE.

       The configuration options recognised by Flask-CORS are:

       CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS (List or str)
              Headers to accept from the client.  Headers in the Access-Control-Request-Headers request header (usually part of the preflight OPTIONS request) matching headers in this list  will  be
              included in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header.

       CORS_ALWAYS_SEND (bool)
              Usually, if a request doesn't include an Origin header, the client did not request CORS.  This means we can ignore this request.

              However, if this is true, a most-likely-to-be-correct value is still set.

       CORS_AUTOMATIC_OPTIONS (bool)
              Only applies to the flask_cors.cross_origin() decorator.  If True, Flask-CORS will override Flask’s default OPTIONS handling to return CORS headers for OPTIONS requests.

       CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS (List or str)
              The  CORS  spec  requires  the  server to give explicit permissions for the client to read headers in CORS responses (via the Access-Control-Expose-Headers header).  This specifies the
              headers to include in this header.

       CORS_INTERCEPT_EXCEPTIONS (bool)
              Whether to deal with Flask exception handlers or leave them alone (with respect to CORS headers).

       CORS_MAX_AGE (timedelta, int or str)
              The maximum time for which this CORS request may be cached.  This value is set as the Access-Control-Max-Age header.

       CORS_METHODS (List or str)
              The method(s) which the allowed origins are allowed to access.  These are included in the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response headers to the preflight OPTIONS requests.

       CORS_ORIGINS (List, str or re.Pattern)
              The origin(s) to allow requests from.  An origin configured here that matches the value of the Origin  header  in  a  preflight  OPTIONS  request  is  returned  as  the  value  of  the
              Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header.

       CORS_RESOURCES (Dict, List or str)
              The series of regular expression and (optionally) associated CORS options to be applied to the given resource path.

              If  the  value  is a dictionary, it's keys must be regular expressions matching resources, and the values must be another dictionary of configuration options, as described in this sec‐
              tion.

              If the argument is a list, it is expected to be a list of regular expressions matching resources for which the app-wide configured options are applied.

              If the argument is a string, it is expected to be a regular expression matching resources for which the app-wide configured options are applied.

       CORS_SEND_WILDCARD (bool)
              If CORS_ORIGINS is "*" and this is true, then the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header's value with be "*" as well, instead of the value of the Origin request header.

       CORS_SUPPORTS_CREDENTIALS (bool)
              Allows users to make authenticated requests.  If true, injects the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header in responses.  This allows cookies and credentials to be submitted across do‐
              mains.

              note   This option cannot be used in conjunction with a "*" origin

       CORS_VARY_HEADER: (bool)
              Enables or disables the injection of the Vary response header is set to Origin.  This informs clients that our CORS headers are dynamic and cannot be cached.

   Default values
       • CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS: "*"

       • CORS_ALWAYS_SEND: True

       • CORS_AUTOMATIC_OPTIONS: True

       • CORS_EXPOSE_HEADERS: None

       • CORS_INTERCEPT_EXCEPTIONS: True

       • CORS_MAX_AGE: None

       • CORS_METHODS: ["GET", "HEAD", "POST", "OPTIONS", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"]

       • CORS_ORIGINS: "*"

       • CORS_RESOURCES: r"/*"

       • CORS_SEND_WILDCARD: False

       • CORS_SUPPORTS_CREDENTIALS: False

       • CORS_VARY_HEADER: True

   Locations
   Resource level settings
       You can specify CORS options on a resource level of granularity by passing a dictionary as the resources keyword argument when  instantiating  the  flask_cors.CORS  object  (or  when  calling
       init_app on it), mapping paths to a set of options.

   Keyword argument settings
       For  options matching all resources, it's also possible to simply set the configuration options using keyword arguments when instantiating the flask_cors.CORS object (or when calling init_app
       on it).

   App level configuration settings
       It's good practice to keep your application configuration settings in one place.  This is also possible with Flask-CORS using the same configuration options in the Flask application's  config
       object.

   Default settings
       Finally, every setting has a default value as well.

   API Docs
       This  package  exposes  a  Flask  extension which by default enables CORS support on all routes, for all origins and methods.  It allows parameterization of all CORS headers on a per-resource
       level. The package also contains a decorator, for those who prefer this approach.

   Extension
       This is the suggested approach to enabling CORS.  The default configuration will work well for most use cases.

       class flask_cors.CORS(app=None, **kwargs)
              Initializes Cross Origin Resource sharing for the application. The arguments are identical to cross_origin(), with the addition of a resources parameter. The  resources  parameter  de‐
              fines  a  series  of regular expressions for resource paths to match and optionally, the associated options to be applied to the particular resource. These options are identical to the
              arguments to cross_origin().

              The settings for CORS are determined in the following order

              1. Resource level settings (e.g when passed as a dictionary)

              2. Keyword argument settings

              3. App level configuration settings (e.g. CORS_*)

              4. Default settings

              Note: as it is possible for multiple regular expressions to match a resource path, the regular expressions are first sorted by length, from longest to shortest, in order to attempt  to
              match the most specific regular expression. This allows the definition of a number of specific resource options, with a wildcard fallback for all other resources.

              Parameters

                     • resources (dict, iterable or string) --

                       The series of regular expression and (optionally) associated CORS options to be applied to the given resource path.

                       If the argument is a dictionary, it's keys must be regular expressions, and the values must be a dictionary of kwargs, identical to the kwargs of this function.

                       If the argument is a list, it is expected to be a list of regular expressions, for which the app-wide configured options are applied.

                       If the argument is a string, it is expected to be a regular expression for which the app-wide configured options are applied.

                       Default : Match all and apply app-level configuration

                     • origins (list, string or regex) --

                       The origin, or list of origins to allow requests from.  The origin(s) may be regular expressions, case-sensitive strings, or else an asterisk.

                       note   origins must include the schema and the port (if not port 80),

                       e.g., CORS(app, origins=["http://localhost:8000", "https://example.com"]).

                       Default : '*'

                     • methods (list or string) --

                       The method or list of methods which the allowed origins are allowed to access for non-simple requests.

                       Default : [GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE]

                     • expose_headers (list or string) --

                       The header or list which are safe to expose to the API of a CORS API specification.

                       Default : None

                     • allow_headers (list, string or regex) --

                       The header or list of header field names which can be used when this resource is accessed by allowed origins. The header(s) may be regular expressions, case-sensitive strings,
                       or else an asterisk.

                       Default : '*', allow all headers

                     • supports_credentials (bool) --

                       Allows  users  to  make  authenticated requests. If true, injects the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header in responses. This allows cookies and credentials to be submitted
                       across domains.

                       note   This option cannot be used in conjunction with a '*' origin

                       Default : False

                     • max_age (timedelta, integer, string or None) --

                       The maximum time for which this CORS request maybe cached. This value is set as the Access-Control-Max-Age header.

                       Default : None

                     • send_wildcard (bool) --

                       If True, and the origins parameter is *, a wildcard Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is sent, rather than the request's Origin header.

                       Default : False

                     • vary_header (bool) --

                       If True, the header Vary: Origin will be returned as per the W3 implementation guidelines.

                       Setting this header when the Access-Control-Allow-Origin is dynamically generated (e.g. when there is more than one allowed origin, and an Origin than '*' is returned) informs
                       CDNs and other caches that the CORS headers are dynamic, and cannot be cached.

                       If False, the Vary header will never be injected or altered.

                       Default : True

   Decorator
       If the CORS extension does not satisfy your needs, you may find the decorator useful.  It shares options with the extension, and should be simple to use.

       flask_cors.cross_origin(*args, **kwargs)
              This function is the decorator which is used to wrap a Flask route with.  In the simplest case, simply use the default parameters to allow all origins in what is  the  most  permissive
              configuration.  If this method modifies state or performs authentication which may be brute-forced, you should add some degree of protection, such as Cross Site Request Forgery protec‐
              tion.

              Parameters

                     • origins (list, string or regex) --

                       The origin, or list of origins to allow requests from.  The origin(s) may be regular expressions, case-sensitive strings, or else an asterisk

                       Default : '*'

                     • methods (list or string) --

                       The method or list of methods which the allowed origins are allowed to access for non-simple requests.

                     • expose_headers (list or string) --

                       The header or list which are safe to expose to the API of a CORS API specification.

                       Default : None

                     • allow_headers (list, string or regex) --

                       The header or list of header field names which can be used when this resource is accessed by allowed origins. The header(s) may be regular expressions, case-sensitive strings,
                       or else an asterisk.

                       Default : '*', allow all headers

                     • supports_credentials (bool) --

                       Allows users to make authenticated requests. If true, injects the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header in responses. This allows cookies and  credentials  to  be  submitted
                       across domains.

                       note   This option cannot be used in conjunction with a '*' origin

                       Default : False

                     • max_age (timedelta, integer, string or None) --

                       The maximum time for which this CORS request maybe cached. This value is set as the Access-Control-Max-Age header.

                       Default : None

                     • send_wildcard (bool) --

                       If True, and the origins parameter is *, a wildcard Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is sent, rather than the request's Origin header.

                       Default : False

                     • vary_header (bool) --

                       If True, the header Vary: Origin will be returned as per the W3 implementation guidelines.

                       Setting this header when the Access-Control-Allow-Origin is dynamically generated (e.g. when there is more than one allowed origin, and an Origin than '*' is returned) informs
                       CDNs and other caches that the CORS headers are dynamic, and cannot be cached.

                       If False, the Vary header will never be injected or altered.

                       Default : True

                     • automatic_options (bool) --

                       Only applies to the cross_origin decorator. If True, Flask-CORS will override Flask's default OPTIONS handling to return CORS headers for OPTIONS requests.

                       Default : True

   Using CORS with cookies
       By  default,  Flask-CORS does not allow cookies to be submitted across sites, since it has potential security implications.  If you wish to enable cross-site cookies, you may wish to add some
       sort of CSRF protection to keep you and your users safe.

       To allow cookies or authenticated requests to be made cross origins, simply set the supports_credentials option to True. E.g.

          from flask import Flask, session
          from flask_cors import CORS

          app = Flask(__name__)
          CORS(app, supports_credentials=True)

          @app.route("/")
          def helloWorld():
            return "Hello, %s" % session['username']

       The above code enables Flask backend to accept cookies to be submitted from cross origin sites.  But if you are sending Xhr requests (ajax calls) to a cross-origin server, by  default  chrome
       or any modern browser won't send cookies and session with the request.  You should use withCredentials = True while sending Xhr request to enable that.  You should keep in mind about the nec‐
       essary security concerns.  Related MDN doc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials

   Using CORS with Blueprints
       Flask-CORS supports blueprints out of the box.  Simply pass a blueprint instance to the CORS extension, and everything will just work.

          api_v1 = Blueprint('API_v1', __name__)

          CORS(api_v1) # enable CORS on the API_v1 blue print

          @api_v1.route("/api/v1/users/")
          def list_users():
              '''
                  Since the path matches the regular expression r'/api/*', this resource
                  automatically has CORS headers set. The expected result is as follows:

                  $ curl --include -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/users/ \
