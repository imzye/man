NAME
       tdbc::sqlite3 - TDBC driver for the SQLite3 database manager

SYNOPSIS
       package require tdbc::sqlite3 1.0

       tdbc::sqlite3::connection create db fileName ?-option value...?

DESCRIPTION
       The  tdbc::sqlite3 driver provides a database interface that conforms to Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl script to connect to a SQLite3 database.  It is also provided as a worked
       example of how to write a database driver in Tcl, so that driver authors have a starting point for further development.

       Connection to a SQLite3 database is established by invoking tdbc::sqlite3::connection create, passing it a string to be used as the connection handle followed by the file name of the database. The
       side effect of tdbc::sqlite3::connection create is to create a new database connection..  As an alternative, tdbc::sqlite::connection new may be used to create a database connection with an  auto‐
       matically assigned name. The return value from tdbc::sqlite::connection new is the name that was chosen for the connection handle. See tdbc::connection(3tcl) for the details of how to use the con‐
       nection to manipulate a database.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       The  standard  configuration options -encoding, -isolation, -readonly and -timeout are all recognized, both on tdbc::sqlite3::connection create and on the configure method of the resulting connec‐
       tion.

       Since the encoding of a SQLite3 database is always well known, the -encoding option accepts only utf-8 as an encoding and always returns utf-8 for an encoding. The actual encoding may be set using
       a SQLite3 PRAGMA statement when creating a new database.

       Only the isolation levels readuncommitted and serializable are implemented. Other isolation levels are promoted to serializable.

       The -readonly flag is not implemented. A false boolean value is accepted silently, while any other value reports an error.

       The -keepcase flag is special and controls how table and column names are reported in the various methods to retrieve database metadata.  By default the flag is zero, i.e. table and  column  names
       are reported all lower case. Otherwise, table and column names are reported as defined in the database.

BUGS
       If  any column name is not unique among the columns in a result set, the results of -as dicts returns will be missing all but the rightmost of the duplicated columns. This limitation can be worked
       around by adding appropriate AS clauses to SELECT statements to ensure that all returned column names are unique.  Plans are to fix this bug by using a C implementation of the driver,  which  will
       also improve performance significantly.
