NAME
       jsonrpcstub - genearate stubs for the libjson-rpc-cpp framework.

SYNOPSIS
       jsonrpcstub specfile.json [--cpp-server=namespace::ClassName]
        [--cpp-server-file=classqname.h]  [--cpp-client=namespace::ClassName] [--cpp-client-file=classname.h] [--js-client=ClassName] [--js-client-file=classname.js]  [-h] [-v] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       jsonrpcstub is a tool to generate C++ and JavaScript classes from a procedure specification file.

   SPECIFICATION SYNTAX
       The specifictaion file is a JSON file containing all available JSON-RPC methods and notifications with their corresponding parameters and return values contained in a top-level JSON array.

       [
            {
                 "name": "method_with_positional_params",
                 "params": [3,4],
                 "returns": 7
            },
            {
                 "name": "method_with_named_params",
                 "params": {"param1": 3, "param2": 4},
                 "returns": 7
            },
            {
                 "name": "notification_without_parmas"
            }
       ]

       The  literal in each "params" and  "returns" section defines the corresponding type.  If the "params" contains an array, the parameters are accepted by position, if it contains an object, they are
       accepted by name.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print usage information.

       -v     Print verbose information during generation.

       --version
              Print version info and exit.

       --cpp-server=ClassName
              Creates a Abstract Server class. Namespaces can be provided using the :: notation (e.g. ns1::ns2::Classname).

       --cpp-server-file=filename.h
              Defines the filename to use when generating the C++ Abstract Server class.  If this is not provided, the lowercase classname is used.

       --cpp-client=ClassName
              Creates a C++ client class. Namespaces can be provided using the :: notation (e.g. ns1::ns2::Classname).

       --cpp-client-file=filename.h
              Defines the filename to use when generating the C++ client class.  If this is not provided, the lowercase classname is used.

       --js-client=ClassName
              Creates a JavaScript client class. No namespaces are supported in this option.

       --js-client-file=filename.js
              Defines the filename to use when generating the JavaScrip client class.

EXAMPLES
       Generate C++ Stubs for Server and Client, the classes will be named AbstractStubServer and StubClient:

              jsonrpcstub  spec.json --cpp-server=AbstractStubServer --cpp-client=StubClient

       Generate JavaScript Client class MyRpcClient into file someclient.js:

              jsonrpcstub  spec.json --js-client=MyRpcClient --js-client-file=someclient.js

EXIT STATUS
       This command returns 0 if no error occurred. In any other case, it returns 1.
