NAME
            alsa-scarlett-gui - Gtk4 GUI for the ALSA controls presented by the Focusrite Scarlett/Clarett kernel driver

SYNOPSIS
       alsa-scarlett-gui [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
            alsa-scarlett-gui is a Gtk4 GUI for the ALSA controls presented by the Linux kernel Focusrite Scarlett Gen 2/3/Clarett USB/Clarett+ Mixer Driver.

            The  Focusrite USB audio interfaces are class compliant meaning that they work "out of the box" on Linux as audio and MIDI interfaces (although on Gen 3 you need to disable MSD mode first for
       full functionality). However, except for some of the smallest models, they have a bunch of proprietary functionality that required a kernel driver to be written specifically for those devices.

            Linux kernel support ("ALSA Focusrite Scarlett Gen 2/3 Mixer Driver") for the proprietary functionality was first added in:

       •      Scarlett Gen 2: Linux 5.4 (bugs fixed in Linux 5.14)

       •      Scarlett Gen 3: Linux 5.14

       •      Clarett+ 8Pre: Linux 6.1

       •      Clarett 2Pre/4Pre/8Pre USB, Clarett+ 2Pre/4Pre: coming soon

              For full documentation, see: https://github.com/geoffreybennett/alsa-scarlett-gui.

OPTIONS
            FILE           Load the specified .state file on start

BUGS
       •      The linear-dB scale of the volume controls doesn't work well. Lower volumes (e.g. below -30dB) don't need as much fine control as higher volumes.

       •      Can’t select (focus) the gain/volume controls or use a keyboard to adjust them.

       •      Level (monitoring) doesn't work yet and is disabled (needs kernel driver update).

       •      Load/Save uses alsactl which will be confused if the ALSA interface name (e.g. USB) changes.

       •      Load/Save is not implemented for simulated interfaces.

       •      Lots of "couldn't find weak ref" warnings are emitted when loading a state file for simulation.

       •      The read-only status of controls in interface simulation mode does not change when the HW/SW button is clicked.

       •      When there's more than one main window open, closing one of them doesn't free and close everything related to that card.

       •      There is no facility to group channels into stereo pairs (needs kernel support to save this information in the interface).

       •      There is no facility to give channels custom names (needs kernel support to save this information in the interface).

       •      No keyboard accelerators (e.g. Ctrl-Q to quit) have been implemented.
