NAME
       pammixmulti - blend together multiple PAM images

SYNOPSIS
       pammixmulti
         [--blend=average|random|mask]
         [--maskfile=filename]
         [--stdev=number]
         [--randomseed integer]
         filename ...

       Minimum  unique abbreviation of an option is acceptable. You can use a single hyphen instead of double hyphens to denote options. You can use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an op‐
       tion name from its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This file is part of Netpbm(1).

       pammixmulti mixes two or more images to produce a new image. The program provides multiple ways to interpret "mix."

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pammixmulti recognizes the following command line options:

       --blend=average|random|mask

              This option specifies how the input images should be mixed to produce the output image.  With --blend=average (the default), each pixel in the output is produced by averaging the  corresponding
              pixels  from  all the input images.  With --blend=random, each pixel in the output is produced by selecting the corresponding pixel from one of the input images, chosen at random on a per-pixel
              basis.  With --blend=mask, each pixel in the output is produced by a weighted average of the corresponding pixels from all the input images based on the grayscale level of  an  additional  mask
              image.

       --maskfile=filename

              In  conjunction  with  --blend=mask, this option names a grayscale mask file to control the blending of each pixel.  (If the file is not grayscale, the first channel is treated as gray).  Where
              the mask file is black, the first image is selected. Where the mask file is white, the last image is selected.  Intermediate levels of gray select intermediate images.

       --stdev=number

              When used with --blend=mask, this option controls how smoothly the various input images are mixed to produce each output pixel.  For example, consider running pammixmulti with three  input  im‐
              ages  and  a  mask  image  that  uses gray levels from 0 to 255. Given --stdev=0.0, gray levels 0-84 produce exclusively image 1; gray levels 85-170 produce exclusively image 2; and gray levels
              171-255 produce exclusively image 3.  If the argument to --stdev is positive, images are blended according to a normal distribution.  Hence, gray levels around 85 produce an output  pixel  that
              includes roughly equal amounts of the corresponding pixel from images 1 and 2 but less of the corresponding pixel from image 3.  As number tends towards the number of input images (going beyond
              that has diminishing impact), the output tends to look more like --blend=average. number defaults to 0.25.

       --randomseed integer
              This is the seed for the random number generator used with --blend=random

              Use this to ensure you get the same image on separate invocations.

ARGUMENTS
       You supply the names of the files to mix as non-option arguments.

EXAMPLES
       Average a bunch of PPM images to produce a new PAM image:
           pammixmulti input*.ppm >output.ppm

       Mix these same images by taking each pixel from a randomly selected input image:

           pammixmulti --blend=random input*.ppm >output.ppm

       Use a mask image to control the fading among input images on a pixel-by-pixel basis:

           pammixmulti --blend=mask --maskfile=mask.pgm >output.pam \
              one.pam two.pam three.pam four.pam

       Do the same but with more abrupt transitions:

           pammixmulti --blend=mask --maskfile=mask.pgm --stdev=0.0 >output.pam \
              one.pam two.pam three.pam four.pam

       and now with more gradual transitions:

           pammixmulti --blend=mask --maskfile=mask.pgm --stdev=1.0 >output.pam \
              one.pam two.pam three.pam four.pam

HISTORY
       pammixmulti was new in Netpbm 10.85 (December 2018).
