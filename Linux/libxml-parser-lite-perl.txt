NAME
       XML::Parser::Lite - Lightweight pure-perl XML Parser (based on regexps)

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Parser::Lite;

         $p1 = new XML::Parser::Lite;
         $p1->setHandlers(
           Start => sub { shift; print "start: @_\n" },
           Char => sub { shift; print "char: @_\n" },
           End => sub { shift; print "end: @_\n" },
         );
         $p1->parse('<foo id="me">Hello World!</foo>');

         $p2 = new XML::Parser::Lite
           Handlers => {
             Start => sub { shift; print "start: @_\n" },
             Char => sub { shift; print "char: @_\n" },
             End => sub { shift; print "end: @_\n" },
           }
         ;
         $p2->parse('<foo id="me">Hello <bar>cruel</bar> World!</foo>');

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements an XML parser with a interface similar to XML::Parser. Though not all callbacks are supported, you should be able to use it in the same way you use XML::Parser. Due to using
       experimental regexp features it'll work only on Perl 5.6 and above and may behave differently on different platforms.

       Note that you cannot use regular expressions or split in callbacks. This is due to a limitation of perl's regular expression implementation (which is not re-entrant).

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   new
       Constructor.

       The new() method returns the object called on when called as object method.  This behaviour was inherited from SOAP::Lite, which XML::Parser::Lite was split out from.  This means that the
       following effectively is a no-op if $obj is a object:

        $obj = $obj->new();

       New accepts a single named parameter, "Handlers" with a hash ref as value:

        my $parser = XML::Parser::Lite->new(
           Handlers => {
               Start => sub { shift; print "start: @_\n" },
               Char => sub { shift; print "char: @_\n" },
               End => sub { shift; print "end: @_\n" },
           }
        );

       The handlers given will be passed to setHandlers.

   setHandlers
       Sets (or resets) the parsing handlers. Accepts a hash with the handler names and handler code references as parameters. Passing "undef" instead of a code reference replaces the handler by a no-op.

       The following handlers can be set:

        Init
        Start
        Char
        End
        Final

       All other handlers are ignored.

       Calling setHandlers without parameters resets all handlers to no-ops.

   parse
       Parses the XML given. In contrast to XML::Parser's parse method, parse() only parses strings.

Handler methods
   Init
       Called before parsing starts. You should perform any necessary initializations in Init.

   Start
       Called at the start of each XML node. See XML::Parser for details.

   Char
       Called for each character sequence. May be called multiple times for the characters contained in an XML node (even for every single character).  Your implementation has to make sure that it
       captures all characters.

   End
       Called at the end of each XML node. See XML::Parser for details

   Comment
       See XML::Parser for details

   XMLDecl
       See XML::Parser for details

   Doctype
       See XML::Parser for details

   Final
       Called at the end of the parsing process. You should perform any necessary cleanup here.
