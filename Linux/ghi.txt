NAME
       ghi - the stupid issue tracker

SYNOPSIS
       ghi [--version] [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--help] command [args]
           [ -- [user/]repo]]

DESCRIPTION
       GHI is the alphabetical acronym for GitHub Issues. GHI provides an easy way to manage your issues from the comfort of the command line and your editor of choice.

       GHI  should  look  familiar  if you´re familiar with Git. When invoked from a repository directory that has a GitHub remote, GHI will work with that repository´s issues by default. Otherwise, GHI will
       work with your global issues or with a repository specified in its terminating arguments.

       The command is either the name of a GHI command (see below) or an alias.

OPTIONS
       --version
              Prints the GHI version number.

       --help Prints the synopsis and a list of commonly-used commands. If a GHI command is named, this option will bring up the manual page for that command.

              See ghi-help(1) for more information.

       -p, --paginate
              Pipe all output into less if standard output is a terminal.

       --no-pager
              Do not pipe output into a pager.

       --[no-]color
              Toggle colorized output.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Various GHI commands use the following environment variables:

       GHI_REPO
              The GitHub repository to be used by the issued GHI command.

       GHI_TOKEN
              The OAuth access token used to authenticate you.

       GHI_PAGER
              This environment variable overrides $GIT_PAGER and $PAGER. If it is set to an empty string or to the value "cat", git will not launch a pager.

       GHI_EDITOR
              This environment variable overrides $GIT_EDITOR, $VISUAL, and $EDITOR.

       GITHUB_USER
              Your GitHub username: used to authenticate and identify you.

       GITHUB_PASSWORD
              If you store your GitHub password in an environment variable, GHI will automatically attempt to fetch an access token using it.

       All environment variables may also be stored in Git configuration files where the variable is in lowercase form and the underscore is a period (e.g., $GHI_REPO would become the ghi.repo option).
