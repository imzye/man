NAME
       valinor - generate debugger project files, and launch a debugger, to debug an ELF file

SYNOPSIS
       valinor [--tool TOOL] [--project-dir PROJECT_DIR] [--no-open] -–target TARGET executable

       valinor –-version

DESCRIPTION
       valinor is designed to be used as a proxy debug command for yotta targets to provide as their scripts.debug command.

OPTIONS
       -t, --tool TOOL
              debug tool (IDE) to generate for (if omitted, a debug project will be generated for an IDE detected on your system, defaulting to opening a GDB debug session, if no known IDEs are detected)

       -d, --project-dir PROJECT_DIR
              directory in which to generate any necessary project files (default: directory of the executable argument)

       -n, --no-open
              do not open debug session (generate the necessary files to enable debugging and print command to proceed)

       -–target TARGET
              target board to generate project file for (e.g. K64F) (this name is passed to project_generator - any name it accepts will work)

       --version
              print version and exit

YOTTA TARGET DEFINITIONS
       To  use  valinor to add debug support to a yotta target description, add the following to your target.json file (replacing K64F with the project_generator target ID for the chip/board on your tar‐
       get):

              "scripts":{
                  "debug": ["valinor", "--target", "frdm-k64f", "$program"]
              }
