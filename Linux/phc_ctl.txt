PHC_CTL(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 PHC_CTL(8)

NAME
       phc_ctl - directly control PHC device clock

SYNOPSIS
       phc_ctl [ options ] <device> [ commands ]

DESCRIPTION
       phc_ctl  is a program which can be used to directly control a PHC clock
       device.  Typically, it is used for debugging purposes, and  has  little
       use for general control of the device. For general control of PHC clock
       devices, phc2sys (8) should be preferred.

       <device> may be either CLOCK_REALTIME, any  /dev/ptpX  device,  or  any
       ethernet device which supports ethtool's get_ts_info ioctl.

OPTIONS
       -l print-level
              Set the maximum syslog level of messages which should be printed
              or sent to the system logger. The default is 6 (LOG_INFO).

       -q     Do not send messages to syslog.  By  default  messages  will  be
              sent.

       -Q     Do  not  print  messages to standard output. By default messages
              will be printed.

       -h     Display a help message.

       -v     Prints the software version and exits.

COMMANDS
       phc_ctl is controlled by passing commands which take either an optional
       or  required  parameter.  The  commands  (outlined  below) will control
       aspects of the PHC clock device.  These  commands  may  be  useful  for
       inspecting  or  debugging  the  PHC  driver,  but may have adverse side
       effects on running instances of ptp4l (8) or phc2sys (8)

       set seconds
              Set the PHC clock  time  to  the  value  specified  in  seconds.
              Defaults to reading CLOCK_REALTIME if no value is provided.

       get    Get the current time of the PHC clock device.

       adj seconds
              Adjust  the  PHC  clock  by  an amount of seconds provided. This
              argument is required.

       freq ppb
              Adjust the frequency of the PHC clock by the specified parts per
              billion. If no argument is provided, it will attempt to read the
              current frequency and report it.

       cmp    Compare the PHC clock device to CLOCK_REALTIME, using  the  best
              method available.

       caps   Display  the device capabilities. This is the default command if
              no commands are provided.

       wait seconds
              Sleep the process for the specified period of  time,  waking  up
              and  resuming  afterwards. This command may be useful for sanity
              checking whether the PHC clock is running as expected.

              The arguments specified in seconds are read as double  precision
              floating point values, and will scale to nanoseconds. This means
              providing a value of 5.5 means 5  and  one  half  seconds.  This
              allows specifying fairly precise values for time.

EXAMPLES
       Read the current clock time from the device
              phc_ctl /dev/ptp0 get

       Set the PHC clock time to CLOCK_REALTIME
              phc_ctl /dev/ptp0 set

       Set PHC clock time to 0 (seconds since Epoch)
              phc_ctl /dev/ptp0 set 0.0

       Quickly  sanity check frequency slewing by setting slewing frequency by
       positive 10%, resetting clock to 0.0 time, waiting for 10 seconds,  and
       then  reading  time. The time read back should be (roughly) 11 seconds,
       since the clock was slewed 10% faster.
              phc_ctl /dev/ptp0 freq 100000000 set 0.0 wait 10.0 get
