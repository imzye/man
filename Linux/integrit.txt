NAME
       i-ls - display file stat and checksum information for files

SYNOPSIS
       i-ls [-s] filename

       i-ls [-s] dirname

       Specify a filename for i-ls to examine, or specify a directory with dirname to examine all the files in the directory.

       -s

              Do not show/calculate checksums for all regular files.

DESCRIPTION
       The integrit system detects intrusion by detecting when trusted files have been altered.

       integrit records information about files in a database.  i-ls allows the user to see that information for live files.

       The output syntax is the same as that of integrit.

EXAMPLES
            i-ls /tmp/foo.txt

       shows file stat attributes for the file, "/tmp/foo.txt".

            i-ls /tmp

       shows file stat attributes for all files in the directory, "/tmp".

            i-ls -s /tmp

       shows file stat attributes for all files in the directory, "/tmp", also including also checksums for all regular files.
