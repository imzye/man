NAME
       read_allocate, read_deallocate - Allocate and deallocate the Read structure.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <Read.h>

       Read *read_allocate(
            int num_points,
            int num_bases);

       void read_deallocate(
            Read *read);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions create and destroy Read structures. The Read structure is a generalised in-memory data structure used for holding trace data information.

       read_allocate()  creates  a Read structure large enough to hold num_points trace sample points and num_bases called bases. The allocated data is then initialised to appropriate defaults, which are
       mainly zeros and null pointers.

       read_deallocate() destroys a previously created Read structure. It is not sufficient to simply use the free() call instead.

RETURN VALUES
       On successful completion, the read_allocate() function returns a pointer to a Read structure. Otherwise this function returns a null pointer.

       The read_deallocate() function returns no value.
