Pod::Weaver::Section::GenerateSection(3pm)                       User Contributed Perl Documentation                      Pod::Weaver::Section::GenerateSection(3pm)

NAME
       Pod::Weaver::Section::GenerateSection - add pod section from an interpolated piece of text

VERSION
       version 1.06

SYNOPSIS
       In your weaver.ini

         [GenerateSection]
         title = HOMEPAGE
         text  = This is the POD for distribution {{$name}}. Check out what we have
         text  = been up to at {{$homepage}}

       The title value can be omited if passed as the plugin name:

         [GenerateSection / HOMEPAGE]

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin attempts to be a cross between Pod::Weaver::Section::Template and Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenerateFile without the generation of extra files.

       The values of text are concatenated and variable names with matching values on the distribution are interpolated. Specifying the heading level allows one to
       write down a rather long section of POD text without need for extra files. For example:

         [GenerateSection / FEEDBACK]
         head = 1
         [GenerateSection / Reporting bugs]
         head = 2
         text = Please report bugs when you find them. While we do have a mailing
         text = list, please use the bug tracker at {{$bugtracker_web}}
         text = to report bugs
         [GenerateSection / Homegape]
         head = 2
         text = Also, come check out our other projects at
         text = {{$homepage}}

ATTRIBUTES
   text
       The text to be added to the section. Multiple values are allowed and will be concatenated. Certain sequences on the text will be replaced (see below).

   head
       The heading level of this section. If 0, there will be no heading. Defaults to 1.

   title
       The title for this section. It can optionally be omitted and passed as the plugin name.

   main_module_only
       If true, it will add the text only to the main module POD. Defaults to false.

   is_template
       If false, it will not attempt to replace the {{}} entries on text. Defaults to true.

Text as template
       Unless the option "is_template" is false, the text will be run through Text::Template.  The variables $plugin, $dist, and $distmeta will be provided, set to
       the GenerateSection plugin, "Dist::Zilla" object, and the distribution metadata hash respectively. For convenience, the following variables are also set:

       $name
       $version
       $homepage
       $repository_web
       $repository_url
       $bugtracker_web
       $bugtracker_email
