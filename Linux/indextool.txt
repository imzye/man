NAME
       indextool - Sphinxsearch tool dump miscellaneous debug information about the physical index.

SYNOPSIS
       indextool {command} [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Sphinx is a collection of programs that aim to provide high quality fulltext search.

       indextool is one of the helper tools within the Sphinx package. It is used to dump miscellaneous debug information about the physical index. Apart ghe dumping indextool can perform index verification,
       hence the indextool name rather than just indexdump.

COMMANDS
       The commands are as follows:

       --dumpheader FILENAME.sph
           quickly dumps the provided index header file without touching any other index files or even the configuration file. The report provides a breakdown of all the index settings, in particular the
           entire attribute and field list. Prior to 0.9.9-rc2, this command was present in CLI search utility.

       --dumpconfig FILENAME.sph
           dumps the index definition from the given index header file in (almost) compliant sphinx.conf file format.

       --dumpheader INDEXNAME
           dumps index header by index name with looking up the header path in the configuration file.

       --dumpdocids INDEXNAME
           dumps document IDs by index name. It takes the data from attribute (.spa) file and therefore requires docinfo=extern to work.

       --dumphitlist INDEXNAME KEYWORD
           dumps all the hits (occurences) of a given keyword in a given index, with keyword specified as text.

       --dumphitlist INDEXNAME --wordid ID
           dumps all the hits (occurences) of a given keyword in a given index, with keyword specified as internal numeric ID.

       --htmlstrip INDEXNAME
           filters stdin using HTML stripper settings for a given index, and prints the filtering results to stdout. Note that the settings will be taken from sphinx.conf, and not the index header.

       --check INDEXNAME
           checks the index data files for consistency errors that might be introduced either by bugs in indexer and/or hardware faults.

       --strip-path
           strips the path names from all the file names referenced from the index (stopwords, wordforms, exceptions, etc). This is useful for checking indexes built on another machine with possibly
           different path layouts.

       --optimize-rt-klists
           optimizes the kill list memory use in the disk chunk of a given RT index. That is a one-off optimization intended for rather old RT indexes, created by development versions prior to 1.10-beta
           release. As of 1.10-beta releases, this kill list optimization (purging) should happen automatically, and there should never be a need to use this option.

OPTIONS
       The only currently available option applies to all commands and lets you specify the configuration file:

       --config CONFIGFILE, -c CONFIGFILE
           overrides the built-in config file names.
