BPM(1)                                                                                    General Commands Manual                                                                                    BPM(1)

NAME
       bpm-tools - calculate the tempo of music files

SYNOPSIS
       bpm-tag [options] file

       bpm-graph file

       bpm [options] < file.raw

DESCRIPTION
       The bpm-tools commands are used to automatically calculate the tempo (in beats-per-minute) of music, optionally displaying an analysis and adding it to file 'tags'. The data from these tags can be
       especially useful for navigating a music library in DJ software such as xwax(1).

       The bpm command implements the algorithm on raw data, but the most commonly used command is bpm-tag.

OPTIONS
       Options are described by the commands themselves. Use one of the following for more information:

              bpm-tag -h

              bpm-graph -h

              bpm -h

EXAMPLES
       Tag a file with its tempo:

              bpm-tag "Daft Punk - Get Lucky.mp3"

       Calculate and display the tempo of a file without modifying it:

              bpm-tag -f -n "Gwen Guthrie - Padlock.flac"

       Tag a file, with a hint to look for a fast tempo:

              bpm-tag -m 120 -x 200 "Roni Size - Brown Paper Bag.oga"
