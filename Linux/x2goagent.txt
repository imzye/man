NAME
       x2goagent - X2Go Agent.

SYNOPSIS
       x2goagent [options]

DESCRIPTION
       x2goagent is a wrapper around nxagent. The nxagent Xserver is an Xnest-like X server for remote application/desktop access.

       x2goagent implements a very efficient compression of the X11 protocol.

       This  increases  performance when using X applications over high latency and low bandwidth networks, while providing a local (LAN-like) usage experience even if connecting from off-site locations (via
       cable modem or GSM).

       x2goagent is not designed to be used as a standalone application.  It has to be launched on the server side by the X2Go server software.

       Available clients are x2goclient, pyhoca-gui and pyhoca-gui (using the Python X2Go API).

OPTIONS
       -help  Lists all others options that are not listed here.
