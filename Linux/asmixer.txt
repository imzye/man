NAME
       asmixer - the AfterStep Mixer

SYNOPSIS
       asmixer [ -help ] [ -g geometry ] [ -d device ] [ -1 control ] [ -2 control ] [ -3 control ] [ -t title ] [ -v rate ] [ -w withdrawn ]

DESCRIPTION
       asmixer is a nice little application for controlling the volume of various sound outputs through three slider bars. It can be swallowed into Afterstep's Wharf for ease of use.

OPTIONS
       -h -help --help
            SOS, 911, etc.

       -g [+|-]x[+|-]y
            standard format for where you want to exile asmixer

       -d device
            the mixer device to harass

       -1 -2 -3 control
            this binds a slider to a specific sound device:

            VOLUME, BASS, TREBLE, SYNTH, PCM, SPEAKER, LINE,
            MIC, CD, IMIX, ALPTPCM, RECLEV, IGAIN, OGAIN,
            LINE1, LINE2, LINE3

       -w
            WindowMaker withdrawn window support.

       -v volume
            the volume (1-100) to set the first slider to

DEFAULTS
       -d /dev/mixer -1 VOLUME -2 CD -3 PCM -t asmixer

INVOCATION
       asmixer can be called from one of many ways.  The most common invocation is Afterstep's .steprc:

          *Wharf "mixer" nil Swallow "asmixer" asmixer -g -1-1 &

       This line will cause asmixer to be swallowed into Wharf, which 9 out of 10 dentists agree is cool. You will then be able to slide to your hearts content in perfect Wharf comfort!

       Another way to call asmixer is from the command line:

            [ximenes@leo]$ asmixer -d /dev/mixer -t asmixer -v 95 &

       This will pop up a little window with asmixer helplessly imprisoned inside.  Don't worry, it likes it.
