NAME
       h2o - optimized HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 server

SYNOPSIS
       h2o [options]

DESCRIPTION
       H2O  is  a  performance-optimized  HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 web server. Designed from ground-up, the server takes full advantage of HTTP/2 features including prioritized content serving and server
       push.

       This manual page describes the options supported by the h2o command. Note that H2O should in most cases be run as a system service (through a systemd(1) service or an initscript).

OPTIONS
       -c, --conf FILE
              Configuration file (default: /etc/h2o/h2o.conf)

       -m, --mode mode
              mode specifies one of the following modes:

              worker the h2o process will stay in the foreground and handle all incoming connections itself (default).

              master h2o will be started using the /usr/share/h2o/start_server helper; in this mode the start_server process will stay in the foreground and spawn an h2o worker process for  handling
                     incoming connections. SIGHUP can be sent to the master process to reconfigure or upgrade the server without service downtime.

              daemon spawns  a  master process in the background and exits. error-log must be configured when using this mode, as all errors are logged to the error log instead of output to standard
                     error.

              test   tests the configuration and exits

       -t, --test
              Synonym of `--mode=test`

       -v, --version
              Prints the version number

       -h, --help
              Prints usage help.
