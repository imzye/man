BADWOLF(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               BADWOLF(1)

NAME
     badwolf — minimalist and privacy-oriented web browser based on WebKitGTK

SYNOPSIS
     badwolf [webkit/gtk options] [URLs or paths]

DESCRIPTION
     badwolf is a minimalist browser that cares about privacy, it is based on
     WebKitGTK and thus also accepts WebKitGTK (and dependencies) flags and
     environment variables, unfortunately there doesn't seems to be manpages
     for theses.

     Runtime configuration specific to badwolf will probably get added at a
     later release.

KEYBINDINGS
     The following section lists the keybinding by their action, each item is
     described by the widget the focus is on or ⟨any⟩ if it works for the

ENVIRONMENT
     BADWOLF_L10N
             A colon-separated list in the form lang_COUNTRY where lang is in
             ISO-639 and COUNTRY in ISO-3166.  For example
             BADWOLF_L10N="en_GB:fr_FR:de_DE".  When this variable isn't set,
             spelling isn't activated.  A more generic variable name is also
             intended to be used in the future.

             To get the list of supported dictionaries execute enchant-lsmod-2
             -list-dicts or before enchant 2.0: enchant-lsmod -list-dicts

FILES
     The following paths are using sh(1) syntax to correctly support XDG Base
     Directory Specification, you can use the echo(1) command to check where
     it is on your system.

     ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/badwolf/content-filters.json
             WebKit-specific content-filter file, this allows to block un‐
             wanted content (ads, nagware, ...).  For some introductory infor‐
             mation about the format see:
             https://webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/
             https://webkit.org/blog/4062/targeting-domains-with-content-
             blockers/
             https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/creating_a_content_blocker

             For a converter using AblockPlus-style filters, try:
             https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abp2blocklist

             For a ready-to-use file (that you should update periodically),
             try: https://easylist-
             downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist_min_content_blocker.json
     ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/badwolf/filters
             This is where the compiled filters are stored, the file(s) in it
             are automatically generated and so shouldn't be edited.  Docu‐
             mented here only for sandboxing / access-control purposes.
     ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/badwolf/bookmarks.xbel
             XBEL (XML Bookmark Exchange Language) file, known to be currently
             supported by: elinks(1), konqueror(1), kbookmarkeditor(1). Doing
             a symbolic link from their path works fine but you might also
             want to use XInclude to merge multiple XBEL files.

             For more information about this format see:
             http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/

             For an example XBEL file see: https://hacktivis.me/bookmarks.xbel
     ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/badwolf/webkit-web-extension/
             Directory containing the WebKitWebExtensions:
             https://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/WebKitWebExtension.html
             to be loaded into badwolf. Note: They aren't the JavaScript-based
             Web-Extensions supported by Firefox or Chrome, but native code in
             shared objects using the WebKitGTK API.

             Examples of useful extensions may be found at:
             https://hacktivis.me/git/badwolf-extensions
     ${DATADIR:-/usr/local/share}/badwolf/interface.css
     ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/badwolf/interface.css
             CSS files (respectively system and user-level) for styling bad‐
             wolf interface.  See
             http://web.archive.org/web/20210420214617/https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/chap-
             css-properties.html for the properties being available.

             For testing your styles I would recommend using the
             GTK_DEBUG=interactive environment variable on launching badwolf
             and going to the CSS tab.
