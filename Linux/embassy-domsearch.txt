NAME
       seqwords - Generates DHF files from keyword search of UniProt.

SYNOPSIS

       seqwords -keyfile infile -spfile infile -outfile outfile

       seqwords -help

DESCRIPTION
       seqwords is a command line program from EMBOSS (“the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite”). It is part of the "Protein:3D Structure" command group(s).

OPTIONS
   Input section
       -keyfile infile
           This option specifies the name of keywords file (input). This contains a list of keywords specific to a number of SCOP or CATH families and superfamilies used by SEQWORDS to search a sequence
           database.

       -spfile infile
           This option specifies the name of the sequence database (input) to search.

   Output section
       -outfile outfile
           This option specifies the name of the DHF file (domain hits file) (output). A 'domain hits file' contains database hits (sequences) with domain classification information, in the DHF format
           (FASTA-like). The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH family (or other node in the structural hierarchies) and are found from a search of a sequence database. Files containing hits retrieved
           by PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH, hits retrieved by a sparse protein signatare by using SIGSCAN or various types of HMM and profile by using LIBSCAN. Default value: test.hits

BUGS
       Bugs can be reported to the Debian Bug Tracking system (http://bugs.debian.org/emboss), or directly to the EMBOSS developers (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=93650&atid=605031).

SEE ALSO
       seqwords is fully documented via the tfm(1) system.
