NAME
       runlock - prevent concurrent execution of a process

SYNOPSYS
       runlock [ -h ]

       runlock [ -d ] [ -f pathname ] [ -t timeout ] command [ args ]

DESCRIPTION
       runlock  tries  to hold an exclusive lock while it executes a command. Subsequent execution of runlock with the same lock, while that lock is held, will cause the new instance of runlock to termi‐
       nate with a failure exit code. Otherwise, the exit code of the subprocess is returned.

USAGE
       -d

              Debug mode; send log messages to standard error as well as to the system log.

       -f pathname

              Specifies the pathname of the file to use as a lock file.  The default is to create a lock file in /tmp/cronutils-$USER with the name of the command, and suffix ".pid".

       -t timeout

              Specifies the duration, in seconds, for runlock to wait before giving up on trying to acquire the lock.  The default is 5 seconds.

       -h

              Prints some basic help.

BUGS
       Sending SIGALRM to runlock before the timer has expired will cause the subprocess to be killed.
