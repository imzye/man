NAME
       untex - strip LaTeX comands from input

SYNOPSIS
       untex [ options ] [ files ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Untex removes some LaTeX commands from the files listed in the arguments (or standard input) and prints the output to standard output.

OPTIONS
       -      read from standard input.

       -o     remove options to LaTeX commands, i. e. everything in brackets [] behind a command.

       -i     process "\include{file}" and "\input{file}" and "\input file" commands.

       -m     (try to) remove all math code.

       -u     replace all \"a (etc.) with ibm (CP850) characters.

       -uiso  replace all \"a (etc.) with ISO characters.

       -uascii
              replace all \"a (etc.) with ascii characters.

       -g     replace all "a (etc., from german.sty) with ibm (CP850) characters.

       -giso  replace all "a (etc., from german.sty) with ISO characters.

       -gascii
              replace all "a (etc., from german.sty) with ascii characters.

       -e     remove environment names.

       -a     remove arguments of commands (not recommended).

       -g implies -u, -a implies -o.

SEE ALSO
       latex, tex, detex

BUGS
       The -g and -u options only work for german accented characters. Not fixed due to lack of time, any help is appreciated. The \includeonly command is ignored.

       Using -u option in a UTF-8 terminal doesn't work. Using it alone in a Latin1 terminal doesn't work either, you must also add -uiso.
