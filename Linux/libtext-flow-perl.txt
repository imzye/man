Text::Flow::Wrap(3pm)                                                               User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                               Text::Flow::Wrap(3pm)

NAME
       Text::Flow::Wrap - Flexible word wrapping for not just ASCII output.

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Flow::Wrap;

         # for regular ASCII usage ...
         my $wrapper = Text::Flow::Wrap->new(
             check_width => sub { length($_[0]) < 70 },
         );

         # for non-ASCII usage ...
         my $wrapper = Text::Flow::Wrap->new(
             check_width => sub { $pdf->get_text_width($_[0]) < 500 },
         );

         my $text = $wrapper->wrap($text);

DESCRIPTION
       The main purpose of this module is to provide text wrapping features without being tied down to ASCII based output and fixed-width fonts.

       My needs were for sophisticated test control in PDF and GIF output formats in particular.

METHODS
       new (%params)
           This constructs a new Text::Flow::Wrap module whose %params set the values of the attributes listed below.

       wrap ($text)
           This method will accept a bunch of text, it will then return a new string which is wrapped to the expected width.

   Attribute Accessors
       check_width (\&code)
           This attribute is required, and must be a CODE reference. This will be used to determine if the width of the text is appropriate. It will get as an argument, a string which is should check the
           width of. It should return a Boolean value, true if the string is not exceeded the max width and false if it has.

       line_break ($str)
           This is the line break character used when assembling and disassembling the text, it defaults to the newline character "\n".

       paragraph_boundry ($str)
           This is the paragraph boundry marker used when disassembling the text, it defaults to the string "\n".

       paragraph_break ($str)
           This is the paragraph breaker used when re-assembling the text, it defaults to the string "\n\n".

       word_boundry ($str)
           This is the word boundry marker used when disassembling the text, it defaults to a single space character.

       word_break ($str)
           This is the paragraph breaker used when re-assembling the text, it defaults to a single space character.

   Paragraph Disassembling
       These methods deal with breaking up the paragraphs into its parts, which can then be processed through the re-assembling methods.

       These methods are mostly used internally, but more sophisticated tools might need to access them as well (see Text::Flow).

       disassemble_paragraph
       disassemble_paragraphs

   Paragraph Reassembling
       These methods deal with putting the paragraph parts back together after the disassembling methods have done thier work.

       These methods are mostly used internally, but more sophisticated tools might need to access them as well (see Text::Flow)

       reassemble_paragraph
       reassemble_paragraphs

   Introspection
       meta
           Returns the Moose meta object associated with this class.

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to cpan-RT.
