NAME
       ncidutil - manipulate entries in the alias, blacklist and whitelist files

SYNOPSIS
        ncidutil [--help|-h] [--man|-m] [--version|-V]

        ncidutil [--multi "<blacklist and/or whitelist file names>"]
                 [--regex|-R] [--ignore1|-i] <arguments>

DESCRIPTION
       The ncidutil script is designed to be called by the NCID server in response to client requests.  Five arguments are required.

       The ncidutil script can add, modify or remove an alias from the alias file.  If an alias is modified or removed and if the hangup option of the server is enabled, ncidutil will add or remove the alias
       entry in the blacklist and/or whitelist files.

       The "--multi" option is used to determine if the blacklist and whitelist files should be searched for an alias or if an entry should be added or removed from the files.  The entry can be an alias in
       the alias file.

   Options
       -h, --help Displays the help message and exits.

       -m, --man  Displays the manual page and exits.

       -V, --version
                  Displays the version and exits.

       -i, --ignore1
                  This is a US/Canada option only.

                  A leading one in an alias definition and in the calling number is ignored.

                  Normally an alias requires the calling number as it appears in the cidcall.log.  In the US a leading 1 may or may not be provided in incoming or outgoing calls.

                  Default: The number for the alias entry must match the calling number.

       --multi "<blacklist> <whitelist>"
                  Specifies the names of the blacklist and whitelist files to update when an alias is modified. If both are specified, separate each with a space.

                  Default: ""

       -R, --regex <0-2>
                  If regex = 0, uses Simple Expressions.

                  If regex = 1, uses Posix Regular Expressions.

                  If regex = 2, uses Perl-compatible Expressions.

                  Default: Uses Simple Expressions.
