NAME
       dlopen-notes.py

SYNOPSIS
       dlopen-notes.py [-r] [-s] [-f [FEATURE1,FEATURE2]] [-h] filename [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read .note.dlopen notes from ELF files and report the contents.

       ELF binaries store link-time dependencies in their headers, which can be parsed by various tools. There is no machine-readable metadata about dependencies loaded at build time via dlopen(3) avail‐
       able by default. The ELF Dlopen Metadata specification aims to fill this gap by defining a common format. See https://systemd.io/ELF_DLOPEN_METADATA/.

       This tool allows parsing such a note, and printing out the result in various formats.
