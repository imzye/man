SYNOPSIS
       scid

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly Shane's Chess Information Database.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.
       It  does  have  documentation  in  a  README file, which is available as /usr/share/doc/scid/README.gz. It also has extensive HTML documentation, which is available at /usr/share/doc/scid/html/In‐
       dex.html.

       Scid is a chess database application. With it you can browse databases of chess games, edit games and search for games by various criteria.  Scid uses it own compact and fast database format,  but
       can convert to and from PGN.

       The command 'scid' starts the graphical user interface.
