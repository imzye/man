NAME
       swayimgrc - configuration file for the Swayimg viewer

SYNOPSIS
       The Swayimg configuration file is a text-based INI file used to override the default settings.

LOCATION
       Swayimg searches for a config file in the following locations, in this order:
       •   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/swayimg/config
       •   $HOME/.config/swayimg/config
       •   $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/swayimg/config
       •   /etc/xdg/swayimg/config

DESCRIPTION
       The structure of the INI file consists of key-value pairs for properties and sections that organize properties.

       The number sign (#) at the beginning of the line indicates a comment. Empty lines and comments are ignored.

       The  basic  element  contained in the INI file is the key or property. Every key has a name and a value, delimited by an equals sign (=). The name appears to the left of the equals sign. The value
       can contain any characters.

       Keys are grouped into named sections. The section name appears on a line by itself, in square brackets. All keys after the section declaration are associated with that section.

       Special directive include allows to load another config file. The directive must contain the path or name of the file to load the configuration.

       Any option can be overridden using the --config argument in the command line, for instance: swayimg  --config="general.mode=gallery".
