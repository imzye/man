NAME
       pipx - Install and execute apps from Python packages.

SYNOPSIS
       pipx [-h] [--quiet] [--verbose] [--global] [--version] {install,install-all,uninject,inject,pin,unpin,upgrade,upgrade-all,upgrade-shared,uninstall,uninstall-all,reinstall,reinstall-all,list,inter‐

DESCRIPTION
       Install and execute apps from Python packages.

       Binaries can either be installed globally into isolated Virtual Environments or run directly in a temporary Virtual Environment.

       Virtual Environment location is ~/.local/share/pipx/venvs.  Symlinks to apps are placed in ~/.local/bin.  Symlinks to manual pages are placed in ~/.local/share/man.

       optional environment variables:
         PIPX_HOME              Overrides default pipx location. Virtual Environments
                               will be installed to $PIPX_HOME/venvs.
         PIPX_GLOBAL_HOME       Used instead of PIPX_HOME when the `--global` option
                               is given.
         PIPX_BIN_DIR           Overrides location of app installations. Apps are
                               symlinked or copied here.
         PIPX_GLOBAL_BIN_DIR    Used instead of PIPX_BIN_DIR when the `--global`
                               option is given.
         PIPX_MAN_DIR           Overrides location of manual pages installations.
                               Manual pages are symlinked or copied here.
         PIPX_GLOBAL_MAN_DIR    Used instead of PIPX_MAN_DIR when the `--global`
                               option is given.
         PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON    Overrides default python used for commands.
         PIPX_USE_EMOJI         Overrides emoji behavior. Default value varies based
                               on platform.
         PIPX_HOME_ALLOW_SPACE  Overrides default warning on spaces in the home path

COMMAND 'pipx install'
       usage: pipx install [-h] [--quiet] [--verbose] [--global] [--include-deps]
                           [--force] [--suffix SUFFIX] [--python PYTHON]
                           [--fetch-missing-python] [--preinstall PREINSTALL]

                           package_spec [package_spec ...]

       The  install  command is the preferred way to globally install apps from python packages on your system. It creates an isolated virtual environment for the package, then ensures the package's apps
       are accessible on your $PATH. The package's manual pages installed in share/man/man[1-9] can be viewed with man on an operating system where it is available and the path in the  environment  vari‐
       able `PIPX_MAN_DIR` (default: ~/.local/share/man) is in the man search path ($MANPATH).

       The  result:  apps you can run from anywhere, located in packages you can cleanly upgrade or uninstall. Guaranteed to not have dependency version conflicts or interfere with your OS's python pack‐
       ages. 'sudo' is not required to do this.

       pipx install PACKAGE_SPEC ...  pipx install --python PYTHON PACKAGE_SPEC pipx install VCS_URL pipx install ./LOCAL_PATH pipx install ZIP_FILE pipx install TAR_GZ_FILE

       The PACKAGE_SPEC argument is passed directly to `pip install`.

       Virtual Environments will be installed to `$PIPX_HOME/venvs`.  The default pipx home location is ~/.local/share/pipx and can be overridden by setting the environment variable `PIPX_HOME`.  If  the
       `--global` option is used, the default pipx home location instead is /opt/pipx and can be overridden by setting the environment variable `PIPX_GLOBAL_HOME`.

       The  default  app location is ~/.local/bin and can be overridden by setting the environment variable `PIPX_BIN_DIR`.  If the `--global` option is used, the default app location instead is /usr/lo‐
       cal/bin and can be overridden by setting the environment variable `PIPX_GLOBAL_BIN_DIR`.

       The default manual pages location is ~/.local/share/man and can be overridden by setting the environment variable `PIPX_MAN_DIR`.  If the `--global` option is used, the default manual pages  loca‐
       tion instead is /usr/local/share/man and can be overridden by setting the environment variable `PIPX_GLOBAL_MAN_DIR`.

       The default python executable used to install a package is /usr/bin/python3.13 and can be overridden by setting the environment variable `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`.

       package_spec
              package name(s) or pip installation spec(s)

                       app ...

       Download the latest version of a package to a temporary virtual environment, then run an app from it. The environment will be cached and re-used for up to 14 days. This means subsequent  calls  to
       'run' for the same package will be faster since they can reuse the cached Virtual Environment.

       In  support  of PEP 582 'run' will use apps found in a local __pypackages__ directory, if present. Please note that this behavior is experimental, and acts as a companion tool to pythonloc. It may
       be modified or removed in the future. See https://github.com/cs01/pythonloc.
