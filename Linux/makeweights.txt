NAME
       makeweights - generate a GNU Backgammon binary weights file

SYNOPSIS
       makeweights [[-f] output [input]]

DESCRIPTION
       makeweights generates GNU Backgammon binary weights file from a text
       input file.  By default, it reads input from standard input and writes
       output to standard output, but input and output files may be specified
       on the command line.  It is only of interest if you want to regenerate
       the gnubg.wd database from a modified gnubg.weights file.

OPTIONS
       -f     This option may be given for compatibility with the options of
              other GNU Backgammon programs but is ignored.

EXAMPLES
       To generate gnubg.wd from gnubg.weights:

           makeweights gnubg.wd gnubg.weights

SEE ALSO
       gnubg(6)
