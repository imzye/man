NAME
       lldb-mi - manual page for lldb-mi 9

DESCRIPTION
       Description:  The Machine Interface Driver (MI Driver) is a stand alone executable that either be used via a client i.e. Eclipse or directly from the command
       line. It processes MI commands, actions those commands using the internal debugger then forms MI response formatted text which is returned to the client.

       Information: Current limitations. The MI Driver currently only handles remote target debugging. Local debugging has not been implemented. The MI  Driver  has
       been designed primarily to be used with Eclipse Juno and a custom plugin.  The custom plugin is not necessary to operate the MI Driver.

       MI driver usage:

              lldb-mi [--longOption] [-s hortOption] [executable]

       --version

              Prints out GNU (gdb) version information. Exit the MI Driver immediately.

       --versionLong

              Prints out MI Driver version information. Exit the MI Driver immediately.

       --interpreter

       -s <filename> --source <filename>
