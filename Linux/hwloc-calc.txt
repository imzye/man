HWLOC-CALC(1)                        hwloc                       HWLOC-CALC(1)

NAME
       hwloc-calc - Operate on cpu mask strings and objects

SYNOPSIS
       hwloc-calc [options] <location1> [<location2> [...] ]

       Note  that hwloc(7) provides a detailed explanation of the hwloc system
       and of valid <location> formats; it should be read before reading  this
       man page.

OPTIONS
       -p --physical
                 Use  OS/physical  indexes instead of logical indexes for both
                 input and output.

       -l --logical
                 Use logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes  for  both
                 input and output (default).

       --pi --physical-input
                 Use OS/physical indexes instead of logical indexes for input.

       --li --logical-input
                 Use  logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes for input
                 (default).

       --po --physical-output
                 Use OS/physical indexes instead of logical indexes  for  out‐
                 put.

       --lo --logical-output
                 Use logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes for output
                 (default, except for cpusets which are always physical).

       -n --nodeset
                 Interpret both input and output sets as nodesets  instead  of
                 CPU sets.

       --no --nodeset-output
                 Report nodesets instead of CPU sets.

       --ni --nodeset-input
                 Interpret input sets as nodesets instead of CPU sets.

       -N --number-of <type|depth>
                 Report  the number of objects of the given type or depth that
                 intersect the CPU set.  This is convenient  for  finding  how
                 many cores, NUMA nodes or PUs are available in a machine.

                 When combined with --nodeset or --nodeset-output, the nodeset
                 is considered instead of the CPU  set  for  finding  matching
                 objects.   This is useful when reporting the output as a num‐
                 ber or set of NUMA nodes.

       -I --intersect <type|depth>
                 Find the list of objects of the  given  type  or  depth  that
                 intersect  the CPU set and report the comma-separated list of
                 their indexes instead of the cpu mask string.   This  may  be
                 used  for  determining the list of objects above or below the
                 input objects.

                 When combined with --physical, the list is convenient to pass
                 to external tools such as taskset or numactl --physcpubind or
                 --membind.  This is different from --largest since the latter
                 requires  that  all  reported  objects  are strictly included
                 inside the input objects.

                 When combined with --nodeset or --nodeset-output, the nodeset
                 is  considered  instead  of  the CPU set for finding matching
                 objects.  This is useful when reporting the output as a  num‐
                 ber or set of NUMA nodes.

       -H --hierarchical <type1>.<type2>...
                 Find  the  list of objects of type <type2> that intersect the
                 CPU set and report the space-separated list of their  hierar‐
                 chical  indexes  with  respect to <type1>, <type2>, etc.  For
                 instance, if package.core is given, the output would be Pack‐
                 age:1.Core:2 Package:2.Core:3 if the input contains the third
                 core of the second package and the fourth core of  the  third
                 package.

                 Only  normal  CPU-side  object  types may be used. NUMA nodes
                 cannot.

       --largest Report (in a human  readable  format)  the  list  of  largest
                 objects  which  exactly include all input objects (by looking
                 at their CPU sets).  None of these output  objects  intersect
                 each  other, and the sum of them is exactly equivalent to the
                 input. No largest object is included in  the  input  This  is
                 different  from --intersect where reported objects may not be
                 strictly included in the input.

       --sep <sep>
                 Change the field separator in  the  output.   By  default,  a
                 space  is  used to separate output objects (for instance when
                 --hierarchical or --largest is given) while a comma  is  used
                 to separate indexes (for instance when --intersect is given).

       --single  Singlify the output to a single CPU.

       --no-smt, --no-smt=<N>
                 Only  keep  the first PU per core in the input locations.  If
                 <N> is specified, keep the <N>-th instead, if any.   PUs  are
                 ordered by physical index during this filtering.

       --taskset Display  CPU  set  strings  in  the  format recognized by the
                 taskset command-line program instead  of  hwloc-specific  CPU
                 set  string  format.  This option has no impact on the format
                 of input CPU set strings, both formats are always accepted.

       --restrict <cpuset>
                 Restrict the topology to the given cpuset.

       --disallowed
                 Include objects disallowed by administrative limitations.

       -i <file>, --input <file>
                 Read topology from XML file <file>  (instead  of  discovering
                 the  topology  on  the local machine).  If <file> is "-", the
                 standard input is used.  XML support must have been  compiled
                 in to hwloc for this option to be usable.

       -i <directory>, --input <directory>
                 Read  topology  from  <directory>  instead of discovering the
                 topology of the local machine.  On Linux, the  directory  may
                 contain  the  topology  files  gathered  from another machine
                 topology with hwloc-gather-topology.  On x86,  the  directory
                 may contain a cpuid dump gathered with hwloc-gather-cpuid.

       -i <specification>, --input <specification>
                 Simulate  a fake hierarchy (instead of discovering the topol‐
                 ogy on the local  machine).  If  <specification>  is  "node:2
                 pu:3",  the  topology will contain two NUMA nodes with 3 pro‐
                 cessing units in each of them.   The  <specification>  string
                 must end with a number of PUs.

       --if <format>, --input-format <format>
                 Enforce  the  input  in  the given format, among xml, fsroot,
                 cpuid and synthetic.

       -q --quiet
                 Hide non-fatal error messages.  It mostly includes  locations
                 pointing to non-existing objects.

       -v --verbose
                 Verbose output.

       --version Report version and exit.

       -h --help Display help message and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       hwloc-calc generates and manipulates CPU mask strings or objects.  Both
       input and output may  be  either  objects  (with  physical  or  logical
       indexes),  CPU  lists  (with  physical or logical indexes), or CPU mask
       strings (always physically indexed).  Input location  specification  is
       described in hwloc(7).

       If  objects or CPU mask strings are given on the command-line, they are
       combined and a single output is printed.  If  no  object  or  CPU  mask
       strings  are given on the command-line, the program will read the stan‐
       dard input.  It will combine multiple objects or CPU mask strings  that
       are  given  on  the same line of the standard input line with spaces as
       separators.  Different input lines will be processed separately.

       Command-line  arguments  and  options  are  processed  in  order.   For
       instance, it means that changing the type of input indexes with --li or
       changing the input topology with -i only  affects  the  processing  the
       following arguments.

       NOTE:  hwloc-calc  cannot  manipulate  NUMA  memory node sets.  It only
       manipulates CPU sets, which means it cannot do much about CPU-less NUMA
       nodes.

       NOTE: It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page
       before reading this man  page.   Most  of  the  concepts  described  in
       hwloc(7) directly apply to the hwloc-calc utility.

EXAMPLES
       hwloc-calc's operation is best described through several examples.

       To display the (physical) CPU mask corresponding to the second package:

           $ hwloc-calc package:1
           0x000000f0

       To  display the (physical) CPU mask corresponding to the third pacakge,
       excluding its even numbered logical processors:

           $ hwloc-calc package:2 ~PU:even
           0x00000c00

       To combine two (physical) CPU masks:

           $ hwloc-calc 0x0000ffff 0xff000000
           0xff00ffff

       To display the list of logical numbers of processors  included  in  the
       second package:

           $ hwloc-calc --intersect PU package:1
           4,5,6,7

       To bind GNU OpenMP threads logically over the whole machine, we need to
       use physical number output instead:

           $ export GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=`hwloc-calc  --physical-output  --inter‐
       sect PU all`
           $ echo $GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY
           0,4,1,5,2,6,3,7

       To  display the list of NUMA nodes, by physical indexes, that intersect
       a given (physical) CPU mask:

           $ hwloc-calc --physical --intersect NUMAnode 0xf0f0f0f0
           0,2

       Converting object logical indexes (default) from/to physical/OS indexes
       may  be performed with --intersect combined with either --physical-out‐
       put (logical to physical conversion) or --physical-input  (physical  to
       logical):

           $ hwloc-calc --physical-output PU:2 --intersect PU
           3
           $ hwloc-calc --physical-input PU:3 --intersect PU
           2

       One  should  add --nodeset when converting indexes of memory objects to
       make sure a single NUMA node index is returned on platforms  with  het‐
       erogeneous memory:

           $ hwloc-calc --nodeset --physical-output node:2 --intersect node
           3
           $ hwloc-calc --nodeset --physical-input node:3 --intersect node
           2

       To display the set of CPUs near network interface eth0:

           $ hwloc-calc os=eth0
           0x00005555

       To  display  the  indexes  of  packages near PCI device whose bus ID is
       0000:01:02.0:

           $ hwloc-calc pci=0000:01:02.0 --intersect Package
           1

       To display the list of per-package cores that intersect the input:

           $ hwloc-calc 0x00003c00 --hierarchical package.core
           Package:2.Core:1 Package:3.Core:0

       To display the (physical) CPU mask of the entire  topology  except  the
       third package:

           $ hwloc-calc all ~package:3
           0x0000f0ff

       To combine both physical and logical indexes as input:

           $ hwloc-calc PU:2 --physical-input PU:3
           0x0000000c

       To synthetize a set of cores into largest objects on a 2-node 2-package
       2-core machine:

           $ hwloc-calc core:0 --largest
           Core:0
           $ hwloc-calc core:0-1 --largest
           Package:0
           $ hwloc-calc core:4-7 --largest
           NUMANode:1
           $ hwloc-calc core:2-6 --largest
           Package:1 Package:2 Core:6
           $ hwloc-calc pack:2 --largest
           Package:2
           $ hwloc-calc package:2-3 --largest
           NUMANode:1

       To get the set of first threads of all cores:

           $ hwloc-calc core:all.pu:0
           $ hwloc-calc --no-smt all

       This can also be very useful in order to make GNU  OpenMP  use  exactly
       one thread per core, and in logical core order:

           $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=`hwloc-calc --number-of core all`
           $ echo $OMP_NUM_THREADS
           4
           $  export  GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=`hwloc-calc --physical-output --inter‐
       sect PU --no-smt all`
           $ echo $GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY
           0,2,1,3

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful execution, hwloc-calc displays the (physical) CPU  mask
       string,  (physical  or  logical)  object list, or (physical or logical)
       object number list.  The return value is 0.

       hwloc-calc will return nonzero if any kind of  error  occurs,  such  as
       (but not limited to): failure to parse the command line.
