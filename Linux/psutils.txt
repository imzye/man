NAME
       PSUtils - PDF and PostScript utilities

DESCRIPTION
       PSUtils is a set of utilities for manipulating PDF and PostScript documents. PostScript files should follow the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions, but this is not checked.

UNITS OF LENGTH
       PSUtils utilities accept lengths in various units:

       •      pt (PostScript points, 72 points per inch)

       •      mm (millimetres)

       •      cm (centimetres)

       •      in (inches, 1 inch is 25.4mm)

       Write the length as a number directly followed by the unit, for example, 4.5mm or 72pt.  If no unit is given, PostScript points are assumed.
