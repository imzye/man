NAME
       apksigner - sign and verify Android APKs

SYNOPSIS
       A command line tool for signing Android APK files and for checking whether signatures of APK files will verify on Android devices:

       apksigner  [options] apk

       apksigner --version

       apksigner --help

       apk is an existing file to sign or verify.

DESCRIPTION
       apksig  is  a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking whether APK's signatures should verify on Android.  apksig supports JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signa‐
       ture Scheme v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).

       The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK signature verification logic between different versions of the Android platform.  apksig can thus check whether a signed APK  is
       expected  to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the APK.  When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform ver‐
       sions supported by the APK being signed.

COMMANDS
       sign

       :This signs the provided APK, stripping out any pre-existing signatures.  Signing is performed using one or more signers, each represented by an asymmetric key pair and  a  corresponding  certifi‐
       cate.  Typically, an APK is signed by just one signer.  For each signer, you need to provide the signer's private key and certificate.

       verify  :This  checks whether the provided APK will verify on Android.  By default, this checks whether the APK will verify on all Android platform versions supported by the APK (as declared using
       minSdkVersion in AndroidManifest.xml).  Use --min-sdk-version and/or --max-sdk-version to verify the APK against a custom range of API Levels.

       lineage :This modifies the capabilities of one or more signers in the provided SigningCertificateLineage.  This can be used to revoke capabilities of a previous signing certificate  once  the  in‐
       stall base has been migrated to the new signing certificate.

       rotate :This takes the provided keys and creates a SigningCertificateLineage entry linking the old to the new, for use in a key rotation scenario using APK Signature Scheme v3.

       version :Show this tool's version number and exit

       help :Show this usage page and exit

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose: Verbose output mode

       -h, --help: Show help about this command and exit

       -Werr: Treat warnings as errors

   sign
       Sign the provided APK

       --out :File into which to output the signed APK.  By default, the APK is signed in-place, overwriting the input file.

       --min-sdk-version  :Lowest  API Level on which this APK's signatures will be verified.  By default, the value from AndroidManifest.xml is used.  The higher the value, the stronger security parame‐
       ters are used when signing.

       --max-sdk-version :Highest API Level on which this APK's signatures will be verified.  By default, the highest possible value is used.

       --v1-signing-enabled :Whether to enable signing using JAR signing scheme (aka v1 signing scheme, the one used in Android since day one).  By default, signing using this scheme is enabled based  on
       min and max SDK version (see --min-sdk-version and --max-sdk-version).

       --v2-signing-enabled :Whether to enable signing using APK Signature Scheme v2 (aka v2 signing scheme, the one introduced in Android Nougat, API Level 24).  By default, signing using this scheme is
       enabled based on min and max SDK version (see --min-sdk-version and --max-sdk-version).

   per-signer options
       These options specify the configuration of a particular signer.  To delimit options of different signers, use --next-signer.

       --next-signer :Delimits options of two different signers.  There is no need to use this option when only one signer is used.

       --v1-signer-name :Basename for files comprising the JAR signature scheme (aka v1 scheme) signature of this signer.  By default, KeyStore key alias or basename of key file is used.

   per-signer signing key & certificate options
       There  are two ways to provide the signer's private key and certificate: (1) Java KeyStore (see --ks), or (2) private key file in PKCS #8 format and certificate file in X.509 format (see --key and
       --cert).

       --ks :Load private key and certificate chain from the Java KeyStore initialized from the specified file.  NONE means no file is needed by KeyStore, which is the case for some PKCS #11 KeyStores.

       --ks-key-alias :Alias under which the private key and certificate are stored in the KeyStore.  This must be specified if the KeyStore contains multiple keys.

       --ks-pass :KeyStore password (see --ks).  The following formats are supported:

       • pass: password provided inline

       • env: password provided in the named environment variable

       • file: password provided in the named file, as a single line

       • stdin password provided on standard input, as a single line

       A password is required to open a KeyStore.  By default, the tool will prompt for password via console or standard input.  When the same file (including standard input) is used for providing multi‐
       ple passwords, the passwords are read from the file one line at a time.  Passwords are read in the order in which signers are specified and, within each signer, KeyStore password  is  read  before
       the key password is read.

       --key-pass  :Password  with which the private key is protected.  By default it is assumed that KeyStore keys are protected using the same password as their KeyStore (see --ks-pass).  The following
       formats are supported:

       • pass: password provided inline

       • env: password provided in the named environment variable

       • file: password provided in the named file, as a single line stdin password provided on standard input, as a single line

       By default, if the key is password-protected, the tool will prompt for password via console or standard input.  When the same file (including standard input) is used for providing  multiple  pass‐
       words,  the  passwords  are read from the file one line at a time.  Passwords are read in the order in which signers are specified and, within each signer, KeyStore password is read before the key
       password is read.

       --pass-encoding

       Additional character encoding (e.g., ibm437 or utf-8) to try for passwords containing non-ASCII characters.  KeyStores created by keytool are often encrypted not using  the  Unicode  form  of  the
       password but rather using the form produced by encoding the password using the console's character encoding.  apksigner by default tries to decrypt using several forms of the password: the Unicode
       form, the form encoded using the JVM default charset, and, on Java 8 and older, the form encoded using the console's charset.  On Java 9, apksigner cannot detect the console's charset and may need
       to be provided with --pass-encoding when a non-ASCII password is used.  --pass-encoding may also need to be provided for a KeyStore created by keytool on a different OS or in a different locale.

       --ks-type :Type/algorithm of KeyStore to use.  By default, the default type is used.

       --ks-provider-name :Name of the JCA Provider from which to request the KeyStore implementation.  By default, the highest priority provider is used.  See --ks-provider-class for the alternative way
       to specify a provider.

       --ks-provider-class :Fully-qualified class name of the JCA Provider from which to request the KeyStore implementation.  By default, the provider is chosen based on --ks-provider-name.

       --ks-provider-arg  :Value  to  pass into the constructor of the JCA Provider class specified by --ks-provider-class.  The value is passed into the constructor as java.lang.String.  By default, the
       no-arg provider's constructor is used.

       --key :Load private key from the specified file.  If the key is password-protected, the password will be prompted via standard input unless specified otherwise using --key-pass.  The file must  be
       in PKCS #8 DER format.

       --cert :Load certificate chain from the specified file.  The file must be in X.509 PEM or DER format.

   verify
       Check whether the provided APK is expected to verify on Android

       --print-certs
              Show information about the APK's signing certificates

       --min-sdk-version :Lowest API Level on which this APK's signatures will be verified.  By default, the value from AndroidManifest.xml is used.

       --max-sdk-version Highest API Level on which this APK's signatures will be verified.  By default, the highest possible value is used.

EXAMPLES
       apksigner  sign  --ks release.jks app.apk apksigner verify --verbose app.apk apksigner lineage --in /path/to/existing/lineage --print-certs -v apksigner rotate --out /path/to/new/file --old-signer
       --ks release.jks --new-signer --ks release2.jks

   sign
       1. Sign an APK using the one and only key in keystore release.jks: $ apksigner sign --ks release.jks app.apk

       2. Sign an APK using a private key and certificate stored as individual files: $ apksigner sign --key release.pk8 --cert release.x509.pem app.apk

       3. Sign an APK using two keys: $ apksigner sign --ks release.jks --next-signer --ks magic.jks app.apk

   verify
       1. Check whether the APK's signatures are expected to verify on all Android platforms declared as supported by this APK: $ apksigner verify app.apk

       2. Check whether the APK's signatures are expected to verify on Android platforms with API Level 15 and higher: $ apksigner verify --min-sdk-version 15 app.apk

   lineage
       1. Remove all capabilities from a previous signer in the linage: $ apksigner lineage --in /path/to/existing/lineage --out /path/to/new/file
       --signer --ks release.jks --set-installed-data false
       --set-shared-uid false --set-permission false --set-rollback false
       --set-auth false

       2. Display details about the signing certificates and their capabilities in the lineage: $ apksigner lineage --in /path/to/existing/lineage --print-certs -v

   rotate
       1. Create a new SigningCertificateLineage to enable rotation: $ apksigner rotate --out /path/to/new/file --old-signer --ks release.jks
       --new-signer --ks release2.jks

       2. Extend an existing SigningCertificateLineage to rotate again after previous rotation: $ apksigner rotate --in /path/to/existing/lineage --out /path/to/new/file
       --old-signer --ks release2.jks --new-signer --ks release3.jks

       3. Create a new SigningCertificateLineage with explicit capabilities for the previous signer: $ apksigner rotate --out /path/to/new/file --old-signer --ks release.jks
       --set-installed-data true --set-shared-uid true --set-permission true --set-rollback false
       --set-auth true --new-signer --ks release2.jks
