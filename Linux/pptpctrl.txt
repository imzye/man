NAME
       pptpctrl - PPTP control connection manager

SYNOPSIS
       pptpctrl pptp-debug-flag no-ipparam-flag ppp-options-value ppp-speed-value ppp-local-ip-value ppp-remote-ip-value [ pptp-call-id ] [ ppp-binary ] [ pptp-logwtmp ]

DESCRIPTION
       pptpctrl is usually run by pptpd(8), but can also be run from inetd(8) if some of the features of pptpd(8), such as IP pool management, and inbuilt TCP wrappers, are not required.

OPTIONS
       pptpctrl  options  are unconventional, as they are designed for use by pptpd(8) rather than users.  The option order is critical.  Flag options consist of a 0 or 1, and must be present.  Value options
       consist of a 0, or a 1 followed by the value.  Either the 0 or both the 1 and the value must be present.  The remaining options are optional, but must be present in the defined order.  The options are
       as follows:

       pptp-debug-flag
              if set (1), enables debug messages to syslog from pptpctrl.  This has no effect on the setting of the PPP debug option.

       no-ipparam-flag
              if set, pptpctrl will not pass the client's IP address to pppd(8) using the ipparam option.  See the noipparam option in pptpd.conf(5).

       ppp-options-value
              file to use for PPP options.  See the file option in pppd(8).

       ppp-speed-value
              value for the speed option given to pppd(8).  Note that on Linux, this parameter is ineffective.

       ppp-local-ip-value
              if set, specifies the IP address that pppd(8) is to use for the network interface on the server.  If not set, pppd(8) will determine it based on options; usually it will be the ethernet address
              of the server.

       ppp-remote-ip-value
              if set, specifies the IP address that pppd(8) is to use for the network interface on the client.  If not set, pppd(8) will determine it based on options; usually it will be the ethernet address
              of the client, or an address given in chap-secrets.  Must be set if ppp-local-ip-value is set.

       pptp-call-id
              if present, specifies the call identification for the PPTP session.  If omitted, the call identification is zero.  Normally the ID is allocated by pptpd(8) and passed to pptpctrl.

       ppp-binary
              if present, path to the PPP binary to use.  If omitted, the default value is used.

       pptp-logwtmp
              if present, specifies whether wtmp(5) should be updated as users connect and disconnect.

FILES
       none.
