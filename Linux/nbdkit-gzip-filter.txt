NAME
       nbdkit-gzip-filter - decompress a .gz file

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit file --filter=gzip FILENAME.gz

DESCRIPTION
       "nbdkit-gzip-filter" is a filter for nbdkit(1) which transparently decompresses a gzip-compressed file.  You can place this filter on top of nbdkit-file-plugin(1) to decompress a local .gz file, or on
       top of other plugins such as nbdkit-curl-plugin(1):

        nbdkit curl --filter=gzip https://example.com/disk.gz

       With nbdkit-tar-filter(1) it can be used to extract files from a compressed tar file:

        nbdkit curl --filter=tar --filter=gzip \
               https://example.com/file.tar.gz tar-entry=disk.img

       The filter only allows read-only connections.

       Note that gzip files are not very good for random access in large files because seeking to a position in the gzip file involves decompressing all data before that point in the file.  A more practical
       method to compress large disk images is to use the xz(1) format and nbdkit-xz-filter(1).

       To allow seeking this filter has to keep the contents of the complete uncompressed file, which it does in a hidden temporary file under $TMPDIR.

PARAMETERS
       There are no parameters specific to this plugin.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       "TMPDIR"
           Because the gzip format is not seekable, this filter has to store the complete contents of the compressed file in a temporary file located in /var/tmp by default.  You can override this location
           by setting the "TMPDIR" environment variable before starting nbdkit.

FILES
       $filterdir/nbdkit-gzip-filter.so
           The plugin.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $filterdir.

VERSION
       "nbdkit-gzip-filter" first appeared in nbdkit 1.22.  It is derived from "nbdkit-gzip-plugin" which first appeared in nbdkit 1.0.
