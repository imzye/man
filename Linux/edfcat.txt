NAME
            edfcat -- EDF file channel mixer/converter.

SYNOPSIS
            edfcat OPERATION OPERANDS

DESCRIPTION
       edfcat  is  a  tool to manipulate EDF file channels.  Currently, two operations are supported: (1) ascii->edf conversion (multichannel conversion restricted to channels with identical samplerate), and
       (2) channel pruning.

       conv FILE.ascii SAMPLERATE RECORD_SIZE
              Convert samples in FILE.ascii into FILE.ascii.edf.  Multiple columns in the source file will be converted as individual channels.

              On success, physical_min/max in each channel will be set to the absolute min/max of all channel data, widened symmetrically to whichever boundary is farther from 0 (thus, a range  of  -2:3  be‐
              comes -3:3, as will -3:2).

       prune FILE.edf N1[,N2,...]
              Create a copy of source file (FILE-mod.edf) only keeping channels N1,N2,... (1-based).
