NAME
       classified-ads - Program for posting ads online for others to see

SYNOPSIS
       classified-ads

DESCRIPTION
       Classified ads is a program for online communications.  Main features include server-less design, public announcements, private messages, user data and comments. For longer explanation of the
       program, please see "About" dialog inside the program.

FILES
       For  each  individual  user  a  file $HOME/.classified_ads/sqlite_db is created. This is a normal sqlite database that contains state of the program. For backup purpose a copy may be made and
       later restored while the program is not running. Restoring an old file fully resets the programs state to moment when backup was taken.

       Upon uninstall of the program, the datafile is left lingering around.  Users who are sure they'll never use the program again should delete the file by hand. Note that users' encryption  keys
       are inside this file among other data so deleting the file will affect users' ability to access private messages later.
