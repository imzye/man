NAME
       xrootdfs - xrootd FUSE file system daemon

SYNOPSIS
       xrootdfs [options] parameters

DESCRIPTION
       The xrootdfs daemon provides a file system view of an xrootd cluster using FUSE.  Usage synopsis can be displayed by typing "xrootdfs -h".  Short documentation can be found in a README file in the
       src/XrdFfs source directory.

EXAMPLES
       Assuming the redirector is rdr:port

       run from command line with debugging output
              xrootdfs -d -o rdr=root://rdr:port//data,uid=daemon /mnt

       use in /etc/fstab
              xrootdfs /mnt fuse rdr=root://rdr:port//data,uid=daemon 1 2

       use with autofs
              1. add a line to /etc/auto.master
              /- /etc/auto.fuse

              2. create /etc/auto.fuse with the following one line
              /mnt -fstype=fuse,uid=2,rdr=root://rdr\:port//data :xrootdfs.sh

              3. create script /usr/bin/xrootdfs.sh (make sure +x bit is set)
              #!/bin/sh
              exec /usr/bin/xrootdfs $@ >/dev/null 2>&1

NOTES
       Documentation for all components associated with xrootdfs can be found at https://xrootd.org/docs.html

       xrootdfs allows users and administators to query and change the internal parameters on the fly via the filesystem extended attributes

       getfattr -n attribute_name /mount_point
       setfattr -n attribute_name [ -v value ] /mount_point

       attribute_name:
              xroot.url: query the actual ROOT url of the file (this is an old one)
              xrootdfs.fs.nworkers: query or change the number of threads working in parallel on operations such as stat(), unlink()/rmdir(), readdir(), statvfs(), etc.
              xrootdfs.fs.dataserverlist: query or refresh the list of all data servers known to this xrootdfs instance (or "kill -USR1 pid" to refresh)

SECURITY
       By default, XrootdFS does not send individual user identity to the Xrootd storage servers.  So Xrootd storage thinks that all operations from an XrootdFS instance come from the user that runs the
       XrootdFS instance. When the Xrootd "sss" security module (Simple Shared Security) is enabled at both XrootdFS and Xrootd storage system, XrootdFS will send individual user identity information to
       the Xrootd storage servers. This info can be used along with the Xrootd ACL to control file/directory access.

       To use "sss" security module, both Xrootd data servers and XrootdFS should be configured to use "sss" in a particular way, e.g. both sides should use a key file that contains the same key gener‐
       ated by the xrdsssadmin program in the following way:

       xrdsssadmin -k my_key_name -u anybody -g usrgroup add keyfile

       (change only "my_key_name" and "keyfile"). Please refer to environment variable "XrdSecsssKT" in Xrootd "Authentication & Access Control Configuration Reference" for more information on the loca‐
       tion of the keyfile and its unix permission bits. That same document also describes the Xrootd ACL DB file.

       To enable "sss" with XrootdFS, use the sss=/keyfile option with XrootdFS.

       The following example shows how to use both unix and sss security modules with the Xrootd data servers.

                xrootd.seclib /usr/lib64/libXrdSec.so
                sec.protocol /usr/lib64 sss -s /keyfile
                sec.protocol /usr/lib64 unix
                acc.authdb /your_xrootd_ACL_auth_db_file
                acc.authrefresh 300
                ofs.authorize

DIAGNOSTICS
       Errors yield an error message and a non-zero exit status.  The program never exits upon success.  Use the umount command to terminate the program.
