NAME
       Bio::DB::HTS::Kseq::Iterator - The Kseq iterator

DESCRIPTION
       An object for iterating through the available records. Other methods are available but are undocumented because you should be using the "next_seq" methods as much as possible.

SYNOPSIS
         my $iter = $kseq->iterator();
         while(my $r = $iter->next_seq()) {
           say $r->name;
           say $r->desc;
           say $r->seq;
           say $r->qual;
         }

   METHODS
       "next_seq"
               Returns a blessed "Bio::DB::HTS::Kseq::Record" instance.

       "next_seq_hash"
               Returns a raw HashRef with the keys name, desc, seq and qual available.
