DESCRIPTION
       The dhcpctl set of functions provide an API that can be used to communicate with and manipulate a running ISC DHCP server. All functions return a value of isc_result_t.  The return values reflects
       the  result  of  operations  to  local  data  structures.  If  an  operation  fails  on  the  server  for  any  reason,  then  the error result will be returned through the second parameter of the
       dhcpctl_wait_for_completion() call.

       dhcpctl_initialize() sets up the data structures the library needs to do its work. This function must be called once before any other.

       dhcpctl_connect() opens a connection to the DHCP server at the given host and port. If an authenticator has been created for the connection, then it is given as the 4th argument. On  a  successful
       return the address pointed at by the first argument will have a new connection object assigned to it.

       For example:

             s = dhcpctl_connect(&cxn, "127.0.0.1", 7911, NULL);

       connects to the DHCP server on the localhost via port 7911 (the standard OMAPI port). No authentication is used for the connection.

       dhcpctl_timed_connect()  opens  a connection to the DHCP server at the given host and port. If an authenticator has been created for the connection, then it is given as the 4th argument. On a suc‐
       cessful return the address pointed at by the first argument will have a new connection object assigned to it.  How long the function waits for complete the connection is dictated by the  value  of
       the  parameter,  timeout.  If  the  value is null, it will wait indefinitely Otherwise it will wait for the amount of time specified by timeout (tv_sec:tv_usec). Values of zero for both fields are
       valid but not recommended.  An example is shown below:

       For example:

             struct timeval timeout;
             timeout.tv_sec = 5;   /* wait for 5 seconds */
             timeout.tv_usec = 0;

             s = dhcpctl_connect(&cxn, "127.0.0.1", 7911, NULL, &timeout);

       connects to the DHCP server on the localhost via port 7911 (the standard OMAPI port). No authentication is used for the connection.  It allows 5 seconds for the connect to complete.

       dhcpctl_disconnect() closes the open connection specified by the first parameter, cxn.  Note that this call will free the connection object and cxn will be set to
        nul.  If the second parameter,force, is nonzero, the connection will be closed immediately. Otherwise the receiving end will be shut down but any unsent data will be sent before actually  closing
       the socket.  Note that disconnecting only destroys the connection object, any other objects previously created will still exist.

       For example:

             s = dhcpctl_disconnect(&cxn, 1);

       will close the connection immediately.  This funcion should be considered EXPERIMENTAL.

       dhcpctl_wait_for_completion() flushes a pending message to the server and waits for the response. The result of the request as processed on the server is returned via the second parameter.

             s = dhcpctl_wait_for_completion(cxn, &wv);
             if (s != ISC_R_SUCCESS)
                     local_failure(s);
             else if (wv != ISC_R_SUCCESS)
                     server_failure(wc);

       The call to dhcpctl_wait_for_completion() won't return until the remote message processing completes or the connection to the server is lost.

       dhcpctl_timed_wait_for_completion() flushes a pending message to the server and waits for the response.  How long the function waits for a response is dictated by the value of the third parameter,
       timeout.  If  the  value is null, it will wait indefinitely or until the connection is lost. Otherwise it will wait for the amount of time specified by timeout (tv_sec:tv_usec). Values of zero for
       both fields are valid but not recommended.  The result of the request as processed on the server is returned via the second parameter.  An example is shown below:

             struct timeval timeout;
             timeout.tv_sec = 5;   /* wait for 5 seconds */
             timeout.tv_usec = 0;

             s = dhcpctl_wait_for_completion(cxn, &wv, &timeout);
             if (s != ISC_R_SUCCESS) {
                     local_failure(s);
             } else if (wv != ISC_R_SUCCESS) {
                     server_failure(wc);
             }

       If the function times out, the status returned will be ISC_R_TIMEDOUT. Please note that even though the function is no longer waiting for a response, the server does not abandon  the  request  and
       may  still  respond  by  writing the response to the socket. A subsequent call to either this function or dhcpctl_wait_for_completion() will see that data and read it. Depending on the application
       logic flow this may or may not be desired.  Currently though only mechanism for "flushing" this data is to close the connection by calling disconnet(), and then reconnecting via connect().  Please
       note this function should be considered EXPERIMENTAL.

       dhcpctl_get_value() extracts a value of an attribute from the handle. The value can be of any length and is treated as a  sequence  of  bytes.   The  handle  must  have  been  created  first  with
       dhcpctl_new_object() and opened with dhcpctl_open_object().  The value is returned via the parameter named “value”.  The last parameter is the name of attribute to retrieve.

             dhcpctl_data_string value = NULL;
             dhcpctl_handle lease;
             time_t thetime;

             s = dhcpctl_get_value (&value, lease, "ends");
             assert(s == ISC_R_SUCCESS && value->len == sizeof(thetime));
             memcpy(&thetime, value->value, value->len);

       dhcpctl_get_boolean() extracts a boolean valued attribute from the object handle.

       The dhcpctl_set_value(), dhcpctl_set_string_value(), dhcpctl_set_boolean_value(), and dhcpctl_set_int_value() functions all set a value on the object handle.

       dhcpctl_object_update()  function  queues a request for all the changes made to the object handle be sent to the remote for processing. The changes made to the attributes on the handle will be ap‐
       plied to remote object if permitted.

       dhcpctl_object_refresh() queues up a request for a fresh copy of all the attribute values to be sent from the remote to refresh the values in the local object handle.

       dhcpctl_object_remove() queues a request for the removal on the server of the object referenced by the handle.

       The dhcpctl_set_callback() function sets up a user-defined function to be called when an event completes on the given object handle. This is needed for asynchronous handling of events, versus  the
       synchronous  handling given by dhcpctl_wait_for_completion().  When the function is called the first parameter is the object the event arrived for, the second is the status of the message that was
       processed, the third is the same value as the second parameter given to dhcpctl_set_callback().

       The dhcpctl_new_authenticator() creates a new authenticator object to be used for signing the messages that cross over the network. The “name”, “algorithm”, and “secret” values must all match what
       the server uses and are defined in its configuration file. The created object is returned through the first parameter and must be used as the 4th parameter to  dhcpctl_connect().   Note  that  the
       'secret' value must not be base64 encoded, which is different from how the value appears in the dhcpd.conf file.

       dhcpctl_new_object() creates a local handle for an object on the server. The “object_type” parameter is the ascii name of the type of object being accessed. e.g.  "lease".  This function only sets
       up local data structures, it does not queue any messages to be sent to the remote side, dhcpctl_open_object() does that.

       dhcpctl_open_object()  builds  and  queues  the request to the remote side. This function is used with handle created via dhcpctl_new_object().  The flags argument is a bit mask with the following
       values available for setting:

             DHCPCTL_CREATE
                 if the object does not exist then the remote will create it

             DHCPCTL_UPDATE
                 update the object on the remote side using the attributes already set in the handle.

             DHCPCTL_EXCL
                 return and error if the object exists and DHCPCTL_CREATE was also specified

       The omapi_data_string_new() function allocates a new dhcpctl_data_string object. The data string will be large enough to hold “length” bytes of data. The “file”  and  “lineno”  arguments  are  the
       source file location the call is made from, typically by using the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros or the MDL macro defined in

       dhcpctl_data_string_dereference() deallocates a data string created by omapi_data_string_new().  The memory for the object won't be freed until the last reference is released.

EXAMPLES
       The  following program will connect to the DHCP server running on the local host and will get the details of the existing lease for IP address 10.0.0.101. It will then print out the time the lease
       is due to expire. Note that most error checking has been omitted for brevity.
