NAME
       plxload - show what files a perl program loads at compile time

SYNOPSYS
           $ plxload

DESCRIPTION
       This program is used to show what modules a program would load at
       compile time via "use".  Because this installs an at-exit handler and
       then uses Perl's -c flag for compile only, it will not find modules
       loaded at run-time.  Use the Devel::Loaded module for that.

EXAMPLES
           $ plxload perldoc
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/Exporter.pm
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/strict.pm
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/vars.pm
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/i686-linux/Config.pm
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/Getopt/Std.pm

           $ plxload /usr/src/perl5.005_54/installhtml
