NAME
       seqsplit - split seqs into chunks of defined size and overlap

SYNOPSIS
       seqsplit [-options] <seqfile>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the seqsplit command.

       seqsplit is a program that splits sequences into smaller chunks of defined size and overlap; output a FASTA file.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; display usage and version.

       -o <file>
              Output the new FASTA file to <file>.

       --fragfile <f>
              Save one-line-per-frag coord summary file to <f>.

       --informat <s>
              Specify sequence file format <s>.

       --length <n>
              Set max length of each unique seq frag to <n>.

       --overlap <n>
              Set overlap length to <n> (total frag size = length+overlap).

       --shortnames
              Use short "frag1" names, not "<src>/<from>-<to>".

LIMITATIONS
       Still working in 32 bits -- no sequence can be more than 2 GB in size.
