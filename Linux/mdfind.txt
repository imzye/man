NAME
       mdfind - Run Spotlight searches against an SMB server

SYNOPSIS
       mvxattr {server} {sharename} {query} [-p, --path] [-L, --live]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(1) suite.

       mdfind is a simple utility to run Spotlight searches against an SMB
       server that runs the Spotlight mdssvc RPC service.

OPTIONS
       server
           The SMB server name or IP address to connect to.

       sharename
           The name of a share on the server.

       query
           The query expression syntax is a simplified form of filename
           globbing familiar to shell users. Queries have the following
           format:

           attribute=="value"

           For queries against a Samba server with Spotlight enabled using the
           Elasticsearch backend, the list of supported metadata attributes is
           given by the JSON attribute mapping file, typically installed at
           /usr/share/samba/mdssvc/elasticsearch_mappings.json

       -p PATH, --path=PATH
           Server side path to search, defaults to "/"

       -L, --live
           Query remains running.

EXAMPLES
       Search all indexed metadata attributes, exact match:

                 '*=="Samba"'

       Search all indexed metadata attributes, prefix match:

                 '*=="Samba*"'

       Search by filename:

                 'kMDItemFSName=="Samba*"'

       Search by date:

                 'kMDItemFSContentChangeDate<$time.iso(2018-10-01T10:00:00Z)'

       Search files's content:

                 'kMDItemTextContent=="Samba*"'

       Expressions:

                 kMDItemFSName=="Samba*"||kMDItemTextContent=="Tango*"'
