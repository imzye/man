NAME
       sfddiff - compare two font files

SYNOPSIS
       sfddiff [--help] [--ignorehints] [--ignorenames] [--ignoregpos] [--ignoregsub] [--ignorebitmaps] [--exact] [--warn] [--merge outfile] [--usage] [--version] fontfile1 fontfile2

DESCRIPTION
       The program sfddiff compares two font files, which may be in any format that fontforge(1) can read.  It will notice the following differences:

       1)  Characters are present in one font but not in the other.

       2)  Characters  are  present  in both fonts but have different sets of outlines or references. The outlines may be compared so that only exact matches are accepted, or so that a fuzzier match is used.
           Similarly references may need to match exactly, or may be matched after an unlink.  This fuzzy comparison is useful when comparing truetype and postscript fonts, or when comparing a font with ref‐
           erences to one without.

       3)  The PostScript hints or TrueType instructions are different.

       4)  The font names (the TrueType 'name' tables) differ.

       5)  The kerning (and other 'gpos' information) differs.

       6)  The ligatures (and other 'gsub' information) differ.

       7)  Any bitmap strikes present in one font but not in the other.

       8)  Any bitmap characters present in one strike of one font but not in the equivalent strike of the other.

       9)  Any bitmap characters which differ.

OPTIONS
       --help          Provide a description with a list of the available options.

       --ignorehints   Suppress the reporting of hint/instruction differences.

       --ignoregpos    Suppress the reporting of kerning (and other 'gpos') differences.

       --ignoregsub    Suppress the reporting of ligature (and other 'gsub') differences.

       --ignorenames   Suppress the reporting of name string differences.

       --ignorebitmaps Suppress the reporting of bitmap differences.

       --exact         Require outlines to match exactly.

       --warn          Warn if the outlines/references are slightly different.

       --merge outfile Store  a  merged  version  of  the  two fonts into the specified output file.  The merged data will be based on sfdfile1, any characters present in sfdfile2 but not in sfdfile1 will be
                       added, and the outlines of sfdfile2 will be placed in the background.  Finally, for any characters with different outlines or references the background of the  character  will  contain
                       the outlines from sfdfile2 (references will be unlinked into outlines and those outlines also will be added).

       --usage         Display the usage description.

       --version       Display the current version.
