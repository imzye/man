NAME
       downloadosmtiles - Download map tiles from OpenStreetMap

SYNOPSIS
         downloadosmtiles --lat=49.5611:49.6282 --lon=10.951:11.0574 --zoom=13:14
         downloadosmtiles --link='http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=-23.5872&lon=-46.6508&zoom=12&layers=B000FTF'
         downloadosmtiles --loadtilelist=filename

DESCRIPTION
       This script downloads all map tiles from an OpenStreetMap tile server for some geographic region in a range of zoom levels.  The PNG images of the tiles are stored in a directory tree that mirrors
       the paths from the server.

       A bounding box of geographic coordinates and a range of zoom levels must be selected by command line options.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       Command line options may be abbreviated as long as they remain unambiguous.

       At least either "--latitude", "--longitude", and "--zoom" or "--link" must be specified.

   "--latitude=latmin[:latmax]"
       Selects the latitude of the bounding box of coordinates to download.  May be one single real value or two real values separated by a colon in the range "-85.0511..85.0511".  If given only one
       value, just the tile (or row of tiles) at this latitude will be downloaded.

       Default: none

   "--longitude=lonmin[:lonmax]"
       Selects the longitude of the bounding box of coordinates to download.  May be one single real value or two real values separated by a colon in the range "-180.0..180.0".  If given only one value,
       just the tile (or column of tiles) at this longitude will be downloaded.

       Default: none

   "--zoom=zoommin[:zoommax]"
       Selects the range of zoom levels to download the map tiles for.  May be one single integer value or two integer values separated by a colon.  OpenStreetMap supports zoom levels in the range 0..18.
       (This depends on the base URL and is not enforced by this script.)

       Note that the number of tiles to download grows by a factor of up to four with each zoom level.

       Default: none

   "--link=url"
       An URL selecting "--latitude", "--longitude", and "--zoom" in one argument.  The idea is to select the current view of OSM's slippy map by its permalink.

       The argument to "--link" must be an URL containing the HTTP options "?lat=s&lon=s&zoom=s".  (Actually, the base URL will be ignored.)  The script chooses a box around the latitude and longitude
       options.  The size of the box depends on the zoom option.

       If combined with "--latitude", "--longitude", or "--zoom", these explicitly specified values override the implicitly specified values from "--link".

       Default: none

   "--baseurl=url"
       The base URL of the server to download the tiles from.

       Default: <http://tile.openstreetmap.org> (This is the base URL for the Mapnik tiles.)

   "--destdir=dir"
       The directory where the tiles will be stored.  The PNG files will be stored as "dir/zoom/x/y.png".

       Default: The current working directory.

   "--quiet"
       Do not write any diagnostic messages.  Only fatal errors will be reported.

   "--dumptilelist=filename"
       Do not download any tiles at all, but write a list of tiles as selected by other command line options to the file named "filename".  See "TILE LISTS" below.

   "--loadtilelist=filename"
       Read a list of tiles to download from the file "filename".  See "TILE LISTS" below.

EXAMPLE
       Select the region of interest in OSM's slippy map and follow the permalink in the lower left of the window.  Lets assume this permalink to be
       <http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=49.5782&lon=11.0076&zoom=12&layers=B000FTF>.  Then

         downloadosmtiles --link='http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=49.5782&lon=11.0076&zoom=12&layers=B000FTF' --zoom=5:18

       will download all tiles from zoom level 5 to 18 for this region.

TILE LISTS
       A list of tiles may be stored to and retrieved from external files using the "--dumptilelist" and "--loadtilelist" command line options.  A set of tiles may be selected using the command line
       options "--latitude", "--longitude", "--zoom", and "--link" and written to a file specified with "--dumptilelist".  This list may be read at a later date using the "--loadtilelist" option.

       This may be useful to postpone the download of the tiles, to edit the list of tiles, or to use some external tool to generate this list.

       The tile lists are read and written in YAML format.  Please note that this is an experimental feature in the current version.  The file format is not considered stable yet.  There is no guarantee
       that a list of tiles generated by one version of this script may be read in by a future version.

ENVIRONMENT
       http_proxy
       ftp_proxy
       xxx_proxy
       no_proxy
           These environment variables can be set to enable communication through a proxy server.  This is implemented by LWP::UserAgent.

BUGS
       •   Ranges in the command line options must always be increasing.  While this is considered a feature for "--latitude" and "--zoom", it means that it is impossible for a range in the "--longitude"
           argument to cross the 180 degree line.  A command line option like "--longitude=179.5:-179.5" will not work as one should expect.

       •   The  bounding  box  selected  by  the "--link" command line option does not always correspond to the current view in the slippy map.  The problem is that the permalink from the slippy map only
           contains one position and not the bounds of the current view.  The actual view of the slippy map depends on many factors, including the size of the browser window.  Thus,  there  is  not  much
           that can be done about this issue.
