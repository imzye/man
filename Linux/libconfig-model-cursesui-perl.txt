NAME
       Config::Model::CursesUI - Curses interface to edit config data

SYNOPSIS
        use Config::Model ;
        use Config::Model::CursesUI ;

        my $model = Config::Model -> new ;

        my $inst = $model->instance (
           root_class_name => 'XXX',
           instance_name   => 'yyy'
        );

        # create dialog
        my $dialog = Config::Model::CursesUI-> new () ;

        # start never returns
        $dialog->start($model) ;

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides a Curses::UI interface to configuration data managed by Config::Model.

       IMPORTANT: Once the CursesUI object is created, STDOUT and STDERR are managed by the Curses interface, so all print and warn will not work as expected.

CONSTRUCTOR
       The constructor accepts the following parameters:

       load
           Subroutine  ref  containing the code to load the configuration data from the configuration files. This may overrides loading mechanism specified in the model with Config::Model::AutoRead. This
           sub is called without any arguments.

       store
           Subroutine ref containing the code to store the configuration data in the configuration files.  This may overrides writing mechanism specified in the model with  Config::Model::AutoRead.  This
           sub is called without any arguments.
