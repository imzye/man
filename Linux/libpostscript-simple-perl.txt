NAME
       PostScript::Simple::EPS - EPS support for PostScript::Simple

SYNOPSIS
           use PostScript::Simple;

           # create a new PostScript object
           $p = new PostScript::Simple(papersize => "A4",
                                       colour => 1,
                                       units => "in");

           # create a new page
           $p->newpage;

           # add an eps file
           $p->add_eps({xsize => 3}, "test.eps", 1,1);
           $p->add_eps({yscale => 1.1, xscale => 1.8}, "test.eps", 4,8);

           # create an eps object
           $e = new PostScript::Simple::EPS(file => "test.eps");
           $e->rotate(90);
           $e->xscale(0.5);
           $p->add_eps($e, 3, 3); # add eps object to postscript object
           $e->xscale(2);
           $p->add_eps($e, 2, 5); # add eps object to postscript object again

           # write the output to a file
           $p->output("file.ps");

DESCRIPTION
       PostScript::Simple::EPS allows you to add EPS files into PostScript::Simple objects.  Included EPS files can be scaled and rotated, and placed anywhere inside a PostScript::Simple page.

       Remember when using translate/scale/rotate that you will normally need to do the operations in the reverse order to that which you expect.

PREREQUISITES
       This module requires "PostScript::Simple", "strict", "Carp" and "Exporter".

   EXPORT
       None.

CONSTRUCTOR
       "new(options)"
           Create a new PostScript::Simple::EPS object. The options that can be set are:

           file
               EPS file to be included. This or "source" must exist when the "new" method is called.

           source
               PostScript code for the EPS document. Either this or "file" must be set when "new" is called.

           clip
               Set to 0 to disable clipping to the EPS bounding box. Default is to clip.

           Example:

               $ps = new PostScript::Simple(landscape => 1,
                                            eps => 0,
                                            xsize => 4,
                                            ysize => 3,
                                            units => "in");

               $eps = new PostScript::Simple::EPS(file => "test.eps");

               $eps->scale(0.5);

           Scale the EPS file by x0.5 in both directions.

               $ps->newpage();
               $ps->importeps($eps, 1, 1);

           Add the EPS file to the PostScript document at coords (1,1).

               $ps->importepsfile("another.eps", 1, 2, 4, 4);

           Easily add an EPS file to the PostScript document using bounding box (1,2),(4,4).

           The methods "importeps" and "importepsfile" are described in the documentation of "PostScript::Simple".

OBJECT METHODS
       All object methods return 1 for success or 0 in some error condition (e.g. insufficient arguments). Error message text is also drawn on the page.

       "get_bbox"
           Returns the EPS bounding box, as specified on the %%BoundingBox line of the EPS file. Units are standard PostScript points.

           Example:

               ($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2) = $eps->get_bbox();

       "width"
           Returns the EPS width, in PostScript points.

           Example:

             print "EPS width is " . abs($eps->width()) . "\n";

       "height"
           Returns the EPS height, in PostScript points.

           Example:

           To scale $eps to 72 points high, do:

             $eps->scale(1, 72/$eps->height());

       "scale(x, y)"
           Scales the EPS file. To scale in one direction only, specify 1 as the other scale. To scale the EPS file the same in both directions, you may use the shortcut of just specifying the one value.

           Example:

               $eps->scale(1.2, 0.8); # make wider and shorter
               $eps->scale(0.5);      # shrink to half size

       "rotate(deg)"
           Rotates the EPS file by "deg" degrees anti-clockwise. The EPS file is rotated about it's own origin (as defined by it's bounding box). To rotate by a particular co-ordinate (again, relative to
           the EPS file, not the main PostScript document), use translate, too.

           Example:

               $eps->rotate(180);        # turn upside-down

           To rotate 30 degrees about point (50,50):

               $eps->translate(50, 50);
               $eps->rotate(30);
               $eps->translate(-50, -50);

       "translate(x, y)"
           Move the EPS file by "x","y" PostScript points.

           Example:

               $eps->translate(10, 10);      # move 10 points in both directions

       "reset"
           Clear all translate, rotate and scale operations.

           Example:

               $eps->reset();

       "load"
           Reads the EPS file into memory, to save reading it from file each time if inserted many times into a document. Can not be used with "preload".

       "preload(object)"
           Experimental:  defines  the  EPS at in the document prolog, and just runs a command to insert it each time it is used. "object" is a PostScript::Simple object. If the EPS file is included more
           than once in the PostScript file then this will probably shrink the filesize quite a lot.

           Can not be used at the same time as "load", or when using EPS objects defined from PostScript source.

           Example:

               $p = new PostScript::Simple();
               $e = new PostScript::Simple::EPS(file => "test.eps");
               $e->preload($p);

BUGS
       This is software in development; some current functionality may not be as expected, and/or may not work correctly.

AUTHOR
       The PostScript::Simple::EPS module was written by Matthew Newton, after prods for such a feature from several people around the world. A useful importeps function that provides scaling and  aspect
       ratio operations was gratefully received from Glen Harris, and merged into this module.
