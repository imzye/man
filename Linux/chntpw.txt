NAME
       samunlock - unlock users in the SAM user database

SYNOPSIS
       samunlock [options] -uuser <samfile>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the samunlock command.

       samunlock  is  a  non-interactive  command  line  utility that can unlock a user and/or the user's account bits from the SAM user database file of a Microsoft Windows system (Windows NT, 2000, XP,
       Vista, 7, 8.1, etc.).  This file is usually located at \WINDOWS\system32\config\SAM on the file system of a Microsoft Windows Operating System

       On success, the program does not output any informatin and the exit code is 0.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -U     Unlock the user.

       -a     Unlock all the users. If this option is used there is no need to specify the next option.

       -u <user>
              User to unlock. The user value can be provided as a username, or a RID number in hexadecimal (if the username is preceded with '0x'). Usernames including international characters will prob‐
              ably not work.

       -l     Lists the users in the SAM database.

       -H     Output human readable output. The program by default will print a parsable table unless this option is used.

       -N     Do not allocate more information, only allow the editing of existing values with same size.

       -E     Do not expand the hive file (safe mode).

       -t     Print debug information of allocated blocks.

       -v     Print verbose information and debug messages.

EXAMPLES
       samunlock -U -u theboss
              Unlock an user named 'theboss', if found.

       samunlock -U -u 0x3ea
              Unlock an user with RID '0x3a'.

KNOWN BUGS
       If the username includes international (non-ASCII) characters the program will not (usually) find it. Use the RID number instead.
