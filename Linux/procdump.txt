NAME
       procdump - generate coredumps based on performance triggers.

SYNOPSIS
       procdump [ -n count ] [ -s seconds ] [ -c|-cl CPU usage ] [ -m|-ml usage ] [ -gcm [[gc-generation:|LOH:|POH:]mem_usage[,mem_usage,...]]  ] [ -gcgen generation ] [ -tc threshold ] [ -fc threshold ]
       [ -sig number ] [ -e ] [ -f filter,...  ] [ -pf frequency ] [ -o ] [ -log ] [[ [ -w name ] | [ -pgid pid ] ] [ file | folder ]]

DESCRIPTION
       procdump  is  a Linux reimagining of the class ProcDump tool from the Sysinternals suite of tools for Windows. Procdump provides a convenient way for Linux developers to create core dumps of their
       application based on performance triggers.

OPTIONS
       -n     Number of dumps to write before exiting.

       -s     Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10).

       -c     CPU threshold above which to create a dump of the process.

       -cl    CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process.

       -m     Memory commit threshold(s) (MB) above which to create dumps.

       -ml    Memory commit threshold(s) (MB) below which to create dumps.

       -gcm   [.NET] GC memory threshold(s) (MB) above which to create dumps for the specified generation or heap (default is total .NET memory usage).

       -gcgen [.NET] Create dump when the garbage collection of the specified generation starts and finishes.

       -tc    Thread count threshold above which to create a dump of the process.

       -fc    File descriptor count threshold above which to create a dump of the process.

       -sig   Signal number to intercept to create a dump of the process.

       -e     [.NET] Create dump when the process encounters an exception.

       -f     [.NET] Filter (include) on the (comma separated) exception name(s) and exception messages(s). Supports wildcards.

       -pf    Polling frequency.

       -o     Overwrite existing dump file.

       -log   Writes extended ProcDump tracing to syslog.

       -w     Wait for the specified process to launch if it's not running.

       -pgid  Process ID specified refers to a process group ID.
