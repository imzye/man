NAME
       doccentral - web-based documentation browser

SYNOPSIS
       doccentral [document-name]

OPTIONS
       The  only option that can be passed to the doccentral wrapper is a document name (often the same as the name of the package which provides it) for direct access (automatic search for the given pa‐
       rameter).

DESCRIPTION
       Doc-Central is a simple tool to help you browse the documentation installed on your Debian system. It uses the doc-base registration entries for documentation to build a list of available documen‐
       tation.  You can view this list via any web browser.

       The easiest way to view the doc-central index is to use the doccentral tool, which will look for a webbrowser on your system and start that with the correct page. If for any reason doccentral can‐
       not find a suitable browser or you want to use another one, you can also use the following URL:

              http://localhost/dc/

ENVIRONMENT
       BROWSER
              Override the normal browser selection from doccentral by specifying a specific browser.

       DC_HOST
              Override the location of Doc-Central (usually localhost)
