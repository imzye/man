NAME
       psbook - rearrange pages in PostScript file into signatures

SYNOPSIS
       psbook [-q] [-ssignature] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
       Psbook rearranges pages from a PostScript document into ``signatures'' for printing books or booklets, creating a new PostScript file. The input PostScript file should follow the Adobe Document Struc‐
       turing Conventions.

       The -s option selects the size of signature which will be used. The signature size is the number of sides which will be folded and bound together; the number given should be a multiple  of  four.  The
       default is to use one signature for the whole file. Extra blank sides will be added if the file does not contain a multiple of four pages.

       Psbook normally prints the page numbers of the pages rearranged; the -q option suppresses this.
