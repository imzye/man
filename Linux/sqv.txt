NAME
       sqv - An OpenPGP signature verification tool

SYNOPSIS
       sqv [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       An OpenPGP signature verification tool.

       sqv is a simple signature verification tool.  It checks that signatures are valid, and correctly issued by one of the certificates in the specified keyring.

       sqv can verify detached signatures, inline-signed messages, and messages using the Cleartext Signature Framework.

       To verify detached signatures, use the `--signature-file` argument followed by the path to the detached signature file, and give the data file as first positional argument:

         $ sqv --keyring=... --signature-file=image.iso.sig image.iso

       To verify an inline-signed message, use the `--message` argument, and give the path to the inline-signed message as first positional argument.  When verifying an inline-signed `--output` has to be
       given:

         $ sqv --keyring=... --output=authenticated.txt \
               --message signed.pgp

       To verify a message using the Cleartext Signature Framework, use the `--cleartext` argument, and give the path to the message as first positional argument.  When verifying an inline-signed `--out‐
       put` has to be given:

         $ sqv --keyring=... --output=authenticated.txt \
               --cleartext message.txt

       Finally, there is a legacy way to verify detached signatures, where the path to the signature file and the path to the data file are given as positional arguments.  This form is deprecated, prefer
       the explicit `--signature-file` form.

       By default, one signature must be valid.  This can be changed using the `--signatures` arguments.

       A  signature  is  valid if a signing-capable key can verify the signature.  The signing-capable key must be correctly bound to a certificate in the keyring, and it must not be revoked, or expired.
       The certificate must not be revoked or expired.  The signature, the signing-capable key and the certificate must all be valid according to the cryptographic policy.

       By default, sqv configures the cryptographic policy using </etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/sequoia.config>.  That can be overwritten by setting the SEQUOIA_CRYPTO_POLICY environment variable to  an
       alternate file.  The path must be absolute.  The file's format is described here: <https://docs.rs/sequoia-policy-config/>.

       In some cases, the user expects signatures to be made within a certain temporal window.  This can be enforced using the `--not-before` and `--not-after` arguments.  The TIMESTAMPs must be given in
       ISO 8601 format (e.g. `2017-03-04T13:25:35Z`, `2017-03-04T13:25`, `20170304T1325+0830`, `2017-03-04`, `2017031`, etc.).  If no timezone is specified, UTC is assumed.

       Exits with a non-zero status if the specified number of signatures could not be verified.

OPTIONS
       -V, --version
              Print version

       --cleartext
              Verify a cleartext-signed message

       -h, --help
              Print help (see a summary with '-h')

       --keyring=FILE
              A keyring

       --message
              Verify an inline signed message

       -n, --signatures=N
              The number of valid signatures to return success.

              Note: this counts the number of certificates, not signatures. Thus, if two signatures are issued by the same certificate, they only count once.

              [default: 1]

       --not-after=TIMESTAMP
              Consider signatures created after TIMESTAMP as invalid.

              If only a date is given, 23:59:59 is used for the time. [default: now]

       --not-before=TIMESTAMP
              Consider signatures created before TIMESTAMP as invalid.

              If only a date is given, 00:00:00 is used for the time. [default: no constraint]

       --output=FILE
              Write to FILE or stdout if omitted

       --policy-as-of=TIMESTAMP
              Select the cryptographic policy as of the specified time

              The time is expressed as an ISO 8601 formatted timestamp.  The policy determines what cryptographic constructs are allowed.

              If  you are working with a message that sq rejects, because it is protected by cryptographic constructs that are now considered broken, you can use this option to select a different crypto‐
              graphic policy.  If you are relying on the cryptography, e.g., you are verifying a signature, then you should only do this if you are confident that the message hasn't been tampered with.

              TIME is interpreted as an ISO 8601 timestamp.  To set the policy time to January 1, 2007 at midnight UTC, you can do:

              $ sqv --policy-as-of 20070101 --message msg.pgp

              Defaults to the current time.

       --signature-file=SIG
              Verify a detached signature file

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose

        FILE  The inline-signed message, message using the Cleartext Signature Framework, or data file

EXAMPLES

              sqv --keyring=trusted.certs --signature-file=document.sig \
                     document.txt

       Verify a detached signature, legacy interface.

              sqv --keyring=trusted.certs document.sig document.txt

       Verify a signed message.

              sqv --keyring trusted.certs --message document.pgp

       Verify a message using the Cleartext Signature Framework.

              sqv --keyring trusted.certs --clearsign document.pgp
