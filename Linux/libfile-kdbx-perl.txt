NAME
       File::KDBX::IO::HashBlock - Hash block stream IO handle

VERSION
       version 0.906

DESCRIPTION
       Writing to a hash-block handle will transform the data into a series of blocks. Each block is hashed, and the hash is included with the block in the stream.

       Reading from a handle, each hash block will be verified as the blocks are disassembled back into a data stream.

       This format helps ensure data integrity of KDBX3 files.

       Each block is encoded thusly:

       •   Block index - Little-endian unsigned 32-bit integer, increments starting with 0

       •   Hash - 32 bytes

       •   Block size - Little-endian unsigned 32-bit (counting only the data)

       •   Data - String of bytes

       The terminating block is an empty block where hash is 32 null bytes, block size is 0 and there is no data.

ATTRIBUTES
   algorithm
       Digest algorithm in hash-blocking the stream (default: "SHA-256")

   block_size
       Desired block size when writing (default: $File::KDBX::IO::HashBlock::BLOCK_SIZE or 1,048,576 bytes)

METHODS
   new
           $fh = File::KDBX::IO::HashBlock->new(%attributes);
           $fh = File::KDBX::IO::HashBlock->new($fh, %attributes);

       Construct a new hash-block stream IO handle.
