PATATT(5)                                                                                Linux Programmer's Manual                                                                                PATATT(5)

NAME
       patatt - DKIM-like cryptographic patch attestation

SYNOPSIS
       patatt {sign|validate|genkey|install-hook} [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool allows cryptographically signing patches sent via email by using DKIM-like message headers. This approach is both effective and doesn't interfere with other code review tools the way in‐
       line or detached PGP signatures do. For a full overview of core concepts and considerations, please see README.

       If  you  already have a PGP key configured for signing git tags or commits, then you should be able to use patatt without any additional configuration. Try running the following in any git reposi‐
       tory:

          git format-patch -1 --stdout | patatt sign

       If patatt is not finding your PGP key, try adding the following to your ~/.gitconfig:

          [user]
              signingkey = [yourkeyid]

       To find out your keyid, run gpg --list-secret-keys. If you want to use a specific subkey, you can specify the subkey ID with a ! at the end.

USING AS A GIT HOOK
       If you use git-send-email for sending patches, then you can get them automatically signed via the sendemail-validate hook. To install, run the following command in the repository you want  enabled
       for signing:

          $ patatt install-hook

       Or you can install it manually:

          $ echo 'patatt sign --hook "${1}"' >> .git/hooks/sendemail-validate
          $ chmod a+x .git/hooks/sendemail-validate

SUBCOMMANDS
       • sign: sign stdin or RFC2822 files passed as arguments

       • validate: basic validation for signed messages

       • genkey: generate a new ed25519 keypair

       • install-hook: install sendemail-validate hook in the current repository

       You can run patatt [subcommand] --help to see a summary of flags for each subcommand.
