NAME
       faxstat - display HylaFAX status

SYNOPSIS
       faxstat [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       faxstat  reports the status of HylaFAX servers, including (potentially) the status of the send, receive, done, document, and archive directories.  When invoked without options faxstat reports only the
       status of the server; the options described below can be used to override this behaviour.

       Server status information indicates the state of the server (idle, sending, receiving, etc.)  and the phone number that is associated with the fax modem.

       The job queue report give the status of facsimile jobs queued for transmission; by default:

       •  the job identifier,

       •  the job state (see below for the description of the a format in the JobFmt string),

       •  the modem or modem class the job is bound to (``any'' if the job can be sent though any modem),

       •  the destination (phone number) of the job,

       •  the time to send the job, or a blank field if the job is being processed or is to be sent immediately,

       •  the job's owner,

       •  and status information about the job (typically the reason why a previous attempt failed).

       The receive queue report lists the facsimile documents that have been received and are awaiting delivery; by default it includes:

       •  the document protection mode,

       •  the number of pages,

       •  the document's owner,

       •  the phone number of the sender (if supplied),

       •  the date and time at which the job was received, and

       •  the filename of the document in the recvq directory on the server machine.

OPTIONS
       -a        Display the contents of the archive directory on the server machine

       -d        Display the status of all jobs that have completed; i.e. those jobs located in the doneq directory on the server machine.  The JobFmt string defines the content and format of information re‐
                 ported with this option.

       -f        Display the status of document files located in the docq directory on the server machine.  The FileFmt string defines the content and format of information reported with this option (see be‐
                 low).

       -g        Display times and dates in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  NB: this is the default.

       -h host   Report the status of the server on a specific host.  The host may be either a symbolic name or a network address.  If no -h option is supplied, faxstat uses the FAXSERVER  environment  vari‐
                 able to identify the HylaFAX server to contact.  If this variable is not set, then faxstat checks for a setting in the configuration files (first in the per-user file and then in the system-
                 wide file).  If all of the above fails, then faxstat attempts to contact a server on the machine where it is run.

       -i        Display additional status information for the server as given by /var/spool/hylafax/status/any.info.  This status typically has information such as the HylaFAX version, the physical location
                 of the server machine, and an administrative contact for the server.  See status(5).

       -l        Display times and dates in the local timezone of the server.

       -r        Display the receive queue status for each server.  The RcvFmt string defines the content and format of information reported with this option (see below).

       -s        Display the status of jobs in the send queue on the server machine.  The JobFmt string defines the content and format of information reported with this option (see below).

       -v        Trace the protocol exchanges between faxstat and the hfaxd processes on the standard output.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       faxstat  reads configuration information from the file /etc/hylafax/hyla.conf and then from the file ~/.hylarc.  Configuration files follow the conventions described in hylafax-client(1).  The follow‐
       ing configuration parameters are recognized:
       Tag              Type       Default      Description
       FileFmt          string     see below    format string for file status results
       Host             string     localhost    host to contact for service
       JobFmt           string     see below    format string for job status results
       ModemFmt         string     see below    format string for modem status results
       PassiveMode      boolean    false        whether or not to use passive mode
       Port             integer    4559         port to use in contacting server
       Protocol         string     tcp          protocol to use in contacting server
       RcvFmt           string     see below    format string for received facsimile status results

                     z         Time to send job

                     The K format produces: ``D'' if ECM is to be disabled, `` '' (space) if ECM use is enabled, ``H'' if T.30 Annex C half duplex is enabled, or ``F'' if T.30 Annex C full duplex is enabled.

                     The N format produces: `` '' (space) if the system-wide tagline format is to be used or ``P'' if a private tagline format is to be used.

                     The O format produces: ``N'' if no continuation cover page is to be used or `` '' (space) if the system default handling for continuation cover pages is to be used.

                     The X format produces: ``F'' for a facsimile job or ``P'' for a pager job.

                     The a format produces: ``?'' for a job in an undefined state, ``T'' for a suspended job (not being scheduled), ``P'' for a pending job (waiting for its time to send to arrive), ``S'' for
                     a sleeping job (waiting for a scheduled timeout such as a delay between attempts to send), ``B'' for a job blocked by concurrent activity to the same destination, ``W'' for a job waiting
                     for resources such as a free modem, ``R'' for a job that is actively running, and ``D'' for a job that is done and was a success.  ``F'' for a job that failed to complete.

                     The h format produces: ``D'' if page chopping is disabled, `` '' (space) for the system default page chop handling, ``A'' when all pages are to be chopped, or ``L'' if only the last page
                     is to be chopped.

                     The  n format produces: `` '' (space) when no notification messages are to be delivered, ``D'' when notification is to be sent when the job is done, ``Q'' when notification is to be sent
                     each time the job is requeued, or ``A'' when notification is to be sent for either the job completing or being requeued.

                     It is recommended that all items include a field width so that the width of column title strings can be constrained when constructing headers from the format string.

       ModemFmt      The format string to use when returning modem status information.  Formats are specified using printf(3S)-style conventions but using the field identifiers listed below.  Each  item  can
                     include  field  width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-8h for an 8-character wide, left-justified, blank-padded field containing the name of the
                     host the server is running on.

                     Format    Description
                     h         Server hostname
                     l         Local identifier string
                     m         Canonical modem name
                     n         FAX phone number
                     r         Maximum pages that can be received in a single call
                     s         Status information string
                     t         Server and session tracing levels (xxxxx:yyyyy)
                     v         Modem speaker volume as one-character symbol
                     z         A ``*'' if a faxgetty(8) process is running; otherwise `` '' (space)

       PassiveMode
                 Whether or not to use passive mode in communication with the server.

       Port          The network port to contact for service.  (Equivalent to the -h option.)

       Protocol      The name of the communication protocol to use when contacting a server.  (Equivalent to the FAXSERVICE environment variable.)

       RcvFmt        The format string to use when returning status information for the -r option.  Formats are specified using printf(3S)-style conventions but using  the  field  identifiers  listed  below.
                     Each  item can include field width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-3b for a 3-character wide, left-justified, blank-padded field containing the
                     signalling rate.

                     Format    Description
                     Y         Extended representation of the time when the receive happened
                     a         SubAddress received from sender (if any)
                     b         Signalling rate used during receive
                     d         Data format used during receive
                     e         Error description if an error occurred during receive
                     f         Document filename (relative to the recvq directory)
                     h         Time spent receiving document (HH:MM:SS)
                     i         CIDName value for received fax
                     j         CIDNumber value for received fax
                     l         Page length in mm
                     m         Fax-style protection mode string (``-rwxrwx'')
                     n         File size (number of bytes)
                     o         File owner
                     p         Number of pages in document
                     q         UNIX-style protection flags
                     r         Resolution of received data
                     s         Sender identity (TSI)
                     t         Compact representation of the time when the receive happened
                     w         Page width in mm
                     z         A ``*'' if receive is going on; otherwise `` '' (space)

                     It is recommended that all items include a field width so that the width of column title strings can be constrained when constructing headers from the format string.

       TimeZone      Control whether times and dates are reported in the local timezone of the server (``local'') or in GMT (``gmt'').  By default times are reported in GMT.

       Verbose       Control protocol tracing.  (Equivalent to the -v option.)

NOTES
       The server login user name may be specified by the FAXUSER environment variable.

BUGS
       There is no way to suppress the server status report.  There is no way to control the printing of headers.
