NAME
       whisper-create - create a whisper database

SYNOPSYS
       whisper-create path secondsPerPoint:pointsToStore [secondsPerPoint:pointsToStore]*

DESCRIPTION
       This command creates a new whisper fixed-size database. For each database you specify one or more pairs of numbers describing how data points should be archived in this database. The first part of the
       pair is the precision, the second part of the pair is how many data points should be stored. You cannot configure two archives with the same precision inside a single database.  Higher  precision  ar‐
       chives must evenly divide all lower precision archives' precision.

       The options are described below.

OPTIONS
       --overwrite
              Overwrite an existing database.

       --xFilesFactor
              The fraction of data points in a propagation interval that must have known values for a propagation to occur.

       -h, --help
              Show the embedded help.
