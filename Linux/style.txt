NAME
       style - analyse surface characteristics of a document

SYNOPSIS
       style [-L language] [-l length] [-r ari] [file...]
       style [--language language] [--print-long length] [--print-ari ari]
       [file...]
       style -h|--help
       style --version

DESCRIPTION
       Style analyses the surface characteristics of the writing  style  of  a
       document.   It prints various readability grades, length of words, sen‐
       tences and paragraphs.  It can further locate  sentences  with  certain
       characteristics.   If  no  files  are  given, the document is read from
       standard input.

       Numbers are counted as words with one syllable.  A sentence  is  a  se‐
       quence  of  words,  that starts with a capitalised word and ends with a
       full stop, double colon, question mark or exclamation mark.   A  single
       letter  followed by a dot is considered an abbreviation, so it does not
       end a sentence.  Various  multi-letter  abbreviations  are  recognized,
       they  do  not  end  a sentence as well.  A paragraph consists of two or
       more new line characters.

   Readability grades
       Style understands cpp(1) #line lines for being able to give precise lo‐
       cations when printing sentences.

       Kincaid formula
              The  Kincaid  Formula has been developed for Navy training manu‐
              als, that ranged in difficulty from 5.5 to 16.3.  It is probably
              best  applied  to  technical  documents,  because it is based on
              adult training manuals rather than school  book  text.   Dialogs
              (often  found  in fictional texts) are usually a series of short
              sentences, which lowers the score.  On the  other  hand,  scien‐
              tific  texts  with  many long scientific terms are rated higher,
              although they are not necessarily harder to read for people  who
              are familiar with those terms.

              Kincaid = 11.8*syllables/wds+0.39*wds/sentences-15.59

       Automated Readability Index
              The Automated Readability Index is typically higher than Kincaid
              and Coleman-Liau, but lower than Flesch.

              ARI = 4.71*chars/wds+0.5*wds/sentences-21.43

       Coleman-Liau Formula
              The Coleman-Liau Formula usually gives a lower grade  than  Kin‐
              caid, ARI and Flesch when applied to technical documents.

              Coleman-Liau = 5.88*chars/wds-29.5*sent/wds-15.8

       Flesh reading easy formula
              The  Flesh  reading  easy formula has been developed by Flesh in
              1948 and it is based on school text covering grade 3 to 12.   It
              is  wide  spread, especially in the USA, because of good results
              and simple computation.  The index is usually between  0  (hard)
              and  100  (easy),  standard  English documents averages approxi‐
              mately 60 to 70.  Applying it to German documents does  not  de‐
              liver good results because of the different language structure.

              Flesch Index = 206.835-84.6*syll/wds-1.015*wds/sent

       Fog Index
              The  Fog  index has been developed by Robert Gunning.  Its value
              is a school grade.  The ``ideal'' Fog Index level is 7 or 8.   A
              level above 12 indicates the writing sample is too hard for most
              people to read.  Only use it on texts of at least hundred  words
              to  get  meaningful results.  Note that a correct implementation
              would not count words of three or more syllables that are proper
              names,  combinations  of  easy words, or made three syllables by
              suffixes such as –ed, –es, or –ing.

              Fog Index = 0.4*(wds/sent+100*((wds >= 3 syll)/wds))

       Lix formula
              The Lix formula developed by Björnsson from Sweden is very  sim‐
              ple and employs a mapping table as well:

              Lix = wds/sent+100*(wds >= 6 char)/wds

              Index         34   38   41   44   48   51    54    57
              School year      5    6    7    8    9    10    11

       SMOG-Grading
              The  SMOG-Grading  for  English  texts  has  been  developed  by
              McLaughlin in 1969.  Its result is a school grade.

              SMOG-Grading = square root of (((wds >= 3 syll)/sent)*30) + 3

              It has been adapted to German by Bamberger &  Vanecek  in  1984,
              who changed the constant +3 to -2.

   Word usage
       The  word  usage  counts are intended to help identify excessive use of
       particular parts of speech.

       Verb Phrases
              The category of verbs labeled "to be" identifies  phrases  using
              the passive voice.  Use the passive voice sparingly, in favor of
              more direct verb forms.  The flag -p causes style  to  list  all
              occurrences of the passive voice.

       The verb category "aux" measures the use of modal auxiliary verbs, such
       as "can", "could", and "should".  Modal auxiliary verbs modify the mood
       of a verb.

       Conjunctions
              The  conjunctions counted by style are coordinating and subordi‐
              nating.  Coordinating conjunctions join grammatically equal sen‐
              tence  fragments,  such  as  a noun with a noun, a phrase with a
              phrase, or a clause to a clause.  Coordinating conjunctions  are
              "and," "but," "or," "yet," and "nor."

       Subordinating conjunctions connect clauses of unequal status.  A subor‐
       dinating conjunction links a subordinate clause,  which  is  unable  to
       stand  alone, to an independent clause.  Examples of subordinating con‐
       junctions are "because," "although," and "even if."

       Pronouns
              Pronouns are contextual references to nouns  and  noun  phrases.
              Documents with few pronouns generally lack cohesiveness and flu‐
              idity.  Too many pronouns may indicate ambiguity.

       Nominalizations
              Nominalizations are verbs that are changed to nouns.  Style rec‐
              ognizes  words  that  end in "ment," "ance," "ence," or "ion" as
              nominalizations.  Examples are  "endowment,"  "admittance,"  and
              "nominalization."   Too  much  nominalization  in a document can
              sound abstract and be difficult  to  understand.   The  flag  -N
              causes  style  to  list all nominalizations.  The flag -n prints
              all sentences with either the passive voice or a nominalization.

OPTIONS
       -L language, --language language
              set the document language (de, en, nl).

       -l length, --print-long length
              print all sentences longer than length words.

       -r ari, --print-ari ari
              print all sentences whose readability  index  (ARI)  is  greater
              than ari.

       -p passive, --print-passive
              print all sentences phrased in the passive voice.

       -N nominalizations, --print-nom
              print all sentences containing nominalizations.

       -n nominalizations-passive, --print-nom-passive

              nominalizations.

              Print a short usage message.

       --version
              Print the version.

ERRORS
       On usage errors, 1 is returned.  Termination caused by lack  of  memory
       is signalled by exit code 2.

ENVIRONMENT
       LC_MESSAGES=de|en|nl

              is en.

       LC_CTYPE=iso-8859-1
              specifies the document character set.  The default character set
              is ASCII.

HISTORY
       There  has  been a style command on old UNIX systems, which is now part
       of the AT&T DWB package.  The original version was bound to roff by en‐
       forcing a call to deroff.
