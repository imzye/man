NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::EOL - Author tests making sure correct line endings are used

VERSION
       version 0.19

DESCRIPTION
       Generate an author Test::EOL.

       This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the file xt/author/eol.t, a standard Test::EOL test.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       This plugin accepts the following options:

   "trailing_whitespace"
       If this option is set to a true value, "{ trailing_whitespace => 1 }" will be passed to "all_perl_files_ok" in Test::EOL. It defaults to 1.

       What this option is going to do is test for the lack of trailing whitespace at the end of the lines (also known as "trailing space").

   "finder"
       This is the name of a FileFinder for finding files to check.  The default value is ":InstallModules", ":ExecFiles" (see also Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExecDir) and ":TestFiles"; this option can be used
       more than once.

       Other predefined finders are listed in "default_finders" in Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser.  You can define your own with the [FileFinder::ByName] plugin.

   "file"
       a filename to also test, in addition to any files found earlier. This option can be repeated to specify multiple additional files.

   "filename"
       The filename of the test to add - defaults to xt/author/test-eol.t.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       This module is a fork of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EOLTests and was originally written by Florian Ragwitz. It was forked because the Test:: namespace is preferred for test modules, and because I would
       prefer to have EOL tests be Author tests.
