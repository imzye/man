NAME
       pappl-makeresheader - resource header utility

SYNOPSIS
       pappl-makeresheader FILES > FILENAME.h

DESCRIPTION
       pappl-makeresheader  creates  a  C  header file suitable for inclusion in a printer application.  The header file creates a C unsigned char array or string constant that can be used with the papplSys‐
       temAddResourceData or papplSystemAddResourceString functions, or as data for a printer icon in the pappl_icon_t structure.  The C variable names used for each file are generated by replacing all  spa‐
       ces, dots, and dashes with the underscore.  For example, a file named "my printer-icon.png" would have the C variable name "my_printer_icon_png".
