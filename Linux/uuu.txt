       bootloader
              download bootloader to board by usb

       cmdlist
              run all commands in cmdlist file If it is path, search uuu.auto in dir If it is zip, search uuu.auto in zip

       cmd    Run one command, use -H see detail example: SDPS: boot -f flash.bin

       -d     Daemon mode, wait for forever.

       -v -V  verbose mode, -V enable libusb error\warning info

       -dry   Dry run mode, check if script or cmd correct

       -bmap  Try using .bmap files even if flash commands do not specify them

       -no-bmap
              Ignore .bmap files even if flash commands specify them

       -m <usbpath>
              Only monitor these paths.  -m 1:2 -m 1:3

       -ms <serial_no> Monitor the serial number prefix of the device using 'serial_no'.
