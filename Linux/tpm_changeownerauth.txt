NAME
       tpm_changeownerauth - change the authorization data associated with the owner or SRK

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_changeownerauth [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm_changeownerauth allows for changing the authorization data for the TPM owner or the TPM's Storage Root Key (via the TPM_ChangeAuthOwner API).  This operation prompts for current password, followed
       by the new password and a confirmation of the new password. The --owner option changes the TPM owner password and --srk option changes the TPM's SRK password. The --well-known option is used when SRK
       or owner passwords need to be changed and current owner password is a secret of zeros, --set-well-known option changes current password to a secret of zeros, both options do not work by themselves,
       they must be used with --owner and --srk options to indicate which of these passwords will be changed.
