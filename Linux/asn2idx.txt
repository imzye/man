NAME
       asn2idx - index ASN.1 Bioseq-sets for fast access to individual sequences

SYNOPSIS
       asn2idx [-] [-b] [-d dir] [-f filter] -p path [-r path] [-t] [-x str]

DESCRIPTION
       asn2idx  indexes  ASN.1  Bioseq-sets (such as GenBank release files) to speed retrieval of the individual sequences they contain.  For each file that it processes, it yields an output file in the same
       directory with the extension .idx.

OPTIONS
