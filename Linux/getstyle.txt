NAME
       getstyle - dumps the current Window Maker style related configuration or creates a theme pack.

SYNOPSIS
       getstyle [-t|--theme-options] [-p|--pack] [style file]

DESCRIPTION
       getstyle  can  either dump the current Window Maker style related configuration information to a file/stdout or create a self-contained theme pack. A theme pack is a directory that contains everything
       that is needed for a redistributable theme, including the style information and pixmaps used by it.

       Note that style information stored in the global configuration of the system is not read.

OPTIONS
       --help print a help message with the list of options.

       --pack or -p
              creates a theme pack in the directory named by the theme name appended with the .themed suffix.

       --theme-options or -t
              dumps theme related information too, which includes the root background texture.  This option is always enabled when the -p option is used.

       --version
              print the version of Window Maker from which the program comes.

       The following options are stored by default: TitleJustify, ClipTitleFont, WindowTitleFont, MenuTitleFont, MenuTextFont, IconTitleFont, LargeDisplayFont, HighlightColor, HighlightTextColor,  ClipTitle‐

       Cursor,  ResizeCursor, TopLeftResizeCursor, TopRightResizeCursor, BottomLeftResizeCursor, BottomRightResizeCursor, VerticalResizeCursor, HorizontalResizeCursor, WaitCursor, QuestionCursor, TextCursor,
