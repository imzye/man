   DESCRIPTION
       libcw is a general purpose CW (Morse code) functions library.  It contains routines for converting characters into Morse code representations and back again,
       for sending Morse code characters, and for receiving characters.  It also contains routines to emulate an Iambic Morse keyer, and a straight key.

       The library can be included in any program that wishes to make use of these features.  It forms the heart of three Morse code tutor applications that  accom‐
       pany the package in which it is distributed.

       See the cw(7) man page for information on Morse code timings, and the dot and dash representations for the various Morse characters.

   TONE QUEUE
       libcw  contains an inbuilt tone queue.  The queue is emptied by background processing, using SIGALRM calls and itimers, so a caller program can continue with
       other tasks while the library sends tones and keys any external device.

       As well as being used by the library functions that sound Morse code characters and provide a keyer sidetone, the primitive tone queue functions are publicly
       available to caller programs.

   CONTROLLING AN EXTERNAL DEVICE
       libcw  may be passed the address of a function that controls external keying.  This function is called each time the library changes the keying state, either
       as a result of sending a Morse character or representation, or as a result of an iambic keyer or straight key state change.  The argument passed is a  single
       integer, TRUE for key-down, and FALSE for key-up.

       libcw calls the external keying function only when the keying state changes.  A call is likely each time a tone is taken off the tone queue.

   SENDING CW CHARACTERS AND STRINGS
       libcw  offers several functions that send individual characters and character strings as Morse code.  It also offers functions that allow specialized 'repre‐
       sentations' to be sent.  A 'representation' is an ASCII string that consists of only the characters '.' and '-'.

       Characters and strings are converted into representations, and then the correct tones for the dots and dashes in these representations are queued on the tone
       queue, for action by the background queue emptying process.

   RECEIVING CW CHARACTERS AND REPRESENTATIONS
       libcw  contains  functions to allow it to receive Morse code.  To receive, the library must be told when a tone start is detected, and when a tone end is de‐
       tected.  It then determines whether the tone was a dot or a dash depending on the timing difference between the two.  After  the  required  silence  gap  has
       passed, the library may be queried to see what the received representation or character was.

       Errors in receiving may be detected by means of the flags passed back on receive character functions.

   IAMBIC KEYER
       libcw  offers functions to simulate an Iambic Morse keyer.  The caller program needs to tell the library of paddle state changes.  Iambic keyer functions are
       mutually exclusive with character send and straight key functions.

   STRAIGHT KEY
       libcw offers simple functions to allow effective pass-through of straight key information.  The caller program  needs  to  tell  the  library  of  key  state
       changes.  Straight key functions are mutually exclusive with character send and iambic keyer functions.

   RETURN CODES
       Some  of  the  library's function return a return code of type int.  The return code has two values, as defined in libcw.h: CW_SUCCESS or CW_FAILURE. The two
       symbolic constants are guaranteed to be identical to boolean true and false.

   FUNCTIONS
       The following list describes the functions available to a libcw caller:

       int cw_generator_new(int audio_system, const char *device)
       Brief: Create new generator

       Allocate memory for new generator data structure, set up default values of some of the generator's properties.  The function does  not  start  the  generator
       (generator does not produce a sound), you have to use cw_generator_start() for this.

       Notice  that  the  function doesn't return a generator variable. There is at most one generator variable at any given time. You can't have two generators. In
       some future version of the library the function will return pointer to newly allocated generator, and then you could have as many of them as  you  want,  but
       not yet.

       audio_system  can  be  one  of following: NULL, console, OSS, ALSA, PulseAudio, soundcard. See "enum cw_audio_systems" in libcw.h for exact names of symbolic
       constants.

       Parameter: audio_system - audio system to be used by the generator
       Parameter: device - name of audio device to be used; if NULL then library will use default device.

       void cw_generator_delete(void)
       Brief: Deallocate generator

       Deallocate/destroy generator data structure created with call to cw_generator_new(). You can't start nor use the generator after the call to this function.

       int cw_generator_start(void)
       Brief: Start a generator

       Start producing tones using generator created with cw_generator_new(). The source of tones is a tone queue associated with the generator. If the  tone  queue
       is empty, the generator will wait for new tones to be queued.

       Returns: CW_FAILURE on errors
       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success

       void cw_generator_stop(void)
       Brief: Shut down a generator

       Silence tone generated by generator (level of generated sine wave is set to zero, with falling slope), and shut the generator down.

       The shutdown does not erase generator's configuration.

       If you want to have this generator running again, you have to call cw_generator_start().

       int cw_set_send_speed(int new_value)
       Brief: Set sending speed of generator

       See libcw.h/CW_SPEED_{INITIAL|MIN|MAX} for initial/minimal/maximal value of send speed.

       errno is set to EINVAL if new_value is out of range.

       Parameter: new_value - new value of send speed to be assigned to generator

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_set_frequency(int new_value)
       Brief: Set frequency of generator

       Set frequency of sound wave generated by generator.  The frequency must be within limits marked by CW_FREQUENCY_MIN and CW_FREQUENCY_MAX.

       See libcw.h/CW_FREQUENCY_{INITIAL|MIN|MAX} for initial/minimal/maximal value of frequency.

       errno is set to EINVAL if new_value is out of range.

       Parameter: new_value - new value of frequency to be assigned to generator

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_set_volume(int new_value)
       Brief: Set volume of generator

       Set volume of sound wave generated by generator.  The volume must be within limits marked by CW_VOLUME_MIN and CW_VOLUME_MAX.

       Note  that volume settings are not fully possible for the console speaker.  In this case, volume settings greater than zero indicate console speaker sound is
       on, and setting volume to zero will turn off console speaker sound.

       See libcw.h/CW_VOLUME_{INITIAL|MIN|MAX} for initial/minimal/maximal value of volume.  errno is set to EINVAL if new_value is out of range.

       Parameter: new_value - new value of volume to be assigned to generator

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_set_gap(int new_value)
       Brief: Set sending gap of generator

       See libcw.h/CW_GAP_{INITIAL|MIN|MAX} for initial/minimal/maximal value of gap.  errno is set to EINVAL if new_value is out of range.

       Notice that this function also sets the same gap value for library's receiver.

       Parameter: new_value - new value of gap to be assigned to generator

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_set_weighting(int new_value)
       Brief: Set sending weighting for generator

       See libcw.h/CW_WEIGHTING_{INITIAL|MIN|MAX} for initial/minimal/maximal value of weighting.  errno is set to EINVAL if new_value is out of range.

       Parameter: new_value - new value of weighting to be assigned for generator

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

                                int *additional_usecs, int *adjustment_usecs)
       Brief: Get timing parameters for sending

       int cw_send_word_space(void)

       The function sends space timed to exclude both the expected prior dot/dash inter-mark gap and the prior end of character space.  FIXME: fix this description.

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_send_representation(const char *representation)
       Brief: Check, then send the given string as dots and dashes.

       The representation passed in is assumed to be a complete Morse character; that is, all post-character delays will be added when the character is sent.

       On success, the routine returns CW_SUCCESS.  On failure, it returns CW_FAILURE, with errno set to EINVAL if any character of the representation  is  invalid,
       EBUSY if the sound card, console speaker, or keying system is busy, or EAGAIN if the tone queue is full, or if there is insufficient space to queue the tones
       or the representation.

       Parameter: representation - representation to send

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_send_representation_partial(const char *representation)
       Brief: Check, then send the given string as dots and dashes

       The representation passed in is assumed to be only part of a larger Morse representation; that is, no post-character delays will be added when the  character
       is sent.

       On  success,  the routine returns CW_SUCCESS.  On failure, it returns CW_FAILURE, with errno set to EINVAL if any character of the representation is invalid,
       EBUSY if the sound card, console speaker, or keying system is busy, or EAGAIN if the tone queue is full, or if there is insufficient space to queue the tones
       for the representation.

       int cw_send_character(char c)
       Brief: Look up and send a given ASCII character as Morse

       The end of character delay is appended to the Morse sent.

       On success the routine returns CW_SUCCESS.  On failure the function returns CW_FAILURE and sets errno.

       errno is set to ENOENT if the given character c is not a valid Morse character.  errno is set to EBUSY if current audio sink or keying system is busy.  errno
       is set to EAGAIN if the generator's tone queue is full, or if there is insufficient space to queue the tones for the character.

       This routine returns as soon as the character has been successfully queued for sending; that is, almost immediately.  The actual  sending  happens  in  back‐
       ground processing.  See cw_wait_for_tone() and cw_wait_for_tone_queue() for ways to check the progress of sending.

       Parameter: c - character to send

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_send_character_partial(char c)
       Brief: Look up and send a given ASCII character as Morse code

       "partial" means that the "end of character" delay is not appended to the Morse code sent by the function, to support the formation of combination characters.

       On success the function returns CW_SUCCESS.  On failure the function returns CW_FAILURE and sets errno.

       errno  is set to ENOENT if the given character c is not a valid Morse character.  errno is set to EBUSY if the audio sink or keying system is busy.  errno is
       set to EAGAIN if the tone queue is full, or if there is insufficient space to queue the tones for the character.

       This routine queues its arguments for background processing.  See cw_wait_for_tone() and cw_wait_for_tone_queue() for ways to check the progress of sending.

       Parameter: c - character to send

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_send_string(const char *string)
       Brief: Send a given ASCII string in Morse code

       errno is set to ENOENT if any character in the string is not a valid Morse character.

       errno is set to EBUSY if audio sink or keying system is busy.

       errno is set to EAGAIN if the tone queue is full or if the tone queue runs out of space part way through queueing the string.  However, an indeterminate num‐
       ber of the characters from the string will have already been queued.

       For safety, clients can ensure the tone queue is empty before queueing a string, or use cw_send_character() if they need finer control.

       This  routine  queues  its  arguments  for  background  processing,  the  actual  sending  happens  in  background  processing.  See  cw_wait_for_tone()  and
       cw_wait_for_tone_queue() for ways to check the progress of sending.

       Parameter: string - string to send

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       void cw_reset_send_receive_parameters(void)
       Brief: Reset send/receive parameters

       Reset the library speed, frequency, volume, gap, tolerance, weighting, adaptive receive, and noise spike threshold to their initial default values:  send/re‐
       ceive speed 12 WPM, volume 70 %, frequency 800 Hz, gap 0 dots, tolerance 50 %, and weighting 50 %.

       const char *cw_get_console_device(void)
       Brief: Return char string with console device path

       Returned pointer is owned by library.

       Returns: char string with current console device path

       const char *cw_get_soundcard_device(void)
       Brief: Return char string with soundcard device name/path

       Returned pointer is owned by library.

       Returns: char string with current soundcard device name or device path

       const char *cw_generator_get_audio_system_label(void)
       Brief: Get a readable label of current audio system

       The function returns one of following strings: None, Null, Console, OSS, ALSA, PulseAudio, Soundcard

       Returns: audio system's label

       int cw_register_tone_queue_low_callback(void (*callback_func)(void*), void *callback_arg, int level)
       Brief: Register callback for low queue state

       Register  a  function  to  be called automatically by the dequeue routine whenever the tone queue falls to a given level. To be more precise: the callback is
       called by queue manager if, after dequeueing a tone, the manager notices that tone queue length has become equal or less than level.

       callback_arg may be used to give a value passed back on callback calls.  A NULL function pointer suppresses  callbacks.   On  success,  the  routine  returns
       CW_SUCCESS.

       If level is invalid, the routine returns CW_FAILURE with errno set to EINVAL.  Any callback supplied will be called in signal handler context.

       Parameter: callback_func - callback function to be registered
       Parameter: callback_arg - argument for callback_func to pass return value
       Parameter: level - low level of queue triggering callback call

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on successful registration
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       bool cw_is_tone_busy(void)
       Brief: Check if tone sender is busy

       Indicate if the tone sender is busy.

       Returns: true if there are still entries in the tone queue
       Returns: false if the queue is empty

       int cw_wait_for_tone(void)
       Brief: Wait for the current tone to complete

       The  routine  returns  CW_SUCCESS on success.  If called with SIGALRM blocked, the routine returns CW_FAILURE, with errno set to EDEADLK, to avoid indefinite
       waits.

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_wait_for_tone_queue(void)
       Brief: Wait for the tone queue to drain

       The routine returns CW_SUCCESS on success. If called with SIGALRM blocked, the routine returns false, with errno set to EDEADLK, to avoid indefinite waits.

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_wait_for_tone_queue_critical(int level)
       Brief: Wait for the tone queue to drain until only as many tones as given in level remain queued

       This routine is for use by programs that want to optimize themselves to avoid the cleanup that happens when the tone queue drains completely;  such  programs
       have a short time in which to add more tones to the queue.

       The routine returns CW_SUCCESS on success.  If called with SIGALRM blocked, the routine returns false, with errno set to EDEADLK, to avoid indefinite waits.

       Parameter: level - low level in queue, at which to return

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       bool cw_is_tone_queue_full(void)
       Brief: Indicate if the tone queue is full

       Returns: true if tone queue is full
       Returns: false if tone queue is not full

       int cw_get_tone_queue_capacity(void)
       Brief: Return the number of entries the tone queue can accommodate

       int cw_get_tone_queue_length(void)
       Brief: Return the number of entries currently pending in the tone queue

       void cw_flush_tone_queue(void)
       Brief: Cancel all pending queued tones, and return to silence.

       If there is a tone in progress, the function will wait until this last one has completed, then silence the tones.

       This  function  may  be  called with SIGALRM blocked, in which case it will empty the queue as best it can, then return without waiting for the final tone to
       complete.  In this case, it may not be possible to guarantee silence after the call.

       void cw_reset_tone_queue(void)
       Cancel all pending queued tones, reset any queue low callback registered, and return to silence.  This function is suitable for calling from  an  application
       exit handler.

       int cw_queue_tone(int usecs, int frequency)
       Brief: Primitive access to simple tone generation

       This  routine  queues  a  tone  of  given  duration  and frequency.  The routine returns CW_SUCCESS on success.  If usec or frequency are invalid, it returns
       CW_FAILURE with errno set to EINVAL.  If the sound card, console speaker, or keying function are busy, it returns CW_FAILURE  with errno set  to  EBUSY.   If
       the tone queue is full, it returns false with errno set to EAGAIN.

       Parameter: usecs - duration of queued tone, in microseconds
       Parameter: frequency - frequency of queued tone

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_set_receive_speed(int new_value)
       Brief: Set receiving speed of receiver

       See documentation of cw_set_send_speed() for more information.

       See  libcw.h/CW_SPEED_{INITIAL|MIN|MAX}  for  initial/minimal/maximal value of receive speed.  errno is set to EINVAL if new_value is out of range.  errno is
       set to EPERM if adaptive receive speed tracking is enabled.

       Parameter: new_value - new value of receive speed to be assigned to receiver

       Parameter: adaptive_threshold

       int cw_set_noise_spike_threshold(int new_value)
       Brief: Set noise spike threshold for receiver

       Set the period shorter than which, on receive, received marks are ignored.  This allows the "receive mark" functions to apply noise canceling for very  short
       apparent  marks.   For  useful  results the value should never exceed the dot length of a dot at maximum speed: 20000 microseconds (the dot length at 60WPM).
       Setting a noise threshold of zero turns off receive mark noise canceling.

       The default noise spike threshold is 10000 microseconds.

       errno is set to EINVAL if new_value is out of range.

       Parameter: new_value - new value of noise spike threshold to be assigned to receiver

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_get_noise_spike_threshold(void)
       Brief: Get noise spike threshold from receiver

       See documentation of cw_set_noise_spike_threshold() for more information

       Returns: current value of receiver's threshold

       void cw_get_receive_statistics(double *dot_sd, double *dash_sd,
                                   double *element_end_sd, double *character_end_sd)
       Brief: Calculate and return receiver's timing statistics

       These statistics may be used to obtain a measure of the accuracy of received CW.  The values dot_sd and dot_sd contain the standard deviation of dot and dash
       lengths  from  the ideal values, and element_end_sd and element_end_sd the deviations for inter element and inter character spacing.  Statistics are held for
       all timings in a 256 element circular buffer.  If any statistic cannot be calculated, because no records for it exist, the returned value is 0.0.   Use  NULL
       for the pointer argument to any statistic not required.

       Parameter: dot_sd
       Parameter: dash_sd
       Parameter: element_end_sd
       Parameter: character_end_sd

       void cw_reset_receive_statistics(void)
       Brief: Clear the receive statistics buffer

       Clear the receive statistics buffer by removing all records from it and returning it to its initial default state.

       void cw_enable_adaptive_receive(void)
       Brief: Enable adaptive receive speed tracking

       If  adaptive speed tracking is enabled, the receive functions will attempt to automatically adjust the receive speed setting to match the speed of the incom‐
       ing Morse code. If it is disabled, the receive functions will use fixed speed settings, and reject incoming Morse which is not at the expected speed.

       Adaptive speed tracking uses a moving average length of the past N marks as its baseline for tracking speeds.  The default state is adaptive  speed  tracking
       disabled.

       void cw_disable_adaptive_receive(void)
       Brief: Disable adaptive receive speed tracking

       See documentation of cw_enable_adaptive_receive() for more information

       bool cw_get_adaptive_receive_state(void)
       Brief: Get adaptive receive speed tracking flag

       The function returns state of "adaptive receive enabled" flag.  See documentation of cw_enable_adaptive_receive() for more information

       Returns: true if adaptive speed tracking is enabled
       Returns: false otherwise

       int cw_start_receive_tone(const struct timeval *timestamp)
       Brief: Signal beginning of receive mark

       Called on the start of a receive mark.  If the timestamp is NULL, the current timestamp is used as beginning of mark.

       The function should be called by client application when pressing a key down (closing a circuit) has been detected by client application.

       On  error  the function returns CW_FAILURE, with errno set to ERANGE if the call is directly after another cw_start_receive_tone() call or if an existing re‐
       ceived character has not been cleared from the buffer, or EINVAL if the timestamp passed in is invalid.

       Parameter: timestamp - time stamp of "key down" event

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE otherwise (with errno set)

       int cw_end_receive_tone(const struct timeval *timestamp)
       Brief: Signal end of mark

       The function should be called by client application when releasing a key (opening a circuit) has been detected by client application.

       If the timestamp is NULL, the current time is used as timestamp of end of mark.

       On success, the routine adds a dot or dash to the receiver's representation buffer, and returns CW_SUCCESS.

       On failure, it returns CW_FAIURE, with errno set to: ERANGE if the call was not preceded by a cw_start_receive_tone() call, EINVAL if the timestamp passed in
       is  not  valid, ENOENT if the mark length was out of bounds for the permissible dot and dash lengths and fixed speed receiving is selected, ENOMEM if the re‐
       ceiver's representation buffer is full, EAGAIN if the mark was shorter than the threshold for noise and was therefore ignored.

       Parameter: timestamp - time stamp of "key up" event

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_receive_buffer_dot(const struct timeval *timestamp)
       Brief: Add a dot to the receiver's representation buffer

       Documentation for both cw_receive_buffer_dot() and cw_receive_buffer_dash():

       Since we can't add a mark to the buffer without any accompanying timing information, the functions accepts timestamp of the "end  of  mark"  event.   If  the
       timestamp is NULL, the current timestamp is used.

       These  routines  are  for client code that has already determined whether a dot or dash was received by a method other than calling the routines cw_start_re‐
       ceive_tone() and cw_end_receive_tone().

       On success, the relevant mark is added to the receiver's representation buffer.

       On failure, the routines return CW_FAILURE, with errno set to ERANGE if preceded by a cw_start_receive_tone() call with no matching cw_end_receive_tone()  or
       if an error condition currently exists within the receiver's buffer, or ENOMEM if the receiver's representation buffer is full.

       Parameter: timestamp - timestamp of "end of dot" event

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_receive_buffer_dash(const struct timeval *timestamp)
       Brief: Add a dash to the receiver's representation buffer

       See documentation of cw_receive_buffer_dot() for more information.

       Parameter: timestamp - timestamp of "end of dash" event

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_receive_representation(const struct timeval *timestamp,
                                  /* out */ char *representation,
                                  /* out */ bool *is_end_of_word,
                                  /* out */ bool *is_error)
       Brief: Get the current buffered representation from the receiver's representation buffer

       On success the function fills in representation with the contents of the current representation buffer and returns CW_SUCCESS.

       On  failure,  it  returns  CW_FAILURE and sets errno to: ERANGE if not preceded by a cw_end_receive_tone() call, a prior successful cw_receive_representation
       call, or a prior cw_receive_buffer_dot or cw_receive_buffer_dash, EINVAL if the timestamp passed in is invalid, EAGAIN if the call is made too early  to  de‐
       termine  whether  a  complete  representation  has  yet  been placed in the buffer (that is, less than the end-of-character gap period elapsed since the last
       cw_end_receive_tone() or cw_receive_buffer_dot/dash call). This is not a *hard* error, just an information that the caller should try to get the  representa‐
       tion later.

       is_end_of_word indicates that the space after the last mark received is longer that the end-of-character gap, so it must be qualified as end-of-word gap.

       is_error indicates that the representation was terminated by an error condition.

       TODO: the function should be called cw_receiver_poll_representation().

       The function is called periodically (poll()-like function) by client code in hope that at some attempt receiver will be ready to pass representation. The at‐
       tempt succeeds only if data stream is in "space" state. To mark end of the space, client code has to provide a timestamp (or pass NULL timestamp,  the  func‐
       tion will get time stamp at function call). The receiver needs to know the "end of space" event - thus the timestamp parameter.

       Parameter: timestamp - timestamp of event that ends "end-of-character" gap or "end-of-word" gap
       Parameter: representation - buffer for representation (output parameter)
       Parameter: is_end_of_word - buffer for "is end of word" state (output parameter)
       Parameter: is_error - buffer for "error" state (output parameter)

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       int cw_receive_character(const struct timeval *timestamp,
                             /* out */ char *c,
                             /* out */ bool *is_end_of_word,
                             /* out */ bool *is_error)
       Brief: Get a current character

       Function returns the character currently stored in receiver's representation buffer.

       On success the function returns CW_SUCCESS, and fills c with the contents of the current representation buffer, translated into a character.

       On failure the function returns CW_FAILURE, with errno set to:

       ERANGE  if  not  preceded  by  a  cw_end_receive_tone() call, a prior successful cw_receive_character() call, or a cw_receive_buffer_dot() or cw_receive_buf‐
       fer_dash() call, EINVAL if the timestamp passed in is invalid, or EAGAIN if the call is made too early to determine whether a complete character has yet been
       placed  in  the  buffer (that is, less than the end-of-character gap period elapsed since the last cw_end_receive_tone() or cw_receive_buffer_dot/dash call).
       ENOENT if character stored in receiver cannot be recognized as valid

       is_end_of_word indicates that the space after the last mark received is longer that the end-of-character gap, so it must be qualified as end-of-word gap.

       is_error indicates that the character was terminated by an error condition.

       Parameter: timestamp - timestamp of event that ends end-of-character gap or end-of-word gap
       Parameter: c - buffer for character (output parameter)
       Parameter: is_end_of_word - buffer for "is end of word" state (output parameter)
       Parameter: is_error - buffer for "error" state (output parameter)

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       void cw_clear_receive_buffer(void)
       Brief: Clear receiver's representation buffer

       Clears the receiver's representation buffer, resets receiver's internal state. This prepares the receiver to receive marks and spaces again.

       This routine must be called after successful, or terminating, cw_receive_representation() or cw_receive_character() calls, to clear the  states  and  prepare
       the buffer to receive more marks and spaces.

       int cw_get_receive_buffer_capacity(void)
       Brief: Get the number of elements (dots/dashes) the receiver's buffer can accommodate

       The maximum number of elements written out by cw_receive_representation() is the capacity + 1, the extra character being used for the terminating NUL.

       Returns: number of elements that can be stored in receiver's representation buffer

       int cw_get_receive_buffer_length(void)
       Brief: Get the number of elements (dots/dashes) currently pending in the cw_receiver's representation buffer

       Returns: number of elements in receiver's representation buffer

       void cw_reset_receive(void)
       Brief: Clear receive data

       Clear  the  receiver's  representation buffer, statistics, and any retained receiver's state.  This function is suitable for calling from an application exit
       handler.

       void cw_register_keying_callback(void (*callback_func)(void*, int), void *callback_arg)
       Brief: Register external callback function for keying

       Register a callback_func function that should be called when a state of a key changes from "key open" to "key closed", or vice-versa.

       The first argument passed to the registered callback function is the supplied callback_arg, if any.  The second argument passed to registered callback  func‐
       tion is the key state: CW_KEY_STATE_CLOSED (one/true) for "key closed", and CW_KEY_STATE_OPEN (zero/false) for "key open".

       Calling this routine with a NULL function address disables keying callbacks.  Any callback supplied will be called in signal handler context (??).

       Parameter: callback_func - callback function to be called on key state changes
       Parameter: callback_arg - first argument to callback_func

       void cw_enable_iambic_curtis_mode_b(void)
       Brief: Enable iambic Curtis mode B

       Normally,  the iambic keying functions will emulate Curtis 8044 Keyer mode A.  In this mode, when both paddles are pressed together, the last dot or dash be‐
       ing sent on release is completed, and nothing else is sent. In mode B, when both paddles are pressed together, the last dot or dash being sent on release  is
       completed, then an opposite element is also sent. Some operators prefer mode B, but timing is more critical in this mode. The default mode is Curtis mode A.

       void cw_disable_iambic_curtis_mode_b(void)
       See documentation of cw_enable_iambic_curtis_mode_b() for more information

       int cw_notify_keyer_paddle_event(int dot_paddle_state, int dash_paddle_state)
       Brief: Inform about changed state of iambic keyer's paddles

       Function  informs  the  library that the iambic keyer paddles have changed state.  The new paddle states are recorded, and if either transition from false to
       true, paddle latches, for iambic functions, are also set.

       On success, the routine returns CW_SUCCESS.  On failure, it returns CW_FAILURE, with errno set to EBUSY if the tone queue or straight key are using the sound
       card, console speaker, or keying system.

       If  appropriate, this routine starts the keyer functions sending the relevant element.  Element send and timing occurs in the background, so this routine re‐
       turns almost immediately.  See cw_keyer_element_wait() and cw_keyer_wait() for details about how to check the current status of iambic keyer background  pro‐
       cessing.

       Function does a test opening and test writing to console device, but it closes it before returning.

       The function tests that the given console file exists, and that it will accept the KIOCSOUND ioctl.  It unconditionally returns false on platforms that do no
       support the KIOCSOUND ioctl.

       Call to ioctl will fail if calling code doesn't have root privileges.

       This is the only place where we ask if KIOCSOUND is defined, so client code must call this function whenever it wants to use console output, as  every  other
       function called to perform console operations will happily assume that it is allowed to perform such operations.

       Parameter: device - name of console device to be used; if NULL then library will use default device.

       Returns: true if opening console output succeeded;
       Returns: false if opening console output failed;

       Check that the given string is a valid Morse representation.  A valid string is one composed of only "." and "-" characters.  This means  that  the  function
       checks only if representation is error-free, and not whether the representation represents existing/defined character.

       If representation is invalid, function returns false and sets errno to EINVAL.

       Parameter: representation - representation of a character to check

       Returns: true on success

       int cw_lookup_representation(const char *representation, char *c)
       Brief: Get the character represented by a given Morse representation

       This function is depreciated, use cw_representation_to_character() instead.

       Function  checks  representation,  and if it is valid and represents a known character, function returns CW_SUCCESS. Additionally, if c is non-NULL, function
       puts the looked up character in c.

       c should be allocated by caller. Function assumes that c being NULL pointer is a valid situation, and can return CW_SUCCESS in such situation.

       On error, function returns CW_FAILURE. errno is set to EINVAL if any character of the representation is invalid, or ENOENT to  indicate  that  the  character
       represented by representation could not be found.

       Brief: Get the string expansion of a given Morse code procedural signal character

       On success the function - fills expansion with the string expansion of a given Morse code procedural signal character c; - sets is_usuall_expanded to true as
       a display hint for the caller; - returns CW_SUCCESS.

       Both expansion and expansion must be allocated and managed by caller. They can be NULL, then the function won't attempt to use them.

       The length of expansion must be at least by one greater than the longest expansion held in the procedural signal  character  lookup  table,  as  returned  by
       cw_get_maximum_procedural_expansion_length().

       If procedural signal character c cannot be found, the function sets errno to ENOENT and returns CW_FAILURE.

       Parameter: c - character to look up
       Parameter: expansion - output, space to fill with expansion of the character
       Parameter: is_usually_expanded - visual hint

       int cw_generator_set_tone_slope(cw_gen_t *gen, int slope_shape, int slope_len)
       Brief: Set parameters of tones generated by generator

       Most  of variables related to slope of tones is in tone data type, but there are still some variables that are generator-specific, as they are common for all
       tones.  This function sets two of these variables.

       A: If you pass to function conflicting values of slope_shape and slope_len, the function will return CW_FAILURE. These  conflicting  values  are  rectangular
       slope shape and larger than zero slope length. You just can't have rectangular slopes that have non-zero length.

       B: If you pass to function '-1' as value of both slope_shape and slope_len, the function won't change any of the related two generator's parameters.

       C1:  If  you pass to function '-1' as value of either slope_shape or slope_len, the function will attempt to set only this generator's parameter that is dif‐
       ferent than '-1'.

       C2:  However,  if   selected   slope   shape   is   rectangular,   function   will   set   generator's   slope   length   to   zero,   even   if   value   of
       slope_len is '-1'.

       D: Notice that the function allows non-rectangular slope shape with zero length of the slopes. The slopes will be non-rectangular, but just unusually short.

       The function should be called every time one of following parameters change:

              •
                      shape of slope,

              •
                      length of slope,

              •
                      generator's sample rate,

              •
                      generator's volume.

       There are four supported shapes of slopes:

              •
                      linear (the only one supported by libcw until version 4.1.1),

              •
                      raised cosine (supposedly the most desired shape),

              •
                      sine,

              •
                      rectangular.

       Use CW_TONE_SLOPE_SHAPE_* symbolic names as values of slope_shape.

       FIXME: first argument of this public function is gen, but no function provides access to generator variable.

       Parameter: gen - generator for which to set tone slope parameters
       Parameter: slope_shape - shape of slope: linear, raised cosine, sine, rectangular
       Parameter: slope_len - length of slope [microseconds]

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS on success
       Returns: CW_FAILURE on failure

       bool cw_is_oss_possible(const char *device)
       Brief: Check if it is possible to open OSS output

       Parameter: device - name of OSS device to be used; if NULL then library will use default device.

       Returns: true if opening OSS output succeeded;
       Returns: false if opening OSS output failed;

       bool cw_is_pa_possible(const char *device)
       Brief: Check if it is possible to open PulseAudio output

       Function first tries to load PulseAudio library, and then does a test opening of PulseAudio output, but it closes it before returning.

       Parameter: device - sink device, NULL for default PulseAudio device

       Returns: true if opening PulseAudio output succeeded;
       Returns: false if opening PulseAudio output failed;

       void cw_block_callback(int block)
       Brief: Block the callback from being called

       Function blocks the callback from being called for a critical section of caller code if block is true, and unblocks the callback if block is false.

       Function works by blocking SIGALRM; a block should always be matched by an unblock, otherwise the tone queue will suspend forever.

       Parameter: block - pass 1 to block SIGALRM, and 0 to unblock it

       int cw_register_signal_handler(int signal_number, void (*callback_func)(int))
       Brief: Register a signal handler and optional callback function for given signal number

       On  receipt  of  that  signal,  all library features will be reset to their default states.  Following the reset, if callback_func is a function pointer, the
       function is called; if it is SIG_DFL, the library calls exit(); and if it is SIG_IGN, the library returns from the signal handler.

       This is a convenience function for clients that need to clean up library on signals, with either exit, continue, or an additional function call; in effect, a
       wrapper round a restricted form of sigaction.

       The signal_number argument indicates which signal to catch.

       On problems errno is set to EINVAL if signal_number is invalid or if a handler is already installed for that signal, or to the sigaction error code.

       Parameter: signal_number
       Parameter: callback_func

       Returns: CW_SUCCESS - if the signal handler installs correctly
       Returns: CW_FAILURE - on errors or problems

       void cw_complete_reset(void)
       Brief: Reset all library features to their default states

       Clears  the  tone  queue,  receive buffers and retained state information, any current keyer activity, and any straight key activity, returns to silence, and
       closes soundcard and console devices.  This function is suitable for calling from an application exit handler.

NOTES
       Despite the fact that this manual page constantly and consistently refers to Morse code elements as dots and dashes, DO NOT think in these terms when  trying
       to learn Morse code.  Always think of them as 'dit's and 'dah's.

       libcw  uses system itimers for its internal timing.  On most UNIX flavours, itimers are not guaranteed to signal a program exactly at the specified time, and
       they generally offer a resolution only as good as the normal system 'clock tick' resolution.  An itimer SIGALRM usually falls on a system clock tick,  making
       it accurate to no better than 10mS on a typical 100Hz kernel.

       The  effect of this is that an itimer period is generally either exactly as specified, or, more likely, slightly longer.  At higher WPM settings, the cumula‐
       tive effect of this affects timing accuracy, because at higher speeds, there are fewer 10mS clock ticks in a dot period.  For example, at  12  WPM,  the  dot
       length  is 100mS, enough to contain five kernel clock ticks; at 60 WPM, the dot length is 20mS, or just two kernel clock ticks.  So at higher speeds, the ef‐
       fect of itimer resolutions becomes more pronounced.
