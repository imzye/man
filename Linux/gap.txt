NAME
       gap - Run the Groups, Algorithms and Programming system

SYNOPSIS
       gap [OPTIONS] [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group Theory.  GAP provides a programming language, a library of thousands of functions implementing alge‐
       braic algorithms written in the GAP language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects.  GAP is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their  representations,  rings,  vector
       spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more.

OPTIONS
       Boolean options (b, e, p, q, r, A, D, M, N, O, T, X, and Y) toggle the current value each time they are used.  Default actions are indicated first.

       MEM options indicate a number of bytes.  Larger units are indicated with trailing characters: 'k' for kilobytes, m for megabytes, and g for gigabytes.  For example, '512k' means 512 kilobytes.

       -a MEM Set the amount of preallocated space.

       -b     Disable/enable the banner.

       -c MEM Set the cache size.

       -e     Disable/enable quitting on Ctrl-D.

       -f     Force line editing.

       -g     Show GASMAN messages.  If this option is given once, then full garbage collections are shown.  If it is given twice, all garbage collections are shown.

       -h     Print a help message and exit.

       -i FILE
              Load an alternate init file.

       -l PATHS
              Set  the  GAP  root paths.  A leading semicolon means to append PATHS to the existing list of root paths.  A trailing semicolon means to prepend PATHS.  Otherwise, the list of root paths is re‐
              placed with PATHS.

       -m MEM Set the initial workspace size.

       -n     Prevent line editing.

       -o MEM Set the hint for the maximal workspace size.  GAP may allocate more.

       -p     Enable/disable emitting extra commands to the output to tell a window handler what GAP is doing.

       -q     Enable/disable quiet mode.

       -r     Disable/enable reading of the .gaprc file.

       -x NUM Set the window width to NUM columns.

       -y NUM Set the window height to NUM rows.

       -A     Disable/enable autoloading of GAP packages.

       -B NAME
              Set the name of the current architecture.

       -C <output> <input> <name>
              Compile an input file with the given name into an output file.

       -D     Enable/disable debugging the loading of library files.

       -K MEM Set the maximal workspace size.  GAP never allocates more.

       -L FILE
              Restore a saved workspace.

       -M     Disable/enable loading of compiled modules.

       -N     Disable/enable check for completion files.

       -O     Enable/disable compatibility with GAP 3, by causing false and fail to be the same value.

       -R     Prevent restoring of workspace (causes -L to be ignored).

       -T     Disable/enable break loop.

       -U OPTIONS
              Set the compile options for compiling GAP files.

       -X     Enable/disable CRC while reading completion.

       -Y     Enable/disable CRC while completing files.
