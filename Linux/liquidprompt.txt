LIQUIDPROMPT(1)                                                                           General Commands Manual                                                                           LIQUIDPROMPT(1)

NAME
       liquidprompt - A full-featured & carefully designed adaptive prompt for bash & zsh

DESCRIPTION
       Liquid Prompt gives you a nicely displayed prompt with useful information when you need it.  It shows you what you need when you need it.  You will notice what changes when it changes, saving time
       and frustration.
       You can even use it with your favorite shell – bash(1) or zsh(1).

ACTIVATION
       The liquidprompt package has no way to know which users do you want this prompt to be active for.  A small script, liquidprompt_activate is included to ease activation of the prompt.

       This will set the required environment:

            * The files ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.zshrc are modified to load liquidprompt at startup.
            * If no previous ~/.config/liquidpromptrc file exists, it will be created.

       So, to get liquidprompt working simply run:

            user@debian:~$ liquidprompt_activate
            user@debian:~$ source ~/.bashrc

       Be aware that multiple invocations of the liquidprompt_activate command may pollute ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.zshrc files.

FUNCTIONS
       Once liquidprompt has been loaded, you will have 4 new commands available (which are shell functions actually).

       liquidprompt_tag tag
              tag current shell liquidprompt with tag.

       liquidprompt_OFF
              use an empty prompt, just the $ mark.

       liquidprompt_off
              turn off liquidprompt for this shell.

       liquidprompt_on
              turn on liquidprompt for this shell.

CONFIGURATION
       liquidprompt is highly configurable. There are plenty of options regarding style, performance, VCS, et all.
       Please take a look at the included README file at /usr/share/doc/liquidprompt/ and the file ~/.config/liquidpromptrc as well.
