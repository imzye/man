NAME
       Data::Binary - Simple detection of binary versus text in strings

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::Binary qw(is_text is_binary);
        my $text = File::Slurp::read_file("test1.doc");
        my $is_text = is_text($text); # equivalent to -T "test1.doc"
        my $is_binary = is_binary($text); # equivalent to -B "test1.doc"

DESCRIPTION
       This simple module provides string equivalents to the -T / -B operators. Since these only work on file names and file handles, this module provides the same functions but on strings.

       Note that the actual implementation is currently different, basically because the -T / -B functions are in C/XS, and this module is written in pure Perl.  For now, anyway.

FUNCTIONS
   is_text($string)
       Uses the same kind of heuristics in -T, but applies them to a string. Returns true if the string is basically text.

   is_binary($string)
       Uses the same kind of heuristics in -B, but applies them to a string. Returns true if the string is basically binary.
