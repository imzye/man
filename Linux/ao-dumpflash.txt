NAME
       ao-dumpflash - Fetch flash memory contents from AltOS device

SYNOPSIS
       ao-dumpflash [--tty tty-device] [--device altos-device] [--output output-file] [--remote] [--frequency frequency] [--call callsign]

OPTIONS
       -T tty-device | --tty tty-device
              This selects which tty device ao-dumpflash uses to communicate with the target device.

       -D AltOS-device | --device AltOS-device
              Search for a connected device. This requires an argument of one of the following forms:

              TeleMetrum:2
              TeleMetrum
              2

              Leaving out the product name will cause the tool to select a suitable product, leaving out the serial number will cause the tool to match one of the available devices.

       -o output-file | --output output-file
              Write flash contents to the specified file rather than stdout.

       -R | --remote
              This uses the command radio link to download the flash from TeleMetrum through a TeleDongle.

       -F frequency | --frequency frequency
              Specifies the radio frequency to use for remote communications in kHz. Default is 434550.

       -C callsign | --call callsign
              Specifies the callsign to use for remote communications. Default is N0CALL.

DESCRIPTION
       ao-dumpflash downloads the entire flash memory contents from a connected AltOS device and writes it to either stdout or the specified output file.

USAGE
       ao-dumpflash connects to the specified target device and dumps the flash.
