NAME
       rbd-fuse - expose rbd images as files

SYNOPSIS
       rbd-fuse [ -p pool ] [-c conffile] mountpoint [ fuse options ]

NOTE
       rbd-fuse is not recommended for any production or high performance workloads.

DESCRIPTION
       rbd-fuse  is  a FUSE ("Filesystem in USErspace") client for RADOS block device (rbd) images.  Given a pool containing rbd images, it will mount a userspace file system allowing access to those im‐
       ages as regular files at mountpoint.

       The file system can be unmounted with:

          fusermount -u mountpoint

       or by sending SIGINT to the rbd-fuse process.

OPTIONS
       Any options not recognized by rbd-fuse will be passed on to libfuse.

       -c ceph.conf
              Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.

       -p pool
              Use pool as the pool to search for rbd images.  Default is rbd.

AVAILABILITY
       rbd-fuse is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at https://docs.ceph.com for more information.
