NAME
       sopwith.cfg - configuration file for SDL Sopwith

DESCRIPTION
       sopwith.cfg is the configuration file for sopwith(6).  The settings stored in sopwith.cfg are usually modified in-game via the options menu.

       sopwith.cfg  is  normally  stored in the user's home directory, as ~/.local/share/SDL Sopwith/default.cfg. The path can be overridden using the XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable (see the XDG Base
       Directory Specification).

FILE FORMAT
       The file is a plain-text file, consisting of a list of configuration options and their values, separated by whitespace.  Each option is stored on a separate line.

       For example:

              integer_value                1
              integer_value2               1

       Lines beginning with "#" are interpreted as comments and will be ignored.  Invalid lines or comments in the file will generate a warning, but will otherwise be ignored.

       Some options are used for keyboard key bindings; these are stored as integer values containing the keyboard scan code of the key to be bound to.  Boolean values are also stored as integers, with a
       value of zero usually indicating "false" and a non-zero value indicating "true".

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       vid_fullscreen
              If 1, the game runs full screen rather than in a window. By default this is 0.

       conf_solidground
              If 1, display the ground as a solid white block, reproducing the visual appearance of "Sopwith 1". If 0, the ground is displayed as a line, reproducing the visual appearance of "Sopwith 2".
              By default this is 0.

       conf_video_palette
              Video palette to use for display. Valid values are 0 (CGA 1), 1 (CGA 2), 2 (CGA 3), 3 (Mono Amber), 4 (Mono Green), 5 (Mono Grey), 6 (Tosh LCD 1), 7 (Tosh LCD 2), 8 (Tosh  LCD  3),  9  (IBM
              LCD), 10 (Tandy LCD), 11 (Gas Plasma) or 12 (Atari).

       conf_hudsplats
              If 1, "splats" are shown on the screen when the plane takes damage: splatted birds are shown on the screen after a bird strike; windscreen "cracks" are shown if the plane is hit by bullets,
              and the whole screen turns magenta after flying through an ox.  This feature was added by the original author of Sopwith in the "Network Edition" release.  By default this is 0.

       conf_wounded
              If  1,  planes  can  take a single unit of damage without crashing. Your plane becomes slower to turn when wounded.  This feature was added by the original author of Sopwith in the "Network
              Edition" release.  By default this is 0.

       conf_animals
              If 1, oxen and birds appear in the game. These were added in "Sopwith 2" but were not present in the original "Sopwith 1".  By default this is 1.

       conf_harrykeys
              If 1, the key_pullup and key_pulldown controls turn your plane relative to the screen, rather than your plane. It is a common point of confusion that the direction  of  turning  appears  to
              "reverse" when the plane is flipped / flying towards the left.  By default this is 0.

       conf_big_explosions
              If  1, oil tanks produce a huge explosion when destroyed. This reproduces the behavior found in both "Sopwith 1" and "Sopwith 2", but the magnitude of the explosion was dialed back signifi‐
              cantly in the "Network Edition" release.  The default is 1.

       conf_medals
              If 1, medals are sometimes awarded to the player on return to base. Some details can be found in the "MEDALS" section of sopwith(6). The medals do not have any effect on gameplay.   By  de‐
              fault this is 1.

KEY BINDINGS
       The  following settings determine the in-game controls. These are keyboard scancodes, so the key binding does not change with keyboard layout. However, the name for the key as shown in the in-game
       options menu should match the current keyboard layout.  The values for these settings are scancodes from the USB standard for HID devices.

       key_accelerate
              Key to accelerate the plane. Default is "X" on a US layout keyboard.

       key_decelerate
              Key to decelerate the plane. Decelerating too much may cause the plane to stall. Default is "Z" on a US layout keyboard.

       key_pullup
              Key to pull up (aim the plane towards the sky). Default is "," on a US layout keyboard. Note that conf_harrykeys may change the behavior of this key binding.

       key_pulldown
              Key to pull down (aim the plane towards the ground. Default is "/" on a US layout keyboard.  Note that conf_harrykeys may change the behavior of this key binding.

       key_flip
              Key to flip the plane upside down. Default is "." on a US layout keyboard.

       key_fire
              Key to fire the machine gun. Default on a US layout keyboard is the spacebar.

       key_dropbomb
              Key to drop a bomb. Default is "B" on a US layout keyboard.

       key_home
              Key to autopilot the plane home to base. Default is "H" on a US layout keyboard.

HIDDEN SETTINGS
       The following are "hidden settings": they cannot be edited in-game via the options menu, and editing the configuration file is the only way to change them.

       snd_tinnyfilter
              If 1, a filter is applied to the sound output so that it sounds more like a tinny PC speaker that's inside a metal PC case. By default this is 1.

       conf_missiles
              Enable missiles and starbursts (flares). This is a feature that was originally added by the author of Sopwith in the "Network Edition" release, but  has  been  hidden  as  it  significantly
              changes the gameplay in a way that doesn't fit the game's theme and also isn't particularly fun.

       key_missile
              Fire missile, if conf_missiles is enabled. Default key is "V" on a US layout keyboard.

       key_starburst
              Launch starburst (flare) if conf_missiles is enabled. Default key is "C" on a US layout keyboard.
