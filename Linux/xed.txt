NAME
       Xed - The Text Editor

SYNOPSIS
       xed [OPTIONS...] [FILES...]

DESCRIPTION
       Xed is the official text editor of the X-APPS project, which aims to provide applications to the Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce desktops. While aiming at simplicity and ease of use, Xed is a powerful general
       purpose text editor. It can be used to create and edit all sorts of text files.

       Xed features a flexible plugin system which can be used to dynamically add new advanced features to Xed itself.

       This manual page briefly documents the xed command.

OPTIONS
       filename(s)...
              Specifies the file to open when xed starts. If this is not specified, xed will start a new, blank file with an "Unsaved Document" label. Multiple files can be loaded if they  are  separated  by
              spaces. xed also supports handling of remote files.
