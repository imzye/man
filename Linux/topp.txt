NAME
       topp - library for LC/MS data management and analysis - tools

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the topp package that brings a set of binary tools to build the OpenMS proteomics pipeline (topp). OpenMS offers an infrastructure for the development of mass
       spectrometry-related software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization solutions. OpenMS offers analyses for various quantitation protocols,  including  label-free  quantitation,  SILAC,  iTRAQ,  SRM,
       SWATH…  It  provides  build-in algorithms for de-novo identification and database search, as well as adapters to other state-of-the art tools like X!Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA… OpenMS supports the Pro‐
       teomics Standard Initiative (PSI) formats for MS data and supports easy integration of tools into workflow engines like Knime, Galaxy, WS-Pgrade, and TOPPAS via the TOPPtools concept and a unified
       parameter handling.
