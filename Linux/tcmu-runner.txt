NAME
       tcmu-runner - A daemon that handles the userspace side of the LIO TCM-User backstore

DESCRIPTION
       tcmu-runner is a service that provides an operating environment for LIO TCM-User handlers. These currently include handlers for Gluster glfs and the qcow and qcow2 image formats.

USAGE
       While normally started automatically via D-Bus system activation, tcmu-runner can also be run as root directly, usually for debugging and development purposes.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print usage information

       -d, --debug
              Enable debug messages

       -V, --version
              Print tcmu-runner's version

CONFIGURING HANDLERS
       TCMU-backed handlers are typically configured using normal LIO configuration tools, such as targetcli.  Part of doing this will be entering a handler-specific configuration string.

   CONFIGURING GLUSTER HANDLER (glfs)
       This handler uses the Gluster glfs API to use Gluster as a backstore for the image file.

       Its configuration string is:

           volume@hostname/filename
           volume: The volume on the Gluster server
           hostname: The server's hostname
           filename: The backing file

   CONFIGURING QCOW HANDLER (qcow)
       This handler supports qcow, qcow2, or raw image file formats.

       Its configuration string is:

           path
           path: The full path to a file of a supported file format. The file must already have been created using qemu-img.
