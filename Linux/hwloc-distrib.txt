HWLOC-DISTRIB(1)                     hwloc                    HWLOC-DISTRIB(1)

NAME
       hwloc-distrib - Build a number of cpu masks distributed on the system

SYNOPSIS
       hwloc-distrib [options] <integer>

OPTIONS
       --single
              Singlify each output to a single CPU.

       --taskset
              Show  CPU  set  strings  in the format recognized by the taskset
              command-line program instead of hwloc-specific  CPU  set  string
              format.

       -v --verbose
              Verbose messages.

       -i <file>, --input <file>
              Read  topology  from XML file <file> (instead of discovering the
              topology on the local machine).  If <file> is "-", the  standard
              input  is used.  XML support must have been compiled in to hwloc
              for this option to be usable.

       -i <directory>, --input <directory>
              Read topology from <directory> instead of discovering the topol‐
              ogy  of  the local machine.  On Linux, the directory may contain
              the topology files gathered from another machine  topology  with
              hwloc-gather-topology.   On  x86,  the  directory  may contain a
              cpuid dump gathered with hwloc-gather-cpuid.

       -i <specification>, --input <specification>
              Simulate a fake hierarchy (instead of discovering  the  topology
              on  the local machine). If <specification> is "node:2 pu:3", the
              topology will contain two NUMA nodes with 3 processing units  in
              each of them.  The <specification> string must end with a number
              of PUs.

       --if <format>, --input-format <format>
              Enforce the input in the given format, among xml, fsroot,  cpuid
              and synthetic.

       --ignore <type>
              Ignore all objects of type <type> in the topology.

       --from <type>
              Distribute  starting  from  objects of the given type instead of
              from the top of the topology hierarchy, i.e. ignoring the struc‐
              ture given by objects above.

              <type> cannot be among NUMANode, I/O or Misc types.

       --to <type>
              Distribute  down to objects of the given type instead of down to
              the bottom of the topology hierarchy, i.e. ignoring  the  struc‐
              ture  given  by objects below.  This may be useful if some lati‐
              tude is desired for the binding, e.g.  just  bind  several  pro‐
              cesses to each package without specifying a single core for each
              of them.

              <type> cannot be among NUMANode, I/O or Misc types.

       --at <type>
              Distribute among objects of the given type.  This is  equivalent
              to specifying both --from and --to at the same time.

       --reverse
              Distribute by starting with the last objects first, and singlify
              CPU sets by keeping the last bit (instead of the first bit).

       --restrict <cpuset>
              Restrict the topology to the given cpuset.

       --disallowed
              Include objects disallowed by administrative limitations.

       --version
              Report version and exit.

       -h --help
              Display help message and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       hwloc-distrib generates a series of CPU masks corresponding to  a  dis‐
       tribution  of  a  given  number  of  elements  over the topology of the
       machine. The distribution is done recursively from the top of the hier‐
       archy (or from the level specified by option --from) down to the bottom
       of the hierarchy (or down to the level specified  by  option  --to,  or
       until  only  one  element remains), splitting the number of elements at
       each encountered hierarchy level not ignored by options --ignore.

       This can e.g. be used to distribute a set of  processes  hierarchically
       according  to  the  topology of a machine. These masks can be used with
       hwloc-bind(1).

       NOTE: It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page
       before  reading  this  man  page.   Most  of  the concepts described in
       hwloc(7) directly apply to the hwloc-bind utility.

EXAMPLES
       hwloc-distrib's operation is best described through several examples.

       If 4 processes have to be distributed across a machine, their CPU masks
       may be obtained with:

           $ hwloc-distrib 4
           0x0000000f
           0x00000f00
           0x000000f0
           0x0000f000

       To  distribute  only  among  the second package, the topology should be
       restricted:

           $ hwloc-distrib --restrict $(hwloc-calc package:1) 4
           0x00000010
           0x00000020
           0x00000040
           0x00000080

       To get a single processor of each CPU masks (prevent migration in  case
       of binding)

           $ hwloc-distrib 4 --single
           0x00000001
           0x00000100
           0x00000010
           0x00001000

       Each output line may be converted independently with hwloc-calc:

           $ hwloc-distrib 4 --single | hwloc-calc --taskset
           0x1
           0x100
           0x10
           0x1000

       To  convert  the output into a list of processors that may be passed to
       dplace -c inside a mpirun command line:

           $ hwloc-distrib 4 --single | xargs hwloc-calc --pulist
           0,8,4,16

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful execution, hwloc-distrib displays one or more CPU  mask
       strings.  The return value is 0.

       hwloc-distrib  will return nonzero if any kind of error occurs, such as
       (but not limited to) failure to parse the command line.
