NAME
       cobertura-report — generate coverage reports

SYNOPSIS
       cobertura-report [--datafile file]  --destination dir [--format html|xml]  [--encoding encoding]  directory [--basedir dir]

DESCRIPTION
       cobertura-report  generates  coverage reports from the source code directories and calculates the cyclomatic code complexity of each class. The HTML reports are also made of annotated versions of each
       source file, showing which lines of code were exercised.

OPTIONS
       --datafile file
                 Specify the name of the file containing metadata about your classes. Default value: "./cobertura.ser".

       --basedir dir
                 Specify a directory containing source code. All files listed after this are assumed to be underneath this directory. This should only be used if you want to include only a few specific files
                 underneath a source tree and exclude all other files.

       --destination dir
                 Specify the output directory for the report.

       --format xml|html
                 The type of report you want to generate. Default value: html.

       --encoding encoding
                 Specify the encoding used to read the source. See javadocs for java.nio.charset.Charset for more details.
