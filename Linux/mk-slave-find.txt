NAME
       mk-slave-find - Find and print replication hierarchy tree of MySQL slaves.

SYNOPSIS
       Usage: mk-slave-find [OPTION...] MASTER-HOST

       mk-slave-find finds and prints a hierarchy tree of MySQL slaves.

       Examples:

          mk-slave-find --host master-host

RISKS
       The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks, whether known or unknown, of using this tool.  The two main categories of risks are those created by the nature of the tool
       (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write tools) and those created by bugs.

       mk-slave-find is read-only and very low-risk.

       At the time of this release, we know of no bugs that could cause serious harm to users.

       The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue tracking system.  Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.  You can see a list of such issues at the following
       URL: <http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-slave-find>.

       See also "BUGS" for more information on filing bugs and getting help.

DESCRIPTION
       mk-slave-find connects to a MySQL replication master and finds its slaves.  Currently the only thing it can do is print a tree-like view of the replication hierarchy.

       The master host can be specified using one of two methods.  The first method is to use the standard connection-related command line options: "--defaults-file", "--password", "--host", "--port",
       "--socket" or "--user".

       The second method to specify the master host is a DSN.  A DSN is a special syntax that can be either just a hostname (like "server.domain.com" or 1.2.3.4), or a "key=value,key=value" string. Keys are
       a single letter:

          KEY MEANING
          === =======
          h   Connect to host
          P   Port number to use for connection
          S   Socket file to use for connection
          u   User for login if not current user
          p   Password to use when connecting
          F   Only read default options from the given file

       "mk-slave-find" reads all normal MySQL option files, such as ~/.my.cnf, so you may not need to specify username, password and other common options at all.

EXIT STATUS
       An exit status of 0 (sometimes also called a return value or return code) indicates success.  Any other value represents the exit status of the Perl process itself.

OPTIONS
       This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage information for details.

       --ask-pass
           Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.

       --charset
           short form: -A; type: string

           Default character set.  If the value is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on STDOUT to utf8, passes the mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MySQL.  Any
           other value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MySQL.

       --config
           type: Array

           Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the first option on the command line.

       --database
           type: string; short form: -D

           Database to use.

       --defaults-file
           short form: -F; type: string

           Only read mysql options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --host
           short form: -h; type: string

           Connect to host.

       --password
           short form: -p; type: string

           Password to use when connecting.

       --pid
           type: string

           Create the given PID file.  The file contains the process ID of the script.  The PID file is removed when the script exits.  Before starting, the script checks if the PID file already exists.  If
           it does not, then the script creates and writes its own PID to it.  If it does, then the script checks the following: if the file contains a PID and a process is running with that PID, then the
           script dies; or, if there is no process running with that PID, then the script overwrites the file with its own PID and starts; else, if the file contains no PID, then the script dies.

       --port
           short form: -P; type: int

           Port number to use for connection.

       --recurse
           type: int

           Number of levels to recurse in the hierarchy.  Default is infinite.

           See "--recursion-method".

       --recursion-method
           type: string

           Preferred recursion method used to find slaves.

           Possible methods are:

             METHOD       USES
             ===========  ================
             processlist  SHOW PROCESSLIST
             hosts        SHOW SLAVE HOSTS

           The processlist method is preferred because SHOW SLAVE HOSTS is not reliable.  However, the hosts method is required if the server uses a non-standard port (not 3306).  Usually mk-slave-find does
           the right thing and finds the slaves, but you may give a preferred method and it will be used first.  If it doesn't find any slaves, the other methods will be tried.

       --report-format
           type: string; default: summary

           Set what information about the slaves is printed.  The report format can be one of the following:

           •   hostname

               Print just the hostname name of the slaves.  It looks like:

                 127.0.0.1:12345
                 +- 127.0.0.1:12346
                    +- 127.0.0.1:12347

           •   summary

               Print a summary of each slave's settings.  This report shows more information about each slave, like:

                 127.0.0.1:12345
                 Version         5.1.34-log
                 Server ID       12345

                 Slave status

                 Auto-increment  increment 1, offset 1
                 +- 127.0.0.1:12346
                    Version         5.1.34-log
                    Server ID       12346
                    Uptime          04:54 (started 2010-06-17T11:21:24)
                    Replication     Is a slave, has 1 slaves connected
                    Filters
                    Binary logging  STATEMENT
                    Slave status    0 seconds behind, running, no errors
                    Slave mode      STRICT
                    Auto-increment  increment 1, offset 1

       --set-vars
           type: string; default: wait_timeout=10000

           Set these MySQL variables.  Immediately after connecting to MySQL, this string will be appended to SET and executed.

       --socket
           short form: -S; type: string

           Socket file to use for connection.

       --user
           short form: -u; type: string

           User for login if not current user.

       --version
           Show version and exit.

DSN OPTIONS
       These DSN options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like "option=value".  The options are case-sensitive, so P and p are not the same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after
       the "=" and if the value contains whitespace it must be quoted.  DSN options are comma-separated.  See the maatkit manpage for full details.

           dsn: charset; copy: yes

           Default character set.

       •   D

DOWNLOADING
       You can download Maatkit from Google Code at <http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/>, or you can get any of the tools easily with a command like the following:

          wget http://www.maatkit.org/get/toolname
          or
          wget http://www.maatkit.org/trunk/toolname

       Where "toolname" can be replaced with the name (or fragment of a name) of any of the Maatkit tools.  Once downloaded, they're ready to run; no installation is needed.  The first URL gets the latest
       released version of the tool, and the second gets the latest trunk code from Subversion.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable "MKDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output in all of the Maatkit tools:

          MKDEBUG=1 mk-....

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any reasonably new version of Perl.

BUGS
       For a list of known bugs see <http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-slave-find>.

       Please use Google Code Issues and Groups to report bugs or request support: <http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/>.  You can also join #maatkit on Freenode to discuss Maatkit.

       Please include the complete command-line used to reproduce the problem you are seeing, the version of all MySQL servers involved, the complete output of the tool when run with "--version", and if
       possible, debugging output produced by running with the "MKDEBUG=1" environment variable.
