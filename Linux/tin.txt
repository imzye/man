NAME
       tin, rtin - related files

DESCRIPTION
       This man page describes the various (config) files and their formats used by the tin(1) newsreader.  All files are expected to have unix style ('\n' aka LF) line endings.

FILES
       $MAILCAPS
       ~/.mailcap
       /etc/mailcap
       /usr/etc/mailcap
       /usr/local/etc/mailcap
       /etc/mail/mailcap

              mailcap(5)  files  as defined in RFC1524.  The mailcap files are read by tin(1) to determine how to display non-text messages at the local site.  Any line that starts with "#" is a comment.
              Blank lines are ignored. Otherwise, each line defines a single mailcap entry for a single content type.  Long lines may be continued by ending them with a backslash character, "\".

              Each individual mailcap entry consists of a content-type specification, a command to execute, and (possibly) a set of optional "flag" values.

              The "type" field is simply any valid content type name.  It is the string that will be matched against the ''Content-Type:'' header to decide if this is the mailcap entry that  matches  the
              current message.  Additionally, the type field may specify a subtype or a wildcard to match all subtypes.

              The "command" field is any UNIX command and is used to specify the interpreter for the given type of message.  It will be passed to the shell via the system(3) facility.

              Semicolons  and  backslashes  within  the command or any flag field must be quoted with backslashes.  If the field contains "%s", those two characters will be replaced by the name of a file
              that contains the body of the message.  If it contains "%t", those two characters will be replaced by the content-type field, including the subtype, if any.  If it contains "%{" followed by
              a parameter name and a closing "}", then all those characters will be replaced by the value of the named parameter, if any, from the ''Content-Type:'' header.  Finally, if  the  field  con‐
              tains "\%", those two characters will be replaced by a single "%" character.

              Besides the type and command field the following "flags" are defined:

              compose
                     The  "compose"  field  may be used to specify a program that can be used to compose a new body or body part in the given format.  Its intended use is to support mail composing agents
                     that support the composition of multiple types of mail using external composing agents.  As with the view-command, the semantics of program execution are operating system  dependent.
                     The result of the composing program may be data that is not yet suitable for mail transport — that is, a Content-Transfer-Encoding may need to be applied to the data.

              composetyped
                     The "composetyped" field is similar to the "compose" field, but is to be used when the composing program needs to specify the ''Content-Type:'' header field to be applied to the com‐
                     posed  data.   The  "compose" field is simpler, and is preferred for use with existing (non-mail-oriented) programs for composing data in a given format.  The "composetyped" field is
                     necessary when the Content-Type information must include auxiliary parameters, and the composition program must then know enough about mail formats to produce  output  that  includes
                     the mail type information.

              edit   The  "edit"  field  may be used to specify a program that can be used to edit a body or body part in the given format.  In many cases, it may be identical in content to the "compose"
                     field, and shares the operating-system dependent semantics for program execution.

              print  The "print" field may be used to specify a program that can be used to print a message or body part in the given format.  As with the view-command, the semantics of program execution
                     are operating system dependent.

              test   The "test" field may be used to test some external condition (e.g., the machine architecture, or the window system in use) to determine whether or not the mailcap line  applies.   It
                     specifies  a program to be run to test some condition.  The semantics of execution and of the value returned by the test program are operating system dependent.  If the test fails, a
                     subsequent mailcap entry should be sought.  Multiple test fields are not permitted — since a test can call a program, it can already be arbitrarily complex.

              needsterminal
                     The "needsterminal" field indicates that the view-command must be run on an interactive terminal.  This is needed to inform window-oriented user agents that an  interactive  terminal
                     is needed.  (The decision is not left exclusively to the view-command because in some circumstances it may not be possible for such programs to tell whether or not they are on inter‐
                     active terminals.)  The needsterminal command should be assumed to apply to the compose and edit commands, too, if they exist.  Note that this is NOT a test – it is a requirement for
                     the environment in which the program will be executed, and should typically cause the creation of a terminal window when not executed on either a real terminal or a terminal window.

              copiousoutput
                     The  "copiousoutput"  field indicates that the output from the view-command will be an extended stream of output and is to be interpreted as advice to the UA (User Agent mail-reading
                     program) that the output should be either paged or made scroll-able.  Note that it is probably a mistake if needsterminal and copiousoutput are both specified.

              description
                     The "description" field simply provides a textual description, optionally quoted, that describes the type of data, to be used optionally by mail readers that  wish  to  describe  the
                     data before offering to display it.

              textualnewlines
                     The "textualnewlines" field, if set to any nonzero value, indicates that this type of data is line-oriented and that, if encoded in base64, all newlines should be converted to canon‐
                     ical  form  (CRLF)  before  encoding, and will be in that form after decoding.  In general, this field is needed only if there is line-oriented data of some type other than text/* or
                     non-line-oriented data that is a subtype of text.

              x11-bitmap
                     The "x11-bitmap" field names a file, in X11 bitmap (xbm) format, which points to an appropriate icon to be used to visually denote the presence of this kind of data.

              nametemplate
                     The "nametemplate" field gives a filename format, in which %s will be replaced by a short unique string to give the name of the temporary file to be passed to  the  viewing  command.
                     This is only expected to be relevant in environments where filename extensions are meaningful, e.g., one could specify that a GIF file being passed to a gif viewer should have a name
                     ending in ".gif" by using "nametemplate=%s.gif".

              tin(1)  currently  only  respects  the "test", "description", "nametemplate" and partly the "needsterminal" flags, all other flags are internally ignored.  It also can't handle the "%F" and
              "%n" expansions yet.

              Example:
                     # mailcap file example
                     image/*;\
                        xv -8 -geometry +0 '%s';\
                        description=%{name} %t-Image;\
                        test=test "$DISPLAY" != "";\
                        nametemplate=%s.IMAGE

                     message/rfc822;\
                        ${PAGER:-"more"} '%s';\
                        edit=${EDITOR:-"vi"} '%s';\
                        compose=${EDITOR:-"vi"} '%s';\
                        print=a2ps '%s';\
                        needsterminal

       /etc/news/server

              default NNTP-server to read news from if not reading from the local spool.  ''-g server'', $NNTPSERVER have higher priority (in that order), the default server given  at  compile  time  has
              lower priority.

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.cancelsecret

              secret  to  be used for cancel-locks (RFC8315) if tin(1) is built with support for it. An empty secret file disables the cancel-lock creation in that case. This file should be readable only
              by the user.

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.mime.types
       /etc/mime.types
       /etc/tin/mime.types

              mime type / filename extension pairs

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.newsauth

              "nntpserver[:port] password [user]" pairs for NNTP servers that require authorization. If the password contains a space or a tab it must be enclosed in double quotes ("). Usernames must not
              be enclosed in double quotes and thus can't contain spaces or tabs. Any line that starts with "#" is a comment. Blank lines are ignored. This file should be readable only for the user as it
              contains the user's unencrypted password for reading news!

              nntpserver
                     full qualified domain name of the news server. Additionally, a port can be specified by appending :portnumber.

              password
                     user's unencrypted password for reading news.

              user   username on the news server if it differs from the local login. This field is optional.

              Example:
                     # sample .newsauth file
                     news.example.org  secret
                     news.example.net  arcane  guest
                     news.example.com  "top secret"  james.bond@example.com

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.newsrc

              "newsgroupflag [article[,article | -article]...]"  lines.

              newsgroup
                     the name of the newsgroup.

              flag   a flag indicating if the group is subscribed ':' or not '!'.

              article
                     range of already read articles from that group; numbers separated by commas with sequential numbers collapsed with hyphens. Empty lines and lines which start with "#" are ignored and
                     not written back.

              Example:
                     # sample .newsrc file
                     news.software.b! 1–666,669
                     news.software.nntp: 1–13245,13247,13249
                     news.software.readers: 1–19567,19571–19597

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/$NNTPSERVER/.oldnewsrc

              backup of ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.newsrc

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.signature
       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.Sig

              signature

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.sigfixed

              fixed part of a randomly generated signature, this will be added first

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/.inputhistory

              history of last used strings

       ${TIN_INDEX_MAILDIR:-"${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin"}/.mail/

              mailgroups index files

       ${TIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR:-"${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin"}/.news${NNTPSERVER:+"-$NNTPSERVER"}/

              newsgroups index files

       ${TIN_INDEX_SAVEDIR:-"${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin"}/.save/

              saved newsgroups index files

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/active.mail

              active file ("mailgroupname maxnum minnum mailspool" quadruples separated by spaces not tabs) of user's mailgroups (requires tin(1) to be built with mh-mail-handling support).

              mailgroupname
                     must be the pathname of the mailbox relative to field #4 with '/' changed to '.'

              maxnum just put a large number here, something higher than the highest message in the mailbox

              minnum put 0 here

              mailspool
                     path of mail spool directory. This must be the full pathname to the root of the mail folder area.

              Example:
                     Mail.inbox 12345 00000 /home/foo
                     Mail.outbox 23456 00000 /home/foo

              This allows access to the 'inbox' and 'outbox' folders of user foo.  They are accessed via /home/foo/Mail/inbox and /home/foo/Mail/outbox

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/active.save

              active file of user's saved newsgroups, used by tin -R.

       /etc/tin/attributes
       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/attributes

              The group attributes files may be used to override some global settings from ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc on a per group basis. Order is important as last match  counts;  this  allows
              one  to  refine attributes for narrowed scopes. Note that the scope=<grouplist> line has to be specified before the attributes are specified for that list and each attribute can only be set
              once per scope section. All attributes are set to a reasonable default so you only have to specify the attribute that you want to change. All toggle attributes are set by specifying ON/OFF.
              Otherwise, they function exactly as their global equivalents. The following group attributes are available:

              scope  This changes the list of groups to which the attributes that follow will be applied. See the section NEWSGROUP LISTS & WILDCARDS in tin(1) for the types of pattern that can  be  used
                     here.

                     If  this  is  set  to  ON, then saved article files that have been post-processed will be automatically deleted, otherwise the user will be asked whether to delete the post-processed
                     files. Automatic processing of marked articles using GroupAutoSave ('S') will suppress prompting.

              mime_forward
                     Determines whether usenet articles are forwarded as attachment or inline. When set to OFF, the forwarded article will be included in the body of the mail, while setting this variable
                     to ON will cause the article to be attached as a separate MIME part. Enabling mime_forward is particularly useful for articles consisting of multiple  MIME  parts  such  as  PGP/MIME
                     signed  messages or being encoded in a different character set than your local one. It is also useful if the receiver should be able to operate on the entire forwarded article (i.e.,
                     view or save it without your comments). On the other hand, if you want to forward only some parts of the article or to insert 'inline' annotations, you might want to disable this op‐
                     tion.  Currently mime_forward is forced if the article to be attached is a multipart MIME article, this may change in a future version.  Please note that for this option to have  ef‐
                     fect, the tinrc variable interactive_mailer has to be set to 0 (which is the default).

              mime_types_to_save
                     A  comma separated list of MIME major/minor Content-Types that will be saved when using the view/save and save/autosave features.  A single * can be used to wildcard the major and/or
                     minor type and a ! as the first character in an entry will negate it, eg: image/*,!image/bmp,!text/html. Default is */*

              organization
                     This can be used to set the article header field ''Organization:''. It overrides the setting (if any) of organization in  /etc/tin/tin.defaults  and  $ORGANIZATION  (or  $NEWSORG  on
                     Apollo DomainOS). If it points to a readable file a random line from that file will be used. Note that some news servers might still overwrite the ''Organization:'' header.

              x_body A  piece  of text that will be added at the start of a message body. If this string starts with a / or ~ then it is assumed to be the name of a file containing the text to insert. If
                     the string starts with a ! then what follows is assumed to be the path to a program to be executed to generate the content. %G is expanded to the current news.group.name  and  %P  is
                     expanded to the news.group.name with all '.' replaced by '/'.

              x_headers
                     A string including header-name and the contents of the header that will be automatically added when posting. If the string starts with a / or ~ then it is assumed to be the name of a
                     file  containing  the  header  and  its  content to be inserted. If the string starts with a ! then what follows is assumed to be the path to a program to be executed to generate the

              undeclared_charset
                     Assume (broken) articles without MIME charset declaration have this charset — default is US-ASCII. This attribute works only on systems with  working  iconv(3)  or  ucnv_*(),  others
                     might have to compile tin(1) with --disable-mime-strict-charset.

              undeclared_cs_guess
                     Guess charset for (broken) articles without MIME charset declaration.  This attribute works only on systems with working iconv(3) or ucnv_*() and ucsdet_getName() from libicui18n. It
                     has no effect if undeclared_charset is also set.

                     # assume ISO-8859-1 as charset if no charset is declared

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/filter

              The  filter  file  is  used  to  assign  scores  to  certain  articles.  Based  on the score an article can be filtered out (hidden) or marked hot.  The tinrc variables score_limit_kill and
              score_limit_select are the limits that must be crossed to mark an article as killed or selected.  Empty lines or lines beginning with a '#' are ignored. Multiple matching-rules in the  same
              scope are all applied individually and not only when they all hit at the same time (logical OR not AND).

              comment
                     Every  entry  (rule)  in the filter file might get a comment. Multiple lines are allowed (but only for comments yet). Every line must start with the "comment=" keyword. Comments must
                     appear first in the rule.  Comment lines placed within a rule will be moved to the begin of the next rule. This might be changed in the future. Don't use  '#'  to  mark  comments  as
                     those lines are ignored and your comments will get lost on the next write of the file.

              group  A comma-separated list of newsgroup patterns in wildmat-style to which groups the filter rule will be applied. This line is mandatory!

              case   0=case-sensitive, 1=case-insensitive

              score  Score value of the rule; can also be one of the magic words "kill" or "hot".

              subj   Match against ''Subject:''. The matching type used (wildmat or regex) depends on the setting of the tinrc variable wildcard.

              from   Match  against  ''From:''.   tin(1)  converts  the  contents  of  the  ''From:''  header  to an old style e-mail address, e.g., ''some@body.example (John Doe)'' instead of ''John Doe
                     <some@body.example>'', before trying to match the patterns in the filter rule. The matching type used (wildmat or regex) depends on the setting of the tinrc variable wildcard.

              msgid  Match against ''Message-ID:'' and full ''References:''. The matching type used (wildmat or regex) depends on the setting of the tinrc variable wildcard.

              msgid_last
                     Match against ''Message-ID:'' and last ''References:'' entry (direct responses) only. The matching type used (wildmat or regex) depends on the setting of the tinrc variable wildcard.

              msgid_only
                     Match against ''Message-ID:''. The matching type used (wildmat or regex) depends on the setting of the tinrc variable wildcard.

              refs_only
                     Match against ''References:''. The matching type used (wildmat or regex) depends on the setting of the tinrc variable wildcard.

              lines  Match against ''Lines:'', <num matches less than, >num matches more than.

              gnksa  Match against ''From:'' address parser return codes. <num matches less than, >num matches more than the returned numeric value. GNKSA_LOCAL_DOMAIN_LITERAL or GNKSA_INVALID_DOMAIN are
                     only returned if disable_gnksa_domain_check in /etc/tin/tin.defaults is set to OFF. As the built in domain list may be outdated this should be considered carefully. GNKSA_ILLEGAL_LA‐
                     BEL_BEGNUM is only only returned if tin(1) was compiled with ENFORCE_RFC1034 defined which is usually not the case.

              xref   Match against ''Xref:'' line. Before any matching is done the line is turned into the same format ''Newsgroups:'' has that is it is turned into a comma separated newsgroup list  with
                     all other information (i.e., the article counter) removed. The matching type used (wildmat or regex) depends on the setting of the tinrc variable wildcard.

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/mailgroups

              This  file  provides short descriptions of each mailgroup. (requires tin(1) to be built with mh-mail-handling support). Each line consist of two tab-separated fields "mailgroupname one-line
              description".

              mailgroupname
                     is the name of the newsgroup

              description
                     is a short single-line description of the group

       ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/newsrctable

              "nntpserver[:port] newsrc [shortname [...]]"  pairs to use with the ''-g'' command-line switch. The matching is case-insensitive and any line that starts with "#", ";" or " " is treated  as
              a comment. This is only available if reading via NNTP.

              nntpserver
                     full  qualified  domain name of the news server. Plain IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets. Additionally, a port can be specified by appending :portnumber. Be aware that
                     if a port is given it will override any port given with ''-g'' or ''-p'' or implied by ''-T'' or ''-k'' or set via $NNTPPORT. The string "default" or "*" acts as  wildcard  to  match
                     any name, such a line should be placed last.

              newsrc related newsrc. A file specified via ''-f'' has a higher priority.

              shortname
                     nickname(s) for the nntpserver. Nicknames must not contain ":" and must be unique.

              Example:
                     # sample newsrctable file
                     news.tin.org .newsrc-tin.org tinorg

                     # catch all rules should go last
                     # with the more specific one on top

                         0     Nothing
                         1     Complete UU/YENC

                        15    Hide all

              hideline_regex
                     A regular expression to hide matching lines in pager. Could be used to hide excessive quoting, e.g. via '^>\s?>\s?>'. If left blank, no lines will be hidden. This option does not af‐
                     fect lines within verbatim blocks and is applied after trim_article_body and suppress_soft_hyphens.

              inews_prog
                     Path, name and options of external inews(1).  If you are reading via NNTP the default value is "--internal" (use built-in NNTP inews), else it is "inews -h". The article is passed to
                     inews_prog on STDIN via '< article'.

              info_in_last_line
                     If  ON,  show  current group description or article subject in the last line (not in the pager and global menu) — ToggleInfoLastLine ('i') toggles setting. This facility is useful as
                     the full width of the screen is available to display long subjects. Default is OFF.

              interactive_mailer
                     If greater than 0 your mailreader will be invoked earlier for reply so you can use more of its features (e.g., MIME, pgp, ...). 1 means include headers, 2 means don't include headers
                     (old use_mailreader_i=ON option). 0 turns off usage. This option has to suit mailer_format. Default is 0.

              inverse_okay
                     If ON use inverse video for page headers and URL highlighting.  Default is ON.

              keep_dead_articles
                     If ON keep all failed postings in ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/dead.articles besides keeping the last failed posting in ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/dead.article. Default is ON.

              keep_expired_filters
                     If ON keep expired filter rules in the file, but no longer evaluate them.  Default is OFF.

              kill_level
                     This option controls the processing and display of articles that are killed. There are 3 options, default is 0 (Kill only unread arts).

                        0  Kill only unread arts is the 'traditional' behavior of tin(1).  Only unread articles are killed once only by marking them read. As filtering only  happens  on  unread  articles
                           with kill_level set to 0, art_marked_killed and art_marked_read_selected are only shown once. When you reenter the group the mark will be gone.

                        1  Kill  all  arts & show with K will process all articles in the group and therefore there is a processing overhead when using this option. Killed articles are threaded as normal
                           but they will be marked with art_marked_killed.

                        2  Kill all arts and never show will process all articles in the group and therefore there is a processing overhead when using this option. Killed articles  simply  does  not  get
                           displayed at all.

              mail_8bit_header
                     Allows 8-bit characters unencoded in the header of mail message. Default is OFF. Turning it ON is effective only if mail_mime_encoding is also set to 8bit. Leaving it OFF is safe for
                     most users and compliant to Internet Mail Standard (RFC5322 and RFC2047).

              mail_address
                     User's mail address (and full name), if not username@host. This is used when creating articles, sending mail and when pgp(1) signing.

              mail_mime_encoding
                     MIME encoding of the body in mail message, if necessary (8bit, base64, quoted-printable, 7bit). Default is quoted-printable.

              mail_quote_format
                     Format  of  quote  line when replying (via mail) to an article (%A=Address, %D=Date, %F=Fullname+Address, %G=Groupname, %M=Message-ID, %N=Fullname, %C=Firstname, %I=Initials). If the
                     article has multiple addresses only the first is evaluated. Default is "In article %M you wrote:"

              mailbox_format
                     Select one of the following mailbox-formats: MBOXO (default, except on SCO), MBOXRD or MMDF (default on SCO). See mbox(5) and RFC4155 for more details on MBOXO and MBOXRD and mmdf(5)
                     for more details about MMDF.

              maildir
                     The directory where articles/threads are to be saved in mbox(5) format. This feature  is  mainly  for  use  with  the  mutt(1)  mail  program.  It  allows  the  user  to  save  arti‐
                     cles/threads/groups simply by giving '=' as the filename to save to.  Default is ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/Mail.

              mailer_format
                     The  format  string  used to create the mailer command with parameters that is used for mailing articles to other people. Default is '%M "%T" < %F' (e.g., /bin/mail "iain" < ~/.arti‐
                     cle). The flexible format allows other mailers with different command line parameters to be used such as
                        sendmail -oem -t < %F
                        mutt -H %F
                        claws-mail --compose "mailto:%T?subject=%S&insert=%F"
                     interactive_mailer must be set adequate. The following substitutions are supported:
                        %F              filename
                        %M              default_mailer
                        %S              subject-field
                        %T              to-filed
                        %U              username
                        %%              %

              mark_saved_read
                     If ON mark articles that are saved as read. Default is ON.

              mark_ignore_tags
                     When this is ON, the GroupMarkThdRead ('K'), ThreadMarkArtRead ('K'), MarkThdUnread ('Z') at Group level and MarkArtUnread ('z') at Thread level functions mark just the current arti‐
                     cle or thread, ignoring other tagged, (un)read articles. When OFF, the same function presents a menu with choices of the current thread or article, all tagged,  unread  articles,  or
                     nothing.

              metamail_prog
                     Path,  name  and  options  of  external metamail(1) program used to view non-textual parts of articles.  To use the built-in viewer, set to --internal. This is the default value when
                     metamail(1) is not installed. Leave it blank if you don't want any automatic viewing of non-textual attachments. The PageViewAttach ('V') command can always be used to manually  view
                     any attachments. See also ask_for_metamail.

              mm_charset
                     Charset  supported locally, which is also used for MIME header (charset parameter and charset name in header encoding) in mail and news postings. If MIME_STRICT_CHARSET is defined at
                     compile time, text in charset other than the value of this parameter is considered not displayable and represented as '?'. Otherwise, all character sets are  regarded  as  compatible
                     with  the  display.  If  it's not set, the value of the environment variable $MM_CHARSET is used. US-ASCII or compile-time default is used in case neither of them is defined. If your
                     system supports iconv(3) or ucnv_*(), this option is disabled and you should use mm_network_charset instead.

              mm_network_charset
                     Charset used for posting and MIME headers; replaces mm_charset.  Conversion between mm_network_charset and local charset (determined via  nl_langinfo(3))  is  done  via  iconv(3)  or
                     ucnv_*().  If none of these functions are available on your system this option is disabled and you have to use mm_charset instead. mm_network_charset is limited to one of the follow‐
                     ing charsets:
                        US-ASCII, ISO-8859-{1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,13,14,15,16}, KOI8-{R,U,RU} EUC-{CN,JP,KR,TW}, ISO-2022-{CN,CN-EXT,JP,JP-1,JP-2}, Big5, UTF-8
                     Not all values might work on your system, see iconv_open(3) for more details. If it's not set, the value of the environment variable $MM_CHARSET is used. US-ASCII or compile-time de‐
                     fault is used in case neither of them is defined.

              mono_markdash
                     Character attribute of words emphasized like _this_. It depends on your terminal which attributes are usable. See also word_h_display_marks and word_highlight.

              mono_markslash
                     Character attribute of words emphasized like /this/. It depends on your terminal which attributes are usable. See also word_h_display_marks and word_highlight.

              mono_markstar
                     Character attribute of words emphasized like *this*. It depends on your terminal which attributes are usable. See also word_h_display_marks and word_highlight.

              mono_markstroke
                     Character attribute of words emphasized like -this-. It depends on your terminal which attributes are usable. See also word_h_display_marks and word_highlight.

              newnews
                     These are internal timers used by tin(1) to keep track of new newsgroups. Do not change them unless you understand what they are for.

              news_headers_to_display
                     Which  news  headers  you wish to see. If you want to see _all_ the headers, place an '*' as this value. This is the only way a wildcard can be used.  If you enter 'X-' as the value,
                     you will see all headers beginning with 'X-' (like X-Alan or X-Pape). You can list more than one by delimiting with spaces. Not defining anything turns off this option.

              news_headers_to_not_display
                     Same as news_headers_to_display except it denotes the opposite. An example of using both options might be if you thought 'X-' headers were A Good Thing(tm), but thought Alan and Pape
                     were miscreants... well then you would do something like this: news_headers_to_display=X- news_headers_to_not_display=X-Alan X-Pape Not defining anything turns off this option.

              news_quote_format
                     Format of quote line when posting/following up an article (%A=Address, %D=Date, %F=Fullname+Address, %G=Groupname, %M=Message-ID, %N=Fullname, %C=Firstname, %I=Initials). If the  ar‐
                     ticle has multiple addresses only the first is evaluated. Default is "%F wrote:".

              nntp_read_timeout_secs
                     Time in seconds to wait for a response from the server. Default is 120.

              normalization_form
                     The normalization form which should be used to normalize Unicode input.  The possible values are:

                        0  None: no normalization

                        1  NFKC: Compatibility Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition

                        2  NFKD: Compatibility Decomposition

                        3  NFC: Canonical Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition

                        4  NFD: Canonical Decomposition

                        5  NFKC_CF: Compatibility Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition and Case Folding
              Some normalization modes are only available if they are supported by the library tin(1) uses to do the normalization. NFC should be used if possible (RFC5198).

              page_mime_format
                     Format string tin(1) uses for mime header at Page level.  Default is "[-- %T%S%*n%z%*l%!c%!d%*e --]".

              page_uue_format
                     Format string tin(1) uses for uue header at Page level.  Default is "[-- %T%S%*n%I%!d%*e --]".

              page_yenc_format
                     Format string tin(1) uses for yenc header at Page level.  Default is "[-- %*N%!d%I [%F%G]%V%W%X --]".

              pos_first_unread
                     If ON put cursor at first unread article in group otherwise at last article. Default is ON.

              post_8bit_header
                     Allows  8-bit  characters unencoded in the header of a news article, if set this also disables the generation of MIME-headers when they are usually required. Default is OFF. Only en‐
                     acted if post_mime_encoding is also set to 8bit. In a number of local hierarchies where 8-bit characters are used, using unencoded (raw) 8-bit characters in header is acceptable  and
                     sometimes even recommended so that you need to check the convention adopted in the local hierarchy of your interest to determine what to do with this and post_mime_encoding.

              post_mime_encoding
                     MIME encoding of the body in news message, if necessary. (8bit, base64, quoted-printable, 7bit). Default is 8bit, which leads to no encoding.  base64 and quoted-printable are usually
                     undesired on usenet.

              post_process_view
                     If  ON, then tin(1) will start an appropriate viewer program to display any files that were post processed and uudecoded. The program is determined using the mailcap(5) file. Default
                     is ON.

              post_process_type
                     This specifies whether to perform post processing on saved articles.  Because the shell archive may contain commands you may not want to be executed, be careful when extracting shell
                     archives.  The following values are allowed:

                        0  No (default), no post processing is done.

                        1  Shell archives, unpacking of multi-part shar(1) files only.

                        2  Yes, binary attachments and data will be decoded and saved.

              posted_articles_file
                     Keep posted articles in given file. If the given filename does not contain any expandable strings it will be prefixed with ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/Mail/. If no filename is  set  then
                     postings will not be saved. See the section "MAILING PIPING PRINTING REPOSTING AND SAVING ARTICLES" for more information about the various expansion characters. Default is 'posted'.

              print_header
                     If ON, then the full article header is sent to the printer. Otherwise only the ''Subject:'' and ''From:'' fields are output. Default is OFF.

              printer
                     The printer program with options that is to be used to print articles. The default is lpr(1) for BSD machines and lp(1) for SysV machines. Printing from tin(1) may have been disabled
                     by the System Administrator.

              process_only_unread
                     If ON only save/print/pipe/mail unread articles (tagged articles excepted).  Default is OFF.

              prompt_followupto
                     If ON show empty ''Followup-To:'' header when editing an article.  Default is OFF.

              quote_chars
                     The  character  used in quoting included text to article followups and mail replies. The '_' character represents a blank character and is replaced with ' ' when read, %I is replaced
                     by author's initials. If the article has multiple addresses only the first is evaluated. Default is '>_'.

              quote_style
                     This bit coded integer value controls how articles are to be quoted when following up or replying to them. Any of the following options can be combined by adding all relevant values.
                     Default is 5, which means that quote characters are compressed and empty lines are quoted.

                        0  Nothing special Non empty lines are quoted.

                        1  Compress quotes Compress quote characters together when quoting multiple times (for example, '> > >' will be turned into '>>>'). This option is on by default.

                        2  Quote Signatures This option is off by default. Signatures are always quoted regardless of this option when you are viewing an article in raw mode PageToggleRaw ('^H') and fol‐
                           lowup or reply to it. Signatures are never quoted regardless of this option when show_signatures is off.

                        4  Quote empty lines This option is on by default.

              quote_regex
                     A regular expression that will be applied when reading articles. All matching lines are shown in col_quote. If quote_regex is blank, then tin(1) uses a built-in default.

              quote_regex2
                     A regular expression that will be applied when reading articles. All matching lines are shown in col_quote2. If quote_regex2 is blank, then tin(1) uses a built-in default.

              quote_regex3
                     A regular expression that will be applied when reading articles. All matching lines are shown in col_quote3. If quote_regex3 is blank, then tin(1) uses a built-in default.

              recent_time
                     If set to 0, this feature is deactivated, otherwise it means the number of days. Default is 2.

              render_bidi
                     If ON tin(1) does the rendering of bi-directional text. If OFF tin(1) leaves the rendering of bi-directional text to the terminal. Default is OFF.

              reread_active_file_secs
                     The news ${TIN_LIBDIR:-NEWSLIBDIR}"/"${TIN_ACTIVEFILE:-active} file is reread at regular intervals to show if any new news has arrived. Default is 1200. Setting this to 0  will  dis‐
                     able this feature.

              savedir
                     Directory where articles/threads are saved. Default is ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/News.

              score_limit_kill
                     If the score of an article is below or equal this value the article gets marked as killed.

              score_limit_select
                     If the score of an article is above or equal this value the article gets marked as hot.

              score_kill
                     Score of an article which should be killed, this must be <= score_limit_kill.

              score_select
                     Score of an article which should be marked hot, this must be >= score_limit_select.

              scroll_lines
                     The  number  of  lines  that will be scrolled up/down in the article pager when using cursor-up/down. The default is 1 (line-by-line). Set to 0 to get traditional tin(1) page-by-page
                     scrolling. Set to -1 to get page-by-page scrolling where the top/bottom line is carried over onto the next page.  This setting supersedes show_last_line_prev_page=ON. Set  to  -2  to

                     signature  (first  match counts). If the path starts with a ! the program the path points to will be executed to generate a signature. In order to pass the group name to the program,
                     %G can be specified.  This will be replaced by the name of the current newsgroup. --none will suppress any signature. Default is ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.Sig.  See  also  ${TIN_HOME‐

                     Allows you to select how tin(1) matches strings. The default is 0 and uses the wildmat(3) notation, which is how this has traditionally been handled.  Setting this to 1 allows you to
                     use perl(1) compatible regular expressions pcre(3) or pcre2(3).  (see also perlre(1) and pcrepattern(3) or pcre2pattern(3)).  You will probably want to update your filter file if you
                     use this regularly.  NB: Newsgroup names will always be matched using the wildmat(3) notation.

              word_h_display_marks

              word_highlight
                     Enable word highlighting. See word_h_display_marks for the options available. If use_color is enabled the colors specified in col_markdash, col_markslash, col_markstar and  col_mark‐
                     stroke are used for word highlighting else the character attributes specified in mono_markdash, mono_markslash, mono_markstar and mono_markstroke are used. Default is ON.

              wrap_column
                     Sets  the  column at which a displayed article body should be wrapped.  If this value is equal to 0, it defaults to the current screen width.  If this value is greater than your cur‐
                     rent screen width and dont_break_words is unset the part off-screen is not displayed.  Thus setting this option to a large value can be used to disable wrapping.  If  this  value  is
                     negative  the wrap margin is the current screen width plus the given value (as long as the result is still positive, otherwise it will fall back to the current screen width). Default
                     is 0, wrapping at the current screen width.

              wrap_on_next_unread

       /etc/tin/tin.defaults

              Yet  another  global  configuration  file  with "variable=value" pairs. This one is for the more general options which usually can't be controlled via ${TIN_LIBDIR:-NEWSLIBDIR}/tinrc and/or
              ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc like resetting (to override the built-in default) the newslibdir.

              inewsdir
                     Defines the directory containing the inews(1) executable.

              mm_charset
                     Default charset to be used in MIME's ''Content-Type:'' header.  $MM_CHARSET overrides any specified value.

              post_mime_encoding
                     Default encoding scheme used in MIME articles. 8bit might be the best value.

              mail_mime_encoding
                     Default encoding scheme used in MIME letters. quoted-printable is a good choice here.

              disable_gnksa_domain_check
                     Allow unregistered top level domains. As the list of valid TLDs is no longer actively maintained the default was changed to ON starting with tin(1) version 2.1.5

       ${TIN_LIBDIR:-NEWSLIBDIR}"/"${TIN_ACTIVEFILE:-active}

              This file lists the newsgroups that the local site receives. Each newsgroup should be listed only once. Each line specifies one group; within each newsgroup, articles  are  assigned  unique
              names, which are monotonically increasing numbers.

              If an article is posted to newsgroups not mentioned in this file, those newsgroups are ignored.  If no valid newsgroups are specified, the article is rejected.

              Each line consists of four space-separated fields "name highmark lowmark flags".

              name   is the name of the newsgroup

              highmark
                     is the highest article number that has been used in that newsgroup

              lowmark
                     is  the lowest article number in the group; this number is not guaranteed to be accurate, and should only be taken to be a hint. Note that because of article cancellations, there may
                     be gaps in the numbering sequence. If the lowest article number is greater than the highest article number, then there are no articles in the newsgroup.

              flags  can be one of those

                     y      local postings are allowed

                     n      no local postings are allowed, only remote ones

                     m      the group is moderated and all postings must be approved

                     j      articles in this group are not kept, but only passed on

                     x      articles cannot be posted to this newsgroup

                     =foo.bar
                            articles are locally filed into the ''foo.bar'' group

              tin(1) only tries to read the file if you read directly from the local spool, if you read news via NNTP, tin(1) uses the LIST (RFC3977) or LIST COUNTS (RFC6048) command instead.

       ${TIN_LIBDIR:-NEWSLIBDIR}/active.times

              This file provides a chronological record of when newsgroups are created. It is normally updated by the local news server (e.g., innd(8)) whenever a new group is created. Each line  consist
              of three space-separated fields "name time creator".

              name   is the name of the newsgroup

              time   is the time when the group was created, expressed as the number of seconds since the Epoch.

              creator
                     is the electronic mail address of the person who created the group.

              tin(1) only tries to read the file if you read directly from the local spool, if you read news via NNTP, tin(1) uses the NEWGROUPS (RFC3977) command instead.

       ${TIN_LIBDIR:-NEWSLIBDIR}/newsgroups

              This  file provides short descriptions of each newsgroup. It is normally updated by the local news server (e.g., innd(8)) whenever a new group is created. Each line consist of two tab-sepa‐
              rated fields "group.name             one-line description".

              group.name
                     is the name of the newsgroup

              one-line description
                     is a short single-line description of the group

              tin(1) only tries to read the file if you read directly from the local spool, if you read news via NNTP, tin(1) uses the LIST NEWSGROUPS (RFC3977) command instead.

       ${TIN_LIBDIR:-NEWSLIBDIR}/organization

              This file might hold a default organization to be used in the ''Organization:'' header. $ORGANIZATION has a higher priority if set.

       ${TIN_LIBDIR:-NEWSLIBDIR}/overview.fmt

              This file specifies the organization of the news overview database (see also newsoverview(5)).  The order of lines in this file is important; it determines the order  in  which  the  fields
              will  appear  in  the  database.  See  also  overview.fmt(5).   tin(1) only tries to read the file if you read directly from the local spool, if you read news via NNTP, tin(1) uses the LIST
              OVERVIEW.FMT (RFC3977) command instead.

       ${TIN_LIBDIR:-NEWSLIBDIR}/subscriptions

              This file contains a list of newsgroups — one per line — which the client should subscribe to when the user has no ${TIN_HOMEDIR:-"$HOME"}/.newsrc for the news server.  tin(1) only tries to
              read the file if you read directly from the local spool, if you read news via NNTP, tin(1) uses the LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS (RFC6048) command instead.
