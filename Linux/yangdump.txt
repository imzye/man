NAME
       yangdump - validate YANG modules and convert them to different formats

SYNOPSIS
          yangdump (module=value | subtree=value)+ [parameter=value...]

          yangdump  --help [brief | normal | full]

          yangdump  --version

          yangdump  --show-errors

DESCRIPTION
       yangdump  provides validation and translation of YANG data models.  Information about a module or submodule can be generated as well.  This version of yangdump supports the YANG data modeling lan‐
       guage defined in RFC 6020.

       The format parameter is used to select a translation output mode.  If it is missing, then no translation will be done.

       This parameter can be used with the module reports parameters, but the translation output should be directed to a file instead of STDOUT to keep them separated.

       For XSD 1.0 translation, use the format=xsd parameter.

       For XHTML 1.0 translation, use the format=html parameter.

       For a 1 line output of the module name and version, use the modversion parameter.

       For a listing of all the symbols that the file exports to other files, use the exports parameter.

       For a listing of all the files that the file depends on, to compile, use the dependencies parameter.

       For a listing of all the accessible object identifiers that the file contains, use the identifiers parameter.

       For a listing of all the accessible object identifiers that the file contains, in tree format, use the tree-identifiers parameter.

USAGE
       Parameters can be entered in any order, and have the form:

          [start] name [separator [value]]

       where:

           start == 0, 1, or 2 dashes (foo, -foo, --foo)

           name == parameter name

                Parameter name completion will be attempted
                if a partial name is entered.

           separator == whitespace or equals sign (foo=bar, foo bar)

           value == string value for the parameter.

                Strings with whitespace need to be double quoted
                (--foo="some string")

       Some examples of valid command line parameters:

          foo=3
          -foo=3
          --foo=3
          foo 3
          foo=fred
          --foo "fred flintstone"

       Partial parameter names can be entered if they are unique.

OPTIONS
       --config=filespec
              The name of the configuration file to use.  Any parameter except this one can be set in the config file.  The default config file /etc/yuma/yangdump.conf will be not be checked if this  pa‐
              rameter is present.

       --defnames=boolean
              If true, output to a file with the default name for the format, in the current directory. The default value is 'false'.

              If the output parameter is present and represents an existing directory, then the default filename will be created in that directory, instead of the current directory.

       --dependencies
              Validate the file, write the module name, version and module source for each file that this [sub]module imports and includes, then exit.

              Each dependency type, name, version, and source is listed once.

              If the dependency version and source are missing, then that import or include file was not found.

       --deviation=string
               This  parameter  identifies  a  YANG  module  that  should  only  be checked for deviation statements for external modules.  These will be collected and applied to the real module(s) being
              processed.

              Deviations are applied as patches to the target module.  Since they are not identified in the target module at all (ala imports), they have to be specified explicitly, so they will be  cor‐
              rectly processed.  Zero or more instances of this parameter are allowed.

       --exports
              Validate  the  file, write information for the symbols that this [sub]module exports, then exit.  Report includes the following info for the specific file, not the entire module, if submod‐
              ules are used:

                 - [sub]module name
                 - version
                 - source filespec
                 - namespace (module only)
                 - prefix (module only)
                 - belongs-to (submodule only)
                 - typedefs
                 - groupings
                 - objects, rpcs, notifications
                 - extensions.

       --feature-code-default=enum
              If 'dynamic' (the default), then dynamic SIL feature code will be generated by default.  If 'static', then static SIL feature code will be generated by default.   If  false,  then  features
              will be disabled by default.

       --feature-disable=module:feature
              Identifies a feature which should be considered disabled.

       --feature-dynamic=module:feature
              Identifies a dynamic feature for SIL code generation purposes.  Zero or more entries are allowed.

       --feature-enable-default=boolean
              If true (the default), then features will be enabled by default.  If false, then features will be disabled by default.

       --feature-enable=module:feature
              Identifies a feature which should be considered enabled.  Zero or more entries are allowed.

       --feature-static=module:feature
              Identifies a static feature for SIL code generation purposes.  Zero or more entries are allowed.

       --format=string
              Type of conversion desired, if any. If this parameter is missing, then no translation will be done, but the module will be validated, and any requested reports will be generated.

              The following translation formats are available:

                  xsd:  XSD 1.0
                 html:  XHTML 1.0
                 yang:  Canonical YANG (in progress)
                 copy:  Validate, and copy with a new name
                  yin:  YIN format
                    c:  Combined Yuma and User SIL C module
                    h:  Combined Yuma and User SIL H file
                   uc:  User part of a split SIL C module
                   uh:  User part of a split SIL H file
                   yc:  Yuma part of a split SIL C module
                   yh:  Yuma part of a split SIL H file

       --help Print this help text and exit.  The help-mode choice (--brief, --normal, or --full) may also be present to control the amount of help text printed.

       --home=dirspec
              Directory specification for the home directory to use instead of HOME.

       --html-div
              If  HTML translation is requested, then this parameter will cause the output to be a single <div> element, instead of an entire HTML file.  This allows the HTML translation to be easily in‐
              tegrated within more complex WEB pages, but the proper CSS definitions need to be present for the HTML to render properly.

              The default filename extension will be '.div' instead of '.html' if this parameter is present.  The contents will be well-formed XHTML 1.0, but without any namespace declarations.

       --html-toc=string
              The HTML Table of Contents output mode.  Ignored unless the format parameter is set to html.  Default is menu.

              Values:

                 - none: no ToC generated
                 - plain: plain list ToC generated
                 - menu: drop-down menu ToC generated.

       --identifiers
              Validate the file, write the list of object identifiers, that this [sub]module contains, then exit.

              Each accessible object node is listed once, including all child nodes.  Notifications and RPC methods are considered top-level objects, and have object identifiers as well as  configuration
              and state data..

       --indent=number
              Number of spaces to indent (0..9) in formatted output.  The default is 2 spaces.

       --log=filespec
              Filespec for the log file to use instead of STDOUT.  If this string begins with a '~' character, then a username is expected to follow or a directory separator character.  If it begins with
              a '$' character, then an environment variable name is expected to follow.

       --log-append
              If present, the log will be appended not over-written.  If not, the log will be over-written.  Only meaningful if the log parameter is also present.

       --log-level=enum
              Sets the debug logging level for the program.

       --modpath=list
              Directory search path for YANG and YIN files.  Overrides the YUMA_MODPATH environment variable.

       --module=string
              YANG or YIN source module name to validate and convert.

              If this string represents a filespec, ending with the .yang or .yin extension, then only that file location will be checked.

              If this string represents a module name, then the module search path will be checked for a file the .yang or .yin extension.

              If  this  string begins with a '~' character, then a username is expected to follow or a directory separator character.  If it begins with a '$' character, then an environment variable name
              is expected to follow.

                    ~/some/path ==> <my-home-dir>/some/path

                    ~fred/some/path ==> <fred-home-dir>/some/path

                    $workdir/some/path ==> <workdir-env-var>/some/path

       --modversion
              Validate the file, write the [sub]module name, version and source filespec, then exit.

       --objview=string
              Determines how objects are generated in HTML and YANG outputs.  The default mode is the raw view.  XSD output is always cooked, since refined groupings and  locally-scoped  definitions  are
              not supported in XSD.  Values:

                 raw -- output includes augment and uses clauses, not the
                        expanded results of those clauses.

                 cooked -- output does not include augment or uses clauses,
                          just the objects generated from those clauses.

       --output=filespec
              Output file name to use.  Default is STDOUT if none specified and the defname parameter is also missing.

              If this parameter represents an existing directory, then the defnames parameter will be assumed by default, and the translation output file(s) will be generated in the specified directory.

              If this parameter represents a file name, then the defnames parameter will be ignored, and all translation output will be directed to the specified file.

              If  this  string begins with a '~' character, then a username is expected to follow or a directory separator character.  If it begins with a '$' character, then an environment variable name
              is expected to follow.

                    ~/some/path ==> <my-home-dir>/some/path

                    ~fred/some/path ==> <fred-home-dir>/some/path

                    $workdir/some/path ==> <workdir-env-var>/some/path

       --show-errors
              If present, list each error or warning number and its default message string.  The program will exit after this is done.

       --simurls=boolean
              If true, and if HTML translation is requested, then this parameter will cause the format of URLs within links to be generated in simplified form, for WEB development engines such  as  Cher‐
              ryPy, which support this format.  The default is false.

                 Normal URL format:
                   example.html?parm1=foo&parm2=bar#frag

                 Simplified URL format:
                   example/foo/bar#frag

       --stats=enumeration
              Controls YANG usage statistics report generation.
                 enum values:
                    none: (default)
                       No statistics reporting will be done.
                    brief:
                      Brief statistics reporting will be done:
                        - Complexity score
                        - Total nodes
                    basic:
                       Basic statistics reporting will be done.
                    advanced:
                       Advanced statistics reporting will be done.
                    all:
                       All possible statistics reporting will be done.

       --subdirs=boolean
              If false, the file search paths for modules, scripts, and data files will not include sub-directories if they exist in the specified path.

              If  true,  then these file search paths will include sub-directories, if present.  Any directory name beginning with a dot (.) character, or named CVS, will be ignored.  This is the default
              mode.

       --subtree=string
              Path specification of the directory subtree to convert.  All of the YANG and YIN source modules contained in the specified directory sub-tree will be processed.

              If the format parameter is present, then one file with the default name will be generated for each YANG or YIN file found in the sub-tree.

              Note that symbolic links are not followed during the directory traversal.  Only real directories will be searched and regular files will be checked as modules.  Processing will continue  to
              the next file if a module contains errors.

              If  this  string begins with a '~' character, then a username is expected to follow or a directory separator character.  If it begins with a '$' character, then an environment variable name
              is expected to follow.

              This parameter may be present zero or more times.

                    ~/some/path ==> <my-home-dir>/some/path

                    ~fred/some/path ==> <fred-home-dir>/some/path

                    $workdir/some/path ==> <workdir-env-var>/some/path

       --totals=enumeration
              Controls summary YANG usage statistics report generation.  Must be used with the '--stats' parameter.
                 enum values:
                    none: (default)
                       No summary statistics reporting will be done.
                    summary:
                       Summary statistics totals will be
                       reported, based on the stats mode
                       that is requested.
                    summary-only
                       Only the summary statistics totals
                       will be reported, based on the stats
                       mode that is requested.  This mode
                       will cause all individual module
                       statistics reports to be generated,
                       and a summary for all input modules
                       will be generated instead.

       --tree-identifiers
              Validate the file, write the hierarchy of node names in tree format, that this [sub]module contains, then exit.

              Each accessible object node is listed once, including all child nodes.  Notifications and RPC methods are considered top-level objects, and have object identifiers as well as  configuration
              and state data..

       --unified=boolean
              If true, then submodules will be processed within the main module, in a unified report, instead of separately, one report for each file.

              For  translation  purposes, this parameter will cause any sub-modules to be treated as if they were defined in the main module.  Actual definitions will be generated instead of an 'include'
              directive, for each submodule.

              If false (the default), then a separate output file is generated for each input file, so that XSD output and other reports for a main module will not include information for submodules.

              If this parameter is set to true, then submodules entered with the module parameter will be ignored.

       --urlstart=string
              If present, then this string will be used to prepend to HREF links and URLs generated for SQL and HTML translation.  It is expected to be a URL ending with a directory path.   The  trailing
              separator '/' will be added if it is missing.

              If not present (the default), then relative URLs, starting with the file name will be generated instead.

              For example, if this parameter is set to

                'http://acme.com/public'

              then the URL generated for the 'bar' type on line 53, in the module FOO (version 2008-01-01) would be:

                if no-versionnames set:

                  'http://acme.com/public/FOO.html#bar.53'

                 OR

                if no-versionnames not set (default):

                 'http://acme.com/public/FOO_2008-01-01.html#bar.53'

       --version
              Print yangdump version string and exit.

       --versionnames=boolean
              If  false,  the  default filenames will not contain the module version string.  If true, the [sub]module name and version string are both used to generate a default file name, when the def‐
              names output parameter is used.  This flag will cause filenames and links to be generated which do not contain the version string.  The default value is true.

       --warn-idlen=number
               Control whether identifier length warnings will be generated.  The value zero disables all identifier length checking.  If non-zero, then a warning will be generated if  an  identifier  is
              defined which has a length is greater than this amount.  range: 0 | 8 .. 1023.  The default value is 64.

       --warn-linelen=number
              Control  whether line length warnings will be generated.  The value zero disables all line length checking.  If non-zero, then a warning will be generated if the line length is greater than
              this amount.  Tab characters are counted as 8 spaces.  range: 0 | 40 .. 4095.  The default value is 72.

       --warn-off=number
              Control whether the specified warning number will be generated and counted in the warning total for the module being parsed.  range: 400 .. 899.  This parameter may be entered zero or  more
              times.

       --xsd-schemaloc=string
              If present, then this string will be used to prepend to output XSD filenames, when generating schemaLocation clauses.  It is expected to be a URL ending with a directory path.  The trailing
              separator '/' will be added if it is missing.  This parameter is also prepended to URLs generated fpr include and import directives within the XSD.

              If  not present (the default), then the schemaLocation element is not generated during XSD translation.  Relative URLs for include and import directives will be generated, starting with the
              file name.

              For example, if this parameter is set to

                'http://acme.com/public'

              then the schemaLocation XSD for the module FOO (version 01-01-2008) would be:

                 if no-versionnames set:

                    'http://acme.com/public/FOO.xsd'

                OR

                 if no-versionnames not set (default):

                    'http://acme.com/public/FOO_2008-01-01.xsd'

       --yuma-home=string
              Directory for the yuma project root to use.  If present, this directory location will override the YUMA_HOME environment variable, if it is present.  If a  zero-length  string  is  entered,
              then the YUMA_HOME environment variable will be ignored.

INPUT FILES
       Operations can be performed on one or more files with the module parameter, or an entire directory tree with the subtree parameter.  Unless the help, version, or show-errors parameters is entered,
       one of these input file parameters is mandatory.  Each of these parameters may be entered multiple times.  The default parameter for yangdump is 'module', so these commands are wquivalent:

          yangdump --module=foo

          yangdump foo

       Note that 'foo' must not match another parameter name.  If it does, the module parameter name must be used for that module.  For example,

          yangdump --module=help

SEARCH PATH
       When a module name is entered as input, or when a module or submodule name is specified in an import or include statement within the file, the following search algorithm is used to find the file:

         1) file is in the current directory
         2) YUMA_MODPATH environment var (or set by modpath parameter)
         3) $HOME/modules directory
         4) $YUMA_HOME/modules directory
         5) $YUMA_INSTALL/modules directory OR
            default install module location, '/usr/share/yuma/modules'

       By default, the entire directory tree for all locations (except step 1) will be searched, not just the specified directory.  The subdirs parameter can be used to prevent sub-directories from being
       searched.

       Any directory name beginning with a dot character (.)  will be skipped.  Also, any directory named CVS will be skipped in directory searches.

OUTPUT MODES
       By default, any translation output will be sent to STDOUT.

       The output parameter can be used to specify the full filespec of the output file to use instead.

       The defname parameter can be used to generate a default filename in the current directory for the output.

          E.g., the default XSD filename is <name>_<version>.xsd.

       This is the default mode when subtree input mode is selected.

ERROR LOGGING
       By default, warnings and errors are sent to STDOUT.

       A log file can be specified instead with the log' parameter.

       Existing log files can be reused with the 'logappend' parameter, otherwise log files are overwritten.

       The logging level can be controlled with the log-level parameter.

       The default log level is 'info'.  The log-levels are additive:

            off:    suppress all errors (not recommended!)
                    A program return code of '1' indicates some error.
            error:  print errors
            warn:   print warnings
            info:   print generally interesting trace info
            debug:  print general debugging trace info
            debug2: print verbose debugging trace info
            debug3: print very verbose debugging trace info
            debug4: print maximum debugging trace info

ENVIRONMENT
       The following optional environment variables can be used to control module search behavior:

       HOME   The user's home directory  (e.g., /home/andy)

       YUMA_HOME
              The root of the user's Yuma work directory (e.g., /home/andy/swdev/netconf)

       YUMA_INSTALL
              The root of the directory that yangdump is installed on this system (default is, /usr/share/yuma)

       YUMA_MODPATH
              Colon-separated list of directories to search for modules and submodules.

              (e.g.: './workdir/modules:/home/andy/test-modules')

              The modpath parameter will override this environment variable, if both are present.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       yangdump.conf
              YANG config file The default is: /etc/yuma/yangdump.conf

              An ASCII configuration file format is supported to store command line parameters.

              The config parameter is used to specify a specific config file, otherwise the default config file will be checked.

                 - A hash mark until EOLN is treated as a comment
                 - All text is case-sensitive
                 - Whitespace within a line is not significant
                 - Whitespace to end a line is significant/
                   Unless the line starts a multi-line string,
                   an escaped EOLN (backslash EOLN) is needed
                   to enter a leaf on multiple lines.
                 - For parameters that define lists, the key components
                   are listed just after the parameter name, without
                   any name,  e.g.,

                          interface eth0 {
                            # name = eth0 is not listed inside the braces
                            ifMtu 1500
                            ifName mySystem
                          }

              A config file can contain any number of parameter sets for different programs.

              Each program must have its own section, identifies by its name:

                   # this is a comment
                   yangdump {
                      log-level debug
                      output "~/swdev/testfiles"
                   }

                   netconfd {
                      ...
                   }

FILES
       The following data files must be present in the module search path in order for this program to function:

         * YANG module library
           default: /usr/share/yuma/modules/

DIAGNOSTICS
       Internal diagnostics may generate the following type of message if any bugs are detected at runtime:

           [E0]
                filename.c:linenum error-number (error-msg)
