NAME
       MythExport - MythTV recordings export daemon

DESCRIPTION
       MythExport  is  a Perl daemon that can be used with MythTV to export recordings into a format playable on portable devices such as iPod Video, iPod Touch, PSP, and other devices. Besides con‐
       verting your recordings, this script also grabs data from the MythTV MySQL database and injects it as iTunes data into the exported video so that it will  show  up  correctly  on  your  iPod.
       MythExport may also be used to take your recordings "On The Go" and provides a RSS feed to all exported recordings.  For more information please see the wiki link below.
