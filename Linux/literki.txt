NAME
       literki - on-screen keyboard

SYNOPSIS
       literki [configuration_file]

DESCRIPTION
       literki  is  an  on-screen  keyboard  with configurable layout and transparency. It is designed for touch screen devices and has a full qwerty keyboard and always-on functionality by usage of
       transparency. Applications do not need to redraw windows when literki is shown, and popping up the keyboard is very fast because literki is always in the backround.

       In addition to keyboard, literki comes with touchpad and scroll buttons.

              An alternative configuration file to use instead of the default.
