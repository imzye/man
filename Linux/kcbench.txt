NAME
       kcbench - Linux kernel compile benchmark, speed edition

SYNOPSIS
       kcbench [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Kcbench tries to compile a Linux kernel really quickly which can be used to test a system's performance or stability.

       Note: The number of compile jobs ('-j') that delivers the best result depends on the machine being benched.  See the section "ON THE DEFAULT NUMBER OF JOBS" below for details.

       To  get  comparable results from different machines you need to use the exact same operating system on all of them.  There are multiple reasons for this recommendation, but one of the main reasons is:
       the Linux version this benchmark downloads and compiles depends on the operating system's default compiler.

       If you choose to ignore this recommendation at least make sure to hard code the Linux version to compile ('-s 5.4'), as for example compiling 5.7 will take longer than 5.4 or 4.19 and thus lead to re‐
       sults  one  cannot  compare.  Also, make sure the compiler used on the systems you want to compare is from similar, as for example gcc10 will try harder to optimize the code than gcc8 or gcc9 and thus
       take more time for its work.

       Kcbench is accompanied by kcbenchrate.  Both are quite similar, but work slightly different:

       • kcbench tries to build one kernel as fast as possible.  This approach is called 'speed run' and let's make start multiple compilers jobs in parallel by using 'make -j #'.  That way kcbench will  use
         a  lot  of CPU cores most of the time, except during those few phases where the Linux kernel build process is singled threaded and thus utilizes just one CPU core.  That for example is the case when
         vmlinux is linked.

       • kcbenchrate tries to keep all CPU cores busy constantly by starting workers on all of them, which each builds one kernel with just one job ('make -j 1').  This approach is  called  'rate  run'.   It
         takes a lot longer to generate a result than kcbench; it also needs a lot more storage space, but will utilize the machine and its processors better.

   Options
       -b, --bypass
              Omit the initial kernel compile to fill caches; saves time, but first result might be slightly lower than the following ones.

       -d, --detailedresults
              Print more detailed results.

       -h, --help
              Show usage.

       -i, --iterations int
              Determines the number of kernels that kcbench will compile sequentially with different values of jobs ('-j').  Default: 2

       -j, --jobs int(,int, int, ...)
              Number of jobs to use when compiling a kernel('make -j #').

              This  option  can  be  given  multiple  times (-j 2 -j 4 -j 8) or 'int' can be a list (-j "2 4 8").  The default depends on the number of cores in the system and if its processor uses SMT.  Run
              '--help' to query the default on the particular machine.

              Important note: kcbench on machines with SMTs will do runs which do not utilize all available CPU cores; this might look odd, but there are reasons for this behaviour.  See "ON THE DEFAULT NUM‐
              BER OF JOBS" below for details.

       -m, --modconfig
              Instead  of using a config generated with 'defconfig' use one built by 'allmodconfig' and compile modules as well.  Takes a lot longer to compile, which is more suitable for machines with a lot
              of fast CPU cores.

       -o, --outputdir dir
              Use path to compile Linux.  Passes 'O=dir/kcbench-worker/' to make when calling it to compile a kernel; use a temporary directory if not given.

       -s, --src path|version
              Look for sources in path, ~/.cache/kcbench/linux-version or /usr/share/kcbench/linux-version.  If not found try to download version automatically unless '--no-download' was specified.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase verboselevel; option can be given multiple times.

       -V, --version
              Output program version.

       --cc exec
              Use exec as target compiler.

       --cross-compile arch
              EXPERIMENTAL: Cross compile the Linux kernel.  Cross compilers for this task are packaged in some Linux distribution.  There are also pre-compiled compilers available on the internet, for exam‐
              ple here: https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/

              Values of arch that kcbench/kcbenchrate understand: arm arm64 aarch64 riscv riscv64 powerpc powerpc64 x86_64

              Building for archs not directly supported by kcbench/kcbenchrate should work, too: just export ARCH= and CROSS_COMPILE= just like you would when normally cross compiling a Linux kernel.  Do not
              use '--cross-compile' in that case and keep in mind that kcbench/kcbenchrate configure the compiled Linux kernel with the make target 'defconfig' (or 'allmodconfig', if you specify '-m'), which
              might be unusual for the arch in question, but might be good enough for benchmarking purposes.

              Be aware there is a bigger risk running into compile errors (see below) when cross compiling.

       --crosscomp-scheme scheme
              On  Linux  distributions  that  are  known  to ship cross compilers kcbench/ kcbenchrate will assume you want to use those.  This parameter allows to specify one of the various different naming
              schemes in cases this automatic detection fails or work you want kcbench/kcbenchrate to find them using a 'generic' scheme that should work with compilers from various sources, which is the de‐
              fault on unknown distributions.

              Valid values of scheme: debian fedora generic redhat ubuntu

       --hostcc exec
              Use exec as host compiler.

       --infinite
              Run endlessly to create system load.

       --llvm Set LLVM=1 to use clang as compiler and LLVM utilities as GNU binutils substitute.

       --add-make-args string
              Pass additional flags found in string to make when creating the config or building the kernel.  This option is meant for experts that want to try unusual things, like specifying a special link‐
              er (--add-make-args 'LD=ld.lld').

              Use with caution!

       --no-download
              Never download Linux kernel sources from the web automatically.

       --savefailedlogs path
              Save log of failed compile runs to path.

ON THE DEFAULT NUMBER OF JOBS
       The optimal number of compile jobs (-j) to get the best result depends on the machine being benched.  On most systems you will achieve the best result if the number of jobs matches the number  of  CPU
       cores.  That for example is the case on this 4 core Intel processor without SMT:

              [cttest@localhost ~]$ bash kcbench -s 5.3 -n 1
              Processor:            Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570 CPU @ 3.20GHz [4 CPUs]
              Cpufreq; Memory:      Unknown; 15934 MByte RAM
              Compiler used:        gcc (GCC) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)
              Linux compiled:       5.3.0 [/home/cttest/.cache/kcbench/linux-5.3/]
              Config; Environment:  defconfig; CCACHE_DISABLE="1"
              Build command:        make vmlinux
              Run 1 (-j 4):         250.03 seconds / 14.40 kernels/hour
              Run 2 (-j 6):         255.88 seconds / 14.07 kernels/hour

       The  run  with 6 jobs was slower here.  Trying a setting like that by default looks like a waste of time on this machine, but other machines deliver the best result when they are oversubscribed a lit‐
       tle.  That's for example the case on this 6 core/12 threads processor, which achieved its best result with 15 jobs:

              [cttest@localhost ~]$ bash kcbench -s 5.3 -n 1
              Processor:            Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700K CPU @ 3.70GHz [12 CPUs]
              Cpufreq; Memory:      Unknown; 15934 MByte RAM
              Linux running:        5.6.0-0.rc2.git0.1.vanilla.knurd.2.fc31.x86_64
              Compiler used:        gcc (GCC) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)
              Linux compiled:       5.3.0 [/home/cttest/.cache/kcbench/linux-5.3/]
              Config; Environment:  defconfig; CCACHE_DISABLE="1"
              Build command:        make vmlinux
              Run 1 (-j 12):        92.55 seconds / 38.90 kernels/hour
              Run 2 (-j 15):        91.91 seconds / 39.17 kernels/hour
              Run 3 (-j 6):         113.66 seconds / 31.67 kernels/hour
              Run 4 (-j 9):         101.32 seconds / 35.53 kernels/hour

       You'll notice attempts that tried to utilize only the real cores (-j 6) and oversubscribe them a little (-j 9), which look liked a waste of time.  But on some  machines  with  SMT  capable  processors
       those will deliver the best results, like on this AMD Threadripper processor with 64 core/128 threads:

              $ kcbench
              [cttest@localhost ~]$ bash kcbench -s 5.3 -n 1
              Processor:            AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64-Core Processor [128 CPUs]
              Cpufreq; Memory:      Unknown; 15934 MByte RAM
              Linux running:        5.6.0-0.rc2.git0.1.vanilla.knurd.2.fc31.x86_64
              Compiler used:        gcc (GCC) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)
              Linux compiled:       5.3.0 [/home/cttest/.cache/kcbench/linux-5.3/]
              Config; Environment:  defconfig; CCACHE_DISABLE="1"
              Build command:        make vmlinux
              Run 1 (-j 128):       26.16 seconds / 137.61 kernels/hour
              Run 2 (-j 136):       26.19 seconds / 137.46 kernels/hour
              Run 3 (-j 64):        21.45 seconds / 167.83 kernels/hour
              Run 4 (-j 72):        22.68 seconds / 158.73 kernels/hour

       This is even more visible when compiling an allmodconfig configuration:

              [cttest@localhost ~]$ bash kcbench -s 5.3 -n 1 -m
              Processor:            AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64-Core Processor [128 CPUs]
              Cpufreq; Memory:      Unknown; 63736 MByte RAM
              Linux running:        5.6.0-0.rc2.git0.1.vanilla.knurd.2.fc31.x86_64
              Compiler used:        gcc (GCC) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)
              Linux compiled:       5.3.0 [/home/cttest/.cache/kcbench/linux-5.3/]
              Config; Environment:  defconfig; CCACHE_DISABLE="1"
              Build command:        make vmlinux
              Run 1 (-j 128):       260.43 seconds / 13.82 kernels/hour
              Run 2 (-j 136):       262.67 seconds / 13.71 kernels/hour
              Run 3 (-j 64):        215.54 seconds / 16.70 kernels/hour
              Run 4 (-j 72):        215.97 seconds / 16.67 kernels/hour

       This can happen if the SMT implementation is bad or something else (memory, storage, ...) becomes a bottleneck.  A few tests on above machine indicated the memory interface was the limiting factor.  A
       AMD Epyc from the same processor generation did not show this effect and delivered its best results when the number of jobs matched the number of CPUs:

              [cttest@localhost ~]$ bash kcbench -s 5.3 -n 1 -m
              Processor:            AMD EPYC 7742 64-Core Processor [256 CPUs]
              Cpufreq; Memory:      Unknown; 63736 MByte RAM
              Linux running:        5.6.0-0.rc2.git0.1.vanilla.knurd.2.fc31.x86_64
              Compiler used:        gcc (GCC) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)
              Linux compiled:       5.3.0 [/home/cttest/.cache/kcbench/linux-5.3/]
              Config; Environment:  defconfig; CCACHE_DISABLE="1"
              Build command:        make vmlinux
              Run 1 (-j 256):       128.24 seconds / 28.07 kernels/hour
              Run 2 (-j 268):       128.87 seconds / 27.94 kernels/hour
              Run 3 (-j 128):       141.83 seconds / 25.38 kernels/hour
              Run 4 (-j 140):       137.46 seconds / 26.19 kernels/hour

       This table will tell you now many jobs kcbench will use by default:

               #                             Cores: Default # of jobs

ON FAILED RUNS DUE TO COMPILATION ERRORS
       The compilation is unlikely to fail, as long as you are using a settled GCC version to natively compile the source of a current Linux kernel for  popular  architectures  like  ARM,  ARM64/Aarch64,  or
       x86_64.   For  other cases there is a bigger risk that compilation will fail due to factors outside of what kcbench/kcbenchrate control.  They nevertheless try to catch a few common problems and warn,
       but they can not catch them all, as there are to many factors involved:

       • Brand new compiler generations are sometimes stricter than their predecessors and thus might fail to compile even the latest Linux kernel version.  You might need to use a pre-release version of the
         next Linux kernel release to make it work or simply need to wait until the compiler or kernel developers solve the problem.

       • Distributions enable different compiler features that might have an impact on the kernel compilation.  For example gcc9 was capable of compiling Linux 4.19 on many distributions, but started to fail
         on Ubuntu 19.10 due to a feature that got enabled in its GCC.  Try compiling a newer Linux kernel version in this case.

       • Cross compilation increases the risk of running into compile problems in general, as there are many compilers and architectures our there.  That for example is why compiling the Linux kernel for  an
         unpopular  architecture  is  more  likely  to fail due to bugs in the compiler or the Linux kernel sources that nobody had noticed before when the compiler or kernel was released.  This is even more
         likely to happen if you start kcbench/kcbenchrate with '-m/--allmodconfig' to build a more complex kernel.

HINTS
       Running benchmarks is very tricky.  Here are a few of the aspects you should keep mind when doing so:

       • Do not compare results from two different archs (like ARM64 and x86_64); kcbench/kcbenchrate compile different code in that case, as they will compile a native kernel on each of those  archs.   This
         can be avoided by cross compiling for a third arch that is not related to any of the archs compared (say RISC-V when comparing ARM64 and x86_64).

       • Unless  you  want  to bench compilers do not compare results from different compiler generations, as they will apply different optimizations techniques.  For example to not compare results from GCC7
         and GCC9, as the later optimizes harder and thus will take more time generating the code.  That's also why the Linux version compiled by default depends on  the  machine's  compiler:  you  sometimes
         can't  compile  older  kernels with the latest compilers anyway, as new compiler generations often uncover bugs in the Linux kernel source that need get fixed for compiling to succeed.  For example,
         when GCC10 was close to release it was incapable of compile the then latest Linux version 5.5 in an allmodconfig configuration due to a bug in the Linux kernel sources.

       • Compiling a Linux kernel scales very well and thus can utilize processors quite well.  But be aware that some parts of the Linux compile process will only use one thread (and thus one CPU core), for
         example when linking vmlinuz; the other cores will idle meanwhile.  The effect on the result will grow with the number of CPU cores.

       If  you  want to work against that consider using '-m' to build an allmodconfig configuration with modules; comping a newer, more complex Linux kernel version can also help.  But the best way to avoid
       this effect is by running kcbenchrate.

       • kcbench/kcbenchrate by default set CCACHE_DISABLE=1 when calling 'make' to avoid interference from ccache.

EXAMPLES
       To let kcbench decide everything automatically simply run:
              $ kcbench

       On a four core processor without SMT kcbench by default will compile 2 kernels with 4 jobs and 2 with 6 jobs.  You can specify a setting like this manually: .

       : $ kcbench -s 5.4 --iterations 3 --jobs 2 --jobs 4

       This will compile Linux 5.4 first 3 times with 2 jobs and then as often with 4 jobs.

RESULTS
       By default, the lines you are looking for look like this:

              Run 1 (-j 4): 230.30 sec / 15.63 kernels/hour [P:389%, 24 maj. pagefaults]

       Here it took 230.30 seconds to compile the Linux kernel image.  With a speed like this the machine can compile 15.63 kernels per hour (60*60/230.30).  The results from this 4 core  machine  also  show
       the  CPU  usage (P) was 389 percent; 24 major page faults occurred during this run – this number should be small, as processing them takes some time and thus slows down the build.  This information is
       omitted, if less than 20 major page faults happen.  For details how the CPU usage is calculated and major page faults are detected see the man page for GNU 'time', which  kcbench/kcbenchrate  rely  on
       for their measurements.

       When running with "-d|--detailedresults" you'll get more detailed result:

              Run 1 (-j 4): 230.30 sec / 15.63 kernels/hour [P:389%]
              Elapsed Time(E): 2:30.10 (150.10 seconds)
              Kernel time (S): 36.38 seconds
              User time (U): 259.51 seconds
              CPU usage (P): 197%
              Major page faults (F): 0
              Minor page faults (R): 9441809
              Context switches involuntarily (c): 69031
              Context switches voluntarily (w): 46955

MISSING FEATURES
       • some math to detect the fastest setting and do one more run with it before sanity checking the result and printing the best one, including standard deviation.
