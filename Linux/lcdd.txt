NAME
       LCDd - LCDproc server daemon

SYNOPSIS
       LCDd [-hf] [-c config] [-d driver] [-i bool] [-a addr] [-p port] [-u user] [-w time] [-r level] [-s bool]

DESCRIPTION
       LCDd is the server part of LCDproc, a daemon which listens to a certain port (normally 13666) and displays information on an LCD display.  It works with several types and sizes of displays.

       Most  settings  of  LCDd are configured through its configuration file /etc/lcdproc/LCDd.conf, some of them can be overridden using command line options.  Before running LCDd you should carefully read
       through that file and modify everything necessary according to your needs.  Otherwise you might encounter LCDd not running properly on your system.

       To make full use of LCDd, a client such as lcdproc(1), lcdexec(1), or lcdvc is required.

OPTIONS
       Available options are:

       -h     Display help screen

       -c config
              Use a configuration file other than /etc/lcdproc/LCDd.conf

       -d driver
              Specify a driver to use (output only to first), overriding the Driver parameter in the config file's [Server] section.

       -f     Run in the foreground, overriding the Foreground parameter in the config file's [Server] section.  The default, if not specified in the config file, is to daemonize LCDd as it  is  intended  to
              operate in the background.

       -i bool
              Tell whether the to enable (1) or disable (0) showing the LCDproc server screen in n the screen rotation, overriding ServerScreen in the config file's [Server] section.

       -w waittime
              Time to pause at each screen (in seconds), overriding the WaitTime parameter in the config file's [Server] section.

       -a addr
              Bind to network address addr, overriding the Bind parameter in the config file's [Server] section.

       -p port
              Listen on port port for incoming connections, overriding the Port parameter in the config file's [Server] section.

       -u user
              Run as user user, overriding the User parameter in the config file's [Server] section.

       -s bool
              Output messages to syslog (1) or to stdout (0), overriding the ReportToSyslog parameter in the config file's [Server] section.

       -r level
              Set reporting level to level, overriding th ReportLevel parameter in the config file's [Server] section.

       Multiple drivers can be used simultaneously; thus, for example, a Matrix Orbital display (MtxOrb driver) can be combined with an infrared driver (irmanin driver).

INVOCATION
              LCDd -d MtxOrb -d joy
       The  invocation  example above will start LCDd reading its configuration from the default configuration file /etc/lcdproc/LCDd.conf but overriding the drivers specified therein with the Matrix Orbital
       driver and the Joystick input driver.

LCDPROC CLIENT-SERVER PROTOCOL
       There is a basic sequence:

       1. Open a TCP connection to the LCDd server port (usually 13666).

       2. Say "hello"

       3. The server will return some information on the type
              of display available.

       4. Define (and use) a new screen and its widgets.

       5. Close the socket when done displaying data.

   CLIENT COMMANDS
       There are many commands for the client to send to the LCDd server, here is the list of commands for versions 0.3 - 0.4 of the protocol:

       hello  This starts a client-server session with the LCDd server; the server will return a white-space separated data string detailing the type of display and its size. The format of  this  string  is:
              "connect  LCDproc <LCDd-version> protocol <protocol-version> lcd [keyword value] [keyword value] ...".  protocol-version is always in the form of "major.minor".  The first 4 keyword value pairs
              are always wid, hgt, cellwid and cellhght, for backwards compatibility with older clients which are hardcoded to take the 8th and 10th words of the connect string as width and height. The  con‐
              nect string will look like this for example: "connect LCDproc 0.5dev protocol 0.4 lcd wid 17 hgt 4 cellwid 6 cellhgt 10"

       client_set -name name
              Set the client's name.

       screen_add #id
              Add a new screen to the display.

       screen_del #id
              Remove a screen from the display.

       screen_set #id [-name name ] [-wid width] [-hgt height] [-priority prio] [-duration int] [-timeout int] [-heartbeat mode] [-backlight mode] [-cursor mode] [-cursor_x xpos] [-cursor_y ypos]
              Initialize a screen, or reset its data.

       widget_add #screen #id type [-in #frame]
              Add a widget of type type to screen #screen.

       widget_del #screen #id
              Delete widget #id from screen #screen.

       widget_set #screen #id data
              Set the data used to define a particular widget #id on screen #screen.

   HEARTBEAT MODES
       Valid heartbeat mode values (for the screen_set command) are:

       on     Display pulsing heart symbol.

       off    No heartbeat display.

       open   Use client's heartbeat setting. This is the default.

   BACKLIGHT MODES
       Valid backlight mode values (for the screen_set command) are:

       on     Turn backlight on.

       off    Turn backlight off

       toggle Turn backlight off when it is on and vice versa.

       open   Use client's backlight setting. This is the default.

       blink  Blinking backlight

       flash  Flashing blacklight

   Priorities
       Valid priority settings (used in the screen_set command) are as follows:

       input  The client is doing interactive input.

       alert  The screen has an important message for the user.

       foreground
              an active client

       info   Normal info screen, default priority.

       background
              The screen is only visible when no normal info screens exists.

       hidden The screen will never be visible.

       For compatibility with older versions of clients a mapping of numeric priority values is also supported:

       1 - 64 foreground

       65 - 192
              normal

       193 - (infinity)
              background

       An example of how to properly use priorities is as follows:

       Imagine  you're making an mp3 player for lcdproc.  When the song changes, it's nice to display the new name immediately.  So, you could set your screen's priority to foreground, wait for the server to
       display (or ignore) your screen, then set the screen back to normal.  This would cause the mp3 screen to show up as soon as the one on screen was finished, then return to normal priority afterward.

       Or, let's say your client monitors the health of hospital patients.  If one of the patients has a heart attack, you could set the screen priority to alert, and it would be displayed  immediately.   It
       wouldn't even wait for the previous screen to finish.  Also, the display would stay on screen most of the time until the user did something about it.

   WIDGET TYPES
       Widgets can be any of the following:

       string A text string to display (as is).

       hbar   A horizontal bar graph.

       vbar   A vertical bar graph.

       pbar   A-percentage bar, filled from left to right. This widget-type is only available on servers which report a protocol-version of 0.4 or newer.

       title  A title displayed across the top of the display, within a banner.

       icon   A graphic icon.

       scroller
              A scrolling text display, scrolling either horizontally or vertically.

       frame  A  container  to  contain  other  widgets,  permitting them to be referred to as a single unit.  A widget is put inside a frame by using the -in #id parameter, where #id refers to the id of the
              frame.

       num    Displays a large decimal digit

       Widgets are drawn on the screen in the order they are created.

   SETTING WIDGET DATA
       In the widget_set command, the data argument depends on which widget is being set.  Each widget takes a particular set of arguments which defines its form and behavior:

       string x y text
              Displays text at position (x,y).

       title text
              Uses text as title to display.

       hbar x y length
              Displays a horizontal bar starting at position (x,y) that is length pixels wide.

       vbar x y length
              Displays a vertical bar starting at position (x,y) that is length pixels high.

       pbar x y width promille [begin-label end-label]
              Displays a percentage-bar starting at position (x,y) covering width character cells including the optional begin and end-labels, filled from left to right to the specified promille value.   Op‐
              tionally a begin-label and end-label can be specified which will be drawn in front of and after the percentage-bar.

       icon x y name
              Displays the icon name at position (x,y).

       scroller left top right bottom direction speed text
              The  text  defined  will scroll in the direction defined.  Valid directions are h (horizontal), m (marquee) and v (vertical).  The speed defines how many "movements" (or changes) will occur per
              frame.  A positive number indicates frames per movement; a negative number indicates movements per frame.

       frame left top right bottom wid hgt dir speed
              Frames define a visible "box" on screen, from the (left, top) corner to the (right, bottom) corner.  The actual data may be bigger, and is defined as wid (width) by hgt (height); if it is  big‐
              ger, then the frame will scroll in the direction (dir) and speed defined.

       num x int
              Displays large decimal digit int at the horizontal position x, which is a normal character x coordinate on the display.  The special value 10 for int displays a colon.

BUGS
       If  LCDd  seems  not to work as expected, try to run it in the foreground with reporting level set to maximum and reporting to stderr.  This can be achieved without changes to the config file by using
       the command line:
              LCDd -f -r 5 -s 0
