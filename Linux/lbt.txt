NAME
       lbt - LTL to Büchi Translator

SYNOPSIS
       lbt < formula.txt > automaton.txt
       lbt2dot < automaton.txt > automaton.dot

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the lbt and lbt2dot commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  In‐
       stead, it has documentation in HTML format; see below.

       lbt is a filter that translates a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula to a corresponding generalized Büchi automaton.  The translation is based on the algorithm by Gerth, Peled and Vardi presented
       at PSTV'95, Simple on-the-fly automatic verification of linear temporal logic.  Hardly any optimizations are implemented, and the generated automaton is often bigger than necessary.   But  on  the
       other hand, it should always be correct.
       The filter lbt2dot can be used to translate Büchi automata from the lbt output format to GraphViz format for visualization.

EXAMPLE
       echo G p0 | lbt | lbt2dot | dotty -
