NAME
       tanglet - word finding game

SYNOPSIS
       tanglet [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       Tanglet is a single player word finding game based on Boggle. The object of the game is to list as many words as you can before the time runs out.  There are several timer modes that determine how
       much time you start with, and if you get extra time when you find a word.

       You  can  join  letters  horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction to make a word, so as long as the letters are next to each other on the board. However, you can not reuse the same
       letter cells in a single word. Also, each word must be at least three letters on a normal board, and four letters on a large board.
