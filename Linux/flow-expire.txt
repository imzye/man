NAME
       flow-expire - Manage storage of flow file archives by expiring old data.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-expire [ -h ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -e expire_count ]  [ -E expire_size ]  -w workdir

DESCRIPTION
       The  flow-expire utility will remove the oldest flow files in a directory based on either a count of files or space utilization. The directory is recursively searched for flow files. Files that do not
       have a flow-tools signature will be ignored. The internal timestamp is used so backups or copies of the flow files that do not retain the original timestamp will not impact the operation  of  flow-ex‐
       pire.  flow-expire is typically used to manage storage in a distributed environment where flows are collected on a different server than they are archived.

OPTIONS
       -d debug_level
              Enable debugging.

       -e expire_count
              Retain the maximum number of files so that the total file count is less than expire_count.

       -E expire_size
              Retain the maximum number of files so that the total storage is less than expire_size. The letters b,K,M,G can be used as multipliers, ie 16 Megabytes is 16M.

       -h     Display help.

       -w workdir
              Work in workdir.

EXAMPLES
       Remove the oldest flow files in /flows/krc4 until the total storage is less then 2 Gigabytes.

       flow-expire -E2Gig -w /flows/krc4

       Remove the oldest flow files in /flows/krc4 until the total number of files is less then 100.

       flow-expire -e100 -w /flows/krc4

BUGS
       Empty directories are not removed.
