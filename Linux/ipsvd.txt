NAME
       ipsvd - Internet protocol service daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ipsvd [-hp] [-l name] [-u user] [-i dir|-x cdb] [-t sec] host port prog

DESCRIPTION
       An implementation of an internet protocol service daemon provides the command line interface as shown in SYNOPSIS above (additional options are possible), and supports pre-defined instructions for
       handling connections through files in a instructions directory, and through a constant database, as described in ipsvd-instruct(5).

       Currently there are two implementations of an internet protocol service daemon: a TCP/IP service daemon, tcpsvd(8), and an UDP/IP service daemon, udpsvd(8).  More internet protocol service daemons
       may appear in the future.

OPTIONS
       -i dir read instructions for handling new connections from the instructions directory dir.  See ipsvd-instruct(5) for details.

       -x cdb read instructions for handling new connections from the constant database cdb.  The constant database normally is created from an instructions directory by running ipsvd-cdb(8).

       -t sec timeout.   This option only takes effect if the -i option is given.  While checking the instructions directory, check the time of last access of the file that matches the clients address or
              hostname if any, discard and remove the file if it wasn't accessed within the last sec seconds; ipsvd does not discard or remove a file if the user's write permission is not set, for  those
              files the timeout is disabled.  Default is 0, which means that the timeout is disabled.

       -l name
              local hostname.  Do not look up the local hostname in DNS, but use name as hostname.

       -u [:]user[:group]
              drop permissions.  Set uid and gid to the user's uid and gid, as found in /etc/passwd, before running prog.  If user is followed by a colon and a group, set the gid to group's gid, as found
              in  /etc/group,  instead  of user's gid.  If group consists of a colon-separated list of group names, set the group ids of all listed groups.  If user is prefixed with a colon, the user and
              all group arguments are interpreted as uid and gids respectively, and not looked up in the password or group file.  All supplementary groups are removed.

       -h     Look up the client's hostname in DNS.

       -p     paranoid.  After looking up the client's hostname in DNS, look up the IP addresses in DNS for that hostname, and forget about the hostname if none of the addresses match the client's IP ad‐
              dress.  You should set this option if you use hostname based instructions.  The -p option implies the -h option.

SIGNALS
       If an ipsvd receives a TERM signal, it exists with 0.
