NAME
       ceph-volume-systemd - systemd ceph-volume helper tool

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-volume-systemd systemd instance name

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-volume-systemd is a systemd helper tool that receives input from (dynamically created) systemd units so that activation of OSDs can proceed.

       It translates the input into a system call to ceph-volume for activation purposes only.

EXAMPLES
       Its input is the systemd instance name (represented by %i in a systemd unit), and it should be in the following format:

          <ceph-volume subcommand>-<extra metadata>

       In the case of lvm a call could look like:

          /usr/bin/ceph-volume-systemd lvm-0-8715BEB4-15C5-49DE-BA6F-401086EC7B41

       Which in turn will call ceph-volume in the following way:

          ceph-volume lvm trigger  0-8715BEB4-15C5-49DE-BA6F-401086EC7B41

       Any other subcommand will need to have implemented a trigger command that can consume the extra metadata in this format.

AVAILABILITY
       ceph-volume-systemd is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the documentation at http://docs.ceph.com/ for more information.
