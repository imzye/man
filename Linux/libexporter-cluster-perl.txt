NAME
       Exporter::Cluster - Extension for easy multiple module imports.

SYNOPSIS
       In module ModuleName.pm:

        package ModuleName;
        require Exporter::Cluster;

        @ISA = qw( Exporter::Cluster );

        %EXPORT_CLUSTER = ( MODULE_1 => ARGS_1,
                            MODULE_2 => ARGS_2,
                            ...      => ...     );

       In other files which to use ModuleName:

        use ModuleName;

       All of the modules listed %EXPORT_CLUSTER will be available (after being augmented by the import argument list if any) to the module that uses ModuleName.

DESCRIPTION
       Exporter::Cluster is designed to allow the user to develop a binding package that allows multiple packages to be imported into the symbol table with single 'use' command.  This module was
       created from the observation of the general trend of Perl packages growing in complexity as new technology is developed and Perl interfaces are designed to interact with this technology.
       This is not a general use module!  It has been designed mainly for use by developers who are trying to implement a sane interface to their work, but still attempt to use good coding practices
       such as code seperation and modular design.

BUGS
       No known bugs at this time.
