DIALOG()                                                                                       Library calls                                                                                       DIALOG()

NAME
       dialog - widgets and utilities for the dialog program

SYNOPSIS
       cc [ flag ... ] file ... -ldialog [ library ... ]
          or
       cc $(dialog-config --cflags) file ... $(dialog-config --libs) ]

       #include <dialog.h>

       Dialog  is  a  program  that will let you present a variety of questions or display messages using dialog boxes from a shell script.  It is built from the dialog library, which consists of several
       widgets as well as utility functions that are used by the widgets or the main program.

DESCRIPTION
       This manpage documents the features from <dialog.h> which are likely to be important to developers using the widgets directly.  Some hints are also given for developing new widgets.

       Here is a dialog version of Hello World:
              int main(void)
              {
                   int status;
                   init_dialog(stdin, stdout);
                   status = dialog_yesno(
                             "Hello, in dialog-format",
                             "Hello World!",
                             0, 0);
                   end_dialog();
                   return status;
              }

DEFINITIONS
       Exit codes (passed back to the main program for its use) are defined with a "DLG_EXIT_ prefix.  The efined constants can be mapped using environment variables  as  described  in  dialog(1),  e.g.,
       DLG_EXIT_OK corresponds to $DIALOG_OK.

       Useful character constants which correspond to user input are named with the "CHR_" prefix, e.g., CHR_BACKSPACE.

       Colors and video attributes are categorized and associated with settings in the configuration file (see the discussion of $DIALOGRC in dialog(1)).  The DIALOG_ATR(n) macro is used for defining the
       references to the combined color and attribute table dlg_color_table[].

       The  dialog  application  passes its command-line parameters to the widget functions.  Some of those parameters are single values, but some of the widgets accept data as an array of values.  Those
       include checklist/radiobox, menubox and formbox.  When the --item-help option is given, an extra column of data is expected.  The  USE_ITEM_HELP(),  CHECKBOX_TAGS,  MENUBOX_TAGS  and  FORMBOX_TAGS
       macros are used to hide this difference from the calling application.

       Most of the other definitions found in <dialog.h> are used for convenience in building the library or main program.  These include definitions based on the generated <dlg_config.h> header.

DATA STRUCTURES
       All  of  the  global data for the dialog library is stored in a few structures: DIALOG_STATE, DIALOG_VARS and DIALOG_COLORS.  The corresponding dialog_state, dialog_vars and dlg_color_table global
       variables should be initialized to zeros, and then populated with the data to use.  A few of these must be nonzero for the corresponding widgets to function.  As as the case with  function  names,
       variables beginning with "dialog_" are designed for use by the calling application while variables beginning with "dlg_" are intended for lower levels, e.g., by the dialog library.

DIALOG_STATE
       The state variables are dialog's working variables.  It initializes those, uses them to manage the widgets.

   .all_subwindows
       This is a linked list of all subwindows created by the library.  The dlg_del_window function uses this to free storage for subwindows when deleting a window.

   .all_windows
       This is a linked list of all windows created by the library.  The dlg_del_window function uses this to locate windows which may be redrawn after deleting a window.

   .aspect_ratio
       This  corresponds to the command-line option "--aspect-ratio".  The value gives the application some control over the box dimensions when using auto sizing (specifying 0 for height and width).  It
       represents width / height.  The default is 9, which means 9 characters wide to every 1 line high.

   .finish_string
       When set to true, this allows calls to dlg_finish_string to discard the corresponding data which is created to speed up layout computations for the given string parameter.  The gauge  widget  uses
       this feature.

   .getc_callbacks
       This is set up in ui_getc.c to record windows which must be polled for input, e.g., to handle the background tailbox widget.  One window is designated as the foreground or control window.

   .getc_redirect
       If the control window for DIALOG_STATE.getc_callbacks is closed, the list is transferred to this variable.  Closing all windows causes the application to exit.

   .had_resize
       This is set to TRUE in dlg_will_resize or dlg_result_key when KEY_RESIZE is read, to tell dialog to ignore subsequent ERRs.

   .no_mouse
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-mouse".  If true, dialog will not initialize (and enable) the mouse in init_dialog.

   .output
       This is set in the dialog application to the stream on which the application and library functions may write text results.  Normally that is the standard error, since the curses library prefers to
       write its data to the standard output.  Some scripts, trading portability for convenience, prefer to write results to the standard output, e.g., by using the "--stdout" option.

   .output_count
       This  is  incremented by dlg_does_output, which is called by each widget that writes text to the output.  The dialog application uses that to decide if it should also write a separator, i.e., DIA‐
       LOG_STATE.separate_str, between calls to each widget.

   .pipe_input
       This is set in init_dialog to a stream which can be used by the gauge widget, which must be the application's standard input.  The dialog application calls init_dialog normally with input  set  to
       the  standard  input,  but optionally based on the "--input-fd" option.  Since the application cannot read from a pipe (standard input) and at the same time read the curses input from the standard
       input, it must allow for reopening the latter from either a specific file descriptor, or directly from the terminal.  The adjusted pipe stream value is stored in this variable.

   .screen_height
       The text-formatting functions use this for the number of rows used for formatting a string.

       It is used by dialog for the command-line options "--print-text-size" and "--print-text-only".

   .screen_initialized
       This is set in init_dialog and reset in end_dialog.  It is used to check if curses has been initialized, and if the endwin function must be called on exit.

   .screen_output
       This is set in init_dialog to the output stream used by the curses library.  Normally that is the standard output, unless that happens to not be a terminal (and  if  init_dialog  can  successfully
       open the terminal directly).

   .screen_width
       The text-formatting functions use this for the number of columns used for formatting a string.

       It is used by dialog for the command-line options "--print-text-size" and "--print-text-only".

   .separate_str
       This  corresponds  to the command-line option "--separate-widget".  The given string specifies a string that will separate the output on dialog's output from each widget.  This is used to simplify
       parsing the result of a dialog with several widgets.  If this option is not given, the default separator string is a tab character.

   .tab_len
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--tab-len number".  Specify the number of spaces that a tab character occupies if the "--tab-correct" option is given.  The default is 8.

   .text_height
       The text-formatting functions set this to the number of lines used for formatting a string.

       It is used by dialog for the command-line options "--print-text-size" and "--print-text-only".

   .text_only
       Dialog uses this in the command-line option "--print-text-only".

       The text-formatting functions (dlg_print_text, dlg_print_line, and dlg_print_autowrap) check this to decide whether to print the formatted text to dialog's output or to the curses-display.

       Also, dlg_auto_size checks the flag, allowing it to be used before init_dialog is called.

   .text_width
       The text-formatting functions set this to the number of columns used for formatting a string.

       It is used by dialog for the command-line options "--print-text-size" and "--print-text-only".

   .trace_output
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--trace file".  It is the file pointer to which trace messages are written.

   .use_colors
       This is set in init_dialog if the curses implementation supports color.

   .use_scrollbar
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--scrollbar".  If true, draw a scrollbar to make windows holding scrolled data more readable.

   .use_shadow
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-shadow".  This is set in init_dialog if the curses implementation supports color.  If true, suppress shadows that would be drawn to the right  and
       bottom of each dialog box.

   .visit_items
       This  corresponds  to  the command-line option "--visit-items".  Modify the tab-traversal of the list-oriented widgets (buildlist, checklist, radiobox, menubox, inputmenu, and treeview) to include
       the list of items as one of the states.  This is useful as a visual aid, i.e., the cursor position helps some users.

       The dialog application resets the dialog_vars data before accepting options to invoke each widget.  Most of the DIALOG_VARS members are set directly from dialog's command-line options:

DIALOG_VARS
       In contrast to DIALOG_STATE, the members of DIALOG_VARS are set by command-line options in dialog.

   .ascii_lines
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--ascii-lines.  It causes line-drawing to be done with ASCII characters, e.g., "+" and "-".  See DIALOG_VARS.no_lines.

   .backtitle
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--backtitle backtitle".  It specifies a backtitle string to be displayed on the backdrop, at the top of the screen.

   .beep_after_signal
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--beep-after".  If true, beep after a user has completed a widget by pressing one of the buttons.

   .beep_signal
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--beep".  It is obsolete.

   .begin_set
       This is true if the command-line option "--begin y x" was used.  It specifies the position of the upper left corner of a dialog box on the screen.

   .begin_x
       This corresponds to the x value from the command-line option "--begin y x" (second value).

   .begin_y
       This corresponds to the y value from the command-line option "--begin y x" (first value).

   .cancel_label
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--cancel-label string".  The given string overrides the label used for “Cancel” buttons.

   .cant_kill
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-kill".  If true, this tells dialog to put the tailboxbg box in the background, printing its process id to dialog's output.  SIGHUP is disabled for
       the background process.

   .colors
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--colors".  If true, interpret embedded "\Z" sequences in the dialog text by the following character, which tells dialog to set colors or video attrib‐
       utes:

       •   0 through 7 are the ANSI codes used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white respectively.

       •   Bold is set by 'b', reset by 'B'.

       •   Reverse is set by 'r', reset by 'R'.

       •   Underline is set by 'u', reset by 'U'.

       The settings are cumulative, e.g., "\Zb\Z1" makes the following text bright red.  Restore normal settings with "\Zn".

   .column_separator
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--column-separator".  Dialog splits data for radio/checkboxes and menus on the occurrences of the given string, and aligns the split data into columns.

   .cr_wrap
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--cr-wrap".  If true, interpret embedded newlines in the dialog text as a newline on the screen.  Otherwise, dialog will only wrap lines  where  needed
       to  fit  inside  the text box.  Even though you can control line breaks with this, dialog will still wrap any lines that are too long for the width of the box.  Without cr-wrap, the layout of your
       text may be formatted to look nice in the source code of your script without affecting the way it will look in the dialog.

   .cursor_off_label
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--cursor-off-label".  If true, place the terminal cursor at the end of a button instead of on the first character of the button label.  This is  useful
       to reduce visual confusion when the cursor coloration interacts poorly with the button-label text colors.

   .date_format
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--date-format string".  If the host provides strftime, and the value is nonnull, the calendar widget uses this to format its output.

   .default_button
       This is set by the command-line option "--default-button.  It is used by dlg_default_button.

   .default_item
       This  corresponds to the command-line option "--default-item string".  The given string is used as the default item in a checklist, form or menu box.  Normally the first item in the box is the de‐
       fault.

   .defaultno
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--defaultno".  If true, make the default value of the yes/no box a No.  Likewise, treat the default button of widgets that provide “OK” and “Cancel” as
       a Cancel.  If --no-cancel was given that option overrides this, making the default button always “Yes” (internally the same as “OK”).

   .dlg_clear_screen
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--clear".  This option is implemented in the main program, not the library.  If true, the screen will be cleared on exit.   This  may  be  used  alone,
       without other options.

   .erase_on_exit
       This  corresponds to the command-line option "--erase-on-exit".  If true, remove the dialog widget on program exit, erasing the entire screen to its native background color, and place the terminal
       cursor at the lower left corner of the screen.

       This is useful for making the window contents invisible at the end of a series of dialog boxes.  It can also be used at earlier stages of a series of invocations of dialog, if the  series  may  be
       aborted before it is fully completed.

   .exit_label
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--exit-label string".  The given string overrides the label used for “EXIT” buttons.

   .extra_button
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--extra-button".  If true, some widgets show an extra button, between “OK” and “Cancel” buttons, or “Yes” and “No” buttons.

   .extra_label
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--extra-label string".  The given string overrides the label used for “Extra” buttons.  Note: for inputmenu widgets, this defaults to “Rename”.

   .formitem_type
       This is set by the command-line option "--passwordform" to tell the form widget that its text fields should be treated like password widgets.

   .help_button
       This  corresponds  to the command-line option "--help-button".  If true, some widgets show a help-button after “OK” and “Cancel” buttons, i.e., in checklist, radiolist and menu boxes, or the “Yes”
       and “No” buttons for the yesno box.

       If --item-help is also given, on exit the return status will be the same as for the “OK” button, and the item-help text will be written to dialog's output after the token “HELP”.   Otherwise,  the
       return status will indicate that the Help button was pressed, and no message printed.

   .help_file
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--hfile string".  The given filename is passed to dialog_helpfile when the user presses F1.

   .help_label
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--help-label string".  The given string overrides the label used for “Help” buttons.

   .help_line
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--hline string".  The given string is displayed in the bottom of dialog windows, like a subtitle.

   .help_status
       This  corresponds  to  the command-line option "--help-status".  If true, and the the help-button is selected, writes the checklist or radiolist information after the item-help “HELP” information.
       This can be used to reconstruct the state of a checklist after processing the help request.

   .help_tags
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--help-tags".  If true, dlg_add_help_formitem and dlg_add_help_listitem use the item's tag value consistently rather than  using  the  tag's  help-text
       value when DIALOG_VARS.item_help is set.

   .input_length
       This is nonzero if DIALOG_VARS.input_result is allocated, versus being a pointer to the user's local variables.

   .input_menu
       This flag is set to denote whether the menubox widget implements a menu versus a inputmenu widget.

   .input_result
       This may be either a user-supplied buffer, or a buffer dynamically allocated by the library, depending on DIALOG_VARS.input_length:

       •   If DIALOG_VARS.input_length is zero, this is a pointer to user buffer (on the stack, or static).  The buffer size is assumed to be MAX_LEN, which is defined in <dialog.h>.

       •   When DIALOG_VARS.input_length is nonzero, this is a dynamically-allocated buffer used by the widgets to return printable results to the calling application.

       Certain  widgets  copy a result to this buffer.  If the pointer is NULL, or if the length is insufficient for the result, then the dialog library allocates a buffer which is large enough, and sets
       DIALOG_VARS.input_length.  Callers should check for this case if they have supplied their own buffer.

   .insecure
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--insecure".  If true, make the password widget friendlier but less secure, by echoing asterisks for each character.

   .in_helpfile
       This variable is used to prevent dialog_helpfile from showing anything, e.g., if F1 were pressed within a help-file display.

   .iso_week
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--iso-week".  It is used in the calendar widget to tell how to compute the starting week for the year:

       •   by default, the calendar treats January 1 as the first week of the year.

       •   If this variable is true, the calendar uses ISO 8601's convention.  ISO 8601 numbers weeks starting with the first week in January with a Thursday in the current year.  January 1 may be in the
           previous year.

   .item_help
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--item-help".  If true, interpret the tags data for checklist, radiolist and menu boxes adding a column whose text is displayed in the bottom  line  of
       the screen, for the currently selected item.

   .keep_tite
       This  is  set  by  the  command-line option "--keep-tite" to tell dialog to not attempt to cancel the terminal initialization (termcap ti/te) sequences which correspond to xterm's alternate-screen
       switching.  Normally dialog does this to avoid flickering when run several times in a script.

   .keep_window
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--keep-window".  If true, do not remove/repaint the window on exit.  This is useful for keeping the window contents visible when  several  widgets  are
       run in the same process.  Note that curses will clear the screen when starting a new process.

   .last_key
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--last-key".

   .max_input
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--max-input size".  Limit input strings to the given size.  If not specified, the limit is 2048.

   .no_hot_key
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-hot-list".

       Some  widgets  (buildlist, checklist, inputmenu, menu, radiolist, treeview) display a list for which the leading capital letter in each entry is accepted as a hot-key, to quickly move the focus to
       that entry.

       Setting this variable to TRUE disables the feature.

   .no_items
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-items".  Some widgets (checklist, inputmenu, radiolist, menu) display a list with two columns (a “tag” and  “item”,  i.e.,  “description”).   This
       tells dialog to read shorter rows from data, omitting the “list”.

   .no_label
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-label string".  The given string overrides the label used for “No” buttons.

   .no_lines
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-lines.  It suppresses line-drawing.  See DIALOG_VARS.ascii_lines.

   .no_nl_expand
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-nl-expand".  If false, dlg_trim_string converts literal "\n" substrings in a message into newlines.

   .no_tags
       This  corresponds  to  the command-line option "--no-tags".  Some widgets (checklist, inputmenu, radiolist, menu) display a list with two columns (a “tag” and “item”, also known as “description”).
       The tag is useful for scripting, but may not help the user.  The --no-tags option (from Xdialog) may be used to suppress the column of tags from the display.

       Normally dialog allows you to quickly move to entries on the displayed list, by matching a single character to the first character of the tag.  When the --no-tags option is given,  dialog  matches
       against the first character of the description.  In either case, the matchable character is highlighted.

       Here is a table showing how the no_tags and no_items values interact:

       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

       * Xdialog does not display the tag column for the analogous buildlist and treeview widgets.  Dialog does the same on the command-line.  However the library interface defaults to displaying the tag
         column.  Your application can enable or disable the tag column as needed for each widget.

   .nocancel
       This  corresponds  to  the command-line option "--no-cancel".  If true, suppress the “Cancel” button in checklist, inputbox and menu box modes.  A script can still test if the user pressed the ESC
       key to cancel to quit.

   .nocollapse
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-collapse".  Normally dialog converts tabs to spaces and reduces multiple spaces to a single space for text which is displayed in a message  boxes,
       etc.  It true, that feature is disabled.  Note that dialog will still wrap text, subject to the --cr-wrap option.

   .nook
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--no-ok.  Dialog will suppress the “ok” (or “yes”) button from the widget.

   .ok_label
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--ok-label string".  The given string overrides the label used for “OK” buttons.

   .pause_secs
       When set, force dlg_set_timeout to use 10 milliseconds rather than using the DIALOG_VARS.timeout_secs value.

   .print_siz
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--print-size".  If true, each widget prints its size to dialog's output when it is invoked.

   .quoted
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--quoted.  Normally dialog quotes the strings returned by checklist's as well as the item-help text.  If true, dialog will quote all string results.

   .reorder
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--reorder.  By default, the buildlist widget uses the same order for the output (right) list as for the input (left).  If true, dialog will use the or‐
       der in which a user adds selections to the output list.

   .separate_output
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--separate-output".  If true, checklist widgets output result one line at a time, with no quoting.  This facilitates parsing by another program.

   .single_quoted
       This  corresponds  to the command-line option "--single-quoted".  If true, use single-quoting as needed (and no quotes if unneeded) for the output of checklist's as well as the item-help text.  If
       this option is not set, dialog uses double quotes around each item.  The latter requires occasional use of backslashes to make the output useful in shell scripts.

   .size_err
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--size-err".  If true, check the resulting size of a dialog box before trying to use it, printing the resulting size if it is larger than  the  screen.
       (This option is obsolete, since all new-window calls are checked).

   .sleep_secs
       This  corresponds  to the command-line option "--sleep secs".  This option is implemented in the main program, not the library.  If nonzero, this is the number of seconds after to delay after pro‐
       cessing a dialog box.

   .tab_correct
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--tab-correct".  If true, convert each tab character of the text to one or more spaces.  Otherwise, tabs are rendered according to the curses library's
       interpretation.

   .time_format
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--time-format string".  If the host provides strftime, and the value is nonnull, the timebox widget uses this to format its output.

   .timeout_secs
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--timeout secs".  If nonzero, timeout input requests (exit with error code) if no user response within the given number of seconds.

   .title
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--title title".  Specifies a title string to be displayed at the top of the dialog box.

   .trim_whitespace
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--trim".  If true, eliminate leading blanks, trim literal newlines and repeated blanks from message text.

   .week_start
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--week-start".  It is used in the calendar widget to set the starting day for the week.  The string value can be

       •   a number (0 to 6, Sunday through Saturday using POSIX) or

       •   the special value “locale” (this works with systems using glibc, providing an extension to the locale command, the first_weekday value).

       •   a string matching one of the abbreviations for the day of the week shown in the calendar widget, e.g., “Mo” for “Monday”.

   .yes_label
       This corresponds to the command-line option "--yes-label string".  The given string overrides the label used for “Yes” buttons.

            is the list of items, contain tag, name, and optionally help strings (if dialog_vars.item_help is set).  The initial selection state for each item is also in this list.

       int flag

       flag is either FLAG_CHECK, for checklists (multiple selections), or FLAG_RADIO for radiolists (a single selection).

   dialog_yesno
       implements the "--yesno" option.

       const char * title
            is the title on the top of the widget.

       const char * cprompt
            is the prompt text shown within the widget.

       int height
            is the desired height of the box.  If zero, the height is based on the screen size.

       int width
            is the desired width of the box.  If zero, the height is based on the screen size.

UTILITY FUNCTIONS
       Most  functions  that  implement lower-level functionality for the command-line dialog program or widgets, have names beginning "dlg_".  Bowing to longstanding usage, the functions that initialize
       the display and end it are named init_dialog and end_dialog.

       The only non-widget function whose name begins with "dialog_" is dialog_version, which returns the version number of the library as a string.

       A few functions are prefixed "_dlg_", because they are required for internal use, but not intended as part of the library application programming interface.

       Here is a brief summary of the utility functions and their parameters:

   dlg_add_callback
       Add a callback, used to allow polling input from multiple tailbox widgets.

       DIALOG_CALLBACK *p
            contains the callback information.

   dlg_add_callback_ref
       Like dlg_add_callback, but passes a reference to the DIALOG_CALLBACK as well as a pointer to a cleanup function which will be called when the associated input ends.

       DIALOG_CALLBACK **p
            points to the callback information.  This is a reference to the pointer so that the caller's pointer can be zeroed when input ends.

       DIALOG_FREEBACK func
            function to call when input ends, e.g., to free caller's additional data.

   dlg_add_help_formitem
       This is a utility function used enforce consistent behavior for the DIALOG_VARS.help_tags and DIALOG_VARS.item_help variables.

       int *result
            this is updated to DLG_EXIT_ITEM_HELP if DIALOG_VARS.item_help is set.

       char **tag
            the tag- or help-text is stored here.

       DIALOG_FORMITEM *item
            contains the list item to use for tag- or help-text.

   dlg_add_help_listitem
       This is a utility function used enforce consistent behavior for the DIALOG_VARS.help_tags and DIALOG_VARS.item_help variables.

       int *result
            this is updated to DLG_EXIT_ITEM_HELP if DIALOG_VARS.item_help is set.

       char **tag
            the tag- or help-text is stored here.

       DIALOG_LISTITEM *item
            contains the list item to use for tag- or help-text.

   dlg_add_last_key
       Report the last key entered by the user.  This implements the --last-key command-line option, using dialog_vars.last_key.

       int mode
            controls the way the last key report is separated from other results:

            -2   (no separator)

            -1   (separator after the key name)

            0    (separator is optionally before the key name)

            1    (same as -1)

   dlg_add_quoted
       Add a quoted string to the result buffer (see dlg_add_result).  If no quotes are necessary, none are used.  If dialog_vars.single_quoted is set, single-quotes are used.   Otherwise,  double-quotes
       are used.

       char * string
            is the string to add.

   dlg_add_result
       Add a string to the result buffer dialog_vars.input_result.

       char * string
            is the string to add.

   dlg_add_separator
       Add  an  output-separator to the result buffer dialog_vars.input_result.  If dialog_vars.output_separator is set, use that.  Otherwise, if dialog_vars.separate_output is set, use newline.  If nei‐
       ther is set, use a space.

   dlg_add_string
       Add a quoted or unquoted string to the result buffer (see dlg_add_quoted) and dlg_add_result), according to whether dialog_vars.quoted is true.

       char * string
            is the string to add.

   dlg_align_columns
       Copy and reformat an array of pointers to strings, aligning according to the column separator dialog_vars.column_separator.  If no column separator is set, the array will be unmodified;  otherwise
       it is copied and reformatted.

              Caveat: This function is only implemented for 8-bit characters.

       char **target
            This is the array to reformat.  It points to the first string to modify.

       int per_row
            This is the size of the struct for each row of the array.

       int num_rows
            This is the number of rows in the array.

   dlg_allocate_gauge
       Allocates a gauge widget.  Use dlg_update_gauge to display the result.

       const char * title
            is the title string to display at the top of the widget.

       const char * cprompt
            is the prompt text shown within the widget.

       int height
            is the desired height of the box.  If zero, the height is adjusted to use the available screen size.

       int width
            is the desired width of the box.  If zero, the height is adjusted to use the available screen size.

       int percent
            is the percentage to show in the progress bar.

   dlg_asciibox
       returns  its parameter transformed to the corresponding "+" or "-", etc., for the line-drawing characters used in dialog.  If the parameter is not a line-drawing or other special character such as
       ACS_DARROW, it returns 0.

       chtype ch
            is the parameter, usually one of the ACS_xxx constants.

   dlg_attr_clear
       Set window to the given attribute.

       WINDOW * win
            is the window to update.

       int height
            is the number of rows to update.

       int width
            is the number of columns to update.

       chtype attr
            is the attribute, e.g., A_BOLD.

   dlg_auto_size
       Compute window size based on the size of the formatted prompt and minimum dimensions for a given widget.

       Dialog sets dialog_state.text_height and dialog_state.text_width for the formatted prompt as a side-effect.

       Normally dialog writes the formatted prompt to the curses window, but it will write the formatted prompt to the output stream if dialog_state.text_only is set.

       const char * title
            is the title string to display at the top of the widget.

       const char * prompt
            is the message text which will be displayed in the widget, used here to determine how large the widget should be.

            If the value is NULL, dialog allows the widget to use the whole screen, i.e., if the values referenced by height and/or width are zero.

       int * height
            is the nominal height.  Dialog checks the referenced value and may update it:

            •   if the value is negative, dialog updates it to the available height of the screen, after reserving rows for the window border and shadow, as well as taking  into  account  dialog_vars.be‐
                gin_y and dialog_vars.begin_set.

            •   if the value is zero, dialog updates it to the required height of the window, taking into account a (possibly) multi-line prompt.

            •   if the value is greater than zero, dialog uses it internally, but restores the value on return.

       int * width
            is the nominal width.  Dialog checks the referenced value and may update it:

            •   if the value is negative, dialog updates it to the available width of the screen, after reserving rows for the window border and shadow, as well as taking into account dialog_vars.begin_x
                and dialog_vars.begin_set.

            •   if the value is zero, dialog updates it to the required width of the window, taking into account a (possibly) multi-line prompt.

            •   if the value is greater than zero, dialog uses it internally, but restores the value on return.

       int boxlines
            is the number of lines to reserve in the vertical direction.

       int mincols
            is the minimum number of columns to use.

   dlg_auto_sizefile
       Like dlg_auto_size, but use a file contents to decide how large the widget should be.

       const char * title
            is the title string to display at the top of the widget.

       const char * file
            is the name of the file.

       int * height
            is the nominal height.

            If it is -1, use the screen's height (after subtracting dialog_vars.begin_y if dialog_vars.begin_set is true).

            If it is greater than zero, limit the referenced value to the screen-height after verifying that the file exists.

       int * width
            is the nominal width.

            If it is -1, use the screen's width (after subtracting dialog_vars.begin_x if dialog_vars.begin_set is true).

            If it is greater than zero, limit the referenced value to the screen-width after verifying that the file exists.

       int boxlines
            is the number of lines to reserve on the screen for drawing boxes.

       int mincols
            is the number of columns to reserve on the screen for drawing boxes.

   dlg_beeping
       If dialog_vars.beep_signal is nonzero, this calls beep once and sets dialog_vars.beep_signal to zero.

   dlg_boxchar
       returns its chtype parameter transformed as follows:

       •   if neither dialog_vars.ascii_lines nor dialog_vars.no_lines is set.

       •   if dialog_vars.ascii_lines is set, returns the corresponding "+" or "-", etc., for the line-drawing characters used in dialog.

       •   otherwise, if dialog_vars.no_lines is set, returns a space for the line-drawing characters.

       •   if the parameter is not a line-drawing or other special character such as ACS_DARROW, it returns the parameter unchanged.

   dlg_box_x_ordinate
       returns a suitable x-ordinate (column) for a new widget.  If dialog_vars.begin_set is 1, use dialog_vars.begin_x; otherwise center the widget on the screen (using the width parameter).

       int width
            is the width of the widget.

   dlg_box_y_ordinate
       returns a suitable y-ordinate (row) for a new widget.  If dialog_vars.begin_set is 1, use dialog_vars.begin_y; otherwise center the widget on the screen (using the height parameter).

       int height
            is the height of the widget.

   dlg_buildlist
       This is an alternate interface to the buildlist widget which allows the application to read the list item states back directly without putting them in the output buffer.

       const char * title
            is the title string to display at the top of the widget.

       const char * cprompt
            is the prompt text shown within the widget.

       int height
            is the desired height of the box.  If zero, the height is adjusted to use the available screen size.

       int width
            is the desired width of the box.  If zero, the height is adjusted to use the available screen size.

       int list_height
            is the minimum height to reserve for displaying the list.  If zero, it is computed based on the given height and width.

       int item_no
            is the number of rows in items.

       DIALOG_LISTITEM * items
            is the list of items, contain tag, name, and optionally help strings (if dialog_vars.item_help is set).  The initial selection state for each item is also in this list.

       const char * states
            This  is  a list of characters to display for the given states.  Normally a buildlist provides true (1) and false (0) values, which the widget displays as "*" and space, respectively.  An ap‐
            plication may set this parameter to an arbitrary null-terminated string.  The widget determines the number of states from the length of this string, and will cycle through  the  corresponding
            display characters as the user presses the space-bar.

       int order_mode
            is reserved for future enhancements

       int * current_item
            The widget sets the referenced location to the index of the current display item (cursor) when it returns.

   dlg_button_count
       Count the buttons in the list.

       const char ** labels
            is a list of (pointers to) button labels terminated by a null pointer.

   dlg_button_key
       If a key was bound to one of the button-codes in dlg_result_key, fake a button-value and an “Cancel”  key to cause the calling widget to return the corresponding status.

       See dlg_ok_buttoncode, which maps settings for ok/extra/help and button number into exit-code.

   dlg_button_layout
       Make sure there is enough space for the buttons by computing the width required for their labels, adding margins and limiting based on the screen size.

       const char ** labels
            is a list of (pointers to) button labels terminated by a null pointer.

       int * limit
            the function sets the referenced limit to the width required for the buttons (limited by the screen size) if that is wider than the passed-in limit.

   dlg_button_sizes
       Compute the size of the button array in columns.

       const char ** labels
            is a list of (pointers to) button labels terminated by a null pointer.

       int vertical
            is true if the buttons are arranged in a column rather than a row.

       int * longest
            Return the total number of columns in the referenced location.

       int * length
            Return the longest button's columns in the referenced location.

   dlg_button_to_char
       Find  the  first uppercase character in the label, which we may use for an abbreviation.  If the label is empty, return -1.  If no uppercase character is found, return 0.  Otherwise return the up‐
       percase character.

       Normally dlg_draw_buttons and dlg_char_to_button use the first uppercase character.  However, they keep track of all of the labels and if the first has already been used  in  another  label,  they
       will continue looking for another uppercase character.  This function does not have enough information to make that check.

       const char * label
            is the label to test.

   dlg_button_x_step
       Compute the step-size needed between elements of the button array.

       const char ** labels
            is a list of (pointers to) button labels terminated by a null pointer.

       int limit
            is the maximum number of columns to allow for the buttons.

       int * gap
            store the nominal gap between buttons in the referenced location.  This is constrained to be at least one.

       int * margin
            store the left+right total margins (for the list of buttons) in the referenced location.

       int * step
            store the step-size in the referenced location.

   dlg_calc_list_width
       Calculate the minimum width for the list, assuming none of the items are truncated.

       int item_no
            is the number of items.

       DIALOG_LISTITEM * items
            contains a name and text field, e.g., for checklists or radiobox lists.  The function returns the sum of the widest columns needed for of each of these fields.

            If dialog_vars.no_items is set, the text fields in the list are ignored.

   dlg_calc_listh
       Calculate new height and list_height values.

       int * height
            on input, is the height without adding the list-height.  On return, this contains the total list-height and is the actual widget's height.

       int * list_height
            on  input, is the requested list-height.  On return, this contains the number of rows available for displaying the list after taking into account the screen size and the dialog_vars.begin_set
            and dialog_vars.begin_y variables.

       int item_no
            is the number of items in the list.

   dlg_calc_listw
       This function is obsolete, provided for library-compatibility.  It is replaced by dlg_calc_list_width.

       int item_no
            is the number of items.

       char ** items
            is a list of character pointers.

       int group
            is the number of items in each group, e.g., the second array index.

   dlg_char_to_button
       Given a list of button labels, and a character which may be the abbreviation for one, find it, if it exists.  An abbreviation will be the first character which happens to be capitalized in the la‐
       bel.  If the character is found, return its index within the list of labels.  Otherwise, return DLG_EXIT_UNKNOWN.

       int ch
            is the character to find.

       const char ** labels
            is a list of (pointers to) button labels terminated by a null pointer.

   dlg_checklist
       This entrypoint provides the --checklist or --radiolist functionality without the limitations of dialog's command-line syntax (compare to dialog_checklist).

       const char * title
            is the title string to display at the top of the widget.

       const char * cprompt
            is the prompt text shown within the widget.

            is the desired width of the box.  If zero, the height is adjusted to use the available screen size.

       int list_height
            is the minimum height to reserve for displaying the list.  If zero, it is computed based on the given height and width.

       int item_no
            is the number of items.

       DIALOG_LISTITEM * items
            This is a list of the items to display in the checklist.

       const char * states
            This is a list of characters to display for the given states.  Normally a checklist provides true (1) and false (0) values, which the widget displays as "*" and space, respectively.   An  ap‐
            plication  may  set this parameter to an arbitrary null-terminated string.  The widget determines the number of states from the length of this string, and will cycle through the corresponding
            display characters as the user presses the space-bar.

       int flag
            This is should be one of FLAG_CHECK or FLAG_RADIO, depending on whether the widget should act as a checklist or radiobox.

       int * current_item
            The widget sets the referenced location to the index of the current display item (cursor) when it returns.

   dlg_check_scrolled
       given a function key (or other key that was mapped to a function key), check if it is one of the up/down scrolling functions:

              DLGK_PAGE_FIRST,
              DLGK_PAGE_LAST,
              DLGK_GRID_UP,
              DLGK_GRID_DOWN,
              DLGK_PAGE_PREV or
              DLGK_PAGE_NEXT.

       Some widgets use these key bindings for scrolling the prompt-text up and down, to allow for display in very small windows.

       The function returns 0 (zero) if it finds one of these keys, and -1 if not.

       int key
            is the function-key to check

       int last
            is the number of lines which would be used to display the scrolled prompt in an arbitrarily tall window.  It is used here to check limits for the offset value.

       int page
            this is the available height for writing scrolled text, which is smaller than the window if it contains buttons.

       bool * show
            on return, holds TRUE if dlg_print_scrolled should be used to redisplay the prompt text.

       int * offset
            on entry, holds the starting line number (counting from zero) last used for dlg_print_scrolled.  On return, holds the updated starting line number.

   dlg_clear
       Set window to the default dialog screen attribute.  This is set in the rc-file with screen_color.

   dlg_clr_result
       Free storage used for the result buffer (dialog_vars.input_result).  The corresponding pointer is set to NULL.

   dlg_color_count
       Return the number of colors that can be configured in dialog.

   dlg_color_setup
       Initialize the color pairs used in dialog.

       Count the entries in an argument vector.

       argv Points to the argument vector.

   dlg_count_columns
       Returns the number of columns used for a string.  This is not necessarily the number of bytes in a string.

       const char * string
            is the string to measure.

   dlg_count_real_columns
       Returns the number of columns used for a string, accounting for "\Z" sequences which can be used for coloring the text if dialog_vars.colors is set.  This is not necessarily the number of bytes in
       a string.

       const char * string
            is the string to measure.

   dlg_count_wchars
       Returns the number of wide-characters in the string.

       const char * string
            is the string to measure.

   dlg_create_rc
       Create a configuration file, i.e., write internal tables to a file which can be read back by dialog as an rc-file.

       const char * filename
            is the name of the file to write to.

   dlg_ctl_size
       If dialog_vars.size_err is true, check if the given window size is too large to fit on the screen.  If so, exit with an error reporting the size of the window.

       int height
            is the window's height

       int width
            is the window's width

   dlg_default_button
       If dialog_vars.default_button is positive, return the button-index for that button code, using dlg_ok_buttoncode to test indices starting with zero.  Otherwise (or if no match was  found  for  the
       button code), return zero.

   dlg_default_formitem
       If dialog_vars.default_item is not null, find that name by matching the name field in the list of form items.  If found, return the index of that item in the list.  Otherwise, return zero.

       DIALOG_FORMITEM * items
            is the list of items to search.  It is terminated by an entry with a null name field.

   dlg_default_item
       This function is obsolete, provided for library-compatibility.  It is replaced by dlg_default_formitem and dlg_default_listitem.

       char ** items
            is the list of items to search.

       int llen
            is the number of items in each group, e.g., the second array index.

   dlg_defaultno_button
       If dialog_vars.defaultno is true, and dialog_vars.nocancel is not, find the button-index for the “Cancel” button.  Otherwise, return the index for “OK” (always zero).

       Creates a region on which the mouse-clicks will return a specified code.

       int y
            is the top-row of the region.

       int x
            is the left-column of the region.

       int height
            is the height of the region.

       int width
            is the width of the region.

       int code
            is a code used to make the region unique within a widget

       int step_x
            is used in modes 2 (columns) and 3 (cells) to determine the width of a column/cell.

       int step_y
            is currently unused

       int mode
            is used to determine how the mouse position is translated into a code (like a function-key):

            1  index by lines

            2  index by columns

            3  index by cells

            is the left-column for the base

       int y
            is the top-row for the base

   dlg_mouse_setcode
       Sets  a  value  used internally by dlg_mouse_mkregion which is added to the code parameter.  By providing different values, e.g., multiples of KEY_MAX, it is possible to support multiple “big” re‐
       gions in a widget.  The buildlist widget uses this feature to recognize mouse-clicks in the left/right panes.

       int code
            is the value to add to dlg_mouse_mkregion's code parameter.

   dlg_mouse_wgetch
       is a wrapper for dlg_getc which additionally maps mouse-clicks (if the curses library supports those) into extended function-keys which encode the position according to the mode in dlg_mouse_mkbi‐
       gregion.  Returns the corresponding key-code.

       WINDOW * win

   dlg_prev_button
       Return the previous index in the list of labels.

       const char ** labels
            is a list of (pointers to) button labels terminated by a null pointer.

       int button
            is the current button index

   dlg_print_line
       Print one line of the prompt in the window within the limits of the specified right margin.  The line will end on a word boundary and a pointer to the start of the next line is returned, or a NULL
       pointer if the end of *prompt is reached.

       WINDOW *win
            is the window to update.

       chtype *attr

       played.   If  dialog_vars.no_tags is true, the “tag” value is not shown.  The first character of the first value shown (tag or description) is highlighted to indicate that the widget will match it
       for quick navigation.

       WINDOW *win

   dlg_print_scrolled
       This is a wrapper for dlg_print_autowrap which allows the user to scroll too-long prompt text up/down.

       See dlg_check_scrolled for a function which updates the offset variable used as a parameter here.  It complements this function; you need both.  If pauseopt is set, this function  returns  an  up‐
       dated last parameter, needed for dlg_check_scrolled calls.

       WINDOW * win
            is the window to update.

       const char * prompt

            is the width that the wrapping should occur in

       int pauseopt
            is true if the extra functionality for scrolling should be enabled.  If false, this calls dlg_print_autowrap without doing any scrolling.

   dlg_prev_ok_buttonindex
       Find the previous button index in the list from dlg_ok_labels.

       int current
            is the current index

       int extra
            if negative provides a way to enumerate extra active areas on the widget.

   dlg_print_autowrap
       Print a string of text in a window, automatically wrap around to the next line if the string is too long to fit on one line.  Note that the string may contain embedded newlines.  The text is writ‐
       ten starting at the top of the window.

       WINDOW * win
            is the window to update.

       const char * prompt
            is the string to print

       int col
            is the column limit

       chtype * attr
            holds the starting attributes, and is updated to reflect the final attributes applied to the string.

   dlg_progressbox
       implements the "--prgbox" and "--progressbox" options.

       const char * title
            is the title on the top of the widget.

       const char * cprompt
            is the prompt text shown within the widget.  If empty or null, no prompt is shown.

       int height
            is the desired height of the box.  If zero, the height is based on the screen size.

       int width
            is the desired width of the box.  If zero, the height is based on the screen size.

       int pauseopt
            if true, an “OK” button will be shown, and the dialog will wait for it to complete.  With an “OK” button, it is denoted a “programbox”, without an “OK” button, it is denoted a “progressbox”.

       FILE * fp
            is the file pointer, which may be a pipe or a regular file.

   dlg_put_backtitle
       Display the background title if dialog_vars.backtitle is non-null.  The background title is shown at the top of the screen.

   dlg_reallocate_gauge
       Allocates or reallocates a gauge widget (see dlg_allocate_gauge).  Use dlg_update_gauge to display the result.

       void ** objptr
            If  the pointer referenced by this parameter is null, the function creates a new gauge widget using dlg_allocate_gauge.  Otherwise, it updates the title and cprompt values, reusing the window
            from the previous call on this function.  As a side-effect, the function stores the updated object-pointer via the objptr parameter.

       const char * title
            is the title string to display at the top of the widget.

       const char * cprompt
            is the prompt text shown within the widget.

       int height
            is the desired height of the box.  If zero, the height is adjusted to use the available screen size.

       int width
            is the desired width of the box.  If zero, the height is adjusted to use the available screen size.

       int percent
            is the percentage to show in the progress bar.

   dlg_register_buttons
       The widget developer should call this function after dlg_register_window, for the list of button labels associated with the widget.  One may bind a key to a button, e.g., “OK” for DLGK_OK,

       WINDOW * win
            is the window with which to associate the buttons

       const char * name
            is the widget's binding name (usually the name of the widget).

       Remove a callback.

       DIALOG_CALLBACK * p
            contains the callback information.

   dlg_renamed_menutext
       This is a utility function which supports the --inputmenu option of the dialog program.  If dialog_vars.input_menu is set, dialog_menu passes this pointer to dlg_menu as the rename_menutext  para‐
       meter.  Otherwise, it passes dlg_dummy_menutext.

       The function should add “RENAMED” to dialog_vars.input_result , followed by the menu item's name and the newtext value (with a space separating the three items), and return DLG_EXIT_EXTRA.

       DIALOG_LISTITEM * items
            is the list of menu items

       int current
            is the index of the currently-selected item

       char * newtext
            is the updated text for the menu item

   dlg_reset_timeout
       Calls wtimeout with the value saved for a window in the last call to dlg_set_timeout.

   dlg_restore_vars
       Restore dialog's variables from the given variable (see dialog_save_vars).

       DIALOG_VARS * save
            is the variable from which to restore.

       The DIALOG_VARS.input_length and DIALOG_VARS.input_result members are treated specially, since these are used by a widget to pass data to the caller.  They are not modified by this function.

   dlg_result_key
       Test  a  dialog  internal  keycode  to  see if it corresponds to one of the push buttons on the widget such as “OK”.  This is only useful if there are user-defined key bindings, since there are no
       built-in bindings that map directly to DLGK_OK, etc.  Return true if a mapping was done.

       int dialog_key
            is the dialog key to test

       int fkey
            is true if this is a function key

       int * resultp
            store the result of the mapping in the referenced location.

   dlg_save_vars
       Save dialog's variables into the given variable (see dlg_restore_vars).

            is the window on which to place focus (usually a subwindow of a widget)

   dlg_set_result
       Setup a fixed-buffer for the result in dialog_vars.input_result

       const char * string
            is the new contents for the result

   dlg_set_timeout
       Calls wtimeout to establish a preferred timeout for nonblocking reads, e.g., to allow the gauge widget to handle window-resizing events.  The dlg_may_resize  function  temporarily  overrides  this
       value, to allow it to skip over the error codes returned while the ncurses library processes window-resizing events.  It restores the value established in this call by calling dlg_restore_timeout.

       WINDOW * win
            is the window whose input-timeout should be set

       bool will_getc
            is true if the widget is expected to read keyboard characters.  Some (such as the gauge widget) do not.

   dlg_show_string
       Displays the string, shifted as necessary, to fit within the box and show the current character-offset.

       WINDOW * win
            is the window within which to display

       int x_last
            number of columns on screen

       bool hidden
            if true, do not echo input

       bool force
            if true, force repaint

   dlg_strclone
       duplicate the string, like strdup.

       const char * cprompt
            is the string to duplicate

   dlg_strcmp
       compare two strings, ignoring case.

       const char * a
            is one string

       const char * b
            is the other string

   dlg_string_to_argv
       Convert a string to an argument vector returning an index (which must be freed by the caller).  The string is modified:

       •   Blanks between arguments are replaced by nulls.

       •   Normally arguments are separated by blanks; however you can double-quote an argument to enclose blanks.  The surrounding double-quotes are removed from the string.

       •   A backslash preceding a double-quote within double-quotes is removed.

       •   A backslash preceding a newline outside double-quotes is removed.

       •   Except for special cases, backslashes are preserved in the strings, since other dialog functions interpret backslashes, e.g., for colors.

       char *blob
            is the string to convert.

   dlg_sub_window
       create a subwindow, e.g., for an input area of a widget

       WINDOW * win
            is the parent window

       int height
            is the subwindow's height

       int width
            is the subwindow's width

       int y
            is the subwindow's top-row

       int x
            is the subwindow's left-column

   dlg_tab_correct_str
       If the dialog_vars.tab_correct is true, convert tabs to single spaces.  Return the converted result.  The caller is responsible for freeing the string.

       char * prompt
            is the string to convert

   dlg_trace
       If the parameter is non-null, opens a trace file with that name and stores the file pointer in dialog_state.trace.

   dlg_trace_2n
       logs a numeric value as a comment.

       char * name
            is the name to log in the comment.

       int value
            is the value to log in the comment.

   dlg_trace_2s
       logs a string value as a comment.  If the value contains embedded newlines, the comment is continued with “#+” markers.

       char * name
            is the name to log in the comment.

       int value
            is the value to log in the comment.

   dlg_trace_chr
       If dialog_state.trace is set, translate the parameters into a printable representation, log it on a “chr” line.

       int ch
            is the nominal keycode value.

       int fkey
            is nonzero if the value is really a function key.  Some of these may be values declared in the DLG_KEYS_ENUM.

   dlg_trace_msg
       Write a formatted message to the trace file.

       const char * fmt
            is the format of the printf-like message to write.

       ...
            are the variables to apply to the fmt format.

       Use the DLG_TRACE macro for portability, in case the trace feature is not compiled into the library.  It uses an extra level of parentheses to work with a variable number of parameters, e.g.,

              DLG_TRACE(("this is dialog version %s\n", dialog_version()));

   dlg_trace_va_msg
       Write a formatted message to the trace file.

       const char *fmt
            is the format of the printf-like message to write.

       va_list ap
            are the variables to apply to the fmt format.

       This is used in dlg_exiterr to capture error messages in the trace file:

              va_start(ap, fmt);
              dlg_trace_msg("## Error: ");
              dlg_trace_va_msg(fmt, ap);
              va_end(ap);

       Unlike dlg_trace_msg, an extra macro is not needed.

   dlg_ttysize
       Returns the screensize without using curses.  That allows the function to be used before initializing the screen.

   dlg_trace_win
       If dialog_state.trace is set, log a printable picture of the given window.

   dlg_treeview
       This is an alternate interface to 'treeview' which allows the application to read the list item states back directly without putting them in the output buffer.

       const char * title
            is the title on the top of the widget.

       const char * cprompt
            is the prompt text shown within the widget.

       int height
            is the desired height of the box.  If zero, the height is based on the screen size.

       int width
            is the desired width of the box.  If zero, the height is based on the screen size.

       int list_height
            is the minimum height to reserve for displaying the list.  If zero, it is computed based on the given height and width.

       int item_no
            is the number of rows in items.

       DIALOG_LISTITEM * items
            is the list of items, contain tag, name, and optionally help strings (if dialog_vars.item_help is set).  The initial selection state for each item is also in this list.

       const char * states
            This  is  a list of characters to display for the given states.  Normally a buildlist provides true (1) and false (0) values, which the widget displays as "*" and space, respectively.  An ap‐
            plication may set this parameter to an arbitrary null-terminated string.  The widget determines the number of states from the length of this string, and will cycle through  the  corresponding
            display characters as the user presses the space-bar.

       int * depths
            This is a list of depths of each item in the tree.  It is a separate parameter from items to allow reuse of the existing functions.

       int flag
            is either FLAG_CHECK, for checklists (multiple selections), or FLAG_RADIO for radiolists (a single selection).

       int * current_item
            The widget sets the referenced location to the index of the current display item (cursor) when it returns.

   dlg_trim_string
       The  dialog  program uses this in each widget to adjust the message string, which may contain the newline character (referred to as '\n') and/or the special substring "\n" (which can be translated
       into a newline character).

       There are several optional features:

       •   Unless dialog_vars.nocollapse is set, each tab is converted to a space before other processing.

       •   If dialog_vars.no_nl_expand is not set, and the string has "\n" substrings:

           •   The function changes embedded "\n" substrings to '\n' characters.

               The function preserves extra spaces after these substitutions.  For instance, spaces following a newline (substring or character) are preserved to use as an indentation.

           •   If dialog_vars.cr_wrap is set, the function preserves '\n' newline characters.  Otherwise, each '\n' newline character is converted to a space.

       •   Otherwise, if dialog_vars.trim_whitespace is set:

           •   This function strips all extra spaces to simplify justification.

           •   If dialog_vars.cr_wrap is set, the function preserves '\n' newline characters.  Otherwise, each '\n' newline character is converted to a space.

       •   Finally (if dialog_vars.no_nl_expand is set, or the string does not contain "\n" substrings, and dialog_vars.trim_whitespace is not set):

           •   Unless dialog_vars.nocollapse is set, sequences of spaces are reduced to a single space.

       char * src
            is the string to trim

   dlg_unregister_window
       Remove the bindings for a given window.

       WINDOW * win
            is the window from which to remove bindings

   dlg_update_gauge
       Update a gauge widget to show a different percentage value.

       void *objptr
            points to the gauge object to update.

       int percent
            is the new percentage value to display.

   dlg_will_resize
       This filters out bursts of KEY_RESIZE values.  Call this after dlg_getc returns KEY_RESIZE, to improve performance.

   dlg_yes_buttoncode
       Map the given button index for dlg_yes_labels into dialog's exit-code.

       int button
            is the button index

   dlg_yes_labels
       Return a list of buttons for Yes/No labels.

   end_dialog
       End use of dialog functions.

   init_dialog
       Do some initialization for dialog.

       FILE *input
            is the real tty input of dialog.  Usually it is the standard input, but if --input-fd option is used, it may be anything.

       FILE *output
            is where dialog will send its result.  Usually it is the standard error, but if --stdout or --output-fd is used, it may be anything.
