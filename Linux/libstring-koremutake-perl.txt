NAME
       String::Koremutake - Convert to/from Koremutake Memorable Random Strings

SYNOPSIS
         use String::Koremutake;
         my $k = String::Koremutake->new;

         my $s = $k->integer_to_koremutake(65535);        # botretre
         my $i = $k->koremutake_to_integer('koremutake'); # 10610353957

DESCRIPTION
       The String::Koremutake module converts to and from Koremutake Memorable Random Strings.

       The term "Memorable Random String" was thought up by Sean B. Palmer as a name for those strings like dopynl, glargen, glonknic, spoopwiddle, and kebble etc. that don't have any conventional sense,
       but can be used as random identifiers, especially in URIs to keep them persistent. See http://infomesh.net/2001/07/MeRS/

       Koremutake is a MeRS algorithm which is used by Shorl (http://shorl.com/koremutake.php). As they explain: "It is, in plain language, a way to express any large number as a sequence of syllables.
       The general idea is that word-sounding pieces of information are a lot easier to remember than a sequence of digits."

INTERFACE
   new()
       The new() method is the constructor:

   integer_to_koremutake($i)
       The integer_to_koremutake method converts a positive integer to a Koremutake string:

         my $s = $k->integer_to_koremutake(65535);        # botretre

   koremutake_to_integer($s)
       The koremutake_to_integer method converts a Koremutake string to the integer it represents:

         my $i = $k->koremutake_to_integer('koremutake'); # 10610353957

CAVEATS
       You need to "use bigint;" if you want String::Koremutake to work with integers larger than what fits into a normal Perl integer before it gets converted to a floating point number on your
       platform.

   Example
       Without "use bigint;" big integers get converted to fixed precision floating point numbers:

         $ perl -MString::Koremutake -le '
           my $a = 65536**4;
           my $k = String::Koremutake->new;
           foreach my $b ($a, $a+1, $a+2, $a+3) {
             print "$b: ".$k->integer_to_koremutake($b);
           }'
         1.84467440737096e+19: bibababababababababa
         1.84467440737096e+19: bibababababababababa
         1.84467440737096e+19: bibababababababababa
         1.84467440737096e+19: bibababababababababa

       If you use that large integers, you should add "use bigint;" to your program which solves that issue:

         $ perl -Mbigint -MString::Koremutake -le '
           my $a = 65536**4;
           my $k = String::Koremutake->new;
           foreach my $b ($a, $a+1, $a+2, $a+3) {
             print "$b: ".$k->integer_to_koremutake($b);
           }'
         18446744073709551616: bibababababababababa
         18446744073709551617: bibababababababababe
         18446744073709551618: bibababababababababi
         18446744073709551619: bibababababababababo

       It will likely save you from other issues with big integers, too.

       Note that "foreach my $b ($a .. $a+3)" doesn't work either as the ".."  operator can't be overloaded. See CAVEATS in "perldoc bigint" for details.
