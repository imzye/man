NAME
       qsexec  -  parses  the data received via stdin and executes the defined
       command on a pattern match.

SYNOPSIS
       qsexec  -e  <pattern>  [-t  <number>:<sec>]  [-c  <pattern>   [<command
       string>]] [-p] [-u <user>] <command string>

DESCRIPTION
       qsexec reads log lines from stdin and searches for the defined pattern.
       It executes the defined command string on pattern match.

OPTIONS
       -e <pattern>
              Specifes the search pattern causing an event which shall trigger
              the command.

       -t <number>:<sec>
              Defines  the number of pattern match within the the defined num‐
              ber of seconds in order to trigger  the  command  execution.  By
              default, every pattern match causes a command execution.

       -c <pattern> [<command string>]
              Pattern  which  clears  the event counter. Executes optionally a
              command if an event command has been executed before.

       -p     Writes data also to stdout (for piped logging).

       -u <name>
              Become another user, e.g. www-data.

       <command string>
              Defines the event command string where $0-$9 are substituted  by
              the submatches of the regular expression.

EXAMPLE
       Executes  the  deny.sh  script  providing  the IP address of the client
       causing a mod_qos(031) messages whenever the  log  message  appears  10
       times within at most one minute:
         ErrorLog        "|/usr/bin/qsexec        -e       \'mod_qos\(031\).*,
       c=([0-9a-zA-Z:.]*)\' -t 10:60 \'/usr/local/bin/deny.sh $1\'"
