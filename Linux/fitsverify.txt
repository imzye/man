NAME
       fitsverify - Test if the input file(s) conform to the FITS format

SYNOPSIS
       fitsverify filename ...

       fitsverify @filelist.txt

DESCRIPTION
       This  task  reads one or more input FITS files and verifies that the files conform to the specifications of the FITS Standard document (known as the NASA/Science Office of Standards and Tech‐
       nology 'Definition of the Current  FITS Standard', document number, NOST 100-2.0, available online  at https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/).  The input filename template may contain wildcard  charac‐
       ters,  in which case all matching files will be tested.  Alternatively, the name of an ASCII text file containing a list of file names, one per line, may be entered preceded by an '@' charac‐
       ter.

OPTIONS
       -H     test ESO HIERARCH keywords

       -l     list all header keywords

       -q     quiet; print one-line pass/fail summary per file

       -e     only test for error conditions; don't issue warnings

       -h     Help
