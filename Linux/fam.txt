FAM.CONF(5)                                                                      SGI                                                                     FAM.CONF(5)

NAME
       fam.conf - The File Alteration Monitor (FAM) configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       In  addition  to its command line options, famd's behavior can also be controlled through its configuration file.  By default, this is /etc/fam.conf.  The -c
       command line option can be used to specify an alternate file.

FILE FORMAT
       Configuration lines are in the format option=value.  Lines beginning with # or ! are ignored.  famd recognizes the following options:

       insecure_compatibility    If set to true, this disables authentication and reduces access security as described under SECURITY below.  This is false  by  de‐
                                 fault.  Setting this option to true is the same as using the -C command line option.

       untrusted_user            This  is  the  user  name or UID of the user account which famd will use for unauthenticated clients.  If a file can't be stated by
                                 this user, famd will not tell unauthenticated clients about the file's existence.  If an untrusted user is not given in the config‐
                                 uration file, famd will write an error message to the system log and terminate.

       local_only                If set to true, famd will ignore requests from remote famds.  This is false by default.  Setting this option to true is the same as
                                 using the -L command line option.  This option is ignored if famd is started by inetd.

       idle_timeout              This is the time in seconds that famd will wait before exiting after its last client disconnects.  The default is 5 seconds.   This
                                 option is overridden by the -T command line option.

       nfs_polling_interval      This is the interval in seconds between polling files over an NFS filesystem.  The default is 6 seconds.  This option is overridden
                                 by the -t command line option.

       xtab_verification         If set to true, famd will check the list of exported filesystems when remote requests are received to verify that the requests fall
                                 on  filesystems  which  are  exported to the requesting hosts.  This is true by default.  If this option is set to false, famd will
                                 service remote requests without attempting to perform the verification.  If the local_only configuration option or -L command  line
                                 option is used, xtab_verification has no effect.

       detect_readonly_filesystems
                                 If  set to true, famd will try to detect read-only filesystems.  Such filesystems are assumed to never change. This is false by de‐
                                 fault.  Setting this option to true is the same as using the -r command line option.
