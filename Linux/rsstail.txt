NAME
       rsstail - a console RSS reader that monitors feeds and outputs new entries

SYNOPSIS
       rsstail [OPTIONS]... -u URL

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       rsstail fetches RSS feeds from specified URLs and outputs them continuously, much like tail -f does with files.

OPTIONS
       Options can be given in any order. Options that don't have an argument can be combined after a single dash.
