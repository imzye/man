NAME
       ibsim-run - run programs in an ibsim-simulated envronment

SYNOPSIS
       ibsim-run [<command>]

DESCRIPTION
       The package ibsim simulates calls to the umad library (of the Infiniband user-space stack).

       In order to use it, you should run ibsim(1), that gets a network diagram.  Programs that have libumad2sim.so loaded, override the calls to libumad with calls to the ibsim simulator.

       This is a script that runs commands with libumad2sim.so already LD_PRELOAD-ed.

OPTIONS
       The script will manipulate the environment and then run the rest of the command line in that environment. If no command was given, it will run bash.

       However the following options are supported:

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options and exit.

EXAMPLES
         ibsim -s path/to/net-examples/net.2sw2path4hca

       And in a separate shell:

         ibsim-run ibdiscover
