NAME
       freecad - Extensible Open Source CAx program

SYNOPSIS
       freecad [options] files

DESCRIPTION
       FreeCAD is an Open Source CAx RAD based on OpenCasCade, Qt and Python. It features some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches, ability to run as a server and dynamically loadable applica‐
       tion extensions and it is designed to be platform independent.
