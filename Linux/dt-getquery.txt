NAME
       dt-getquery - command-line test program for the val_res_query()
       function

SYNOPSIS
          dt-getquery [options] name

DESCRIPTION
       This utility is a command-line wrapper around the val_res_query()
       function.  It invokes the val_res_query() function with the given
       command-line arguments and displays the returned data as a DNS-style
       response.  It also displays the validation status value for the records
       returned for the query.

       The exit status for this program is 1 if the answer received is
       trusted, 2 if the answer received is validated, and -1 for an error.
       The program returns 0 if the result was neither trusted nor validated.
       The trusted and validated status values are obtained using the
       val_istrusted() and val_isvalidated() functions from libval(3).
