NAME
       autopkgtest-virt-lxd - autopkgtest virtualisation server using LXD

SYNOPSIS
       autopkgtest [...] -- lxd [options] image [-- extra lxc launch args...]

DESCRIPTION
       autopkgtest-virt-lxd provides an autopkgtest virtualisation server using LXD. It creates temporary containers from the given LXD image name.

       Normally autopkgtest-virt-lxd will be invoked by autopkgtest.

REQUIREMENTS
       autopkgtest-virt-lxd makes no strict assumptions about the image. However, it is highly recommended that the image has eatmydata installed, or at least that gets installed via setup commands.

       For  production use, it is recommended to use autopkgtest-build-lxd(1) to generate an optimized image with autopkgtest's standard setup commands applied. Then these setup commands don't need to be ap‐
       plied for every test.  This is particularly necessary if you want to use --apt-source tests, i. e. use apt-get source in the test bed to download the package to test. Standard  images  from  linuxcon‐
       tainers.org do not have "deb-src" apt sources by default.

OPTIONS
       -r remote | --remote=remote
              Run container on given remote host instead of locally. See lxc remote list for available remotes.

       -d | --debug
              Enables debugging output.

       You can pass additional options to lxd launch: Anything after a -- gets appended verbatim to lxc launch image.

INPUT, OUTPUT AND EXIT STATUS
       The behaviour of autopkgtest-virt-lxd is as described by the AutomatedTesting virtualisation regime specification.

EXAMPLE
       Show available images on the standard linuxcontainers.org remote image server:

              lxc image list images:

       Run the tests of a local built directory tree on the current Debian sid image from the above images: remote:

              autopkgtest my-package/ -- lxd images:debian/sid/amd64

       Run the tests in a local built directory tree from a local LXD image desktop/i386, ensuring that eatmydata is installed:

              autopkgtest --setup-commands 'apt-get install -y eatmydata' dir/to/test/ \
                -- lxd desktop/i386

       Run the tests of the gdk-pixbuf package on the current Debian sid image from the images: remote on a remote armhf host:

              lxc remote add armhf-test http://armhf.testlab.example.com:8443
              autopkgtest --setup-commands=setup-testbed gdk-pixbuf -- \
                 lxd --remote armhf-test images:debian/sid/armhf

       Build a local image with standard setup commands pre-applied from a remote standard image, and run gdk-pixbuf test in it:

              autopkgtest-build-lxd images:ubuntu/xenial/amd64
              autopkgtest gdk-pixbuf -- lxd autopkgtest/ubuntu/xenial/amd64
