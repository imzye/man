NAME
       inotifywait, fsnotifywait - wait for changes to files using inotify or fanotify

SYNOPSIS
       inotifywait [-hcmrPqIFS] [-e <event> ] [-t <seconds> ] [--format <fmt> ] [--timefmt <fmt> ] <file> [ ... ]

       fsnotifywait [-hcmrPqIFS] [-e <event> ] [-t <seconds> ] [--format <fmt> ] [--timefmt <fmt> ] <file> [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       inotifywait  efficiently  waits for changes to files using Linux's inotify(7) interface by default.  It is suitable for waiting for changes to files from shell scripts.  It can either exit once an
       event occurs, or continually execute and output events as they occur.

       fsnotifywait is similar to inotifywait but it is using Linux's fanotify(7) interface by default. If explicitly specified, it uses the inotify(7) interface.

OUTPUT
       inotifywait and fsnotifywait will output diagnostic information on standard error and event information on standard output.  The event output can be configured, but by default it consists of lines
       of the following form:

       watched_filename EVENT_NAMES event_filename

       watched_filename
              is the name of the file on which the event occurred.  If the file is a directory, a trailing slash is output.

       EVENT_NAMES
              are the names of the inotify events which occurred, separated by commas.

       event_filename
              is output only when the event occurred on a directory, and in this case the name of the file within the directory which caused this event is output.

              By default, any special characters in filenames are not escaped in any way.  This can make the output of inotifywait difficult to parse in awk scripts or similar.  The  --csv  and  --format
              options will be helpful in this case.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output some helpful usage information.

       @<file>
              When  watching  a  directory tree recursively, exclude the specified file from being watched.  The file must be specified with a relative or absolute path according to whether a relative or
              absolute path is given for watched directories.  If a specific path is explicitly both included and excluded, it will always be watched.

              Note: If you need to watch a directory or file whose name starts with @, give the absolute path.

       --fromfile <file>
              Read filenames to watch or exclude from a file, one filename per line.  If filenames begin with @ they are excluded as described above.  If <file> is `-', filenames are read  from  standard
              input.  Use this option if you need to watch too many files to pass in as command line arguments.

       -m, --monitor
              Instead of exiting after receiving a single event, execute indefinitely.  The default behaviour is to exit after the first event occurs.

       -d, --daemon
              Same as --monitor, except run in the background logging events to a file that must be specified by --outfile. Implies --syslog.

       -o, --outfile <file>
              Output events to <file> rather than stdout.

       -s, --syslog
              Output errors to syslog(3) system log module rather than stderr.

       -P, --no-dereference
              Do not follow symlinks.

       -r, --recursive
              Watch  all subdirectories of any directories passed as arguments.  Watches will be set up recursively to an unlimited depth.  Symbolic links are not traversed.  Newly created subdirectories
              will also be watched.

              Warning: If you use this option while watching the root directory of a large tree, it may take quite a while until all inotify watches are established, and events will not  be  received  in
              this  time.   Also, since one inotify watch will be established per subdirectory, it is possible that the maximum amount of inotify watches per user will be reached.  The default maximum is
              8192; it can be increased by writing to /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches.

       -q, --quiet
              If specified once, the program will be less verbose.  Specifically, it will not state when it has completed establishing all inotify watches.

              If specified twice, the program will output nothing at all, except in the case of fatal errors.

       --exclude <pattern>
              Do not process any events for the subset of files whose filenames match the specified POSIX regular expression, case sensitive.

       --excludei <pattern>
              Do not process any events for the subset of files whose filenames match the specified POSIX regular expression, case insensitive.

       --include <pattern>
              Process events only for the subset of files whose filenames match the specified POSIX regular expression, case sensitive.  When used with --recursive, events will  still  be  generated  for
              matching files inside newly created directories, even if the directory names themselves do not match the pattern.

       --includei <pattern>
              Process events only for the subset of files whose filenames match the specified POSIX regular expression, case insensitive.

       -t <seconds>, --timeout <seconds>
              Exit if an appropriate event has not occurred within <seconds> seconds. If <seconds> is zero (the default), wait indefinitely for an event.

       -e <event>, --event <event>
              Listen for specific event(s) only.  The events which can be listened for are listed in the EVENTS section.  This option can be specified more than once.  If omitted, all events are listened
              for.

       -c, --csv
              Output in CSV (comma-separated values) format.  This is useful when filenames may contain spaces, since in this case it is not safe to simply split the output at each space character.

       --timefmt <fmt>
              Set a time format string as accepted by strftime(3) for use with the `%T' conversion in the --format option.

       --no-newline
              Don't print newline symbol after user-specified format in the --format option.

       --format <fmt>
              Output in a user-specified format, using printf-like syntax.  The event strings output are limited to around 4000 characters and will be truncated to this length.  The following conversions
              are supported:

       %w     This  will  be  replaced with the name of the Watched file on which an event occurred.  When an event occurs within a Watched directory or when watching with fanotify, this will be replaced
              with the name of the Directory in which the event occurred.

       %f     When an event occurs within a Watched directory or when watching with fanotify, this will be replaced with the name of the File which caused the event to occur.  Otherwise, this will be re‐
              placed with an empty string.

       %e     Replaced with the Event(s) which occurred, comma-separated.

       %Xe    Replaced with the Event(s) which occurred, separated by whichever character is in the place of `X'.

       %T     Replaced with the current Time in the format specified by the --timefmt option, which should be a format string suitable for passing to strftime(3).

       %0     Replaced with NUL.

       %n     Replaced with Line Feed.

       -I, --inotify
              Watch using inotify (default for inotifywait).

       -F, --fanotify
              Watch using fanotify (default for fsnotifywait).  fanotify support for reporting events with inotify compatible information was added in kernel v5.9.  With older kernels  the  command  will
              fail.  As of kernel v5.12, fanotify requires admin privileges.

       -S, --filesystem
              Watch entire filesystem of any directories passed as arguments using fanotify.

EXIT STATUS
       0      The program executed successfully, and an event occurred which was being listened for.

       1      An  error  occurred  in execution of the program, or an event occurred which was not being listened for.  The latter generally occurs if something happens which forcibly removes the inotify
              watch, such as a watched file being deleted or the filesystem containing a watched file being unmounted.

       2      The -t option was used and an event did not occur in the specified interval of time.

EVENTS
       The following events are valid for use with the -e option:

       access A watched file or a file within a watched directory was read from.

       modify A watched file or a file within a watched directory was written to.

       attrib The metadata of a watched file or a file within a watched directory was modified.  This includes timestamps, file permissions, extended attributes etc.

       close_write
              A watched file or a file within a watched directory was closed, after being opened in writable mode.  This does not necessarily imply the file was written to.

       close_nowrite
              A watched file or a file within a watched directory was closed, after being opened in read-only mode.

       close  A watched file or a file within a watched directory was closed, regardless of how it was opened.  Note that this is actually  implemented  simply  by  listening  for  both  close_write  and
              close_nowrite, hence all close events received will be output as one of these, not CLOSE.

       open   A watched file or a file within a watched directory was opened.

       moved_to
              A file or directory was moved into a watched directory.  This event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the same directory.

       moved_from
              A file or directory was moved from a watched directory.  This event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the same directory.

       move   A  file  or  directory was moved from or to a watched directory.  Note that this is actually implemented simply by listening for both moved_to and moved_from, hence all move events received
              will be output as one or both of these, not MOVE.

       move_self
              A watched file or directory was moved. After this event, the file or directory is no longer being watched.

       create A file or directory was created within a watched directory.

       delete A file or directory within a watched directory was deleted.

       delete_self
              A watched file or directory was deleted.  After this event the file or directory is no longer being watched.  Note that this event can occur even if it is not explicitly being listened for.

       unmount
              The filesystem on which a watched file or directory resides was unmounted.  After this event the file or directory is no longer being watched.  Note that this event can occur even if it  is
              not explicitly being listened to.

EXAMPLES
   Example 1
       Running inotifywait at the command-line to wait for any file in the `test' directory to be accessed.  After running inotifywait, `cat test/foo' is run in a separate console.

       % inotifywait test
       Setting up watches.
       Watches established.
       test/ ACCESS foo

   Example 2
       A short shell script to efficiently wait for httpd-related log messages and do something appropriate.

       #!/bin/sh
       while ! inotifywait -e modify /var/log/messages; do
         if tail -n1 /var/log/messages | grep httpd; then
           kdialog --msgbox "Apache needs love!"
         fi
       done

   Example 3
       A custom output format is used to watch `~/test'.  Meanwhile, someone runs `touch ~/test/badfile; touch ~/test/goodfile; rm ~/test/badfile' in another console.

       % inotifywait -m -r --format '%:e %f' ~/test
       Setting up watches.  Beware: since -r was given, this may take a while!
       Watches established.
       CREATE badfile
       OPEN badfile
       ATTRIB badfile
       CLOSE_WRITE:CLOSE badfile
       CREATE goodfile
       OPEN goodfile
       ATTRIB goodfile
       CLOSE_WRITE:CLOSE goodfile
       DELETE badfile

   Example 4
       Enforce file permissions in directory `~/test'

       inotifywait -qmr -e 'moved_to,create' --format '%w%f%0' --no-newline ~/test |\
           while IFS= read -r -d '' file
           do
              chmod -v a+rX "$file"
           done

CAVEATS
       When  using  inotifywait,  the filename that is outputted is not guaranteed to be up to date after a move because it is the inode that is being monitored. Additionally, none of the observed opera‐
       tions are guaranteed to have been performed on the filename inotifywait was instructed to monitor in cases when the file is known by several names in the filesystem.

BUGS
       There are race conditions in the recursive directory watching code which can cause events to be missed if they occur in a directory immediately after that directory is created.  This  is  probably
       not fixable.

       It is assumed the inotify event queue will never overflow.
