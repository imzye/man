NAME
       Mail::SRS::Daemon - modular daemon for Mail::SRS

SYNOPSIS
       my $daemon = new Mail::SRS::Daemon(      SecretFile  => $secretfile,      Separator   => $separator,           ); $daemon->run();

DESCRIPTION
       The SRS daemon listens on a socket for SRS address transformation requests. It transforms the addresses and returns the new addresses on the socket.

       It may be invoked from exim using ${readsocket ...}, and probably from other MTAs as well. See http://www.anarres.org/projects/srs/ for examples.

METHODS
   $daemon = new Mail::SRS::Daemon(...)
       Construct a new Mail::SRS object and return it.  All parameters which are valid for Mail::SRS are also valid for Mail::SRS::Daemon and will be passed to the constructor of Mail::SRS verbatim. The
       exception to this rule is the Secret parameter, which will be promoted to a list and will have all secrets from SecretFile included. New parameters are documented here. See Mail::SRS for the rest.

       SecretFile => $string
           A  file to read for secrets. Secrets are specified once per line. The first specified secret is used for encoding. Secrets are written one per line. Blank lines and lines starting with a # are
           ignored.  If Secret is not given, then the secret file must be nonempty.

           Secret will specify a primary secret and override SecretFile if both are specified. However, secrets read from SecretFile still be used for decoding if both are specified.

       Socket => $socket
           An instance of IO::Socket, presumed to be a listening socket. This may be provided in order to use a preexisting socket, rather than have Mail::SRS::Daemon construct a new socket.

   $daemon->run()
       Run the daemon. This method will never return. Errors and exceptions are caught, and error messages are returned down the socket.

EXPORTS
       Given :all, this module exports the following variables.

       $SRSSOCKET
           The filename of the default socket created by Mail::SRS::Daemon.

PROTOCOL
       The daemon waits for a single line of text from the client, and will respond with a single line. The lines are all of the form "COMMAND args...". Currently, two commands are supported: forward and
       reverse.

       A forward request looks like:

               FORWARD sender@source.com alias@forwarder.com

       A reverse request looks like:

               REVERSE srs0+HHH=TT=domain=local-part@forwarder.com

       In either case, the daemon will respond with either a translated address, or a line starting "ERROR ", followed by a message.

TODO
       Add more daemon-related options, such as path to socket, or inet socket address.
