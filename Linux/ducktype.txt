NAME
       ducktype - convert Mallard Ducktype to Mallard XML

SYNOPSIS
       ducktype [--output=OUTPUT|-o OUTPUT] INPUT ...

DESCRIPTION
       The ducktype(1) tool converts Mallard Ducktype, a lightweight markup language for topic-oriented help, into Mallard XML.

OPTIONS
       --output=OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
              Set  the  output  file or directory name. The default is to take each input pathname, remove any .duck suffix and append .page. If there is exactly one input file, OUTPUT may be a filename.
              Otherwise, OUTPUT must be a directory name, and files will be created in that directory instead of in the same directory as the input.
