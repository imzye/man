         });

METHODS
   new
       die_on_unescaped
           This value, if set to a true value, causes the process to throw an exception upon encountering a value that was not explicitly set to be escaped or was marked as a raw value.

           default is HTML

       method_for_escape
           The default method to escape a value explicitly (mostly useful with "die_on_unescaped" .

       method_for_raw
           default is raw, you can get not escaped value from [% value.raw %]

       escape_method
             my $tt = Template->new({
               STASH => Template::Stash::AutoEscaping->new({
                   escape_method => sub { my $text = shift; ... ; return $text }
               })
             });

       ignore_escape

DESCRIPTION
       Template::Stash::AutoEscaping is a sub class of Template::Stash, automatically escape all HTML strings and avoid XSS vulnerability.

CONFIGURE
       $Template::Stash::AutoEscaping::ESCAPE_ARGS
            default is 0. for example "key of hash" or "args of vmethods" are not escaped. I think this is good in most cases.
            [% hash.${key} %] [% hash.item(key) %] means [% hash.${key.raw} | html %] [% hash.item(key.raw) | html %] by default.
