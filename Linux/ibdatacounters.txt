       ibdatacounters [-h] [-b] [-v] [-N | -nocolor] [<topology-file> | -C ca_name -P ca_port -t(imeout) timeout_ms]

DESCRIPTION
       ibdatacounters is a script which uses a full topology file that was created by ibnetdiscover, scans the network to validate the connectivity and reports the data counters (from port counters).

OPTIONS
       -v   increase the verbosity level

       -b   brief mode. Reduce the output to show only if errors are present,
            not what they are.

       -N | -nocolor  use mono rather than color mode

       -C <ca_name>    use the specified ca_name.

       -P <ca_port>    use the specified ca_port.

       -t <timeout_ms> override the default timeout for the solicited mads.
