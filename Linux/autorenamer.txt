SYNOPSIS
       autorenamer

DESCRIPTION
       autorenamer  is  an  interactive graphical user interface program. It displays contents of a directory using icons that you can reorder using drag-and-drop.  Once you are done, the program renames
       the files such that their alphabetical ordering is the same as the order you chose.

       If any entries are selected when "Save" is clicked, only the selected entries are renamed. Otherwise all the entries in the directory are renamed.
