NAME
       unixODBC - An ODBC implementation for Unix

DESCRIPTION
       ODBC is an open specification providing application developers with a predictable API with which to access data sources. Data sources include SQL servers and any data source with an ODBC driver.

       The unixODBC project goals are to develop and promote unixODBC as the definitive standard for ODBC on non-Windows platforms.

       The HTML-formatted "Administrator Manual" shipped with unixODBC provides additional details on configuration and usage to supplement these man pages.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       ODBCSYSINI
              Sets the full path to the directory containing the unixODBC configuration files. By default, this is '/etc'.

       ODBCINSTINI
              Sets the name of the unixODBC driver configuration file. The file name is relative to ODBCSYSINI and is set by default to 'odbcinst.ini'.

       ODBCINI
              Sets the full path to the system-wide unixODBC configuration file containing Data Source Names (DSNs). By default, this is set to '/etc/odbc.ini'.

       ODBCINSTUI
              Sets  the  library  name for the UI. The final name that is searched for is evaluated as "lib$ODBCINSTUI". By default, this variable is set to 'odbcinstQ4', so the resulting library name is
              'libodbcinstQ4'.

       ODBCSEARCH
              Sets the configuration mode and determines where to look for configuration files. This variable must be set to one of ODBC_SYSTEM_DSN, ODBC_USER_DSN or ODBC_BOTH_DSN, which is  the  default
              value.
