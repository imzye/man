NAME
       pilot-read-ical - Exports the DatebookDB and/or ToDo applications to ical format.

SECTION
       pilot-link: Userland conduits

SYNOPSIS
        pilot-read-ical [-p|--port <port>] [--version] [-?|--help] [-q|--quiet] [--usage] [-d|--datebook] [-t|--pubtext  pubtext] [-f|--file  file]

DESCRIPTION
       Note, this is not the same as the iCal calendar format.

        pilot-read-ical allows the user to retrieve the contents of the ToDo and Datebook databases on a Palm handheld, and convert their contents to an Ical calendar.

       Note that the calendar file named by filename will be deleted, so do not use your main calendar. Instead, use a separate one for this purpose, and include it in your main calendar.

       As pilot-read-ical works by passing a script to ical, the ical application must be in your $PATH.

OPTIONS
   pilot-read-ical options
                               -d, --datebook

       Datebook only, no ToDos

                               -t,
                               --pubtext pubtext

       Replace text of items not started with a bullet with pubtext

                               --file file

       This is the file in which the ical-formatted data should be saved. Note that this will be deleted, so do not use your primary calendar file. See DESCRIPTION for details.
