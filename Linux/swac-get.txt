       swac-get  [-t]  [clear] [update] | [upgrade] | [select <url|packid>] | [deselect <url|packid>] | [list] | [list-sources] | [list-available] | [sql <query>] |

DESCRIPTION
       Swac-get is a simple command line program which allows to download and install audio collections of words (SWAC) in a SQLite3  database.   Audio  collections
       can  be imported from the hard drive or directly from the Internet using the HTTP protocol.  Swac-get is designed to be used with swac-explore, a GTK+ inter‐
       face which allows the browsing of the created SQLite3 database.  An important set of free audio collections of words (SWAC) is available at: http://swac-col‐
       lections.org/

       For more information, please, visit the Shtooka Project homepage at: http://shtooka.net/ .
