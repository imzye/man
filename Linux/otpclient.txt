NAME
       OTPClient - Simple GTK+ software to generate OTPs (TOTP and HOTP)

SYNOPSIS
       otpclient [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       OTPClient is GTK+ software for two-factor authentication that supports both Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) and HMAC-Based One-Time Passwords (HOTP).

       OTPClient have the following features:

       •  Support both TOTP and HOTP.

       •  Support setting custom digits (between 4 and 10 inclusive).

       •  Support setting a custom period (between 10 and 120 seconds inclusive).

       •  Support SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 algorithms.

       •  Support for Steam codes.

       •  Import encrypted Authenticator Plus backup.

       •  Import and export encrypted and/or plain andOTP backup.

       •  Import and export plain FreeOTPPlus backup (key URI format only).

       •  Import and export plain Aegis backup (plain json only).

       •  Local database is encrypted using AES256-GCM.

          •  Key is derived using PBKDF2 with SHA512 and 100k iterations.

          •  Decrypted file is never saved (and hopefully never swapped) to disk. While the app is running, the decrypted content resides in a "secure memory" buffer allocated by Gcrypt.
