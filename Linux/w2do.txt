DESCRIPTION
       w2html is a HTML exporter for w2do, a simple to use yet efficient command-line todo manager written in Perl. All tasks are listed by default, but desired subset can be easily selected via
       specifying options.

OPTIONS
   General Options
       -h, --help
           Display help message and exit.

       -v, --version
           Display version information and exit.

   Specifying Options
       -t task, --task task
           Specify the task name.

       -g group, --group group
           Specify the group name. The group name should be a single word with maximum of 10 characters, but longer names are shortened automatically.

       -d date, --date date
           Specify the due date. Available options are anytime, today, yesterday, tomorrow, month, year, or an exact date in the YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. 2008-06-17 for 17 June 2008.

       -p priority, --priority priority
           Specify the priority. Available options are integers between 1 and 5, where 1 represents the highest priority.

       -f, --finished
           Specify the finished task.

       -u, --unfinished
           Specify the unfinished task.

   Additional Options
       -H heading, --heading heading
           Use selected heading.

       -e encoding, --encoding encoding
           Specify the file encoding in a form recognised by the W3C HTML 4.01 standard (e.g. the default UTF-8).

       -o file, --output file
           Use selected file instead of the standard output.

       -s file, --savefile file
           Use selected file instead of the default "~/.w2do" as a save file.

       -k, --preserve
           Do not rewrite existing style sheet if present (e.g. because it contains some local changes).

       -b, --bare
           Leave out the HTML header and footer. This is especially useful when you are planning to embed the list to another page.

       -B, --no-bare
           Include HTML header and footer; the default option.

       -i, --inline
           Embed the style sheet to the page itself instead of creating a separate CSS file. Note that combining this option with "-b" results in no style sheet at all.

       -I, --no-id
           Do not include ID column in the listing.

       --with-id
           Include ID column in the listing; the default option.

       -D, --no-date
           Do not include due date column in the listing.

       --with-date
           Include due date column in the listing; the default option.

       -P, --no-priority
           Do not include priority column in the listing.

       --with-priority
           Include priority column in the listing; the default option.

       -S, --no-state
           Do not include state column in the listing.

       --with-state
           Include state column in the listing; the default option.

       --with-stats, --stats
           Include overall task list statistics.

       --no-stats
           Do not include overall task list statistics; the default option.

       ~/.w2do
           Default save file.
