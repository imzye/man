NAME
       xml2pot - Creates a PO template file from a DocBook XML file.

SYNOPSIS
       xml2pot [original-XML]

DESCRIPTION
       xml2pot is a command-line tool that produces a gettext message template file from the DocBook XML file original-XML. The template file is sent to standard output.

       The resulting template file can be used to create gettext message files (PO-files) for a variety of languages. These can then be used in conjunction with po2xml(1) to translate the original XML file
       into these other languages.

       This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
