NAME
       puf - http client for parallel downloading

SYNTAX
       puf [options] url [url ...]

DESCRIPTION
       puf is a program similar to GNU wget.  The main difference is that puf tries to download as many urls as possible in parallel.

       The available options vary between different versions.  Simply run `puf -h' to get a list of available options.

SEE ALSO
       ftp(1), lynx(1)

BUGS
       Entries in your /etc/hosts file will confuse the alias detection for the listed hosts.  Workaround: do not use aliases, but only the primary name on the command line.

       When continuing a download, ALL already complete files are scanned for links, as we have no reliable means of detecting the file type.

       Please report bugs to Oswald Buddenhagen <puf@ossi.cjb.net>
