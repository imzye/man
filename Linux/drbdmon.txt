NAME
       drbdmon - Monitor DRBD resources realtime

SYNOPSIS
       drbdmon [options...] [-- [backend-options...]] {command} {context...}

DESCRIPTION
       The drbdmon utility is used for monitoring volumes and connections realtime, as defined in DRBD resource files. See drbd.conf(5) for more information.

OPTIONS
       -d, --dry-run
           Show which commands drbdmon would execute instead of actually executing them (for example, drbdmon -d up resource). This can be a useful way to learn how drbdsetup and drbdmeta are used.

       --ascii
           Use only ascii characters (no Unicode).

       --no-header
           Do not display the drbdmon header line

       --no-hotkeys
           Do not display the hotkeys line.

COMMANDS
       c {device}
           Clear screen.

       r
           Repaint display.

       q
           Quit.
