NAME
       cueprint - report disc and track infomation from a CUE or TOC file

SYNOPSIS
       cueprint  [  {  -i  format  |  --input-format=format  }  {  -n number |
       --track-number=number } { -d template | --disc-template=template } { -t
       template | --track-template=template } ] [ file ... ]
       cueprint -h | --help
       cueprint -V | --version

DESCRIPTION
       cueprint  reports  disc  and  track information from CUE and TOC files,
       which are typically created by compact disc ripping software.

       By default, cueprint reports a default set of disc information,  and  a
       default  set  of information for each track on the disc.  With options,
       the report can be restricted to a specific track, and the  presentation
       of  the  disc and track information can be extensively customized using
       printf(3)-style format strings (referred  to  here  as  ‘templates’  to
       avoid  confusion with the concept of file format).  All characters in a
       template are reproduced as-is in  the  output  except  for  conversions
       (which begin with ‘%’) and escapes (which begin with ‘\’).

       If  no filenames are specified, cueprint reads from standard input, and
       an input format option must be specified.  If one or more filenames  is
       provided,  but the input format option is not specified, the input for‐
       mat will be guessed based on each file's suffix (e.g., .cue  or  .toc).
       This heuristic is case-insensitive.

   Conversions
       A conversion has the form ‘%[flags][width][.precision]type’.

       flags may be zero or more of the following:

       Character     Meaning
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       -             left-justify expansion
       +             place sign before numbers
       ‘ ’ (space)   place a blank space before a positive number
       0             pad numbers with zeroes

       width  is  the minimum field width.  precision is the maximum width for
       strings.  type is a single character  which  specifies  the  conversion
       type — apart from %, it is the only mandatory part of the conversion.

       The  available  conversion types are presented in the table below; disc
       conversion types are presented in the left half of the table, and track
       conversion types in the right half.  Disc template expansion characters
       are valid for both disc and track templates.

       Character   Conversion         Character   Conversion
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       A           album arranger     a           track arranger
       C           album composer     c           track composer
       G           album genre        g           track genre
                                      i           track ISRC
       M           album message      m           track message
       N           number of tracks   n           track number
       P           album performer    p           track performer
       S           album songwriter
       T           album title        t           track title
       U           album UPC/EAN      u           track ISRC (CD-TEXT)

       Any other character used as a conversion type expands to itself.   This
       is how a literal percent sign is placed in the template; i.e., ‘%%’ ex‐
       pands to ‘%’.

   Escapes
       The recognized escapes are all single characters, and listed in the ta‐
       ble below.

       Escape Sequence   Expansion
       ──────────────────────────────────
       \a                alert (bell)
       \b                backspace
       \f                formfeed
       \n                newline
       \r                carriage return
       \t                horizontal tab
       \v                vertical tab
       \0                null

       Any other character used after the ‘\’ in an escape sequence expands to
       itself.  This is how a literal escape character is placed in  the  tem‐
       plate; i.e., ‘\\’ expands to ‘\’.

OPTIONS
       -d template, --disc-template=template
              set disc template (see Conversions )

       -h, --help
              displays a usage message and exits.

       -i format, --input-format=format
              sets  the  expected format of the input file(s) to format, which
              must be either cue or toc.

       -n number, --track-number=number
              only print track information for a single track.  The default is
              to print information for all tracks.

       -t template, --track-template=template
              set track template (see Conversions )

       -V ,  --version
              displays version information and exits.

EXIT STATUS
       cueprint  exits with status zero if it successfully reports information
       from each input file, and nonzero if there were problems.

EXAMPLES
       To display disc and track information (using the default  template  for
       both):

       % cueprint album.cue

       To print the number of tracks in a CUE file:

       % cueprint -d '%N\n' album.cue
