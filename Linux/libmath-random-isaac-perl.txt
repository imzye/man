NAME
       Math::Random::ISAAC::PP - Pure Perl port of the ISAAC PRNG algorithm

VERSION
       version 1.004

SYNOPSIS
       This module implements the same interface as "Math::Random::ISAAC" and can be used as a drop-in replacement. However, it is recommended that you let the "Math::Random::ISAAC" module decide whether
       to use the PurePerl or XS version of this module, instead of choosing manually.

       Selecting the backend to use manually really only has two uses:

       •   If you are trying to avoid the small overhead incurred with dispatching method calls to the appropriate backend modules.

       •   If you are testing the module for performance and wish to explicitly decide which module you would like to use.

       Example code:

         # With Math::Random::ISAAC
         my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC->new(time);
         my $rand = $rng->rand();

         # With Math::Random::ISAAC::PP
         my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC::PP->new(time);
         my $rand = $rng->rand();

       See Math::Random::ISAAC for the full description.
