NAME
       InVesalius - 3D medical imaging reconstruction software

SYNOPSIS
       invesalius3 [-d] [-i <dicom_folder>]

       invesalius3 [-d] [<invesalius_project_file>]

DESCRIPTION
       InVesalius  generates  3D medical imaging reconstructions based on a sequence of 2D DICOM files acquired with CT or MRI equipments. InVesalius is internationalized (currently available in English,
       Portuguese, French, German, Spanish, Greek and Chinese) and provides several tools:

       •   DICOM support including: (a) ACR-NEMA version 1 and 2; (b) DICOM version 3.0 (including various encodings of JPEG - lossless and lossy -, RLE)

       •   Image manipulation features (zoom, pan, rotation, brightness/contrast, etc.)

       •   Segmentation based on 2D slices

       •   Pre-defined threshold ranges according to tissue of interest

       •   Edition tools (similar to Paint Brush) based on 2D slices

       •   3D surface creation

       •   3D surface connectivity tools

       •   3D surface exportation (including: binary STL, OBJ, VRML, Inventor)

       •   High-quality volume rendering projection

       •   Pre-defined volume rendering presets

       •   Volume rendering crop plane

       •   Picture exportation (including: BMP, TIFF, JPG, PostScript, POV-Ray)
