       display CDROM status, and display CDROM directory.  This program may be used as a daemon to control an audio CDROM device.

              -c     Output CR-LF at end of each line, not LF.

       By default, cdctrl opens /dev/cdrom, but does not start playing.  Output is to standard output with each line terminated by a linefeed (LF).

              ?      Display help screen.

              q      Quit.

       Each command results in one or multiple lines of output to stdout, followed by an info string, followed by END.

       The format of the info string is:

       CMD cmd-name cd-status track abs-time rel-time

         cmd-name  := {play, stop, ... quit} from above list
         cd-status := {invalid, play, paused}
         cd-status += {completed, error, no_status}
         track     := {1..99} CD track
         abs-time  := HH:MM:SS elapsed since CD start
         rel-time  := HH:MM:SS elapsed since track start
