NAME
       eegview - GUI program to display and record EEG data

SYNOPSIS
       eegview [--device=devstring] [--ui-file=file] [--version] [--help|-h]
               [GTK+ OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       eegview is a minimal scope to display and record various signal coming
       from a EEG acquisition device and others.

OPTIONS
       --device=devstring
              Specify the acquisition device and its configuration according
              to the format described in eegdev-open-options(5). Beware to
              double quote devstring if you use '|' character in it. Otherwise
              the shell might misinterpret it as a pipe symbol.

       --ui-file=file
              Overrides the GUI description file the program should use to
              display the panel. This override has the priority over the UI
              file specified by the configuration file.

       --version
              Display the version of the program as well as the version of the
              libraries it uses.

       --help|-h
              Display the command-line help

       eegview supports also the standards GTK+ options (gtk-options(7)).

FILES
       In the following, xdg-config-home refers to the XDG compliant user
       config folder. So it corresponds to the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment
       variable if set, ~/.config/ otherwise.

       xdg-config-home/eegview.conf
              Default settings of the panel. An example of file can be found
              in the documentation folder.
