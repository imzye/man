NAME
       ParaFly - parallel command processing using OpenMP

SYNOPSIS
       ParaFly <options>

DESCRIPTION
       ParaFly provides a simple mechanism for running a predefined list of unix commands in parallel using multithreading. Failed processes are captured and reported. Successfully executed processes are
       noted. If the process is rerun, only those previously incompleted or failed processes will be executed.

OPTIONS
       Required:

       -c <str>
              filename containing list of bash-style commands to execute

       -CPU <int>
              number_of_threads

       Optional:

       -shuffle
              randomly shuffles the command order.

       -failed_cmds <str>
              filename to capture failed commands.  default("FailedCommands")

       -v     simple progress monitoring.

       -vv    increased verbosity in progress monitoring.

       Note:  This  process  creates a file named based on your commands filename with a .completed extension.  This enables a resume functionality, where if rerun, only those commands not completed suc‐
       cessfully will be reprocessed.
