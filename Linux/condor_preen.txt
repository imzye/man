NAME
       condor_preen - HTCondor Manual

       remove extraneous files from HTCondor directories

SYNOPSIS
       condor_preen [-mail ] [-remove ] [-verbose ] [-debug ] [-log <filename>]

DESCRIPTION
       condor_preen  examines  the directories belonging to HTCondor, and removes extraneous files and directories which may be left over from HTCondor processes which terminated abnormally either due to in‐
       ternal errors or a system crash. The directories checked are the LOG, EXECUTE, and SPOOL directories as defined in the HTCondor configuration files. condor_preen is intended to be run as user root  or
       user  condor  periodically  as a backup method to ensure reasonable file system cleanliness in the face of errors. This is done automatically by default by the condor_master daemon. It may also be ex‐
       plicitly invoked on an as needed basis.

       When condor_preen cleans the SPOOL directory, it always leaves behind the files specified in the configuration variables VALID_SPOOL_FILES   and SYSTEM_VALID_SPOOL_FILES  , as given by the  configura‐
       tion.  For  the  LOG  directory, the only files removed or reported are those listed within the configuration variable INVALID_LOG_FILES   list. The reason for this difference is that, in general, the
       files in the LOG directory ought to be left alone, with few exceptions. An example of exceptions are core files. As there are new log files introduced regularly, it is less  effort  to  specify  those
       that ought to be removed than those that are not to be removed.

OPTIONS
          -mail  Send mail to the user defined in the PREEN_ADMIN
                   configuration variable, instead of writing to the standard output.

          -remove
                 Remove the offending files and directories rather than reporting on them.

          -verbose
                 List  all  files  or directories found in the Condor directories and considered for deletion, even those which are not extraneous. This option also modifies the output produced by the -debug
                 and -log options

          -debug Print extra debugging information to stderr as the command executes.

          -log <filename>
                 Write extra debugging information to <filename> as the command executes.

EXIT STATUS
       condor_preen will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with a non-zero value upon failure.  An exit status of 2 indicates that condor_preen attempted to send email about
       deleted files but was unable to. This usually indicates an error in the configuration for sending email.  An exit status of 1 indicates a general failure.
