NAME
       IMG_isJXL - Detect JXL image data on a readable/seekable SDL_IOStream.

HEADER FILE
       Defined in SDL3_image/SDL_image.h

SYNOPSIS
       #include "SDL3_image/SDL_image.h"

       bool IMG_isJXL(SDL_IOStream *src);

DESCRIPTION
       This function attempts to determine if a file is a given filetype, reading the least amount possible from the SDL_IOStream (usually a few bytes).

       There is no distinction made between "not the filetype in question" and basic i/o errors.

       This  function will always attempt to seek src back to where it started when this function was called, but it will not report any errors in doing so, but assuming seeking works, this means you can
       immediately use this with a different IMG_isTYPE
        function, or load the image without further seeking.

       You do not need to call this function to load data; SDL_image can work to determine file type in many cases in its standard load functions.

FUNCTION PARAMETERS
       src    a seekable/readable SDL_IOStream to provide image data.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns non-zero if this is JXL data, zero otherwise.

AVAILABILITY
       This function is available since SDL_image 3.0.0.
