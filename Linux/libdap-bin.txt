       getdap ‐ test driver for the libdap library

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mgetdap  [‐idaDxXBvVkzsM]  [‐c   4m22mexpr24m   1m]   [‐m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mgetdap   22mIn   the first form of the command, derefer‐
ence the URL and per‐
       form the requested operations. This includes  routing  the
returned  in‐
       formation  through the DAP processing library (parsing the
returned ob‐
       jects,  et c.). If none of a, d, or D are used with a URL,
then the  DAP
       library routines are NOT used and the  URLs  contents  are
dumped to stan‐
       dard output.

       In  the  second  form of the command, assume the files are
DataDDS objects
       (stored  in  files  or  read from pipes) and process  them
as if ‐D were
       given.  In  this case the information *must* contain valid
MIME header in
       order to be processed.

1mOPTIONS0m
       ‐i     For each URL, get the server version.

       ‐d     For each URL, get the the DDS.

       ‐a     For each URL, get the the DAS.

       ‐D     For each URL, get the the DataDDS.

       ‐x     For each URL, get the  DDX  object.  Does  not  get
data.

       ‐X      Request  a  DataDDX from the server (the DAP4 data
response).

       ‐B     Build a DDX in getdap using the DDS and DAS.

       ‐v     Verbose output.

       ‐V     Version of this client; see ’i’ for server version.

       ‐c expr
              4mexpr24m is a  constraint  expression.  Used  with
‐D/X.  You can use  a
              ‘?’ for the CE also.

       ‐k     Keep temporary files created by libdap.

       ‐m num Request the same URL 4mnum24m times

       ‐z     Ask the server to compress data.

       ‐s     Print Sequences using numbered rows.

       ‐M      Assume  data  read from a file has no MIME headers
(the default is
              to assume the headers are present).

       ‐p x.y Set DAP protocol to 4mx.y0m

1mFILES0m
       4m˜/.dodsrc0m
              The  4m.dodsrc24m  file  contains  various  parame‐
ters that affect the
              runtime  behavior  for  DAP  clients.   See  1mdod‐
src22m(5) for further de‐
              tails.

1mENVIRONMENT0m
       DODS_CONF
              Specifies an alternate file or  directory  for  the
4m.dodsrc24m file.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       Various self‐explanitory messages may be issued on stderr.

1mBUGS0m
       The command name should have been chosen more carefully to
reflect  its
       purpose.

       The dodsrc man page needs to be written.
