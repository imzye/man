NAME
       setcap - set file capabilities

SYNOPSIS
       setcap [-q] [-n <rootid>] [-v] {capabilities|-|-r} filename [ ... capabilitiesN fileN ]

DESCRIPTION
       In the absence of the -v (verify) option setcap sets the capabilities of each specified filename to the capabilities specified.  The optional -n <rootid> ar‐
       gument can be used to set the file capability for use only in a namespace with this rootid owner. The -v option is used to verify that the specified capabil‐
       ities are currently associated with the file. If -v and -n are supplied, the -n <rootid> argument is also verified.

       The capabilities are specified in the form described in cap_from_text(3).

       The  special  capability string, '-', can be used to indicate that capabilities are read from the standard input. In such cases, the capability set is termi‐
       nated with a blank line.

       The special capability string, '-r', is used to remove a capability set from a file. Note, setting an empty capability set is not the same as removing it. An
       empty set can be used to guarantee a file is not executed with privilege inspite of the fact that the prevailing ambient+inheritable sets would otherwise be‐
       stow capabilities on executed binaries.

       The -q flag is used to make the program less verbose in its output.

EXIT CODE
       The setcap program will exit with a 0 exit code if successful. On failure, the exit code is 1.
