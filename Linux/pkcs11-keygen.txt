PKCS11-KEYGEN(8)                    BIND 9                    PKCS11-KEYGEN(8)

NAME
       pkcs11-keygen - generate keys on a PKCS#11 device

SYNOPSIS
       pkcs11-keygen [-a algorithm] [-b keysize] [-e] [-i id] [-m module] [-P]
       [-p PIN] [-q] [-S] [-s slot] label

DESCRIPTION
       pkcs11-keygen causes a PKCS#11 device to generate a new key  pair  with
       the given label (which must be unique) and with keysize bits of prime.

OPTIONS
       -a algorithm
              This option specifies the key algorithm class: supported classes
              are RSA, DSA, DH, ECC, and ECX. In addition  to  these  strings,
              the  algorithm can be specified as a DNSSEC signing algorithm to
              be used with this key; for example, NSEC3RSASHA1  maps  to  RSA,
              ECDSAP256SHA256  maps  to  ECC,  and ED25519 to ECX. The default
              class is RSA.

       -b keysize
              This option creates the key pair with keysize bits of prime. For
              ECC keys, the only valid values are 256 and 384, and the default
              is 256. For ECX keys, the only valid values are 256 and 456, and
              the default is 256.

       -e     For  RSA  keys  only, this option specifies use of a large expo‐
              nent.

       -i id  This option creates key objects with id. The ID is either an un‐
              signed short 2-byte or an unsigned long 4-byte number.

       -m module
              This  option specifies the PKCS#11 provider module. This must be
              the full path  to  a  shared  library  object  implementing  the
              PKCS#11 API for the device.

       -P     This option sets the new private key to be non-sensitive and ex‐
              tractable, and allows the private key data to be read  from  the
              PKCS#11  device. The default is for private keys to be sensitive
              and non-extractable.

       -p PIN This option specifies the PIN for the device. If no PIN is  pro‐
              vided on the command line, pkcs11-keygen prompts for it.

       -q     This  option  sets quiet mode, which suppresses unnecessary out‐
              put.

       -S     For Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys only, this option specifies use  of
              a  special  prime of 768-, 1024-, or 1536-bit size and base (AKA
              generator) 2. If not specified, bit size defaults to 1024.

       -s slot
              This option opens the session with the given PKCS#11  slot.  The
              default is slot 0.
