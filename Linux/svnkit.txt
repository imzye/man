SYNOPSIS

OVERVIEW
       SVNKit is a pure Java(TM) version of Subversion.

       Subversion is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions of files and directories (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS
       or SCCS.  Subversion keeps a single  copy  of  the  master  sources.  This copy is called the source ``repository''; it contains all the information to permit extracting previous versions of those
       files at any time.

       For additional information, see http://svnkit.com/.

       For information about Subversion in a broad sense, can be found at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ and http://subversion.tigris.org.
