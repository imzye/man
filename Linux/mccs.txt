NAME
       mccs - package dependency solver

SYNOPSIS
       mccs [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mccs (which stands for Multi Criteria CUDF Solver) is a solver for package dependency problems expressed in the CUDF format. By default, mccs reads a problem specification from standard input, and
       writes the solution to standard output.

OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING INPUT/OUTPUT
       -i file
              Read input from file file instead of standard input.

       -o file
              Write the solution to file instead of standard output.

       -fo    full solution output

       -v n   set verbosity level to n.

       -h     print this help

OPTIONS FOR SELECTING THE SOLVER ENGINE
       By default, mccs uses the cbc solving engine.

       -lpsolve
              use lpsolve solver

       -lp lpsolver
              specify  a solving engine that takes the cplex input format. lpsolver is the path of a script that takes as input the file name containing the cplex input, and that produces the solution on
              standard output (an example for scip is given in /usr/share/doc/mccs/engines/sciplp).

       -pblib pbsolver
              use pseudo-Boolean solver pbsolver as solving engine.

       -nosolve
              do not solve the problem (for debugging)

OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING CONSTRAINT GENERATION
       -noreduce
              do not reduce the initial problem

       -only-agregate-constraints
              generate only agregate constraints

       -only-desagregate-constraints
              generate only deagregate constraints (default)

       -all-constraints
              generate all kind of constraints (ensure redundancy)

OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING OPTIMIZATION
       See the file /usr/share/doc/mccs/README.optimization-criteria for a full grammar of optimization criteria.

EXAMPLES
       An example input file can be found at /usr/share/doc/mccs/examples/legacy.cudf.

           mccs -i legacy.cudf

       calls mccs on examples/legacy.cudf and prints the solution on stdout. With such a call mccs will resort to the default underlying solver cbc and use a default criterion to solve the problem.

           mccs -i legacy.cudf -o sol -lexagregate[-removed,-changed]\
           -lpsolve

       Here, mccs puts the solution into the  file "sol" and solves the problem using the lpsolve solver with the paranoid criterion, which consists of first minimizing the number  of  removed  packaged,
       and then the number of packages that change installation status or installed version.

           mccs -i legacy.cudf -o sol \
           -lexsemiagregate[-removed,-notuptodate,\
           -nunsat[recommends:,true],-new]

       The  criterion  used here is the trendy criterion, which consists of first minimizing the number of package removals, then to minimize the number of installed packages that are installed in a ver‐
       sion older the most recent available version, then to minimize the number of recommendations of installed packages that are not satisfied, and finally  the  number  of  newly  installed  packages.
