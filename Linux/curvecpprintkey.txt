NAME
       CurveCP — Message-handling programs

SYNOPSIS
       curvecpmakekey [keydir]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the CurveCP commands.

       A  traditional UNIX-style server such as ftpd handles just one network connection, reading input from stdin and writing output to stdout. A "superserver" such as inetd or tcpserver listens for network
       connections and starts a separate server process for each connection.

       curvecpprintkey prints ascii version of binary keys needed for curvecpclient  and curvecpserver and created using curvecpmakekey command before.

OPTIONS
       How to use curvecpprintkey:

       keydir    a directory where CurveCP binary keys were created.

SEE ALSO
       curvecpserver (1), curvecpclient (1), curvecpmakekey (1), inetd (8), tcpserver (1).
