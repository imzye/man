NAME
       sgb - The Stanford GraphBase: combinatorial data and algorithms

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the Stanford GraphBase system.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because the original program does
       not have a manual page.

       The  Stanford  GraphBase,  created  by  Prof.  Donald Knuth of Stanford University, is a highly portable collection of programs and data for researchers who study combinatorial algorithms and data
       structures.

       The programs are intended to be interesting in themselves as examples of literate programming.  Thus, the Stanford GraphBase can also be regarded as a collection of  approximately  30  essays  for
       programmers  to  enjoy reading, whether or not they are doing algorithmic research.  The programs are written in CWEB, a combination of TeX and C that is easy to use by anyone who knows those lan‐
       guages and easy to read by anyone familiar with the rudiments of C.

       More details about the Stanford GraphBase can be found in the file /usr/share/doc/sgb/abstract.dvi.gz.  It can be viewed using xdvi.  It can also be converted from DVI  to  some  other  format:  a
       PostScript version can be created by using the command:
              dvips -o abstract.ps abstract.dvi
       If you prefer less readable ASCII version instead of Postscript, you can create it by the non-free dvi2tty program:
              dvi2tty -w132 -e-40 abstract.dvi >abstract.txt

       Complete  instructions  to the Stanford Graphbase appear in the book by D. E. Knuth entitled The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing published jointly by ACM Press and Addi‐
       son-Wesley (1993), ISBN 0-201-54275-7.

       All of the source code may be found in the directory /usr/sgb/doc/src.  The code may be read directly, or can be turned into a pretty-printable TeX form by  using  the  cweave  program.   See  the
       cweb(1) manpage for more details.  The source code forms the main documentation of the libgb library.

FILES
       /usr/share/sgb
              Data files for the GraphBase programs.

       /usr/share/doc/sgb
              The source code for the GraphBase programs.

       /usr/lib/libgb.{a,so}
              The GraphBase libraries.

       /usr/include/gb_*.h
              Header files for the GraphBase library programs.

       /usr/share/cweb
              Directory for files included in the GraphBase programs via the CWEB @i command.

BUGS
       Genuine  bugs  may  be  reported  to Donald Knuth via email to sgb@cs.stanford.edu.  PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS EMAIL ADDRESS FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO REPORT BUGS IN THE STANFORD GRAPHBASE. PROF.
       KNUTH DOES NOT ACCEPT UNSOLICITED EMAIL.
