NAME
       unihex2bmp - GNU Unifont .hex file to bitmap graphics file converter

SYNOPSIS
       unihex2bmp [-phexpage] [-iinput_file.hex] [-ooutput_file.bmp] [-f] [-w]

DESCRIPTION
       unihex2bmp  reads  a  GNU  Unifont .hex file Unicode page of 256 code points and converts the page into a Microsoft Windows Bitmap (.bmp) or Wireless Bitmap (.wbmp) file.  The bitmap file displays the
       glyphs of a Unicode block of 256 code points in a 32 by 32 pixel grid.  The glyphs themselves must be 16 rows high, and 8, 16, 24, or 31 (encoded as 32) columns wide. The default page is 0;  that  is,
       the range U+0000 through U+00FF.

       The bitmap can be printed.  It can also be edited with a bitmap editor.  An edited bitmap can then be re-converted into a GNU Unifont .hex file with the unibmp2hex command.

OPTIONS
       -p    Extract  page  hexpage from the .hex file.  The default is Page 0 (Unicode range U+0000 through U+00FF).  Note that "page" is not a standard Unicode term.  It refers to an output bitmap graphics
             page of 16 by 16 code points.

       -i    Specify the input file. The default is STDIN.

       -o    Specify the output file. The default is STDOUT.

       -f    "Flip" (transpose) the grid, swapping rows and columns from the Unicode standard orientation.

       -w    Produce a Wireless Bitmap format file instead of a Microsoft Windows Bitmap file.

EXAMPLE
       Sample usage:

              unihex2bmp -imy_input_file.hex -omy_output_file.bmp

BUGS
       No known real bugs exist, except that this software does not perform extensive error checking on its input files.  If they're not in the format of the original GNU Unifont .hex file, all bets are off.
