NAME
       syslog-ng - syslog-ng system logger application

SYNOPSIS
       syslog-ng [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page is only an abstract, for the complete documentation of syslog-ng, see The Administrator Guide[1] or the official syslog-ng website[2].

       The application is a flexible and highly scalable system logging application. Typically, syslog-ng is used to manage log messages and implement centralized logging, where the aim is to collect the log
       messages of several devices on a single, central log server. The different devices - called syslog-ng clients - all run syslog-ng, and collect the log messages from the various applications, files,
       and other sources. The clients send all important log messages to the remote syslog-ng server, where the server sorts and stores them.

OPTIONS
       --caps
           Run process with the specified POSIX capability flags.

           ·   If the --no-caps option is not set, and the host supports CAP_SYSLOG, uses the following capabilities: "cap_net_bind_service, cap_net_broadcast, cap_net_raw, cap_dac_read_search,
               cap_dac_override, cap_chown, cap_fowner=p cap_syslog=ep"

           ·   If the --no-caps option is not set, and the host does not support CAP_SYSLOG, uses the following capabilities: "cap_net_bind_service, cap_net_broadcast, cap_net_raw,cap_dac_read_search,
               cap_dac_override, cap_chown, cap_fowner=p cap_sys_admin=ep"

           For example:

               /usr/local/sbin/syslog-ng -Fv --caps cap_sys_admin,cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_net_bind_service,cap_fowner=pi

           Note that the capabilities are not case sensitive, the following command is also good:
            /usr/local/sbin/syslog-ng -Fv --caps CAP_SYS_ADMIN,CAP_CHOWN,CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,CAP_FOWNER=pi

           For details on the capability flags, see the following man pages: cap_from_text(3) and capabilities(7)

       --cfgfile <file> or -f <file>
           Use the specified configuration file.

       --chroot <dir> or -C <dir>
           Change root to the specified directory. The configuration file is read after chrooting so, the configuration file must be available within the chroot. That way it is also possible to reload the
           syslog-ng configuration after chrooting. However, note that the --user and --group options are resolved before chrooting.

       --control <file>  or -c <file>
           Set the location of the syslog-ng control socket. Default value: /var/run/syslog-ng.ctl

       --debug or -d
           Start syslog-ng in debug mode.

       --enable-core
           Enable syslog-ng to write core files in case of a crash to help support and debugging.

       --fd-limit <number>
           Set the minimal number of required file descriptors (fd-s). This sets how many files syslog-ng can keep open simultaneously. Default value: 4096. Note that this does not override the global ulimit
           setting of the host.

       --foreground or -F
           Do not daemonize, run in the foreground. When running in the foreground, starts from the current directory ($CWD) so it can create core files (normally, starts from $PREFIX/var).

       --group <group> or -g <group>
           Switch to the specified group after initializing the configuration file.

       --help or -h
           Display a brief help message.

       --module-registry
           Display the list and description of the available modules. Available only in and later.

       --no-caps
           Run syslog-ng as root, without capability-support. This is the default behavior. On Linux, it is possible to run syslog-ng as non-root with capability-support if syslog-ng was compiled with the
           --enable-linux-caps option enabled. (Execute syslog-ng --version to display the list of enabled build parameters.)

           To run with specific capabilities, use the --caps option.

       --persist-file <persist-file> or -R <persist-file>
           Set the path and name of the syslog-ng.persist file where the persistent options and data are stored.

       --pidfile <pidfile> or -p <pidfile>
           Set path to the PID file where the pid of the main process is stored.

       --preprocess-into <output-file>
           After processing the configuration file and resolving included files and variables, write the resulting configuration into the specified output file. Available only in and later.

       --process-mode <mode>
           Sets how to run syslog-ng: in the foreground (mainly used for debugging), in the background as a daemon, or in safe-background mode. By default, syslog-ng runs in safe-background mode. This mode
           creates a supervisor process called supervising syslog-ng , that restarts syslog-ng if it crashes.

       --stderr or -e
           Log internal messages of syslog-ng to stderr. Mainly used for debugging purposes in conjunction with the --foreground option. If not specified, syslog-ng will log such messages to its internal
           source.

       --syntax-only or -s
           Verify that the configuration file is syntactically correct and exit.

       --user <user> or -u <user>
           Switch to the specified user after initializing the configuration file (and optionally chrooting). Note that it is not possible to reload the syslog-ng configuration if the specified user has no
           privilege to create the /dev/log file.

       --verbose or -v
           Enable verbose logging used to troubleshoot syslog-ng.

       --version or -V
           Display version number and compilation information, and also the list and short description of the available modules. For detailed description of the available modules, see the --module-registry
           option.

       --worker-threads
           Sets the number of worker threads can use, including the main thread. Note that certain operations in can use threads that are not limited by this option. This setting has effect only when is
           running in multithreaded mode. Available only in and later. See The 3.23 Administrator Guide for details.
