NAME
       ceph-conf - ceph conf file tool

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-conf -c conffile --list-all-sections
       ceph-conf -c conffile -L
       ceph-conf -c conffile -l prefix
       ceph-conf key -s section1 ...
       ceph-conf [-s section ] [-r] --lookup key
       ceph-conf [-s section ] key

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-conf is a utility for getting information from a ceph configuration file. As with most Ceph programs, you can specify which Ceph configuration file to use with the -c flag.

       Note  that  unlike other ceph tools, ceph-conf will only read from config files (or return compiled-in default values)--it will not fetch config values from the monitor cluster.  For this reason it is
       recommended that ceph-conf only be used in legacy environments that are strictly config-file based.  New deployments and tools should instead rely on either querying the monitor explicitly for config‐
       uration  (e.g.,  ceph  config get <daemon> <option>) or use daemons themselves to fetch effective config options (e.g., ceph-osd -i 123 --show-config-value osd_data).  The latter option has the advan‐
       tages of drawing from compiled-in defaults (which occasionally vary between daemons), config files, and the monitor's config database, providing the exact value that that daemon would be using  if  it
       were started.

ACTIONS
       ceph-conf performs one of the following actions:

       -L, --list-all-sections
              list all sections in the configuration file.

       -l, --list-sections *prefix*
              list the sections with the given prefix. For example, --list-sections mon would list all sections beginning with mon.

       --lookup *key*
              search and print the specified configuration setting. Note:  --lookup is the default action. If no other actions are given on the command line, we will default to doing a lookup.

       -h, --help
              print a summary of usage.

OPTIONS
       -c *conffile*
              the Ceph configuration file.

       --filter-key *key*
              filter section list to only include sections with given key defined.

       --filter-key-value *key* ``=`` *value*
              filter section list to only include sections with given key/value pair.

       --name *type.id*
              the Ceph name in which the sections are searched (default 'client.admin').  For example, if we specify --name osd.0, the following sections will be searched: [osd.0], [osd], [global]

       -r, --resolve-search
              search for the first file that exists and can be opened in the resulted comma delimited search list.

       -s, --section
              additional sections to search.  These additional sections will be searched before the sections that would normally be searched. As always, the first matching entry we find will be returned.

EXAMPLES
       To find out what value osd 0 will use for the "osd data" option:

          ceph-conf -c foo.conf  --name osd.0 --lookup "osd data"

       To find out what value will mds a use for the "log file" option:

          ceph-conf -c foo.conf  --name mds.a "log file"

       To list all sections that begin with "osd":

          ceph-conf -c foo.conf -l osd

       To list all sections:

          ceph-conf -c foo.conf -L

       To print the path of the "keyring" used by "client.0":

          ceph-conf --name client.0 -r -l keyring

FILES
       /etc/ceph/$cluster.conf, ~/.ceph/$cluster.conf, $cluster.conf

       the Ceph configuration files to use if not specified.
