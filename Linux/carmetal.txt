NAME
       carmetal — dynamic geometry software

SYNOPSIS
       carmetal [file.zir[z]]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the carmetal command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       carmetal  is  a  dinamical geometry software written in Java. Ruler and compass constructions can be changed by dragging one of the basic construction points. The construction follows immediately.
       The student can check the correctness of the construction and gain new insight. Carmetal allow exercices generations (jobs) automaticly checked with html export, and  html diaporama generations.

       Arithmetic computations, numerical solutions, curves and functions go beyond classical constructions. It is even possible to construct in 3D using advanced macros. Other geometries, hyperbolic  or
       elliptic, can be explored.
