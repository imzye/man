NAME
       recode - converts files between character sets

SYNOPSIS
       recode [OPTION]... [ [CHARSET] | REQUEST [FILE]... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Recode converts files between various character sets and surfaces.

       If a long option shows an argument as mandatory, then it is mandatory for the equivalent short option also.  Similarly for optional arguments.

   Listings:
       -l, --list[=FORMAT]
              list one or all known charsets and aliases

       -k, --known=PAIRS
              restrict charsets according to known PAIRS list

       -h, --header[=[LN/]NAME]
              write table NAME on stdout using LN, then exit

       -T, --find-subsets
              report all charsets being subset of others

       -C, --copyright
              display copyright and copying conditions

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   Operation modes:
       -v, --verbose
              explain sequence of steps and report progress

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              inhibit messages about irreversible recodings

       -f, --force
              force recodings even when not reversible

       -t, --touch
              touch the recoded files after replacement

       -i, -p, --sequence=STRATEGY
              ignored for backwards compatibility

   Fine tuning:
       -s, --strict
              use strict mappings; discard untranslatable characters

       -d, --diacritics
              convert only diacritics and special characters for HTML/LaTeX/BibTeX

       -S, --source[=LN]
              limit recoding to strings and comments as for LN

       -c, --colons
              use colons instead of double quotes for diaeresis

       -g, --graphics
              approximate IBMPC rulers by ASCII graphics

       -x, --ignore=CHARSET
              ignore CHARSET while choosing a recoding path

       -I, --prefer-iconv
              use iconv if possible

       Option -l with no FORMAT nor CHARSET list available charsets and surfaces.  FORMAT is `decimal', `octal', `hexadecimal' or `full' (or one of `dohf').  Unless DEFAULT_CHARSET is set in environment,
       CHARSET  defaults  to  the  locale dependent encoding, determined by LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG.  With -k, possible before charsets are listed for the given after CHARSET, both being tabular charsets,
       with PAIRS of the form `BEF1:AFT1,BEF2:AFT2,...'  and BEFs and AFTs being codes are given as decimal numbers.  LN is some language, it may be `c', `perl' or `po'; `c' is the default.

       REQUEST is SUBREQUEST[,SUBREQUEST]...; SUBREQUEST is ENCODING[..ENCODING]...  ENCODING is [CHARSET][/[SURFACE]]...; REQUEST often looks like BEFORE..AFTER, with BEFORE and  AFTER  being  charsets.
       An omitted CHARSET implies the usual charset; an omitted [/SURFACE]... means the implied surfaces for CHARSET; a / with an empty surface name means no surfaces at all.  See the manual.

       Each FILE is recoded over itself, destroying the original.  If no FILE is specified, then act as a filter and recode stdin to stdout.
