NAME
       treetime - Maximum Likelihood Phylodynamics

SYNOPSIS
       treetime <positional> [optional]

DESCRIPTION
       TreeTime  provides routines for ancestral sequence reconstruction and inference of molecular-clock phylogenies, i.e., a tree where all branches are scaled such that the positions of terminal nodes
       correspond to their sampling times and internal nodes are placed at the most likely time of divergence.

       To optimize the likelihood of time-scaled phylogenies, TreeTime uses an iterative approach that first infers ancestral sequences given the branch length of the tree, then optimizes  the  positions
       of  unconstrained  nodes on the time axis, and then repeats this cycle. The only topology optimization are (optional) resolution of polytomies in a way that is most (approximately) consistent with
       the sampling time constraints on the tree. The package is designed to be used as a stand-alone tool on the command-line or as a library used in larger phylogenetic analysis work-flows.

OPTIONS
   positional arguments
       ancestral
              infer ancestral sequences maximizing the joint or marginal likelihood.

       homoplasy
              analyze patterns of recurrent mutations aka homoplasies.

       clock  estimate molecular clock parameters and reroot the tree.

       mugration
              map discrete character such as host or country to the tree.

   optional arguments
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --tree TREE
              Name of file containing the tree in newick, nexus, or phylip format. If none is provided, treetime will attempt to build a tree from the alignment using fasttree, iqtree, or raxml (assuming
              they are installed)

       --sequence-length SEQUENCE_LENGTH
              length of the sequence, used to calculate expected variation in branch length. Not required if alignment is provided.

       --aln ALN
              alignment file (fasta)

       --vcf-reference VCF_REFERENCE
              only for vcf input: fasta file of the sequence the VCF was mapped to.

       --dates DATES
              csv file with dates for nodes with 'node_name, date' where date is float (as in 2012.15)

       --clock-filter CLOCK_FILTER
              ignore tips that don't follow a loose clock, 'clockfilter=number of interquartile ranges from regression'

       --reroot REROOT
              reroot the tree. Valid choices are 'ML', 'ML-rough', 'least-squares', 'min_dev', 'midpoint' or a node name to be used as outgroup. Use --keep-root to keep the current root.

       --keep-root
              don't reroot the tree. Otherwise, reroot to minimize the the residual of the regression of root-to-tip distance and sampling time

       --gtr GTR
              GTR model to use. '--gtr infer' will infer a model from the data. Alternatively, specify the model type.  If the specified model requires additional options, use '--gtr-params'  to  specify
              those.

       --gtr-params GTR_PARAMS [GTR_PARAMS ...]
              GTR  parameters  for  the  model  specified  by  the  --gtr  argument.  The  parameters  should  be  feed  as  'key=value'  list  of  parameters.  Example: '--gtr K80 --gtr-params kappa=0.2
              pis=0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25'. See the exact definitions of the parameters in the GTR creation methods in treetime/nuc_models.py or treetime/aa_models.py

       --clock-rate CLOCK_RATE
              if specified, the rate of the molecular clock won't be optimized.

       --branch-length-mode {auto,input,joint,marginal}
              If set to 'input', the provided branch length will be used without modification. Note that branch lengths optimized by treetime are only accurate at short evolutionary distances.

       --confidence
              estimate confidence intervals of divergence times.

       --keep-polytomies
              Don't resolve polytomies using temporal information.

       --relax [RELAX [RELAX ...]]
              use an autocorrelated molecular clock. Prior strength and coupling of parent and offspring rates can be specified e.g. as --relax 1.0 0.5

       --max-iter MAX_ITER
              maximal number of iterations the inference cycle is run. Note that for polytomy resolution and coalescence models max_iter should be at least 2

       --coalescent COALESCENT
              coalescent time scale -- sensible values are on the order of the average hamming distance of contemporaneous sequences. In addition, 'opt' 'skyline' are valid options and  estimate  a  con‐
              stant coalescent rate or a piecewise linear coalescent rate history

       --plot-tree PLOT_TREE
              filename to save the plot to. Suffix will determine format (choices pdf, png, svg, default=pdf)

       --plot-rtt PLOT_RTT
              filename to save the plot to. Suffix will determine format (choices pdf, png, svg, default=pdf)

       --keep-overhangs
              do not fill terminal gaps

       --zero-based
              zero based mutation indexing

       --report-ambiguous
              include transitions involving ambiguous states

       --verbose VERBOSE
              verbosity of output 0-6

       --outdir OUTDIR
              directory to write the output to
