DESCRIPTION
       Provides integration for projects using Phabricator.

       The current repository must contain a valid .arcconfig file and a remote location to push submitted branches must be defined using:

           git config phab.remote <remote>

COMMANDS
       attach
           Creates a new differential for each commit in the provided <revision_range>. Commit messages will be rewritten to include the URL of the newly created Differential (no other information
           will be added to the message). If a commit message already contains the URL of a Differential it will be updated instead of creating a new one.

           <revision_range> can be either a range of commits or a single commit, as understood by git rev-parse. If omitted, the default range is from the remote current branch’s remote tracking
           commit to HEAD.

           With --task option, or if current branch is in the form Txxx-description, it will also push the current HEAD into wip/phab/Txxx-description on the configured remote repository. If the
           phabricator instance supports the std:maniphest:git:uri-branch extention, the remote branch URI will be linked on the Maniphest.

           If not task is defined, it will prompt if a new one should be created.

           If a task is defined but the current branch is not in the form Txxx-description, it will prompt if a new branch must be created using current branch’s name prefixed with Txxx-.

       log
           Prints all commits in the provided <revision_range>. For each commit it displays the Differential ID and its current status. See the attach command for details on how <revision_range> is
           formed.

       fetch
           Fetch the branch linked to a Maniphest task. With no argument the task will be defined from the current branch name, if it is in the form Txxx-description.

           This only fetch and print the commit id, it won’t create or checkout a branch. A new branch can then be created using, for example:

               git checkout -b my-branch FETCH_HEAD

           With --checkout (or -c), fetch and checkout in a branch.

       apply
           Apply a revision and its dependencies.

           With --no-dependencies (or -n), revision’s dependencies will not be applied.

           With --output-directory (or -o), patches aren’t applied to the repository, but exported to a directory instead.

       browse
           Open related URIs in a web browser using xdg-open.

           With no argument, if the current branch is in the form Txxx-description, opens that Maniphest task.

           If objects is in the form Dxxx/Txxx it will open the corresponding Differential/Maniphest. Otherwise it is assumed that object is a commit as understood by git rev-parse and if that
           commit contains a link to a Differential it will be open.

       clean
           For all local and remote references, if they are in the form Txxx-description and the corresponding task has been closed, prompt if that branch should be removed.

       land
           Same as git push but for each commit that would be pushed, query who approved its differential and add corresponding Reviewed-by: line. Note that the email address is guessed by looking
           the reviewer’s fullname into git shortlog. If the fullname cannot be found it will be asked then stored into ~/.config/git/phab so it won’t be prompted again.

           For each related tasks, also prompt if it should be closed.

EXAMPLES
       Attach all commits since origin/master

           $ git phab attach

       Attach only the top commit

           $ git phab attach HEAD

       Attach all commits since origin/master, excluding top commit

           $ git phab attach origin/master..HEAD^

       Attach top 3 patches, link them to a task, and set reviewers

           $ git phab attach --reviewers xclaesse,smcv --task T123 HEAD~3..

       Push current branch to origin/wip/phab/T123

           $ git config phab.remote origin
           $ git phab attach --task T123

       Fetch a branch associated with the task T123

           $ git phab fetch T123

                                                                                              03/11/2021                                                                                   GIT-PHAB(1)
