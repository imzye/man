NAME
       csg_stat - Part of the VOTCA package

SYNOPSIS
       csg_stat [OPTION] [OPTIONPARAMETERS]

DESCRIPTION
       Calculate  all distributions (bonded and non-bonded) specified in options file.  Optionally calculates update Eigen::Matrix3d for invere Monte Carlo. This program is called inside the inverse scripts.
       Unlike csg_boltzmann, big systems can be treated as well as non-bonded interactions can be evaluated.

       Please visit the program site at __http://www.votca.org__.

OPTIONS
       Allowed options:

       -h [ --help ]
              display this help and exit

       --verbose
              be loud and noisy

       --verbose1
              be very loud and noisy

       -v [ --verbose2 ]
              be extremly loud and noisy

       --top arg
              atomistic topology file

       Mapping options:

       --cg arg
              [OPTIONAL] coarse graining mapping and bond definitions (xml-file). If no file is given, program acts on original trajectory

       --map-ignore arg
              list of molecules to ignore if mapping is done separated by ;

       Specific options:

       --options arg
              options file for coarse graining

       --do-imc
              write out additional Inverse Monte Carlo data

       --block-length arg
              write blocks of this length, the averages are cleared after every write

       --ext arg (=dist.new)
              Extension of the output

       Threading options:

       --nt arg (=1)
              number of threads

       Trajectory options:

       --trj arg
              atomistic trajectory file

       --begin arg (=0)
              skip frames before this time (only works for Gromacs files)

       --first-frame arg (=0)
              start with this frame

       --nframes arg
              process the given number of frames
