NAME
       dt-validate - Query the Domain Name System and display results of the
       DNSSEC validation process

SYNOPSIS
         dt-validate [options] DOMAIN_NAME

DESCRIPTION
       dt-validate is a diagnostic tool built on top of the DNSSEC validator.
       It takes DOMAIN_NAME as an argument and queries the DNS for that domain
       name.  It outputs the series of responses that were received from the
       DNS and the DNSSEC validation results for each domain name.  An
       examination of the queries and validation results can help an
       administrator uncover errors in DNSSEC configuration of DNS zones.

OPTIONS
       -c CLASS, --class=CLASS
           This option can be used to specify the DNS class of the Resource
           Record queried.  If this option is not given, the default class IN
           is used.

       -h, --help
           Display the help and exit.

       -p, --print
           Print the answers and validation results.  By default, dt-validate
           just outputs a series of responses and their validation results on
           stderr.  When the -p option is used, dt-validate will also output
           the final result on stdout.

       -t TYPE, --type=TYPE
           This option can be used to specify the DNS type of the Resource
           Record queried.  If this option is not given, dt-validate will
           query for the A record for the given DOMAIN_NAME.

       -v FILE, --dnsval-conf=FILE
           This option can be used to specify the location of the dnsval.conf
           configuration file.

       -r FILE, --resolv-conf=FILE
           This option can be used to specify the location of the resolv.conf
           configuration file containing the name servers to use for lookups.

       -i FILE, --root-hints=FILE
           This option can be used to specify the location of the root.hints
           configuration file, containing the root name servers.  This is only
           used when no name server is found, and dt-validate must do
           recursive lookups itself.

       -S suite[:suite], --test-suite=suite[:suite]
           This option specifies the test suite (or range of test suites) to
           use for the internal tests.

       -s, --selftest
           This option can be used to specify that the application should
           perform its self tests using names from the configured test-suite.

       -T number[:number], --testcase=number[:number]
           This option can be used to run a specific test (or range of tests)
           from the test suite.

       -F file, --testcase-conf=file
           This option is used to specify the file containing the test cases.

       -l label, --label=label
           This option can be used to specify the policy from within the
           dnsval.conf file to use during validation.

       -w seconds, --wait=seconds
           This option can be used to run the queries specified by other flags
           in a loop, with the specified interval between successive queries.

       -o, --output=<debug-level>:<dest-type>[:<dest-options>]
           <debug-level> is 1-7, corresponding to syslog levels ALERT-DEBUG
           <dest-type> is one of file, net, syslog, stderr, stdout
           <dest-options> depends on <dest-type>
               file:<file-name>   (opened in append mode)
               net[:<host-name>:<host-port>] (127.0.0.1:1053
               syslog[:facility] (0-23 (default 1 USER))
