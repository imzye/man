NAME
       hatari-prg-args - autorun Atari programs with arguments

SYNOPSIS
       hatari-prg-args [-q] [Hatari args] -- <Atari program> <program args>

DESCRIPTION
       Utility for running Hatari so that it autostarts given Atari program and inserts given arguments to program (to its basepage, with builtin Hatari debugger facilities).

       If  Atari program arguments have same (host) path prefix as given Atari program, those prefixes are replaced with "C:\". Unix path separators (/) are replaced with Atari ones (\) and whole filename is
       upper-cased.

       If program and its input files are on a disk image, all paths need to be given as on with TOS, and won't be translated.

       Other program arguments are passed unmodified.

NOTES
       Maximum Atari program command line length that can be given (in basepage) is 126 characters.

       On Unix, Atari/DOS path separators (\) need to be quoted.

OPTIONS
       -q     Make Hatari quit when the started Atari program terminates.  If given, this needs to be the first argument.

EXAMPLES
       Start SID player in mono and tell it to play given SID song:
              hatari-prg-args -m -- atari/sidplay.ttp atari/sids/test.sid

       Run it from disk image instead of host directory:
              hatari-prg-args -m -- 'A:\SIDPLAY.TTP' 'SIDS\TEST.SID'

SEE ALSO
       hatari(1), hconsole(1)
