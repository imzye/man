NAME
       sanitizer - an email virus scanner

SYNOPSIS
       sanitizer [conffile ...] [confoption ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the sanitizer command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       The  Anomy  Sanitizer  is what most people would call "an email virus scanner". That description is not totally accurate, but it does cover one of the more important jobs that the sanitizer can do for
       you - it can scan email attachments for viruses.

       Sanitizer acts as pipe. It expects an email message to scan on standard input, and returns filtered message on standard output. You could give a path to configuration file or just set some  configura‐
       tion variables in command line.
