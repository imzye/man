NAME
       mohaa - OpenMoHAA, a re-implementation of "Medal of Honor: Allied Assault"

SYNOPSIS
       mohaa [-h|--help] [-q|--quiet] [--expansion name] [debugging options] [+set option value]...

DESCRIPTION
       Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is a 2002 first-person shooter video game that simulates infantry combat in the European and North African theaters during World War II.

OPTIONS
       The wrapper script used for OpenMoHAA in Debian accepts these options:

       -h, --help
              Display a short help summary

       -q, --quiet
              Disable all console output

       --expansion name
              play an expansion pack, spearhead or breakthrough.  This requires that additional data files are installed.

       --debugger=DEBUGGER
              Prepend a debugger or other prefix (such as strace) to the engine command line

       --print-backtrace
              Use gdb(1) to get a backtrace if the engine crashes (the gdb package must be installed)

       Any console command can also be prefixed with + and used as a command-line option (press Shift+Esc to access the in-game console), including:

       +set option value
              Set an option (see below for some options)

       +connect server[:port]
              Connect to a server

       Options that can be set with +set (note that this is not a full list!) include:

       r_fullscreen <bool>
              1: Play in fullscreen mode; 0: Play in window mode

       r_mode <num>
              Sets the screen resolution mode. Set num to -1 to use a customized resolution set via r_customheight and r_customwidth, or -2 to use your normal desktop resolution.

       r_customwidth <pixels>
              Use pixels as width if r_mode is set to -1.

       r_customheight <pixels>
              Use pixels as height if r_mode is set to -1.

FILES
       /usr/share/games/mohaa/
              Game data files.

              Configuration and state for the main game
