NAME
       PDL::IO::ENVI - read ENVI data files into PDL

SYNOPSIS
         use PDL::IO::ENVI;
         $pdl = readenvi("file.dat"); # implies there's a file.hdr next to it

         $hdr = readenvi_hdr("file.hdr"); # available separately, used for testing

DESCRIPTION
       Allows you to read ENVI data into an ndarray.

FUNCTIONS
   readenvi_hdr
       Given the name of an ENVI file header, parses the header and returns a hash-ref.

         TODO
           (1) verify that all required fields are present
           (2) parse map_info for pixel geolocation
               - handle keyword=value inside list
           (3) check that all sensor keywords are parsed
           (4) add support for offset/stride/count/reshape
           (5) implement writeenvi/wenvi routine
           (6) LATER: add support for complex data input, e.g. [2,S,L,B]
           (7) LATER: support unsigned long long

   readenvi
         reads ENVI standard format image files

                 $im = readenvi( filename );  # read image data
         ($im, $hdr) = readenvi( filename );  # read image data and hdr data hashref

         readenvi will look for an ENVI header file named filename.hdr

         If that file is not found, it will try with the windows
         convention of replacing the suffix of the filename by .hdr

         If valid header data is found, the image will be read and
         returned, with a ref to a hash of the hdr data in list
         context.

         NOTE: This routine only supports raw binary data at this time.
