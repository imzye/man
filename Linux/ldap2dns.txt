DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ldap2tinydns-conf command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page yet.

       ldap2tinydns-conf is a shell script to help configure ldap2dns for use with tinydns.  This script wil add the directory structure and files required to run ldap2dns under daemontools.

       Run this script within your tinydns directory.
       For example: root@host[/var/tinydns]# ldap2tinydns-conf

       This creates the ldap2tinydns directory under your tinydns directory and adds the default configuration under ldap2tinydns/env.
