SYNOPSIS
       pysol.py [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       PySolFC is a collection of more than 1200 solitaire card games.  It stands for PySol Fan Club Edition, as it is a fork of (the now unmaintained) PySol Solitaire.

       There are games that use the 52 card International Pattern deck, games for the 78 card Tarock deck, eight and ten suit Ganjifa games, Hanafuda games, Matrix games, Mahjongg games, and games for an
       original hexadecimal-based deck.

       Its features include modern look and feel (uses Ttk widget set), multiple cardsets and tableau backgrounds, sound, unlimited undo, player statistics, a hint system, demo games, a solitaire wizard,
       support for user written plug-ins, an integrated HTML help browser, and lots of documentation.

       The integrated help browser can be started by pressin <F1> after the program has launched.

       PySolFC is written in 100% pure Python and runs out-of-the-box on Unix (X11), MS Windows and Mac OS X platforms.
