NAME
       isnsdd - iSNS discovery daemon

SYNOPSIS
       isnsdd [-f] [-c filename] [-d debug-facility]

DESCRIPTION
       Isnsdd is a client side daemon for iSNS. It registers storage nodes and portals with the iSNS service, and refreshes these registrations in a timely manner.

       The  daemon  also  registers itself to receive SCN notifications, and processes these. It can be configured to invoke an external helper application for each status notification received. The path
       name of the helper application can be specified via the SCNCallout option in the configuration file.

OPTIONS
       By default, isnsd will take most of its settings from the configuration file /etc/isns/isnsdd.conf, with the addition of the following command line options:

       --config filename, -c filename
              This option overrides the default configuration file.

       --foreground,-f
              By default, isnsd will put itself into the background. By specifying this option, you can tell it to run in the foreground. Any error messages or debug output will be printed to the console
              rather than being sent to syslog.

       --role role
              This tells the discovery daemon in which capacity is should register itself with the iSNS server.  Role can be either initiator, or control.  The default is to register as an initiator.

              Registering target nodes needs to use a different mechanism, as the iSCSI target server needs to inform the discovery daemon about each exported target separately. This is  not  implemented
              yet.

       --debug facility, -d facility
              enables debugging. Valid facilities are
