NAME
       kea-lfc - Lease File Cleanup process in Kea

SYNOPSIS
       kea-lfc  [-4**|-6**]  [-c config-file] [-p pid-file] [-x previous-file]
       [-i copy-file] [-o output-file] [-f finish-file] [-v]  [-V]  [-W]  [-d]
       [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       The  kea-lfc  service  process  removes  redundant information from the
       files used to provide persistent storage for the memfile database back‐
       end.  The  service is written to run as a stand-alone process. While it
       can be started externally, there is usually no need to do this.  It  is
       run periodically by the Kea DHCP servers.

ARGUMENTS
       The arguments are as follows:

       -4 | -6
              Indicates  the  protocol  version  of  the  lease files; must be
              either 4 or 6.

       -c config-file
              Specifies the  file  with  the  configuration  for  the  kea-lfc
              process. It may also contain configuration entries for other Kea
              services. Currently kea-lfc gets all of its arguments  from  the
              command  line;  in the future it will be extended to obtain some
              arguments from the configuration file.

       -p pid-file
              Specifies the PID file. When  the  kea-lfc  process  starts,  it
              attempts  to  determine  if  another  instance of the process is
              already running by examining the PID file.  If  one  is  already
              running,  the  new process is terminated. If one is not running,
              Kea writes its PID into the PID file.

       -x previous-file
              Specifies the previous or ex-lease file.  When  kea-lfc  starts,
              this  is the result of any previous run of kea-lfc; when kea-lfc
              finishes, it is the result of this run.  If  kea-lfc  is  inter‐
              rupted before completing, this file may not exist.

       -i copy-file
              Specifies  the  input  or  copy  of  lease file. Before the DHCP
              server invokes kea-lfc, it will move the current lease file here
              and then call kea-lfc with this file.

       -o output-file
              Specifies  the  output  lease  file, which is the temporary file
              kea-lfc should use to write the leases. Once this file  is  fin‐
              ished writing, it is moved to the finish file (see below).

       -f finish-file
              Specifies  the finish or completion file, another temporary file
              kea-lfc uses for bookkeeping. When kea-lfc finishes writing  the
              output  file,  it moves it to this file name. After kea-lfc fin‐
              ishes deleting the other files (previous and  input),  it  moves
              this  file  to  the  previous lease file. By moving the files in
              this fashion, the kea-lfc and  the  DHCP  server  processes  can
              determine  the  correct file to use even if one of the processes
              was interrupted before completing its task.

       -v     Causes the version stamp to be printed.

       -V     Causes a longer form of the version stamp to be printed.

       -W     Displays the configuration report.

       -d     Sets the logging level to debug with extra  verbosity.  This  is
              primarily for development purposes in stand-alone mode.

       -h     Causes the usage string to be printed.

DOCUMENTATION
       Kea  comes  with  an  extensive Kea Administrator Reference Manual that
       covers all aspects of running the Kea software - compilation, installa‐
       tion,  configuration,  configuration  examples, and much more. Kea also
       features a Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible  messages  Kea
       can print with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
       available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea distribu‐
       tion.      The      Kea      documentation      is     available     at
       https://kb.isc.org/docs/kea-administrator-reference-manual .

       Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer's Guide. Its  online
       version is available at https://jenkins.isc.org/job/Kea_doc/doxygen/.

       The Kea project website is available at https://kea.isc.org.

MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT
       There  are  two  public  mailing  lists  available for the Kea project.
       kea-users (kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while
       kea-dev  (kea-dev  at  lists.isc.org)  is  intended for Kea developers,
       prospective contributors, and other  advanced  users.  Both  lists  are
       available  at https://lists.isc.org. The community provides best-effort
       support on both of those lists.

       ISC   provides   professional   support   for   Kea    services.    See
       https://www.isc.org/kea/ for details.

HISTORY
       The kea-lfc process was first coded in January 2015 by the ISC Kea/DHCP
       team.
