NAME
       $HOME/.abook/abookrc - configuration file for abook address book program

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the abookrc file.
       abookrc is the (optional) configuration file for use with the abook(1) address book program.

       abookrc is stored in a user's $HOME/.abook directory. It follows a format of “set option=value”.  The following information lists each of these options and the values they may take.

       If a variable is not set in abookrc , a sensible default, as listed with the description below, will be used.

       Comments in abookrc are on lines beginning with '#'.

COMMANDS
       set option = value

       field identifier = human_readable_name [ , type ]
              Defines a new custom field. type can be one of 'string' (default) , 'emails', 'list', or 'date'.

       view view name = field1 [ , field2, ... ]
              Defines a view/tab, with fieldN being the identifier of a field declared with the field command, or the identifier of a standard field.

                   name, email,
                   address, address2, city, state, zip, country,
                   phone, workphone, fax, mobile,
                   nick, url, notes, anniversary

              Note: if you don't define any view, abook will use a default display based on the above standard fields.

VARIABLES
       autosave=[true|false]
              Defines whether the addressbook is automatically saved on exit. Default is true.

       preserve_fields=[all|standard|none]
              Specifies how fields not declared with the field command nor in a view should be preserved while loading an abook database.

              all    preserve any completely unknown field.

              standard
                     only preserve the standard fields (see a list in the
                       description of the view command) and the legacy
                       'custom[1-5]' fields.

              {name:22}
                     displays the name field with a maximal width of 22 characters.

              {phone:-12|workphone|mobile}
                     displays (right aligned within a width of 13 characters), either the phone, workphone or mobile field, whichever being the first to be non-empty.
