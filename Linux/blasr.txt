NAME
       sawriter - generate suffix arrays for nucleotide sequences

SYNOPSIS
       sawriter saOut fastaIn [fastaIn2 fastaIn3 ...] [-blt p] [-larsson] [-4bit] [-manmy] [-kar]

       sawriter fastaIn  (writes to fastIn.sa).

OPTIONS
       -blt p      Build a lookup table on prefixes of length 'p'. This speeds

              up lookups considerably (more than the LCP table), but misses matches less than p when searching.

       -4bit  Read in (one) fasta file as a compressed sequence file.

       -larsson
              (default)  Uses the method of Larsson and Sadakane to build the array.

       -mamy  Uses the method of MAnber and MYers to build the array (slower than larsson,

              and produces the same result. This is mainly for double checking the correctness of larsson).

       -kark  Use Karkkainen DS3 method for building the suffix array.  This will probably be more slow than larsson, but takes only an extra N/(sqrt 3) extra space.

       -mafe  (disabled for now!) Use the lightweight construction algorithm from Manzini and Ferragina

       -welter
              Use lightweight (sort of light) suffix array construction.  This is a bit more slow than normal larsson.

       -welterweight N use a difference cover of size N for building the suffix array.
              Valid values are 7,32,64,111, and 2281.
