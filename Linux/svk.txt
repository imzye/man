NAME
       svk - A Distributed Version Control System

SYNOPSIS
       svk command [options] [args]

DESCRIPTION
       SVK is a decentralized version control system written in Perl.  It uses the Subversion filesystem but provides additional features:

       •   Offline operations like "checkin", "log", "merge".

       •   Distributed branches.

       •   Lightweight checkout copy management (no .svn directories).

       •   Advanced merge algorithms, like star-merge and cherry picking.

       For more information about the SVK project, visit <http://svk.bestpractical.com/>.

       Run "svk help" to access the built-in tool documentation.

       By default svk stores its state in the .svk directory in your home directory. You can change this default by setting the SVKROOT environment variable to your preferred svk depot path.
