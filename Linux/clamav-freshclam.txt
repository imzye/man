NAME
       freshclam.conf - Configuration file for Clam AntiVirus database update tool

DESCRIPTION
       The file freshclam.conf configures the Clam AntiVirus Database Updater, freshclam(1).

FILE FORMAT
       The  file  consists  of comments and options with arguments. Each line which starts with a hash (#) symbol is ignored by the parser. Options and arguments are case sensitive and of the form Option
       Argument. The arguments are of the following types:

       BOOL   Boolean value (yes/no or true/false or 1/0).

       STRING String without blank characters.

       SIZE   Size in bytes. You can use 'M' or 'm' modifiers for megabytes and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes.

       NUMBER Unsigned integer.

DIRECTIVES
       When an option is not used (hashed or doesn't exist in the configuration file) freshclam takes a default action.

       Example
              If this option is set freshclam will not run.

       LogFileMaxSize SIZE
              Limit the size of the log file. The logger will be automatically disabled if the file is greater than SIZE. Value of 0 disables the limit.
              Default: 1M

       LogTime BOOL
              Log time with each message.
              Default: no

       LogSyslog BOOL
              Enable logging to Syslog. May be used in combination with UpdateLogFile.
              Default: disabled.

       LogFacility STRING
              Specify the type of syslog messages - please refer to 'man syslog' for facility names.
              Default: LOG_LOCAL6

       LogVerbose BOOL
              Enable verbose logging.
              Default: disabled

       LogRotate BOOL
              Rotate log file. Requires LogFileMaxSize option set prior to this option.
              Default: no

       PidFile STRING
              Write the daemon's pid to the specified file.
              Default: disabled

       DatabaseDirectory STRING
              Path to a directory containing database files.  This directory must already exist, be an absolute path, be writeable by freshclam and readable by clamd/clamscan.
              Default: /var/lib/clamav

       Foreground BOOL
              Don't fork into background.
              Default: no

       Debug BOOL
              Enable debug messages in libclamav.
              Default: no

       UpdateLogFile STRING
              Enable logging to a specified file. Highly recommended.
              Default: disabled.

       DatabaseOwner STRING
              When started by root, drop privileges to a specified user.
              Default: clamav

       Checks NUMBER
              Number of database checks per day.
              Default: 12

       DNSDatabaseInfo STRING
              Use DNS to verify the virus database version. FreshClam uses DNS TXT records to verify the versions of the database and software itself. With this directive you can change the database ver‐
              ification domain.
              WARNING: Please don't change it unless you're configuring freshclam to use your own database verification domain.
              Default: enabled, pointing to current.cvd.clamav.net

       DatabaseMirror STRING
              DatabaseMirror specifies to which mirror(s) freshclam should connect. You should have at least one entries: database.clamav.net.  Now that CloudFlare is being used as our  Content  Delivery
              Network (CDN), this one domain name works world-wide to direct freshclam to the closest geographic endpoint.
              Default: database.clamav.net

       PrivateMirror STR
              This  option  allows you to easily point freshclam to private mirrors. If PrivateMirror is set, freshclam does not attempt to use DNS to determine whether its databases are out-of-date, in‐
              stead it will use the If-Modified-Since request or directly check the headers of the remote database files. For each database, freshclam first attempts to download the  CLD  file.  If  that
              fails, it tries to download the CVD file. This option overrides DatabaseMirror, DNSDatabaseInfo and ScriptedUpdates. It can be used multiple times to provide fall-back mirrors.
              Default: disabled

       MaxAttempts NUMBER
              How many attempts (per mirror) to make before giving up.
              Default: 3 (per mirror)

       ScriptedUpdates BOOL
              With this option you can control scripted updates. It's highly recommended to keep it enabled.
              Default: yes

       TestDatabases BOOL
              With this option enabled, freshclam will attempt to load new databases into memory to make sure they are properly handled by libclamav before replacing the old ones.
              Default: enabled

       CompressLocalDatabase BOOL
              By  default  freshclam will keep the local databases (.cld) uncompressed to make their handling faster. With this option you can enable the compression; the change will take effect with the
              next database update.
              Default: no

       ExtraDatabase STRING
              Download an additional 3rd party signature database distributed through the ClamAV mirrors. This option can be used multiple times.
              Default: disabled

       ExcludeDatabase STRING
              Exclude a standard signature database (opt-out). This option can be used multiple times.
              Default: disabled

       DatabaseCustomURL STRING
              With this option you can provide custom sources for database files. This option can be used multiple times.  Support for:
                http(s)://, ftp(s)://, or file:// Example usage:
                DatabaseCustomURL https://myserver.com:4567/allow_list.wdb
              Default: disabled

       HTTPProxyServer STR, HTTPProxyPort NUMBER
              Use given proxy server and TCP port for database downloads.  The HTTPProxyServer may be prefixed with [scheme]:// to specify which kind of proxy is used.
                http://     HTTP Proxy. Default when no scheme or proxy type is specified.
                https://    HTTPS Proxy. (Added in 7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS)
                socks4://   SOCKS4 Proxy.
                socks4a://  SOCKS4a Proxy. Proxy resolves URL hostname.
                socks5://   SOCKS5 Proxy.
                socks5h://  SOCKS5 Proxy. Proxy resolves URL hostname.

       HTTPProxyUsername STR,HTTPProxyPassword STRING
              Proxy usage is authenticated through given username and password.
              Default: disabled

       HTTPUserAgent STRING
              If your servers are behind a firewall/proxy which applies User-Agent filtering, you can use this option to force the use of a different User-Agent header.  As of ClamAV 0.103.3,  this  set‐
              ting may not be used when updating from the clamav.net CDN and can only be used when updating from a private mirror.
              Default: clamav/version_number

       NotifyClamd STRING
              Notify a running clamd(8) to reload its database after a download has occurred. The path for clamd.conf file must be provided.
              Default: The default is to not notify clamd. See clamd.conf(5)'s option SelfCheck for how clamd(8) handles database updates in this case.

       OnUpdateExecute STRING
              Execute this command after the database has been successfully updated.
              Default: disabled

       OnErrorExecute STRING
              Execute this command after a database update has failed.
              Default: disabled

       OnOutdatedExecute STRING
              Execute this command when freshclam reports outdated version. In the command string %v will be replaced by the new version number.
              Default: disabled

       LocalIPAddress IP
              Use IP as client address for downloading databases. Useful for multi homed systems.
              Default: Use OS'es default outgoing IP address.

       ConnectTimeout NUMBER
              Timeout in seconds when connecting to database server.
              Default: 10

       ReceiveTimeout NUMBER
              Maximum time in seconds for each download operation. 0 means no timeout.
              Default: 0

       Bytecode BOOL
              This option enables downloading of bytecode.cvd, which includes additional detection mechanisms and improvements to the ClamAV engine.
              Default: yes
