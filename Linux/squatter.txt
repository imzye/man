DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          The  name "squatter" once referred both to the SQUAT indexing engine
          and to the command used to create indexes.  Now that Cyrus  supports
          more  than one index type -- SQUAT and Xapian, as of this writing --
          the name "squatter" refers to the command used to control index cre‐
          ation.  The terms "SQUAT" or "SQUAT index(es)" refers to the indexes
          used by the older SQUAT indexing engine.  Post v3 the  search_engine
          setting in imapd.conf determines which search engine is used.

       squatter  creates a new text index for one or more IMAP mailboxes.  The
       index is a unified index of all of the header and  body  text  of  each
       message in a given mailbox.  This index is used to significantly reduce
       IMAP SEARCH times on a mailbox.

       mode is one of indexer, search, rolling, synclog, compact or audit.

       By default, squatter creates an index of ALL messages in  the  mailbox,
       not  just  those since the last time that it was run.  The -i option is
       used to select incremental updates.  Any messages appended to the mail‐
       box  after  squatter is run, will NOT be included in the index.  To in‐
       clude new messages in the index, squatter must be run again,  or  on  a
       regular   basis  via  crontab,  an  entry  in  the  EVENTS  section  of
       cyrus.conf(5) or use rolling mode (-R).

       In the first synopsis, squatter indexes all mailboxes.

       In the second synopsis, squatter  indexes  the  specified  mailbox(es).
       The mailboxes are space-separated.

       In  the  third  synopsis,  squatter indexes the specified user(s) mail‐
       box(es).

       For the latter two index modes (mailbox, user) one may optionally spec‐
       ify  -r to recurse from the specified start, or -a to limit action only
       to mailboxes which have the shared /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat  anno‐
       tation set to "true".

       In  the  fourth  synopsis, squatter runs in rolling mode.  In this mode
       squatter backgrounds itself and runs as a daemon (unless  -d  is  set),
       listening  to a sync log channel chosen using the -n option, and set up
       using the sync_log_channels setting in imapd.conf(5).  Very soon  after
       messages are delivered or uploaded to mailboxes squatter will incremen‐
       tally index the affected mailbox (see notes, below).

       In the fifth synopsis, squatter reads a single sync log file  and  per‐
       forms  incremental indexing on the mailbox(es) listed therein.  This is
       sometimes useful for cleaning up after problems with rolling mode.

       In the sixth synopsis, squatter will compact indices from srctier(s) to
       desttier, optionally reindexing (-X) or filtering expunged records (-F)
       in the process.  The optional -T flag may be used to specify  a  direc‐
       tory  to  use  for  temporary files.  These files are eventually copied
       with rsync -a and then removed by rm.  rsync can increase the load  av‐
       erage  of  the  system,  especially  when the temporary directory is on
       tmpfs.  To throttle  rsync  it  is  possible  to  modify  the  call  in
       imap/search_xapian.c and pass -\-bwlimit=<number> as further parameter.
       The -o flag may be used to direct that a single index be copied, rather
       than  compacted,  from srctier to desttier.  The -u flag may be used to
       restrict operation to the specified user(s).

       For all modes, the -S option may  be  specified,  causing  squatter  to
       pause seconds seconds after each mailbox, to smooth loads.

       When  using  the  Xapian engine the -Z option may be specified, for the
       indexing modes.  This tells squatter to consult the  Xapian  internally
       indexed  GUIDs,  rather  than  relying  on  what's  stored in cyrus.in‐
       dexed.db, allowing for recovery from  broken  cyrus.indexed.db  at  the
       sacrifice of efficiency.

       NOTE:
          Incremental  updates  are very inefficient with the SQUAT search en‐
          gine.  If using SQUAT for large and active mailboxes, you should run
          squatter periodically as an EVENT in cyrus.conf(5).

       NOTE:
          Messages  and  mailboxes  that  have  not  been indexed CAN still be
          SEARCHed, just not as quickly as those with an index.

       squatter reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)  file
       unless specified otherwise by -C.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -a     Only create indexes for mailboxes which have  the  shared  /ven‐
              dor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat annotation set to "true".

              The value of the /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat annotation is in‐
              herited by all children of the given mailbox, so an entire mail‐
              box tree can be indexed (or not indexed) by setting a single an‐
              notation on the root of that tree with a  value  of  "true"  (or
              "false").     If    a    mailbox   does   not   have   a   /ven‐
              dor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat annotation set on it (or does not  in‐
              herit one), then the mailbox is not indexed. In other words, the
              implicit value of /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat is "false".

       -A     Missing documentation, starts audit mode.  This feature is  only
              available on the master branch.

       -d     In  rolling  mode,  don't background and do emit log messages on
              standard error.  Useful for debugging.  This feature was  intro‐
              duced in version 3.0.

       -F     In  compact  mode, filter the resulting database to only include
              messages which are  not  expunged  in  mailboxes  with  existing
              name/uidvalidity.  This feature was introduced in version 3.0.

       -f synclogfile
              Read  the  synclogfile and incrementally index all the mailboxes
              listed therein, then exit.  This feature was introduced in  ver‐
              sion 3.0.

       -h     Display this usage information.

       -i     Incremental updates where indexes already exist.

       -N name
              Only index mailboxes beginning with name while iterating through
              the mailbox list derived from other options.

       -n channel
              In rolling mode, specify the name of the sync log  channel  that
              squatter will listen to.  The default is "squatter".  This chan‐
              nel must be defined in imapd.conf(5) before  being  used.   This
              feature was introduced in version 3.0.

       -o     In  compact  mode, if only one source database is selected, just
              copy it to the destination rather than compacting.  This feature
              was introduced in version 3.0.

       -P     Missing documentation, reindex parts mode.  This feature is only
              available on the master branch.

       -R     Run in rolling mode; squatter runs as a daemon  listening  to  a
              sync  log  channel and continuously incrementally indexing mail‐
              boxes.  See also -d and -n.  This feature was introduced in ver‐
              sion 3.0.

       -r     Recursively  create  indexes  for all sub-mailboxes of the user,
              mailboxes or mailbox prefixes given as arguments.

       -S seconds
              After processing each mailbox, sleep for "seconds"  before  con‐
              tinuing.  Can  be  used to provide some load balancing.  Accepts
              fractional amounts. This feature was introduced in version 3.0.

       -T directory
              When indexing, work on a temporary copy  of  the  search  engine
              databases  in  directory.   That directory would typically be on
              some very fast filesystem, like an SSD or  tmpfs.   This  option
              may not work with all search engines, but it's only effect is to
              speed up initial indexing.  Xapian only.  This feature  was  in‐
              troduced in version 3.0.

       -t srctier...
              In compact mode, the comma-separated source tier(s) for the com‐
              pacted indices.  At least one source tier must be  specified  in
              compact mode.  Xapian only.  This feature was introduced in ver‐
              sion 3.0.

       -u     Extra options refer to usernames (e.g. foo@bar.com) rather  than
              mailbox names.  Usernames are space-separated.  This feature was
              introduced in version 3.0.

       -U     In compact mode, only  compact  if  re-indexing.   Xapian  only.
              This feature is only available on the master branch.

       -v     Increase  the  verbosity of progress/status messages.  Sometimes
              additional messages are emitted on the terminal with this option
              and  the messages are unconditionally sent to syslog.  Sometimes
              messages are sent to syslog, only if -v is provided.  In rolling
              and synclog modes, -vv sends even more messages to syslog.

       -X     Reindex all the messages before compacting.  This mode reads all
              the lists of messages indexed by the listed  tiers,  and  re-in‐
              dexes them into a temporary database before compacting that into
              place.  Xapian only.  This feature  was  introduced  in  version
              3.0.

       -z desttier
              In compact mode, the destination tier for the compacted indices.
              This must be specified in compact mode.  Xapian only.  This fea‐
              ture was introduced in version 3.0.

       -Z     When  indexing  messages, use the Xapian internal cyrusid rather
              than referencing the ranges of already indexed messages to  know
              if  a  particular  message is indexed.  Useful if the ranges get
              out of sync with the actual messages (e.g. if files  on  a  tier
              are  lost)  Xapian  only.  This feature is only available on the
              master branch.

EXAMPLES
       squatter is typically deployed via entries in cyrus.conf(5), in  either
       the DAEMON or EVENTS sections.

       For  the  older  SQUAT  search engine, which offers poor performance in
       rolling mode (-R) we recommend triggering periodic runs via entries  in
       the EVENTS section, as follows:

       Sample  entries  from  the EVENTS section of cyrus.conf(5) for periodic
       squatter runs:

          EVENTS {
              # reindex changed mailboxes (fulltext) approximately every three hours
              squatter1   cmd="/usr/bin/ionice -c idle /usr/lib/cyrus/bin/squatter -i" period=180

              # reindex all mailboxes (fulltext) daily
              squattera   cmd="/usr/lib/cyrus/bin/squatter" at=0117
          }

       For the newer Xapian search engine, and with sufficiently fast storage,
       the  rolling mode (-R) offers advantages.  Use of rolling mode requires
       that squatter be invoked in the DAEMON section.

       Sample entries for the DAEMON  section  of  cyrus.conf(5)  for  rolling
       squatter operation:

          DAEMON {
            # run a rolling squatter using the default sync_log channel "squatter"
            squatter cmd="squatter -R"

            # run a rolling squatter using a specific sync_log channel
            squatter cmd="squatter -R -n indexer"
          }

       NOTE:
          When  using  the -R rolling mode, you MUST enable sync_log operation
          in imapd.conf(5) via the sync_log: on setting,  and  MUST  define  a
          sync_log  channel via the sync_log_channels: setting.  If also using
          replication, you must either  explicitly  specify  your  replication
          sync_log channel via the sync_log_channels directive with a name, or
          specify the default empty name with  ""  (the  two-character  string
          U+22 U+22).  [Please see imapd.conf(5) for details].

       NOTE:
          When configuring rolling search indexing on a replica, one must con‐
          sider whether sync_logs will be  written  at  all.   In  this  case,
          please  consider the setting sync_log_unsuppressable_channels to en‐
          sure that the sync_log channel upon which  one's  squatter  instance
          depends will continue to be written.  See imapd.conf(5) for details.

       NOTE:
          When  using  the  Xapian search engine, you must define various set‐
          tings in imapd.conf(5).  Please read all relevant Xapian  documenta‐
          tion in this release before using Xapian.

       [NB: More examples needed]
