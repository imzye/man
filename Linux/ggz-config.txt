DESCRIPTION
       The program ggz-config is a central tool and part  of  the  client  li‐
       braries  package  of  the  GGZ Gaming Zone.  It can be used for several
       purposes.  Primarily it is used to maintain the ggz.modules  configura‐
       tion  file by installing and removing game module information.  This is
       done with the --install and --remove modes of operation.

       Additionally, the program can query the installation  settings  of  the
       GGZ  client  libraries  to assist in configuring the build process of a
       client or game module.

OPTIONS
       Query Mode Options

       -c, --configdir
              Output location of the GGZ client libraries configuration direc‐
              tory  and  exit.  This value will usually be @ggzconfdir@ and is
              where the file ggz.modules is located.

       -g, --gamedir
              Output location of the executable game modules and  exit.   Game
              modules in this directory are all game clients which are not in‐
              stalled into a standard PATH directory, mostly because they only
              run  when invoked by a GGZ core client. As a special module, the
              game client wrapper ggzwrap is installed into this  place.   The
              gamedir is usually @ggzexecmoddir@.

       -d, --datadir
              Output location of game module data directory and exit.  This is
              where games look for their graphics and level data.   This  will
              likely resolve to @ggzdatadir@.

       -p, --protocol
              Query  GGZ_CS_PROTO_VERSION  -  version of core protocol between
              the GGZ server and any GGZ core clients.

       -h, --help
              Output help information and exit.

       -u, --usage
              Print some ggz-config usage scenarios for quick reference.

       -v, --version
              Output version information and exit.

       Install Mode Options

       --install
              Specifies that we are installing a game module description.

       --modfile=FILENAME
              Specifies the source module description file.  FILENAME will of‐
              ten be named module.dsc, but this is merely a convention.

       --force
              Overwrite  an existing module entry of the same name, author and
              version rather than returning an error.

       -D, --destdir
              Specifies that the $DESTDIR environment variable contains a  di‐
              rectory  to prepend to the path for the GGZ module configuration
              file (ggz.modules).  The only known purpose for this is for cre‐
              ating binary packages of GGZ games.

       Uninstall Mode Options

       --remove
              Specifies that we are removing a game module description.

       --modfile=FILENAME
              Specifies the source module description file.

FILES
       @ggzconfdir@/ggz.modules
              Game module registry for all GGZ Gaming Zone core clients.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DESTDIR
              Used during install process, most commonly by the build sequence
              of binary packages such as rpm or dpkg.

BUGS
       The program is currently unable to  detect  many  problems  that  could
       arise with an invalid ggz.modules file.

       Probably others, too numerous to mention.
