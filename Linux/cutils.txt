NAME
       cundecl — encode C type declarations

SYNOPSIS
       cundecl [-V] [-o file] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The cundecl utility reads a verbose english description and produces a C type declaration.  Casts are accepted as well.

       The options are as follows:

       -o file
               Set the output destination to file.

       -V      Print version information on standard output then exit.

EXAMPLES
       declare s as pointer to char;
       declare x as function (fmt as pointer to const char, ...) returning int;
       cast s into pointer to const char;
       cast f into pointer to function (int) returning void;

SEE ALSO
       cdecl(1)

STANDARDS
       The cundecl utility is expected to be ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”) compatible.
