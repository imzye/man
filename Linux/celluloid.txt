NAME
       celluloid - A simple GTK+ frontend for mpv

SYNOPSIS
       celluloid [options...]  [filenames|URIs]

DESCRIPTION
       Celluloid is a simple GTK+ frontend for mpv.  Celluloid interacts with mpv via the client API exported by libmpv, allowing access to mpv's powerful playback capabilities.

OPTIONS
       -?, -h, --help
              Show help options.

       --new-window
              Create a new window if there is already a running instance. The option has no effect otherwise.

       --enqueue
              Append the given files or URIs to the playlist if there is a running instance.  The option has no effect otherwise.

       --mpv-MPVOPTION=VALUE
              Set mpv option MPVOPTION to VALUE. For example, --mpv-vf=vflip will set the mpv option vf to vflip. This is equivalent to passing --vf=vflip to mpv.

       --version
              Print the release version and exit.
