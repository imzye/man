NAME
       gpgme-tool - Assuan server exposing GnuPG Made Easy operations

SYNOPSIS
       gpgme-tool [--server|-s] [--gpgme-binary=FILE] [--lib-version] [--usage] [--version|-V] [--help|-?]

DESCRIPTION
       gpgme-tool  is  a test interface that can exercise the library functionality of GPGME. It is not currently intended for production use, but it can be a useful way to dynamically understand and ex‐
       periment with the functionality available from the library.

       Running this tool in Server mode (the default mode) results in a text-based, command-driven session.  When the tool produces (on its standard output) a line beginning with OK or ERR, you can  pro‐
       vide it with a command on its standard input.  Try the command HELP to see a list of available commands.  Commands are case-insensitive.

       Status lines begin with an S, and data lines begin with a D.

OPTIONS
       gpgme-tool accepts the following options on the command line:

       OPTIONS

       -s,--server
              Server mode (default)

       --gpg-binary=FILE

       --lib-version
