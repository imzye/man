NAME
       minimodem - general-purpose software audio FSK modem

SYNOPSIS
       minimodem --tx [options] {baudmode}
       minimodem --rx [options] {baudmode}

DESCRIPTION
       Minimodem  is  a command-line program which decodes (or generates) audio modem tones at any specified baud rate, using various framing protocols.  It acts a general-purpose software FSK modem, and
       includes support for various standard FSK protocols such as Bell103, Bell202, RTTY, TTY/TDD, NOAA SAME, and Caller-ID.

       Minimodem can play and capture audio modem tones in real-time via the system audio device, or in batched mode via audio files.

       Minimodem can be used to transfer data between nearby computers using an audio cable (or just via sound waves), or between remote computers using radio, telephone, or another audio  communications
       medium.

TX/RX MODE
       -t, --tx, --transmit, --write
              transmit mode: generate audio tones

       -r, --rx, --receive, --read
              receive mode: decode audio tones

{baudmode}
       The required {baudmode} parameter may be any floating-point value to specify a baud rate, or any of the special keywords listed below.  The {baudmode} also implies certain other parameter defaults
       depending on the rate, including standard (or at least reasonable) default mark and space tone frequencies.

       {any floating point value N}
              : Bell202-style at N bps --ascii

       1200   : Bell202 1200 bps --ascii

       300    : Bell103 300 bps --ascii

       rtty   : RTTY 45.45 bps --baudot --stopbits 1.5

       tdd    : TTY/TDD 45.45 bps --baudot --stopbits 2.0

       same   : SAME 520.83 bps --startbits 0 --stopbits 0 --sync-byte 0xAB
                   NOAA Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) protocol

       callerid
              : Bell202 1200 bps Caller-ID (MDMF or SDMF) protocol

       uic-train
              : UIC-751-3 600 bps train-to-ground message protocol

       uic-ground
              : UIC-751-3 600 bps ground-to-train message protocol

OPTIONS
       -a, --auto-carrier
              Automatically detect mark and space frequences from carrier.

       -i, --inverted
              Invert the mark and space frequencies (applies whether the frequencies are defaults, discovered by --auto-carrier, or specified manually).

       -c, --confidence min-confidence-threshold
              Set receive confidence minimum threshold (default 1.5).  The "confidence" value is a metric based primarily on the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of the received signal.  This value acts as an
              FSK  decoder "squelch" control.  Increase to accept only very clean signals (up to INFINITY, but a value around 5.0 is more practical).  Decrease to accept partial decoding of noisy signals
              (down to a minimum value of 1.0).  (This option applies to --rx mode only).  -l, --limit max-confidence-search-limit Set receive confidence maximum search limit (default 2.3).  The  "confi‐
              dence"  value  is as described above.  This value acts as a performance vs. analysis quality control.  Increase (up to INFINITY) for a more pedantic analysis and higher CPU usage.  Decrease
              (down to the min-confidence-threshold) for a sloppier analysis, with lower CPU usage.  (This option applies to --rx mode only).

       -8, --ascii
              ASCII  8-N-1

       -5, --baudot
              Baudot 5-N-1.5

       -f, --file filename.wav
              encode or decode an audio file (extension sets audio format)

       -b, --bandwidth {rx_bandwidth}

       -v, --volume {tx_amplitude or 'E'}
              Sets the generated signal amplitude (default is 1.0).  As a special case useful for testing, the value 'E' sets the amplitude to the very small value FLT_EPSILON.  (This option  applies  to
              --tx mode only).

       -M, --mark {mark_freq}

       -S, --space {space_freq}

       --startbits {n}
              Sets the number of start bits (default is 1 for most baudmodes).

       --stopbits {n.n}
              Sets the number of stop bits (default is 1.0 for most baudmodes).

       --sync-byte {0xXX}
              If this option is used, initial carrier acquisition will be suppressed until after one or more consecutive data frame(s) containing this value are received.  This can be used to synchronize
              the stream for protocols which include a fixed preamble byte.  (This option applies to --rx mode only).

       -q, --quiet
              Do not report CARRIER / NOCARRIER or signal analysis metrics.

       -R, --samplerate {rate}
              Set the audio sample rate (default rate is 48000 Hz).

       -A, --alsa[={plughw:X,Y | X,Y | X }]
              Use ALSA as the audio output system instead of the default PulseAudio (depending on build configuration options).  The ALSA device alias "default" is used, if a specific device is not spec‐
              ified.  For example, the following options all select ALSA device #1, sub-device #0:
               --alsa=plughw:1,0  --alsa=1,0  -A1

       --lut={tx_sin_table_len}
              Minimodem  uses  a  precomputed  sine wave lookup table of 1024 elements, or the size specified here.  Use --lut=0 to disable the use of the sine wave lookup table.  (This option applies to
              --tx mode only).

       --float-samples
              Generate 32-bit floating-point format audio samples, instead of the default 16-bit signed integer format (applies to --tx mode only; --rx mode always uses 32-bit floating-point).

       --rx-one
              Quit after the first carrier/no-carrier event (applies to --rx mode only).

       --binary-output
              Print received data bits as raw binary output using characters '0' and '1'.  The bits are printed in the order they are received.  Framing bits (start and stop bits) are  omitted  from  the
              output.  (This option applies to --rx mode only).

       --binary-raw {nbits}
              Print  all received bits (data bits and any framing bits) as raw binary output using characters '0' and '1'.  Framing bits are not interpreted, but simply passed through to the output.  The
              bits are printed in the order they are received, in lines {nbits} wide.  So in order to display a standard 8-N-1 bitstream (8 databits + 1 start bit + 1 stop bit), use "--binary-raw 10"
               or a multiple of 10.  (This option applies to --rx mode only).

       --print-filter
              Filter the received text output, replacing any "non-printable" bytes with a '.' character.  (This option applies to --rx mode only).

       --tx-carrier
              When transmitting from a blocking source, keep a carrier going while waiting for more data.

       --benchmarks
              Run and report internal performance tests (all other flags are ignored).

       -V, --version
              print program version
