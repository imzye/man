NAME
       scrcpy - Display and control your Android device

SYNOPSIS
       scrcpy [options]

DESCRIPTION
       scrcpy provides display and control of Android devices connected on USB (or over TCP/IP). It does not require any root access.

OPTIONS
       --always-on-top
              Make scrcpy window always on top (above other windows).

       -b, --bit-rate value
              Encode the video at the given bit-rate, expressed in bits/s. Unit suffixes are supported: 'K' (x1000) and 'M' (x1000000).

              Default is 8000000.

       --codec-options key[:type]=value[,...]
              Set a list of comma-separated key:type=value options for the device encoder.

              The possible values for 'type' are 'int' (default), 'long', 'float' and 'string'.

              The list of possible codec options is available in the Android documentation https://d.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat.

       --crop width:height:x:y
              Crop the device screen on the server.

              The values are expressed in the device natural orientation (typically, portrait for a phone, landscape for a tablet). Any --max-size value is computed on the cropped size.

       -d, --select-usb
              Use USB device (if there is exactly one, like adb -d).

              Also see -e (--select-tcpip).

       --disable-screensaver
              Disable screensaver while scrcpy is running.

       --display id
              Specify the display id to mirror.

              The list of possible display ids can be listed by "adb shell dumpsys display" (search "mDisplayId=" in the output).

              Default is 0.

       --display-buffer ms
              Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before displaying. This increases latency to compensate for jitter.

              Default is 0 (no buffering).

       -e, --select-tcpip
              Use TCP/IP device (if there is exactly one, like adb -e).

              Also see -d (--select-usb).

       --encoder name
              Use a specific MediaCodec encoder (must be a H.264 encoder).

       --force-adb-forward
              Do not attempt to use "adb reverse" to connect to the device.

       --forward-all-clicks
              By default, right-click triggers BACK (or POWER on) and middle-click triggers HOME. This option disables these shortcuts and forward the clicks to the device instead.

       -f, --fullscreen
              Start in fullscreen.

       -h, --help
              Print this help.

       -K, --hid-keyboard
              Simulate a physical keyboard by using HID over AOAv2.

              This provides a better experience for IME users, and allows to generate non-ASCII characters, contrary to the default injection method.

              It may only work over USB.

              The keyboard layout must be configured (once and for all) on the device, via Settings -> System -> Languages and input -> Physical keyboard. This settings page can be started directly:

                  adb shell am start -a android.settings.HARD_KEYBOARD_SETTINGS

              However, the option is only available when the HID keyboard is enabled (or a physical keyboard is connected).

              Also see --hid-mouse.

       --legacy-paste
              Inject computer clipboard text as a sequence of key events on Ctrl+v (like MOD+Shift+v).

              This is a workaround for some devices not behaving as expected when setting the device clipboard programmatically.

       --lock-video-orientation[=value]
              Lock  video orientation to value. Possible values are "unlocked", "initial" (locked to the initial orientation), 0, 1, 2 and 3. Natural device orientation is 0, and each increment adds
              a 90 degrees rotation counterclockwise.

              Default is "unlocked".

              Passing the option without argument is equivalent to passing "initial".

       --max-fps value
              Limit the framerate of screen capture (officially supported since Android 10, but may work on earlier versions).

       -m, --max-size value
              Limit both the width and height of the video to value. The other dimension is computed so that the device aspect-ratio is preserved.

              Default is 0 (unlimited).

       -M, --hid-mouse
              Simulate a physical mouse by using HID over AOAv2.

              In this mode, the computer mouse is captured to control the device directly (relative mouse mode).

              LAlt, LSuper or RSuper toggle the capture mode, to give control of the mouse back to the computer.

              It may only work over USB.

              Also see --hid-keyboard.

       --no-cleanup
              By default, scrcpy removes the server binary from the device and restores the device state (show touches, stay awake and power mode) on exit.

              This option disables this cleanup.

       --no-clipboard-autosync
              By default, scrcpy automatically synchronizes the computer clipboard to the device clipboard before injecting Ctrl+v, and the device clipboard to the  computer  clipboard  whenever  it
              changes.

              This option disables this automatic synchronization.

       --no-downsize-on-error
              By default, on MediaCodec error, scrcpy automatically tries again with a lower definition.

              This option disables this behavior.

       -n, --no-control
              Disable device control (mirror the device in read-only).

       -N, --no-display
              Do not display device (only when screen recording is enabled).

       --no-key-repeat
              Do not forward repeated key events when a key is held down.

       --no-mipmaps
              If the renderer is OpenGL 3.0+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+, then mipmaps are automatically generated to improve downscaling quality. This option disables the generation of mipmaps.

       --no-power-on
              Do not power on the device on start.

       --otg  Run in OTG mode: simulate physical keyboard and mouse, as if the computer keyboard and mouse were plugged directly to the device via an OTG cable.

              In this mode, adb (USB debugging) is not necessary, and mirroring is disabled.

              LAlt, LSuper or RSuper toggle the mouse capture mode, to give control of the mouse back to the computer.

              If any of --hid-keyboard or --hid-mouse is set, only enable keyboard or mouse respectively, otherwise enable both.

              It may only work over USB.

              See --hid-keyboard and --hid-mouse.

       -p, --port port[:port]
              Set the TCP port (range) used by the client to listen.

              Default is 27183:27199.

       --power-off-on-close
              Turn the device screen off when closing scrcpy.

       --prefer-text
              Inject alpha characters and space as text events instead of key events.

              This avoids issues when combining multiple keys to enter special characters, but breaks the expected behavior of alpha keys in games (typically WASD).

       --print-fps
              Start FPS counter, to print framerate logs to the console. It can be started or stopped at any time with MOD+i.

       --push-target path
              Set the target directory for pushing files to the device by drag & drop. It is passed as-is to "adb push".

              Default is "/sdcard/Download/".

       --raw-key-events
              Inject key events for all input keys, and ignore text events.

       -r, --record file
              Record screen to file.

              The format is determined by the --record-format option if set, or by the file extension (.mp4 or .mkv).

       --record-format format
              Force recording format (either mp4 or mkv).

       --render-driver name
              Request SDL to use the given render driver (this is just a hint).

              Supported names are currently "direct3d", "opengl", "opengles2", "opengles", "metal" and "software".

              https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_HINT_RENDER_DRIVER

       --rotation value
              Set the initial display rotation. Possibles values are 0, 1, 2 and 3. Each increment adds a 90 degrees rotation counterclockwise.

       -s, --serial number
              The device serial number. Mandatory only if several devices are connected to adb.

       --shortcut-mod key[+...]][,...]
              Specify the modifiers to use for scrcpy shortcuts. Possible keys are "lctrl", "rctrl", "lalt", "ralt", "lsuper" and "rsuper".

              A shortcut can consist in several keys, separated by '+'. Several shortcuts can be specified, separated by ','.

              For example, to use either LCtrl+LAlt or LSuper for scrcpy shortcuts, pass "lctrl+lalt,lsuper".

              Default is "lalt,lsuper" (left-Alt or left-Super).

       --tcpip[=ip[:port]]
              Configure and reconnect the device over TCP/IP.

              If a destination address is provided, then scrcpy connects to this address before starting. The device must listen on the given TCP port (default is 5555).

              If  no destination address is provided, then scrcpy attempts to find the IP address and adb port of the current device (typically connected over USB), enables TCP/IP mode if necessary,
              then connects to this address before starting.

       -S, --turn-screen-off
              Turn the device screen off immediately.

       -t, --show-touches
              Enable "show touches" on start, restore the initial value on exit.

              It only shows physical touches (not clicks from scrcpy).

       --tunnel-host ip
              Set the IP address of the adb tunnel to reach the scrcpy server. This option automatically enables --force-adb-forward.

              Default is localhost.

       --tunnel-port port
              Set the TCP port of the adb tunnel to reach the scrcpy server. This option automatically enables --force-adb-forward.

              Default is 0 (not forced): the local port used for establishing the tunnel will be used.

       --v4l2-sink /dev/videoN
              Output to v4l2loopback device.

              It requires to lock the video orientation (see --lock-video-orientation).

       --v4l2-buffer ms
              Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before pushing frames. This increases latency to compensate for jitter.

              This option is similar to --display-buffer, but specific to V4L2 sink.

              Default is 0 (no buffering).

       -V, --verbosity value
              Set the log level ("verbose", "debug", "info", "warn" or "error").

              Default is "info" for release builds, "debug" for debug builds.

       -v, --version
              Print the version of scrcpy.

       -w, --stay-awake
              Keep the device on while scrcpy is running, when the device is plugged in.

       --window-borderless
              Disable window decorations (display borderless window).

       --window-title text
              Set a custom window title.

       --window-x value
              Set the initial window horizontal position.

              Default is "auto".

       --window-y value
              Set the initial window vertical position.

              Default is "auto".

       --window-width value
              Set the initial window width.

              Default is 0 (automatic).

       --window-height value
              Set the initial window height.

              Default is 0 (automatic).

EXIT STATUS
       scrcpy will exit with code 0 on normal program termination. If an initial connection cannot be established, the exit code 1 will be returned. If the device disconnects while a session is  ac‐
       tive, exit code 2 will be returned.
