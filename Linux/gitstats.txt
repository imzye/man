NAME
       gitstats - git history statistics generator

SYNOPSIS
       gitstats [options] <repository dir> <output dir>

DESCRIPTION
       gitstats is a statistics generator for git(1) repositories. It examines
       the repository and produces some interesting statistics from the
       history of it. Currently HTML is the only output format.

OPTIONS
       -c option=value

       Override a default configuration value. Defaults can be seen by running
       gitstats without parameters.

   Values:
       authors_top
           How many top authors to show.

       commit_begin, commit_end
           Specify a commit range to generate statistics from. You can specify
           only commit_end limit statistics to a certain commit or another
           branch.

       linear_linestats
           When enabled, the lines of code statistics are collected from
           linear history.  The downside is that commits of long feature
           branches appear only at the point where a merge commit is made.

           If disabled (old behaviour), the problem is that if two branches
           contain the same changes (for example, removal of same lines), the
           statistics get skewed.

           Defaults to on.

       max_authors
           How many authors to show in the list of authors.

       max_domains
           How many domains to show in domains by commits.

       max_ext_length
           Maximum file extension length.

       processes
           Number of concurrent processes to use when extracting git
           repository data.

       project_name
           Project name to show on the generated pages. Default is to use
           basename of the repository directory.

       start_date
           Specify a starting date to pass with --since to git.

       style
           CSS stylesheet to use.

FAQ
       Q: How do I generate statistics of a non-master branch?

       A: Use "-c commit_end=web" parameter.

       Q: I have files in my git repository that I would like to exclude from
       the statistics, how do I do that?

       A: At the moment the only way is to use git-filter-branch(1) to create
       a temporary repository and generate the statistics from that.

       Q: How do I merge author information when the same author has made
       commits using different names or emails ?

       A: Use git .mailmap feature described in MAPPING AUTHORS of
       git-shortlog(1).

EXAMPLES
       Generates statistics from a git repository in "foo" and outputs the
       result in a directory "foo_stats":
             gitstats foo foo_stats

       As above, but only analyzes the last 10 commits:
             gitstats -c commit_begin='HEAD~10' foo foo_stats
