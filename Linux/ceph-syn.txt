NAME
       ceph-syn - ceph synthetic workload generator

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-syn [ -m monaddr:port ] --syn command ...

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-syn  is  a simple synthetic workload generator for the Ceph distributed file system. It uses the userspace client library to generate simple workloads against a currently running file system. The
       file system need not be mounted via ceph-fuse(8) or the kernel client.

       One or more --syn command arguments specify the particular workload, as documented below.

OPTIONS
       -d     Detach from console and daemonize after startup.

       -c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
              Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.

       -m monaddress[:port]
              Connect to specified monitor (instead of looking through ceph.conf).

       --num_client num
              Run num different clients, each in a separate thread.

       --syn workloadspec
              Run the given workload. May be specified as many times as needed. Workloads will normally run sequentially.

WORKLOADS
       Each workload should be preceded by --syn on the command line. This is not a complete list.

       mknap path snapname
              Create a snapshot called snapname on path.

       rmsnap path snapname
              Delete snapshot called snapname on path.

       rmfile path
              Delete/unlink path.

       writefile sizeinmb blocksize
              Create a file, named after our client id, that is sizeinmb MB by writing blocksize chunks.

       readfile sizeinmb blocksize
              Read file, named after our client id, that is sizeinmb MB by writing blocksize chunks.

       rw sizeinmb blocksize
              Write file, then read it back, as above.

       makedirs numsubdirs numfiles depth
              Create a hierarchy of directories that is depth levels deep. Give each directory numsubdirs subdirectories and numfiles files.

       walk   Recursively walk the file system (like find).

AVAILABILITY
       ceph-syn is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at http://ceph.com/docs for more information.
