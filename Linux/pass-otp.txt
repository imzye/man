PASS-OTP(1)                                                                               General Commands Manual                                                                               PASS-OTP(1)

NAME
       pass-otp - A pass(1) extension for managing one-time-password (OTP) tokens.

SYNOPSIS
       pass otp [ COMMAND ] [ OPTIONS ]... [ ARGS ]...

DESCRIPTION
       pass-otp extends the pass(1) utility with the otp command for adding OTP secrets, generating OTP codes, and displaying secret key URIs using the standard otpauth:// scheme.

       If no COMMAND is specified, COMMAND defaults to code.

COMMANDS
       otp code [ --clip, -c ] pass-name

              Generate  and  print  an  OTP  code from the secret key stored in pass-name using oathtool(1). If --clip or -c is specified, do not print the code but instead copy it to the clipboard using
              xclip(1) and then restore the clipboard after 45 (or PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME) seconds. This command is alternatively named show.

       otp insert [ --force, -f ] [ --echo, -e ] [ [ --secret, -s ] [ --issuer, -i issuer ] [ --account, -a account ] ] [ pass-name ]

              Prompt for and insert a new OTP secret into the password store at pass-name.

              If --secret is specified, prompt for the secret value, assuming SHA1 algorithm, 30-second period, and 6 OTP digits. One or both of issuer and account must also be specified.

              If --secret is not specified, prompt for a key URI; see the documentation at https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format for the key URI specification.

              The secret is consumed from stdin; specify --echo or -e to echo input when running this command interactively. If pass-name is not specified, convert the issuer:accountname URI label  to  a
              path in the form of isser/accountname. Prompt before overwriting an existing secret, unless --force or -f is specified. This command is alternatively named add.

       otp append [ --force, -f ] [ --echo, -e ] [ [ --secret, -s ] [ --issuer, -i issuer ] [ --account, -a account ] ] pass-name

              Append an OTP secret to the password stored in pass-name, preserving any existing lines.

              If --secret is specified, prompt for the secret value, assuming SHA1 algorithm, 30-second period, and 6 OTP digits. One or both of issuer and account must also be specified.

              If --secret is not specified, prompt for a key URI; see the documentation at https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format for the key URI specification.

              The URI is consumed from stdin; specify --echo or -e to echo input when running this command interactively. Prompt before overwriting an existing secret, unless --force or -f is specified.

       otp uri [ --clip, -c | --qrcode, -q ] pass-name

              Print  the key URI stored in pass-name to stdout. If --clip or -c is specified, do not print the URI but instead copy it to the clipboard using xclip(1) and then restore the clipboard after
              45 (or PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME) seconds. If --qrcode or -q is specified, do not print the URI but instead display a QR code using qrencode(1) either to the terminal or graphically if  sup‐
              ported.

       otp validate uri

              Test a URI string for validity according to the Key Uri Format. For more information about this format, see the documentation at https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-
              Format.

OPTIONS
       help, -h, --help
              Show usage message.

EXAMPLES
       Insert new OTP seed
              $ pass otp insert totp-secret
              For totp the secret will be in the format: otpauth://totp/totp-secret?secret=AAAAAAAAAAA&issuer=totp-secret

       To use your webcam to scan a QR code
              $ zbarcam -q --raw | pass otp insert totp-secret

       To use your webcam to append to an existing passfile
              $ zbarimg -q --raw google-qrcode.png | pass otp append google/example@gmail.com
              If you have a clipboard management console tool such as `wl-clipboard` for Wayland installed, you can also select "Copy Image" in your favorite browser and run
              $ wl-paste | zbarimg -q --raw - | pass otp append google/example@gmail.com

       Generate a 2FA code using seed
              $ pass otp totp-secret

       Display a QR code for an OTP token:
              $ pass otp uri -q totp-secret
