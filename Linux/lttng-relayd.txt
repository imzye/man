                    [--control-port=URL] [--data-port=URL] [--fd-pool-size=COUNT]
                    [--live-port=URL] [--output=PATH]

DESCRIPTION
       The Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation <https://lttng.org/> is an open source software package used for correlated tracing of the Linux kernel, user applications, and user libraries.

       LTTng consists of Linux kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing) and dynamically loaded libraries (for user application and library tracing).

       The LTTng relay daemon is responsible for receiving trace data from possibly remote LTTng session/consumer daemons and for writing it to the local file system. The relay daemon also accepts LTTng live
       connections from compatible viewers; this is the official approach to viewing LTTng events as they are emitted.

       The relay daemon listens by default on all network interfaces to gather trace data, but only on localhost for LTTng live connections.

       The relay daemon does not require any particular permissions, as long as it can write to the output directory and listen on the configured ports. If a user is within a secured network and/or has
       proper firewall settings, lttng-relayd can listen to LTTng live connections from all network interfaces by specifying --live-port=tcp://0.0.0.0:5344.

       Once a trace has been streamed completely, the trace can be processed by any tool that can process an LTTng trace located on the local file system.

   Output directory
       The relay daemon uses different output path patterns depending on:

       •   Its configuration.

       •   The connected peer’s tracing session configuration.

       •   The connected peer’s LTTng session daemon (see lttng-sessiond(8)) version.

       Consider the following variables:

       BASE
           Base output directory: $LTTNG_HOME/lttng-traces or the argument of the --output option.

               Note
               $LTTNG_HOME defaults to $HOME when not explicitly set.

       HOSTNAME
           Peer’s hostname.

       SESSION
           Tracing session name.

       DATETIME
           Unique tracing session date/time.

       TRACEPATH
           Custom trace path (TRACEPATH part of the lttng-create(1) command’s --set-url option’s argument, if any).

       The relay daemon output path patterns are:

       Hostname grouping (without --group-output-by-session)

           Without a custom trace path

                   BASE/HOSTNAME/SESSION-DATETIME

           With a custom trace path

                   BASE/HOSTNAME/TRACEPATH

       Tracing session grouping (with --group-output-by-session)

           Without a custom trace path

               The peer’s LTTng session daemon version is at least 2.4

                       BASE/SESSION/HOSTNAME-DATETIME

               Otherwise
                   Defaults to the hostname grouping pattern:

                       BASE/HOSTNAME/SESSION-DATETIME

           With a custom trace path

               The peer’s LTTng session daemon version is at least 2.4

                       BASE/SESSION/HOSTNAME-DATETIME/TRACEPATH

               Otherwise
                   Defaults to the hostname grouping pattern:

                       BASE/HOSTNAME/TRACEPATH

   URL format
       The --control-port, --data-port, and --live-port options specify URLs.

       The format of those URLs is:

           tcp://(HOST | IPADDR):PORT

       with:

       (HOST | IPADDR)
           Binding hostname or IP address (IPv6 address must be enclosed in brackets ([ and ]); see RFC 2732 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt>).

       PORT
           TCP port.

OPTIONS
   Daemon
       -b, --background
           Start as Unix daemon, but keep file descriptors (console) open. Use the --daemonize option instead to close the file descriptors.

       -f PATH, --config=PATH
           Load relay daemon configuration from path PATH.

       -d, --daemonize
           Start as Unix daemon, and close file descriptors (console). Use the --background option instead to keep the file descriptors open.

       -x, --disallow-clear
           Disallow clearing operations (see lttng-clear(1)).

           See also the LTTNG_RELAYD_DISALLOW_CLEAR environment variable.

       --fd-pool-size=SIZE
           Set the size of the file descriptor pool to SIZE.

           SIZE is the maximum number of file descriptors that may be kept opened simultaneously by the relay daemon.

           Default: the soft RLIMIT_NOFILE resource limit of the process (see getrlimit(2)).

       -g GROUP, --group=GROUP
           Use GROUP as Unix tracing group (default: tracing).

       -w PATH, --working-directory=PATH
           Set the working directory of the processes the relay daemon creates to PATH.

           See also the LTTNG_RELAYD_WORKING_DIRECTORY environment variable.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity.

           Three levels of verbosity are available, which are triggered by appending additional v letters to the option (that is, -vv and -vvv).

   Output
       See the Output directory section above for more information.

       -p, --group-output-by-host
           Group the written trace directories by hostname (default).

       -s, --group-output-by-session
           Group the written trace directories by tracing session name instead of by hostname.

       -o PATH, --output=PATH
           Set the base output directory of the written trace directories to PATH.

   Ports
       See the URL format section above for more information about the syntax of the following URL argument.

       -C URL, --control-port=URL
           Listen to control data on URL URL (default: tcp://0.0.0.0:5342).

       -D URL, --data-port=URL
           Listen to trace data on URL URL (default: tcp://0.0.0.0:5343).

       -L URL, --live-port=URL
           Listen to LTTng live connections on URL URL (default: tcp://localhost:5344).

   Program information
       -h, --help
           Show help.

       -V, --version
           Show version.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       LTTNG_ABORT_ON_ERROR
           Set to 1 to abort the process after the first error is encountered.

       LTTNG_NETWORK_SOCKET_TIMEOUT
           Socket connection, receive and send timeout (milliseconds). A value of 0 or -1 uses the timeout of the operating system (default).

       LTTNG_RELAYD_DISALLOW_CLEAR
           Set to 1 to disallow clearing operations (see lttng-clear(1)).

           The --disallow-clear option overrides this variable.

       LTTNG_RELAYD_HEALTH
           Path to relay daemon health’s socket.

       LTTNG_RELAYD_TCP_KEEP_ALIVE
           Set to 1 to enable TCP keep-alive.

           The TCP keep-alive mechanism allows the detection of dead peers (lttng-sessiond(8)) in cases of unclean termination (for example, a hard reset) of a peer.

           Supported on Linux and Solaris only. The default behaviour of the TCP keep-alive mechanism is OS-specific.

           Search for tcp_keepalive in tcp(7) for more information.

       LTTNG_RELAYD_TCP_KEEP_ALIVE_ABORT_THRESHOLD
           The time threshold in seconds to abort a TCP connection after the keep-alive probing mechanism has failed.

           Set to 0 or -1 to use the value chosen by the operating system (default).

           Supported on Solaris 11 only.

           Search for tcp_keepalive_abort_threshold in tcp(7) for more information.

       LTTNG_RELAYD_TCP_KEEP_ALIVE_IDLE_TIME
           Number of seconds a connection needs to be idle before TCP begins sending out keep-alive probes.

           Set to 0 or -1 to use the value chosen by the operating system (default).

           Supported on Linux and Solaris 11 only.

           On Solaris 11, the accepted values are -1, 0, and 10 to 864000.

           Search for tcp_keepalive_time and tcp_keepalive_interval in tcp(7) on Solaris 11 for more information.

       LTTNG_RELAYD_TCP_KEEP_ALIVE_MAX_PROBE_COUNT
           Maximum number of TCP keep-alive probes to send before giving up and killing the connection if no response is obtained from the other end.

           Set to 0 or -1 to use the value chosen by the operating system (default).

           Supported on Linux only.

           Search for tcp_keepalive_probes in tcp(7) for more information.

       LTTNG_RELAYD_TCP_KEEP_ALIVE_PROBE_INTERVAL
           Number of seconds between TCP keep-alive probes.

           Set to 0 or -1 to use the value chosen by the operating system (default).

           Supported on Linux only.

           Search for tcp_keepalive_intvl in tcp(7) for more information.

       LTTNG_RELAYD_WORKING_DIRECTORY
           Working directory of the processes the relay daemon creates.

           The --working-directory option overrides this variable.

FILES
       $LTTNG_HOME/.lttng
           User LTTng runtime and configuration directory.

       $LTTNG_HOME/lttng-traces
           Default base output directory of LTTng traces. This can be overridden with the --output option.

           Note
           $LTTNG_HOME defaults to $HOME when not explicitly set.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           Success

       1
           Error

       3
           Fatal error

LIMITATIONS
       As of this version, only the TCP protocol is supported for both control and data ports. In future versions, TCP will remain the sole available protocol for control data since those communications are
       low-volume and need absolute reliability; trace data could be carried over UDP.

       For an unprivileged user running lttng-relayd, the maximum number of file descriptors per process is usually 1024. This limits the number of connections and opened trace files. This limit can be
       configured with ulimit(3).
