NAME
       srmdump - download your SRM PowerControl data

SYNOPSIS
       srmdump [options] path

DESCRIPTION
       srmdump  implements  the  serial protocols for SRM's PowerControl V, VI and 7.  It allows you to download data from the PC attached to the serial device at path.  This is mostly an example application
       showing the API use of srmio.

OPTIONS
       Options available for the srmdump command:

       -a, --all
              Try to download data "deleted" on the PCV.  (PCVI and PC7 don't seem to support getting "deleted" data).

       -b, --baud=rate
              Use specified baudrate, only. By default all supported baudrates are probed. PCV factory setting is 9600 baud. PCVI and PV7 always use 38400.

       -f, --ftdi
              use ftdi serial driver and open device by the given description.

       -h, --help
              A brief message.

       -p, --pc=type
              Type of PowerControl protocol to use. Supported are PowerControl 5, 6, and 7.  Default is "5".

       -V, --version
              show srmdump version number and exit.

EXAMPLES
        srmdump /dev/ttyUSB0         # linux
        srmdump -p 7 /dev/ttyUSB0    # linux, PowerControl 7
        srmdump /dev/ttyS1      # cygwin, com1
        srmdump /dev/cu.usbserial*   # Mac OS X, prolific driver (good luck)
        srmdump /dev/cu.PL2303-*     # Mac OS X with http://osx-pl2303.sourceforge.net/
        srmdump -p 7 -f "POWERCONTROL 7" # ftdi, PowerControl 7

       This is just a very simplistic frontend for the lib. Please check the source distribution for details.

BUGS
       Yes. For sure. Just keep in mind, that protocol and file formats are reverse engineered...
