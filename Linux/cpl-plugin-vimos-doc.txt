NAME
       vmdet - Determine RON, gain, and bad pixels from a set of flat field exposures.

SYNOPSIS
       esorex vmdet [OPTIONS] FILE.sof

DESCRIPTION
       This recipe is used to estimate the read-out-noise (RON) and the gain of the CCD, and to determine the positions of the bad pixels.

       The input SOF should contain at least five pairs of flat field exposures, all belonging to the same quadrant, each pair corresponding to a different exposure time. The flat fields can be pro‐
       duced  either  in imaging or in MOS mode. In MOS mode a HR grism is used, in order to illuminate the CCD also beyond the central region used in direct imaging mode, but no mask is inserted at
       the telescope focal plane.

       This type of exposure cannot really be considered a spectral flat field, because the CCD is exposed to white light (i.e., without a wavelength dependency along the dispersion direction).  The
       flat  fields  generated  for  the  purpose of determining the detector properties are assigned the DO category DETECTOR_PROPERTIES, to distinguish them from the more common IMG_SCREEN_FLAT or
       MOS_SCREEN_FLAT that are used to produce master calibrations.

       Input files:

         DO category:          Type:         Explanation:  Required:
         DETECTOR_PROPERTIES   Raw           Flat field       Y
         MASTER_BIAS           Calib         Master bias      Y

       Output files:

         DO category:          Data type:    Explanation:
         CCD_TABLE             FITS table    Bad pixel table
         (none)                FITS image    Bad pixel image
         (none)                FITS image    Error image

       Only the primary product, the bad pixel table, is copied (or moved) to the product directory. Other products are generated only on request (typically for debug purposes) and are not  assigned
       a DO category as they would not be used anywhere in further data processing steps.

       For more details, please refer to the VIMOS Pipeline User´s Guide.

OPTIONS
       --CreateBadPixelMap <bool>
              Bad pixel map creation (bool; default: True). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is vimos.Parameters.map [default = True].

       --CreateErrorImage <bool>
              Response slope uncertainty map creation (bool; default: False). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is vimos.Parameters.error [default = False].

       --DetectionThreshold <float>
              Threshold in determination of bad pixels (float; default: 5.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is vimos.Parameters.threshold [default = 5.0].

       --DetectionMode <str>
              Bad pixel detection method (str; default: ´Intolerant´). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is vimos.Parameters.method [default = Intolerant].

       --ComputeQC <bool>
              Compute QC1 parameters. (bool; default: True). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is vimos.Parameters.quality.enable [default = True].

       Note that it is possible to create a configuration file containing these options, along with suitable default values. Please refer to the details provided by the 'esorex --help' command.
