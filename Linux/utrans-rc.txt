UTRANS-RC(1)                                                                                   User Commands                                                                                   UTRANS-RC(1)

NAME
       utrans-rc - convert systemd units using utrans(1) and then save or install them

SYNOPSIS
       utrans-rc [-h] [-b <BACKEND>..] [-n | -o <OUTPUT_DIR>] [-u | <SOURCE_DIR>..]

OPTIONS
       The following commandline options are supported:-

       -b <BACKEND>
              specify backend used by utrans(1). If unset, automatically detect the appropriate backends to use

       -h     show usage

       -o <OUTPUT_DIR>
              save generated files to subdirectories of <OUTPUT_DIR>

       -n     no action; dry run to show what would be done

       -u     only check for new/modified/deleted units and update; ignored if <SOURCE_DIR> or <OUTPUT_DIR> specified

DESCRIPTION
       utrans-rc  scans  the  source directory/directories for systemd.service(5) and systemd.timer(5) units. If no source directory is specified, [/usr]/lib/systemd/system and [/usr]/lib/user/system are
       scanned.

       Each unit is converted using utrans(1).

       If <OUTPUT_DIR> is specified, generated files are saved there. Otherwise, the files are considered for installation beneath /etc using sudo(8) and ucf(1) to preserve user  modifications.  However,
       installation of the whole unit is skipped if

       • the unit's parent package already includes functionality in the installation directory

       • it would overwrite any files in a package known to dpkg(1)

       utrans-rc also checks previously generated and installed files for changes in their source units. If any modified units are found they are re-translated. If the source units have been removed, the
       generated files are disabled and removed (if unmodified).
