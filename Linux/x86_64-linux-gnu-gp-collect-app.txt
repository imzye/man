NAME
       gp-collect-app - collect performance data for the target application

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng collect app [OPTION(S)] TARGET [TARGET_ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       Collect  performance  data  on  the target program. In addition to Program Counter PC) sampling, hardware event counters and various tracing options are sup‐
       ported.

OPTIONS
       --version
              print the version number and exit.

       --help print usage information and exit.

       --verbose {on|off}
              enable (on) or disable (off) verbose mode; the default is "off".

       -p {off|on|lo|hi|<value>}
              disable (off) or enable (on) clock-profiling using a default sampling granularity, or enable clock-profiling implicitly by setting the sampling granu‐
              larity (lo, hi, or a specific value in ms); by default clock profiling is enabled.

       -h {<ctr_def>...,<ctr_n_def>}
              enable  hardware event counter profiling and select the counter(s); to see the supported counters on this system use the -h option without other argu‐
              ments.

       -o <exp_name>
              specify the name for (and path to) the experiment directory; the the default path is the current directory.

       -O <exp_name>
              the same as -o, but unlike the -o option, silently overwrite an existing experiment directory with the same name.

       -C <label>
              add up to 10 comment labels to the experiment; comments appear in the notes section of the header.

       -j {on|off|<path>} enable (on), or disable (off) Java profiling when the target
              program is a JVM; optionally set the <path> to a non-default JVM; the default is "-j on".

       -J <java-args>
              specify arguments to the JVM.

       -t <duration>[m|s]
              specify the duration over which to record data; the default unit is seconds (s), but can be set to minutes (m).

       -n     dry run; display several run-time settings, but do not run the target, or collect performance data.

       -y <signal>[,r]
              specify delayed initialization and a pause/resume signal; by default the target starts in paused mode; if the optional r keyword is provided, start in
              resumed mode.

       -F {off|on|=<regex>}
              control to follow descendant processes; disable (off), enable (on), or collect data on all descendant processes whose name matches the specified regu‐
              lar expression; the default is "-F on".

       -a {off|on|ldobjects|src|usedldobjects|usedsrc}
              specify archiving of binaries and other files; in addition to disable this feature (off), or enable archiving off all loadobjects  and  sources  (on),
              the other options support a more refined selection. All of these options enable archiving, but the keyword controls what exactly is selected: all load
              objects (ldobjects), all source files (src), the loadobjects asscoiated with a program counter (usedldobjects), or the source files associated with  a
              program counter (usedsrc); the default is "-a ldobjects".

       -S {off|on|<seconds>}
              disable (off) or enable (on) periodic sampling of process-wide resource utilization; by default sampling occurs every second; use the <seconds> option
              to change this; the default is "-S on".

       -l <signal>
              specify a signal that will trigger a sample of process-wide resource utilization.

       -s <option>[,<API>]
              enable synchronization wait tracing; <option> is used to define the specifics of the tracing (on, off, <threshold>, or all); <API> is used  to  select
              the API: "n" selects native/Pthreads, "j" selects Java, and "nj" selects both; the default is "-s off".

       -H {off|on}
              disable (off), or enable (on) heap tracing; the default is "-H off".

       -i {off|on}
              disable (off), or enable (on) I/O tracing; the default is "-i off".
