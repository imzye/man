NAME
       patscc - ATS2 compiler frontend

SYNOPSIS
       patscc [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       patscc is a frontend to the Postiats compiler patsopt for the ATS2 language.

OPTIONS
       patscc has a command-line option syntax in the style of gcc and accepts all the same options, many of them being passed directly to the gcc backend.  Here are summarized the non-gcc options.

       -atsccomp <command>
              Specify the name of the C compiler on the command line. Otherwise, use environment variable ATSCCOMP or the default. See further details on environment variables.

       -cleanaft
              Clean up incidental generated C files after compilation finishes.

       --compile, -ccats
              Only compile the given ATS source files into C files.

       -DATS <name>[=<value>], -DDATS <name>[=<value>]
              Define a name/value macro toplevel value in ATS.  -DDATS also passes this option to the C compiler.

       -IATS <path>, -IIATS <path>
              Add a path to search for ATS files when doing static and dynamic loads.  -IIATS also passes this path to the C compiler.

       -fsats <file>, -fdats <file>
              These indicate that the following file is a SATS or a DATS file. Unnecessary if standard filename extensions .sats or .dats are used.

       --gline
              Place line pragma information based on ATS source in the generated C code.

       --typecheck, -tcats
              Typecheck the given ATS source files, but go no further.

       --version, -vats
              Show ATS2/Postiats version and gcc version.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PATSCCOMP, ATSCCOMP
              Use the value of this environment variable as the command name of the C compiler. The default is gcc -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -I${ATSHOME} -I${ATSHOME}/ccomp/runtime -L${ATSHOME}/ccomp/atslib/lib

       PATSHOME, ATSHOME
              Use the value of this environment variable as the path to the ATS library installation. The default is distribution-specific.

       PATSOPT, ATSOPT
              Use the value of this environment variable as the command name of the ATS compiler. The default is patsopt.

EXAMPLES
       patscc -o test -O3 test.dats

       Compile test.dats to an executable named test.  Tell gcc to use the third level of optimization.

       patscc -tcats test.dats

       Typecheck test.dats only.

       patscc -ccats test.dats

       Compile to C file test_dats.c only.

       patscc -o test.o -c test.dats -cleanaft

       Compile test.dats to an object file named test.o, and delete intermediate C file.
