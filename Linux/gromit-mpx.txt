NAME
       Gromit-MPX - Presentation helper to make annotations on screen

SYNOPSIS
       gromit-mpx [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Gromit-MPX  enables  you to make multi-pointer annotations on your screen. It can run in the background and be activated on demand to let you draw over all your currently running applications. The
       drawing will stay on screen as long as you want, you can continue to use your applications while the drawing is visible.
       Gromit-MPX is XInput-Aware, so if you have a graphic tablet you can draw lines with different strength, colour, erase things, etc.
       Since you typically want to use the program you are demonstrating and highlighting something is a short interruption of you workflow, Gromit-MPX is activated by either a hotkey or a repeated invo‐
       cation of Gromit-MPX (the latter can e.g. used by other applications or your windowmanager).

KEYBOARD CONTROL
       By default, Gromit-MPX grabs the "F9" key (this can be changed using the "--key" option), making it unavailable to other application. The available shortcuts are:

       F9     toggle painting

       SHIFT-F9
              clear screen

       CTRL-F9
              toggle visibility

       ALT-F9 quit Gromit-MPX

OPTIONS (STARTUP)
       A short summary of the available commandline arguments for invoking Gromit-MPX, see below for the options to control an already running Gromit-MPX process:

       -a, --active
              start Gromit-MPX and immediately activate it.

       -d, --debug
              gives some debug output.

       -k <keysym>, --key <keysym>
              will change the key used to grab the mouse. <keysym> can e.g. be "F9", "F12", "Control_R" or "Print". To determine the keysym for different keys you can use  the  xev(1)  command.  You  can
              specify "none" to prevent Gromit-MPX from grabbing a key.

       -K <keycode>, --keycode <keycode>
              will change the key used to grab the mouse. Under rare circumstances identifying the key with the keysym can fail. You can then use the keycode to specify the key uniquely. To determine the
              keycode for different keys you can use the xev(1) command.

       -o, --opacity <value>
              will set the initial opacity of the window using a floating point value between 0 and 1.

       -u <keysym>, --undo-key <keysym>
              will  change  the key used to undo/redo strokes. <keysym> can e.g. be "F9", "F12", "Control_R" or "Print". To determine the keysym for different keys you can use the xev(1) command. You can
              specify "none" to prevent Gromit-MPX from grabbing a key.

       -U <keycode>, --undo-keycode <keycode>
              will change the key used to undo/redo strokes. Under rare circumstances identifying the key with the keysym can fail. You can then use the keycode to specify the key uniquely. To  determine
              the keycode for different keys you can use the xev(1) command.

       -V, --version
              will show the Gromit-MPX version.

OPTIONS (CONTROL)
       A sort summary of the available commandline arguments to control an already running Gromit-MPX process, see above for the options available to start Gromit-MPX.

       -c, --clear
              will clear the screen.

       -q, --quit
              will cause the main Gromit-MPX process to quit.

       -t, --toggle
              will toggle the grabbing of the cursor.

       -v, --visibility
              will toggle the visibility of the window.

       -y, --redo
              will redo the last undone drawing stroke.

       -z, --undo
              will undo the last drawing stroke.

ENVIRONMENT
       XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
              Gromit-MPX uses this to determine which desktop environment it is running on.

       XDG_CURRENT_SESSION
              Gromit-MPX uses this to determine whether is is running under X11 or Wayland.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME
              Directory to search for user's custom configuration file, defaults to ~/.config/.

       GDK_CORE_DEVICE_EVENTS
              If set, GDK does not use the XInput extension and only reacts to core X input events.  This renders Gromit-MPX unusable, it will detect this and bail out with an error message.

FILES
       gromit-mpx.cfg
              Configuration file which defines pens and maps mouse buttons and modifiers to them. Searched for in user's custom configuration file directory and, if not found there, in /etc/gromit-mpx/.

BUGS
       When  there  is no compositing manager such as Compiz, xcompmgr or Mutter running, Gromit-MPX falls back to a legacy drawing mode. This may drastically slow down your X-Server, especially when you
       draw very thin lines. It makes heavy use of the shape extension, which is quite expensive if you paint a complex pattern on screen. Especially terminal-programs tend to scroll incredibly  slow  if
       something is painted over their window.

       XFCE  per  default grabs Ctrl-F1 to Ctrl-F12 (switch to workspace 1-12) and Alt-F9 (minimize window) which renders Gromit-MPX's default hotkey mapping unusable. Gromit-MPX detects XFCE and changes
       the default hotkeys to Home and End. Those can can still be overridden by the user.
