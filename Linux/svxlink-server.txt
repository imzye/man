NAME
       ModuleEchoLink.conf - Configuration file for the SvxLink server EchoLink module

DESCRIPTION
       svxlink is a general purpose voice service system for ham radio use. This man-page describe the SvxLink server configuration for the EchoLink module.

       The EchoLink module is used to connect to other EchoLink stations.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       There are a couple of configuration variables that are common to all modules.  The documentation for these can be found in the svxlink.conf(5) manual page.

       Here is the description of all module specific configuration variables that the SvxLink EchoLink module understands.

   ModuleEchoLink
       ALLOW_IP
              Use this variable very carefully. Connections originating from the given subnet will not be checked against the EchoLink directory server. A typical use of this is if you want to connect to
              your own svxlink server and both the server and you are behind a IP masquerading firewall.

       DROP_ALL_INCOMING
              Silently drop all incoming connections.  No message will be sent to the remote station notifying about the drop. The connection will just be ignored and there will be no notification in the
              application log.

       DROP_INCOMING
              Drop  all  incoming  connections where the remote callsign match this regular expression. No message will be sent to the remote station notifying about the drop. The connection will just be
              ignored.  For more information on the syntax, see the REGULAR EXPRESSIONS chapter below.

       REJECT_INCOMING
              Reject all incoming connections where the remote callsign match this regular expression. A message will be sent to the remote station indicating  that  the  connection  was  rejected.   The
              DROP_INCOMING directive will be evaluated before REJECT_INCOMING.  For more information on the syntax, see the REGULAR EXPRESSIONS chapter below.

       ACCEPT_INCOMING
              Only  accept  incoming  connections  where the remote callsign match this regular expression. If the callsign doesn't match, a message will be sent to the remote station indicating that the
              connection was rejected.  The DROP_INCOMING and REJECT_INCOMING directives will be evaluated before ACCEPT_INCOMING.  For more information on the syntax, see the REGULAR EXPRESSIONS chapter
              below.

       REJECT_OUTGOING
              Reject all outgoing connections where the remote callsign match this regular expression. For more information on the syntax, see the REGULAR EXPRESSIONS chapter below.

       REJECT_CONF
              When this is set to 1, reject all incoming connections where the name of the remote station ends in the word CONF. A message will be sent to the remote station indicating that  the  connec‐
              tion  was  rejected.   This  blocks connects from stations that are in conference mode.  When a station enters conference mode after connecting, and transmits towards us, it will be discon‐
              nected as well.

       CHECK_NR_CONNECTS
              If a station connects to often it can be blocked for a configurable time span. Example: CHECK_NR_CONNECTS=3,300,120 If a station connects more than 3 times with less than 300 seconds in be‐
              tween each connect, that station will be rejected for 120 minutes.

       ACCEPT_OUTGOING
              Only accept outgoing connections where the remote callsign match this regular expression. The REJECT_OUTGOING directive will be evaluated before ACCEPT_OUTGOING. For more information on the
              syntax, see the REGULAR EXPRESSIONS chapter below.

       SERVERS
              A space separated list of IP addresses or names of the EchoLink directory servers to use. The specified servers will be tried in order until one is found that works. SvxLink will then stick
              to that server. If that server fail, SvxLink will again try the next server in the list and when the end of the list has been reached, the search start from the beginning again.   Hostnames
              that resolve to multiple IP addresses, like servers.echolink.org, will also be correctly handled so that all returned IP addresses will be tried if necessary.

       CALLSIGN
              The callsign to use to login to the EchoLink directory server.

       SYSOPNAME
              The name of the person or club that is responsible for this system.

       PASSWORD
              The EchoLink directory server password to use.

       LOCATION
              The  location of the station. Note: In the default configuration file the value of this configuration variable starts with "[Svx]". This is of course not necessary but it's fun to see which
              other stations are running SvxLink.

       PROXY_SERVER
              If set, connect to the given EchoLink proxy server host. All EchoLink connections, both incoming and outgoing, will then go through the proxy.

       PROXY_PORT
              Set the TCP port used for connecing to an EchoLink proxy server. Default is 8100.

       PROXY_PASSWORD
              Set the EchoLink proxy password used when connecting to an EchoLink proxy server. Use the password PUBLIC for public proxy servers.

       BIND_ADDR
              This configuration variable can be set to bind the EchoLink network sockets to a specific IP-address/interface. This may be needed if the computer is fitted with more than one ethernet  in‐
              terface and EchoLink should only be used on one of them.

              Example: BIND_ADDR=192.168.0.1

       MAX_QSOS
              The maximum number of stations that can participate in a conference QSO on this node. If more stations try to connect, the connect request will be rejected.

       USE_GSM_ONLY
              On  smaller systems with a less powerful CPU it is a good idea to prevent SvxLink from switching into the Speex codec when another SvxLink station is connecting via EchoLink.  If this param
              is set to 1 SvxLink remains in the default codec (GSM).

       DEFAULT_LANG
              Set the language to use for announcements sent to remote EchoLink stations.  If not set, it will be the same as the one chosen for the logic core. The reason for setting this up may be that
              you want one language for the core and another language for annoncements sent to remote EchoLink stations.

       MAX_CONNECTIONS
              When more stations than specified in MAX_QSOS try to connect, a connection will temporarily be established long enough to play a message telling the remote station that the  connection  was
              rejected.  The  connection  is  then  immediately  terminated.  If  the number of connections exceeds MAX_CONNECTIONS, the connect request is just ignored. This variable is typically set to
              MAX_QSOS+1 or more if using a large number for MAX_QSOS.

       LINK_IDLE_TIMEOUT
              The number of seconds that a connection is idle before disconnection will occur.  This is to prevent a link to stay open if someone forget to disconnect. Disable  this  feature  by  setting
              this config variable to zero (or comment it out).

       AUTOCON_ECHOLINK_ID
              Set this variable to an EchoLink ID that you want to automatically connect to.  SvxLink will autoconnect only when no other station is connected.

       AUTOCON_TIME
              Set this to the time in seconds that you want in between autoconnect tries.

       DESCRIPTION
              A  longer description that is sent to remote stations upon connection. This description should typically include detailed station information like QTH, transceiver frequency/power, antenna,
              CTCSS tone frequency etc.

       COMMAND_PTY
              Specify the path to a PTY that can be used to control the EchoLink module from the operating system. Commands: "KILL" will disconnect the current talker, "DISC callsign" will disconnect the
              station with the given callsign. Commands can be issued using a simple echo command from the shell.

       LOCAL_RGR_SOUND
              Set this variable to 0 to disable playing a roger sound (beep) locally when the remote station stops talking. It's enabled by default.

       REMOTE_RGR_SOUND
              Set this to 1 to enable sending of a roger sound (beep) to remote Echolink stations when the squelch closes on the local node. It's disabled by default.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       Regular expressions are used in the DROP, REJECT and ACCEPT configuration variables. A regular expression can be quite complex and the syntax is fully described in the regex(7) manual  page.  This
       is just a quick tutorial for the most important features.

       ^      match the beginning of a string.

       $      match the end of a string.

       .      match one character.

       *      match the previous expression zero or more times.

       |      match the expression before OR after the |.

       \      escape  the  following  character.  Note  that  backslash is also parsed by the SvxLink configuration parser so a backslash must actually be typed as two.  For example to include a * in the
              matching pattern it must be escaped as \\*.

       ()     grouping an expression.

       []     match any of the characters inside of the brackets.

       Some examples:

       ^(AB1CDE|BA5CBA-L)$
              Match AB1CDE or BA5CBA-L.

       ^(AB1CDE-[LR])$
              Match AB1CDE-L or AB1CDR-R.

       ^(AB1.*)$
              Match all callsigns starting with AB1.

       ^(\\*.*\\*)$
              Match all conference "callsigns". We need to escape the star character since it would otherwise be parsed by the regular expression parser. We also need two backslah characters so that  the
              SvxLink configuration reader doesn't parse it as an escape sequence.

       The  matches in SvxLink are case insensitive so "sm3" and "SM3" are the same.  SvxLink use extended regular expressions (see regex(7) ). You almost always want to start the regular expression with
       "^(" and end it with ")$" so that the whole callsign will be used in the match.
