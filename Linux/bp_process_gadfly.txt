BP_PROCESS_GADFLY(1p)                                                                 User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                 BP_PROCESS_GADFLY(1p)

NAME
       bp_process_gadfly.pl - Massage Gadfly/FlyBase GFF files into a version suitable for the Generic Genome Browser

SYNOPSIS
         % bp_process_gadfly.pl ./RELEASE2 > gadfly.gff

DESCRIPTION
       This script massages the RELEASE 3 Flybase/Gadfly GFF files located at http://www.fruitfly.org/sequence/release3download.shtml into the "correct" version of the GFF format.

       To use this script, download the whole genome FASTA file and save it to disk.  (The downloaded file will be called something like "na_whole-genome_genomic_dmel_RELEASE3.FASTA", but the link on the
       HTML page doesn't give the filename.)  Do the same for the whole genome GFF annotation file (the saved file will be called something like "whole-genome_annotation-feature-region_dmel_RELEASE3.GFF".)
       If you wish you can download the ZIP compressed versions of these files.

       Next run this script on the two files, indicating the name of the downloaded FASTA file first, followed by the gff file:

        % bp_process_gadfly.pl na_whole-genome_genomic_dmel_RELEASE3.FASTA whole-genome_annotation-feature-region_dmel_RELEASE3.GFF > fly.gff

       The gadfly.gff file and the fasta file can now be loaded into a Bio::DB::GFF database using the following command:

         % bulk_load_gff.pl -d fly -fasta na_whole-genome_genomic_dmel_RELEASE3.FASTA fly.gff

       (Where "fly" is the name of the database.  Change it as appropriate.  The database must already exist and be writable by you!)

       The resulting database will have the following feature types (represented as "method:source"):

         Component:arm              A chromosome arm
         Component:scaffold         A chromosome scaffold (accession #)
         Component:gap              A gap in the assembly
         clone:clonelocator         A BAC clone
         gene:gadfly                A gene accession number
         transcript:gadfly          A transcript accession number
         translation:gadfly         A translation
         codon:gadfly               Significance unknown
         exon:gadfly                An exon
         symbol:gadfly              A classical gene symbol
         similarity:blastn          A BLASTN hit
         similarity:blastx          A BLASTX hit
         similarity:sim4            EST->genome using SIM4
         similarity:groupest        EST->genome using GROUPEST
         similarity:repeatmasker    A repeat

       IMPORTANT NOTE: This script will *only* work with the RELEASE3 gadfly files and will not work with earlier releases.
