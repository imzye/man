NAME
       sq-pki-identify - Identify a certificate

SYNOPSIS
       sq pki identify [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Identify a certificate.

       Identify a certificate by finding authenticated bindings (User ID and certificate pairs).

       An error is return if no binding could be authenticated to the specified level (by default: fully authenticated, i.e., a trust amount of 120).

       If a binding could be partially authenticated (i.e., its trust amount is greater than 0), then the binding is displayed, even if the trust is below the specified threshold.

OPTIONS
   Subcommand options
       --amount=AMOUNT
              The required amount of trust

              120  indicates  full authentication; values less than 120 indicate partial authentication.  When `--certification-network` is passed, this defaults to 1200, i.e., this command tries to find
              10 paths.

       --cert=FINGERPRINT|KEYID
              Use certificates with the specified fingerprint or key ID

       --certification-network
              Treats the network as a certification network

              Normally, the authentication machinery treats the Web of Trust network as an authentication network where a certification only means that the binding is correct, not that the target  should
              be  treated  as  a trusted introducer.  In a certification network, the targets of certifications are treated as trusted introducers with infinite depth, and any regular expressions are ig‐
              nored.  Note: The trust amount remains unchanged.  This is how most so-called PGP path-finding algorithms work.

       --gossip
              Treats all certificates as unreliable trust roots

              This option is useful for figuring out what others think about a certificate (i.e., gossip or hearsay).  In other words, this finds arbitrary paths to a particular certificate.

              Gossip is useful in helping to identify alternative ways to authenticate a certificate.  For instance, imagine Ed wants to authenticate Laura's certificate, but asking her directly  is  in‐
              convenient.   Ed discovers that Micah has certified Laura's certificate, but Ed hasn't yet authenticated Micah's certificate.  If Ed is willing to rely on Micah as a trusted introducer, and
              authenticating Micah's certificate is easier than authenticating Laura's certificate, then Ed has learned about an easier way to authenticate Laura's certificate.

              Stable since 1.1.0.

       --show-paths
              Show why a binding is authenticated

              By default, only a user ID and certificate binding's degree of authentication (a value between 0 and 120) is shown.  This changes the output to also show how  that  value  was  computed  by
              showing the paths from the trust roots to the bindings.

       --unusable
              Show bindings that are unusable

              Normally,  unusable certificates and bindings are not shown. This option considers bindings, even if they are not unusable, because they (or the certificates) are not valid according to the
              policy, are revoked, or are not live.

              This option only makes sense with `--gossip`, because unusable bindings are still considered unauthenticated.

              Stable since 1.1.0.

   Global options
       See sq(1) for a description of the global options.

EXAMPLES
       Identify the user IDs that can be authenticated for the certificate.

              sq pki identify --cert \
                     EB28F26E2739A4870ECC47726F0073F60FD0CBF0

       List all user IDs that have that have been certified by anyone.

              sq pki identify --gossip --cert \
