NAME
       bicon.bin - bidirectional console layer

SYNOPSIS
       bicon.bin [command [arguments...]]

DESCRIPTION
       bicon.bin  is  a  console program that supports bidirectional text dis‐
       play, for languages like Arabic, Persian and Hebrew.

       bicon.bin hooks into the I/O of the current console to  display  proper
       directed  text  using  the Unicode BiDi algorithm. Proper directed here
       includes shaping and joining.

       bicon.bin does not load the keymap or font. Use bicon(1) to get  proper
       support for your BiDi language, including loading your keymap and font.

OPTIONS

              is  executed  by bicon.bin after it loads. If omitted, bicon.bin
              uses the current SHELL, or /bin/sh if SHELL is undefined.

       arguments
              are passed to the command to run.
