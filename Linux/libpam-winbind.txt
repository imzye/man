NAME
       pam_winbind.conf - Configuration file of PAM module for Winbind

DESCRIPTION
       This configuration file is part of the samba(7) suite.

       pam_winbind.conf is the configuration file for the pam_winbind PAM module. See pam_winbind(8) for further details.

SYNOPSIS
       The pam_winbind.conf configuration file is a classic ini-style configuration file. There is only one section (global) where various options are defined.

OPTIONS
       pam_winbind supports several options which can either be set in the PAM configuration files or in the pam_winbind configuration file situated at /etc/security/pam_winbind.conf. Options from the
       PAM configuration file take precedence to those from the pam_winbind.conf configuration file.

       debug = yes|no
           Gives debugging output to syslog. Defaults to "no".

       debug_state = yes|no
           Gives detailed PAM state debugging output to syslog. Defaults to "no".

       require_membership_of = [SID or NAME]
           If this option is set, pam_winbind will only succeed if the user is a member of the given SID or NAME. A SID can be either a group-SID, an alias-SID or even an user-SID. It is also possible to
           give a NAME instead of the SID. That name must have the form: MYDOMAIN\mygroup or MYDOMAIN\myuser (where '\' character corresponds to the value of winbind separator parameter). It is also
           possible to use a UPN in the form user@REALM or group@REALM. pam_winbind will, in that case, lookup the SID internally. Note that NAME may not contain any spaces. It is thus recommended to
           only use SIDs. You can verify the list of SIDs a user is a member of with wbinfo --user-sids=SID. This setting is empty by default.

           This option only operates during password authentication, and will not restrict access if a password is not required for any reason (such as SSH key-based login).

       try_first_pass = yes|no
           By default, pam_winbind tries to get the authentication token from a previous module. If no token is available it asks the user for the old password. With this option, pam_winbind aborts with
           an error if no authentication token from a previous module is available. If a primary password is not valid, PAM will prompt for a password. Default to "no".

       krb5_auth = yes|no
           pam_winbind can authenticate using Kerberos when winbindd is talking to an Active Directory domain controller. Kerberos authentication must be enabled with this parameter. When Kerberos
           authentication can not succeed (e.g. due to clock skew), winbindd will fallback to samlogon authentication over MSRPC. When this parameter is used in conjunction with winbind refresh tickets,
           winbind will keep your Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) up-to-date by refreshing it whenever necessary. Defaults to "no".

       krb5_ccache_type = [type]
           When pam_winbind is configured to try kerberos authentication by enabling the krb5_auth option, it can store the retrieved Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) in a credential cache. The type of
           credential cache can be controlled with this option. The supported values are: KCM or KEYRING (when supported by the system's Kerberos library and operating system), FILE and DIR (when the DIR
           type is supported by the system's Kerberos library). In case of FILE a credential cache in the form of /tmp/krb5cc_UID will be created - in case of DIR you NEED to specify a directory. UID is
           replaced with the numeric user id. The UID directory is being created. The path up to the directory should already exist. Check the details of the Kerberos implementation.

           When using the KEYRING type, the supported mechanism is “KEYRING:persistent:UID”, which uses the Linux kernel keyring to store credentials on a per-UID basis. The KEYRING has its limitations.
           As it is secure kernel memory, for example bulk storage of credentials is not possible.

           When using the KCM type, the supported mechanism is “KCM:UID”, which uses a Kerberos credential manager to store credentials on a per-UID basis similar to KEYRING. This is the recommended
           choice on latest Linux distributions, offering a Kerberos Credential Manager. If not we suggest to use KEYRING as that is the most secure and predictable method.

           It is also possible to define custom filepaths and use the "%u" pattern in order to substitute the numeric user id. Examples:

           krb5_ccache_type = DIR:/run/user/%u/krb5cc
               This will create a credential cache file in the specified directory.

           krb5_ccache_type = FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_%u
               This will create a credential cache file.

           Leave empty to just do kerberos authentication without having a ticket cache after the logon has succeeded. This setting is empty by default.

       cached_login = yes|no
           Winbind allows one to logon using cached credentials when winbind offline logon is enabled. To use this feature from the PAM module this option must be set. Defaults to "no".

       silent = yes|no
           Do not emit any messages. Defaults to "no".

       mkhomedir = yes|no
           Create homedirectory for a user on-the-fly, option is valid in PAM session block. Defaults to "no".

       warn_pwd_expire = days
           Defines number of days before pam_winbind starts to warn about passwords that are going to expire. Defaults to 14 days.

       pwd_change_prompt = yes|no
           Generate prompt for changing an expired password. Defaults to "no".
