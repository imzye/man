NAME
       uhd_image_loader - UHD Image Loader

DESCRIPTION
       Burn firmware and FPGA images onto connected Ettus Research devices.

SYNOPSIS
       uhd_image_loader [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS
       List options:
              --help

       Device and loader arguments:
              --args=""

       Custom firmware filepath:
              --fw-path=""

       Custom FPGA filepath:
              --fpga-path=""

       Don't burn firmware:
              --no-fw

       Don't burn FPGA:
              --no-fpga

SPECIFYING A PARTICULAR DEVICE
       Without  any  arguments  given through the args="" option, this utility
       will start a session with the first Ettus Research device it sees.  The
       arguments  shown below will narrow down the utility's search for a par‐
       ticular device:

   All devices
       The name= and serial= arguments can  be  used  to  specify  any  device
       except  an  uninitialized  USB  device  or an OctoClock bootloader. The
       type= argument can be used to specify any device, as described below:

       "type=" argument

       Argument       |     Device

       type=usrp2     |     USRP N200, USRP N210

       type=b200      |     USRP B200, USRP B210

       type=e3x0      |     USRP E310

       type=octoclock |     OctoClock

       NOTE: The USRP1, USRP2, and USRP B100 are not supported.

   Network devices
       By default, this utility will check all network interfaces for network-
       based  devices,  but  a  specific  IP address can be specified with the
       addr= argument.

   NI-RIO devices
       An X-Series devices connected via PCIe can be specified by  its  NI-RIO
       resource through the resource= argument, and the RPC port through which
       to communicate with it can be specified with  the  rpc-port=  argument.
       Using  these  options  is  not recommended, as their default values are
       almost always used.

   OctoClock devices
       An OctoClock's name and serial are only exposed when  the  firmware  is
       loaded, so if the device only has a bootloader, only the addr= argument
       can be used to find it.

DEVICE-SPECIFIC LOADER OPTIONS
       Certain devices have specific options for customizing their image load‐
       ing  process,  and these can be passed in through the --args="" option.
       These arguments are specified below:

   USRP N200, USRP N210
       The  overwrite-safe  option  will  overwrite  the  device's   safe-mode
       firmware  and  FPGA  images.  This  is NOT RECOMMENDED, as these images
       serve as the backup if the device's primary images are corrupted.

       The reset option will automatically reset the device once  the  loading
       process  finishes.  When the device resets, it will have its new images
       loaded.

   USRP X300, USRP X310 (Ethernet only)
       The configure option will automatically reset the device once the load‐
       ing process finishes. When the device resets, it will have its new FPGA
       image loaded.

       The verify option  will  tell  the  device  to  internally  verify  the
       integrity of the image as it loads.  This greatly increases the loading
       time.

EXAMPLES
   Load only the default FPGA image onto a specific N2x0 device and reset
       uhd_image_loader --args="type=usrp2,addr=192.168.10.2,reset" --no-fw

   Load a custom FPGA image onto a specific X3x0 device
       uhd_image_loader      --args="type=x300,addr=192.168.40.2"      --fpga-
       path="/home/user/my_x300_fpga_image.bit"
