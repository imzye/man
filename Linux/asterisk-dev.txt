NAME
       dh_asterisk - Add dependency on the ABI version of Asterisk

SYNOPSIS
       dh_asterisk [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_asterisk is a debhelper program that is responsible for correctly setting the dependency on asterisk-abi-asterisk-ABI-version for a package.

       When writing a package that builds an Asterisk module and is not built with Asterisk itself (and hence depends on the exact binary version), add ${asterisk:Depends} to the package's Depends:
       field in debian control and run dh_asterisk.

       A debhelper addon is also provided.  This makes it possible to just use

         #!/usr/bin/make -f
         %:
                 dh $@ --with asterisk

       for debian/rules.

       Alternatively, you can just build-depend on dh-sequence-asterisk and omit the "--with asterisk" part.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is part of the Debian Asterisk package.
