DESCRIPTION
       Grace is a WYSIWYG tool to make two-dimensional plots of scientific data.

SYNOPSIS
       grace [ option | filename ]...
       xmgrace [ option | filename ]...
       gracebat [ option | filename ]...

OPTIONS
       -autoscale x|y|xy|none
              Set autoscale type

       -barebones
              Turn off all toolbars

       -batch file
              Execute batch file on start up (i.e., after all other options have been processed and the UI initialized)

       -block file
              Assume the data file is block data

       -bxy x:y:etc.
              Form a set from the current block data set using the current set type from columns given in the argument

       -datehint iso|european|us|days|seconds|nohint
              Set the hint for dates analysis

       -dpipe descriptor

       -graph number
              Set the current graph number

       -graphtype xy|chart|fixed|polar|pie
              Set the type of the current graph

       -hardcopy
              No interactive session, just print and quit

       -hdevice device_name
              Set default hardcopy device. See xmgrace -version for a list of supported devices.

       -install
              Install private colormap

       -legend load
              Turn the graph legend on

       -log x|y|xy
              Set the axis scaling of the current graph to logarithmic

       -maxpath length
              Set the maximal drawing path length

       -mono  Run grace in monochrome mode (affects the display only)

       -netcdf file
              Assume data file is in netCDF format. This option is present only if the netCDF support was compiled in

       -netcdfxy X_var Y_var
              If  -netcdf  was  used  previously,  read from the netCDF file X_var and Y_var variables and create a set.  If X_var is "null" then load the index of Y to X.  This option is present only if the
              netCDF support was compiled in

       -noask Assume the answer is yes to all requests, if the operation would overwrite a file, grace will do so without prompting

       -noinstall
              Don't use private colormap

       -noprint
              In batch mode, do not print

              Disable safe mode

       -nosigcatch
              Don't catch signals

       -npipe file
              Read data from named pipe on startup

       -nxy file
              Assume data file is in X Y1 Y2 Y3 ...  format

       -param file
              Load parameters from file to the current graph

       -pexec string
              Interpret string as a parameter setting

       -pipe  Read data from stdin on startup

       -safe  Run in the safe mode (default)

       -saveall file
              Save all to file

       -seed value
              Integer seed for random number generator

       -settype xy|xydx|...
              Set the type of the next data file

       -source disk|pipe
              Source type of next data file

       -timer delay
              Set allowed time slice for real time inputs to delay ms

       -timestamp
              Add timestamp to plot

       -version
              Show the program version, registered devices and build time configuration information.

RESOURCES
       When run in the GUI mode, the interface is a subject to X resource settings.
              Please refer to the User's Guide for a list of important ones.

ENVIRONMENT
       GRACE_HOME
              Specifies the directory where the Grace docs and libs are stored. Default is /usr/local/grace

       GRACE_HELPVIEWER
              The shell command to run an HTML viewer for on-line browsing of the help documents. Must include at least one instance of "%s" which will be replaced with the actual URL by  Grace.  Default  is
              mozilla %s

       GRACE_EDITOR
              Specifies the editor which is used to edit sets. Default is xterm -e vi

       GRACE_PRINT_CMD
              The print command.

       GRACE_FFTW_RAM_WISDOM
              and GRACE_FFTW_WISDOM_FILE A flag (0 or 1) and a file name which determine whether a FFT should use `wisdom' when using the FFTW libraries.

FILES
       In many cases, when Grace needs to access a file given with a relative pathname, it searches for the file along the following path:
        ./pathname:./.grace/pathname:~/.grace/pathname:$GRACE_HOME/pathname

       The following files are of a special importance:

       gracerc - init file loaded upon start up.

       templates/Default.agr - the default template, loaded whenever a new project is started.

       fonts/FontDataBase - the file responsible for font configuration.
