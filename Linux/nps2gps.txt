NAME
       nps2gps - convert nucleotide-protein sets to ASN.1 genomic product sets

SYNOPSIS
       nps2gps [-] [-B] [-D] [-F] [-G str] [-L] [-N] [-P] [-Q] [-R] [-S] [-T] [-U] [-f str] [-i filename] [-o filename] [-p path] [-r path] [-x str]

DESCRIPTION
       nps2gps converts NCBI Bioseq-sets from simple nucleotide-protein sets to full genomic product sets complete with mRNA transcripts, which it outputs as text ASN.1.
