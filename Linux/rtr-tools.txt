NAME
       rtrclient - rtr rpki client

SYNOPSIS
       rtrclient [-kph] SOCKETS...

SOCKETS
       tcp [-kpb bindaddr] HOST PORT
       ssh [-kpb bindaddr] HOST PORT USERNAME (PRIVATE_KEY|PASSWORD) [HOST_KEY]

DESCRIPTION
       rtrclient  connects  to  an  RPKI/RTR  cache server and prints prefix, origin AS, and router key updates.  rtrclient can use plain tcp or ssh transport to connect to an RPKI/RTR cache server.  The
       amount is not limited and different transport types can be mixed arbitrarily.

       For tcp you must specify the HOST and PORT.

       For ssh you must specify the HOST, PORT, USERNAME and a file containing the PRIVATE_KEY or a PASSWORD.  By default the rtrclient will try to guess which of the two was entered. If you want to  ex‐
       plicitly specify this see -w and -s.  You may specify a file containing a list of HOST_KEYs, in the well known SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS file format. See sshd(8) for details.

OPTIONS
       -b bindaddr
           Set explicit bind address
       -h
           Print help message
       -k
           Print information about router key updates
       -p
           Print information about prefix and origin AS updates
       -s
           Print information about connection status updates
       -e
           Export ROAs after completing synchronisation and exit
       -t
           Select template for pfx export. May be a build in template (see -l) or a file path to a custom template (see TEMPLATES)
       -l
           Print available templates and exit. Prints specified templated, when used with -t.
       -o
           Output file for export
       -w
           force ssh authentication information to be interpreted as a password
       -s
           force ssh authentication information to be interpreted as a private key

TEMPLATES
       Templates can be used to export ROA information in a custom format. They are written in the mustache(https://mustache.github.io/) templating language.

       A  template  should  contain a section called roas which may contain the variables prefix, length, maxlen and origin.  The content of this section is expanded for every entry in the ROA table. The
       special variable last is true for the last entry of the prefix table. See the json template for a usage example.

EXAMPLES
       Print prefix and origin AS updates from a tcp based server

              rtrclient tcp -k rpki.example.com 323

       Print prefix and router key updates from a ssh based server

              rtrclient ssh -k -p rpki.example.com 22 rtr-ssh ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/known_hosts

       Use multiple rtr server, print prefix updates for some

              rtrclient tcp -p rpki.example.com 323 tcp rpki2.example.com 323 ssh -p rpki.example.com 22 rtr-ssh ~/.ssh/id_rsa

                                                                                                                                                                                               rtrclient(1)
