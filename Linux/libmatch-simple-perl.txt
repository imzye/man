NAME
       match::smart - clone of smartmatch operator

SYNOPSIS
          use v5.10;
          use match::smart;

          if ($this |M| $that)
          {
             say "$this matches $that";
          }

DESCRIPTION
       match::smart provides a match operator "|M|" that acts like more or less identically to the (as of Perl 5.18) deprecated smart match operator.

       If you don't like the crazy Sub::Infix operator, you can alternatively export a more normal function:

          use v5.10;
          use match::smart qw(match);

          if (match($this, $that))
          {
             say "$this matches $that";
          }

   Differences with ~~
       There were major changes to smart match between 5.10.0 and 5.10.1. This module attempts to emulate the behaviour of the operator in more recent versions of Perl. In particular, 5.18.0 (minus the
       warnings). Divergences not noted below should be considered bugs.

       While the real smart match operator implicitly takes references to operands that are hashes or arrays, match::smart's operator does not.

          @foo ~~ %bar       # means: \@foo ~~ \%bar
          @foo |M| %bar      # means: scalar(@foo) |M| scalar(%bar)

       If you want the "\@foo ~~ \%bar" behaviour, you need to add the backslashes yourself:

          \@foo |M| \%bar

       Similarly:

          "foo" ~~  /foo/    # works
          "foo" |M| /foo/    # no worky!
          "foo" |M| qr/foo/  # do this instead

       match::smart treats the "MATCH" method on blessed objects (if it exists) like an overloaded "~~". This is for compatibility with match::simple, and for compatibility with versions of Perl that
       don't have documented support for overloading "~~".
