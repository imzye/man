SMP_REP_PHY_ERR_LOG(8)                                                                             SMP_UTILS                                                                             SMP_REP_PHY_ERR_LOG(8)

NAME
       smp_rep_phy_err_log - invoke REPORT PHY ERROR LOG SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_rep_phy_err_log [--help] [--hex] [--interface=PARAMS] [--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] [--zero] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a  SAS  Serial Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT PHY ERROR LOG function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the
       SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between  HBAs  if  there  are  multiple
       present.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -p, --phy=ID
              phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and 254. Default is 0.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies  the  SAS  address  of the SMP target device. Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the target's SAS address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in
              decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

       -z, --zero
              zero the Allocated Response Length field in the request. This option also zeros the Request Length field in the request. This is required for strict  SAS-1.1  compliance.  However  this  option
              should not be given in SAS-2 and later; if it is given an abridged response may result.

NOTES
       Similar information is maintained for SAS SSP target phys (e.g. on a SAS disk). It can be obtained from the Protocol Specific Port log page with the sg_logs utility.

       Similar information may be obtained for SAS initiator phys (e.g. on a SAS HBA). As an example in Linux 2.6.28 error information can be found in this directory /sys/class/sas_phy/phy-4:0 (for the phy 0
       in SCSI/SAS host 4).

       Similar information may be obtained for SATA device phys (e.g. on a SATA disk). If there is a SAT layer between OS and the SATA device then the sg_sat_phy_event utility can fetch the information.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP REPORT PHY ERROR LOG function was introduced in SAS-1 .  The "Expander change count" field was added in SAS-2 .
