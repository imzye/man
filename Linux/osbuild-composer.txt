NAME
       osbuild-composer - OSBuild Composer Service

DESCRIPTION
       The  composer  project  is  a set of HTTP services for composing operating system images. It builds on the pipeline execution engine of osbuild [1] and defines its own class of images that it supports
       building.

       Multiple APIs are available to access a composer service. This includes support for the lorax-composer [2] API, and as such can serve as drop-in replacement for lorax-composer.

       You can control a composer instance either directly via the provided APIs, or through higher-level user-interfaces from external projects. This, for instance, includes a Cockpit Module  [3]  or  using
       the composer-cli [4] command-line tool.

   Frontends
       Composer does not ship with frontends itself. However, several external frontends for Composer already exist. These include:

       Cockpit Composer
              This module for Cockpit [5] allows a great level of control of a Composer instance running on a cockpit-managed machine.

       Composer CLI
              This command-line tool originated in the lorax [2] project, but can be used with Composer just as well.

RUNNING
       To deploy a composer instance, all you need is to

          # systemctl start osbuild-composer.socket

       Now you can access the service using composer-cli, for example:

          # composer-cli status show

       or using Cockpit with the Cockpit Composer module from a browser: http://localhost:9090
