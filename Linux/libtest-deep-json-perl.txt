NAME
       Test::Deep::JSON - Compare JSON with Test::Deep

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::Deep;
         use Test::Deep::JSON;

         cmp_deeply {
             foo => 'bar',
             payload => '{"a":1}',
         }, {
             foo => 'bar',
             payload => json({ a => ignore() }),
         };

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Deep::JSON provides the "json($expected)" function to expect that target can be parsed as a JSON string and matches (by "cmp_deeply") with $expected.

FUNCTIONS
       json($expected)
           Exported by default.

           $expected can be anything that "Test::Deep" recognizes.

           This parses the data as a JSON string, and compares the parsed object and $expected by "Test::Deep" functionality.

           Fails if the data cannot be parsed as a JSON string.
