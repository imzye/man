NAME
       baycomepp - Baycom EPP modem driver

SYNOPSIS
       baycomepp [ -lknvcaz ] [-p portaddr] [-m modestr] [--epp] [--ecp] [--eppconv] [--eppafsk] [--ifname name] [--hwaddr callsign] [--ipaddr ipaddress] [--netmask netmask] [--broadcast broadcast]

DESCRIPTION
       baycomepp is a user mode driver for the Baycom EPP modem family. It currently supports the conventional EPP modem (using the IDT 72xxx FIFO's) and the FPGA (Xilinx XCS10) variant. The driver auto‐
       matically  initializes  the FPGA modem depending on the requested mode.  In order to keep the resident memory footprint small (approx 20kBytes plus standard system shared libraries like libc), the
       initialization code is contained in a shared library called baycomfpga_init.so .  This driver is able to automatically attach itself to the kernel network stack as  a  network  interface  (usually
       called ax0). To do this it requires the Linux Kernel MKISS driver (enable CONFIG_MKISS).

OPTIONS
       baycomepp accepts the following options:

       -h     --help Display an overview of the available command line parameters and exit.

       -v     --verbose Increases the verbosity of the output. May be cumulated.

       -p     --port Specifies the base address of the EPP capable parallel port to which the modem is connected. Use the 0x prefix to specify hexadecimal numbers.

       -m     --mode Specifies various ``firmware'' options.

       -n     --no-daemon Do not start up in background as a daemon. Also log received and transmitted packets to stdout.

       -l     --log Log to syslog.

       -k     --kill Kill running baycomepp daemons. Don't start the driver proper.

       --epp  Start up in EPP FSK mode. Requires the FPGA version.

       --eppafsk
              Start up in EPP AFSK mode. Requires the FPGA version.

       --ecp  Start up in ECP FSK mode. Requires the FPGA version.

       --eppconv
              Start up in conventional EPP FSK mode. Requires the conventional version.

       --ifname
              Set the name of the interface (requires Linux 2.2.x)

       --hwaddr
              Set the hardware address (callsign) of the interface

       --ipaddr
              Set the ip address of the interface

       --netmask
              Set the netmask of the interface

       --broadcast
              Set the broadcast address of the interface

FIRMWARE OPTIONS
       intclk uses FPGA internal clock; don't use if an external oscillator is on board.

       extclk uses the external oscillator; recommended if the internal modem is used, as the frequency of the FPGA oscillator is not accurate enough.

       intmodem
              uses the internal modem

       extmodem
              uses a DF9IC type modem connected to the high speed modem connector

       divider=x
              sets the clock divider for the internal modem (baud=fquartz/16/divider)

       loopback
              sets an internal modem loopback

       extstat
              allows extended status readback

       noextstat
              disallows extended status readback
