NAME
       pw-jack - Use PipeWire instead of JACK

SYNOPSIS
       pw-jack [options] COMMAND [ARGUMENTS...]

DESCRIPTION
       pw-jack modifies the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that applications will load PipeWire's reimplementation of the JACK client libraries instead of JACK's own libraries. This results in
       JACK clients being redirected to PipeWire.

       If PipeWire's reimplementation of the JACK client libraries has been installed as a system-wide replacement for JACK's own libraries, then the whole system already behaves in that way, in which
       case pw-jack has no practical effect.

OPTIONS
       -h
           Show help.

       -r NAME
           The name of the remote instance to connect to. If left unspecified, a connection is made to the default PipeWire instance.

       -v
           Verbose operation.

EXAMPLES
       pw-jack sndfile-jackplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga
