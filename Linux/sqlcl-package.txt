NAME
       make-sqlcl-package - Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line Debian package builder

SYNOPSIS
       make-sqlcl-package [options] <file>

DESCRIPTION
       make-sqlcl-package is a utility that builds a Debian package for Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line.

       The Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line program is governed by the copyright holder (Oracle USA, Inc.), so you may be limited as to what you can do with the resulting package (i.e. no redistri‐
       bution, etc). This utility will simply help you create the Debian package, it is your responsibility to use the resulting package accordingly with the OTN license, a copy of which is included
       in the created package, that you must agree on when downloading the source.

       This  utility will require you to download the "Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line for All Platforms" archive from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview/> to create
       the Debian package from.
