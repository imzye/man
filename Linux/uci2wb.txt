NAME
       uci2wb - Protocol adapter for UCI dialects to XBoard

SYNOPSIS
       uci2wb [debug] [-var <variant>] [-nice <priority>] [-kill <delay>] [-c|-s|-x] <engine> [<directory>]

DESCRIPTION
       uci2wb is a protocol adapter, i.e. it can be used to run AI plugins ('engines') that communicate in one protocol in a GUI that communicates in another.  In this case uci2wb can make appear the
       engine specified in its argument, which must use a protocol similar to UCI ('Universal Chess Interface'), to the GUI as an engine using XBoard protocol ('Chess Engine Communication Protocol',
       CECP).

       The protocols for which it can mediate are UCI (both the official standard, as well as the 'Cyclone dialect' that is commonly used by Chinese-Chess engines, and the 'Arena960 dialect' used by pre-
       standard Chess960 engines), USI ('Universal Shogi Interface', used by some Shogi engines) and UCCI ('Universal Chinese-Chess Interface').  When set to UCI through an explicit -c argument, it uses
       Cyclone dialect when playing xiangqi games.

OPTIONS
       -c -s -x -f
               The  flag  arguments  -c  (default),  -s or -x set uci2wb to use UCI, USI or UCCI, respectively.  If there is more than one character in the flag argument, all characters but the first are
               ignored.  This can be used by passing uci2wb the full variant name ('shogi' or 'xiangqi') as a flag, to make it automatically choose the appropriate protocol (USI or UCCI).   Other  values
               also  select  UCI,  but the value -f in addition implies uci2wb should announce it supports Chess960 even for UCI engines that don't have the standard UCI_Chess960 option, and in that case
               causes castlings to be sent to them as O-O or O-O-O instead of the standard KxR notation.

       -var <variant>
               Forces uci2wb to announce to the GUI it supports (only) the specified variant.  Although a UCI_Variant option has been proposed as a way for UxI engines to announce  what  they  can  play,
               (and  is  supported by uci2wb), not many engines implement this.  So if these are not the standard variants implied by the protocol choice, (but, f.e. seirawan or 6x6+6_shogi) it has to be
               configured on the uci2wb command line through this option.

       -nice <priority>
               Runs the engine processes at the requested priority; positive values lower the priority.

       -kill <delay>
               Increases the time between receiving a 'quit' command and killing of an engine process that somehow could not be made to exit through the normal handling of this (50 ms by default) by  the
               specified delay.

       debug   Makes  uci2wb  report  to  the  GUI  everything  it  receives  from the engine, as a CECP engine comment (i.e. prefixed with '#').  This would make it appear in the GUI's log of the engine
               communication.  Some critical commands it sends to the engine (such as the 'position-moves' and 'go' commands) will be reported as well.  This option can also  be  switched  interactively,
               through the 'UCI2WB debug output' checkbox option appearing as additional engine option.

       directory
               If a directory is specified, the engine is started with that directory set as current directory.

       byoyomi work-arounds
               Byoyomi  is  a  mode  of  time  control  in  USI  not  supported  by CECP.  Engines can be forced to run in this mode by letting the GUI use incremental or sudden-death TC, and ticking the
               interactive 'Floating Byoyomi' checkbox option that uci2wb pools with the engine options.  An accompanying option 'Byoyomi (sec)' allows you to force a fixed value >= 0 for the byoyomi  to
               be sent to the engine when 'Floating Byoyomi' is off.
