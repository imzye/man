DESCRIPTION
       The WC (Whozz Calling) gateway obtains Caller ID from one or more Whozz Calling Ethernet Link devices.  The Whozz Calling Ethernet Link device handles multi-line Caller ID, either 2, 4, or 8 telephone
       lines.  The basic models handle incoming calls and the deluxe models handle incoming and outgoing calls.

       See the Whozz Calling feature matrix for the various models:
         http://www.callerid.com/feature-table/

       The Whozz Calling devices do not pick-up, go off-hook, or answer the telephone line.  They cannot be used to hangup the line for phone numbers in the ncidd blacklist file, but a modem can be used with
       the WC gateway for the blacklist feature of ncidd.

REQUIREMENTS
       The NCID server
           http://ncid.sourceforge.net/ncid/ncid.html

       At least one Whozz Calling Ethernet Link device
           http://www.callerid.com

       perl 5.6 or higher, perl(Config::Simple), perl(Data::HexDump)

OPTIONS
       -n <[host][:port]>, --ncidhost <[host][:port]>
         Specifies the NCID server.  Port may be specified by suffixing the hostname with :<port>.

         Input must be <host> or <host:port>, or <:port>

         Default:  localhost:3333

       -w <address1[,address2][,...]>, --wchost <address1[,address2],[,...]>
         Specifies the Whozz Calling Ethernet Link Device or devices.  Multiple addresses for devices are comma separated.

         Input must be <address> or <address1,address2,etc>.

         Default: 192.168.0.90

       -d <seconds>, --delay <seconds>
         If the connection to the NCID server is lost, try every <delay> seconds to reconnect.

         Default: 15

       -D, --debug
         Debug mode, displays all messages that go into the log file.  Use this option to run interactively.

       -H <0|1>, --hostname-flag <0|1>
         When the hostname flag is set to 1, the IDENT string sent to a server will include the hostname with the program name.

         Default: 0

       -h, --help
         Displays the help message and exits.

       -m, --man
         Displays the manual page and exits.

       -C, --configfile <filename>
         Specifies the configuration file to use.  The program will still run if a configuration file is not found.

         Default: /etc/ncid/wc2ncid.conf

       --set-wc
         Sets the IP address, beginning line number, number of telephone lines, and sending port for each Whozz Calling Ethernet Link Device.

         It sets the IP address for the WC device from the address for "wcaddr" in the configuration file or --wchost on the command line.

         It automatically sets the beginning line number for the WC device which is used as a line label prefixed with "WC".  Each device gets a beginning line number that is the ending line number plus one
         from the preceeding device, for example; device 1 (WC01 WC02) device 2 (WC03 WC04 WC05 WC06).

         NOTE: All devices are automatically configured to send call information on port 3520.

       -l, --logfile-append <filename>
       -L, --logfile-overwrite <filename>
         Specifies the logfile name to write.  The program will still run if it does not have permission to write to it.

         If both options are present, --logfile-append takes precedence.

         Default: Append to /var/log/wc2ncid.log

       -p, --pidfile <filename>
         Specifies the pidfile name to write. The program will still run if it does not have permission to write a pidfile. The pid filename that should be used is /var/run/wc2ncid.pid.

         Default: no pidfile

       -t, --test
         Test mode is a connection to the Whozz Calling Network Device without a connection to the NCID server.  It sets debug mode and verbose = 3.  The verbose level can be changed on the command line.

         Default: no test mode

       -v, --verbose <1-9>
         Output information, used for the logfile and the debug option.  Set the level to a higher number for more information.  Levels range from 1 to 9, but not all levels are used.

         Default: verbose = 1

       -V, --version
         Displays the version.

EXAMPLES
       Start wc2ncid, set IP address to 192.168.1.90 from command line, set the beginning line number automatically and set the sending Ethernet port to 3520 (the default):
           wc2ncid --set-wc --wchost 192.168.1.90

       Start wc2ncid in test and debug modes at verbose 5:
           wc2ncid -tv5

FILES
       /etc/ncid/wc2ncid.conf
