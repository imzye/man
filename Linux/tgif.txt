NAME
       pstoepsi - convert PostScript to encapsulated PostScript with bitmap

SYNOPSIS
       pstoepsi [-gs|-news] [-strip] [-2x] [-noprev] [-debug] file.ps file.epsi

DESCRIPTION
       pstoepsi will convert an arbitrary PostScript image to an encapsulated PostScript image with a bitmap, suitable for incorporation into FrameMaker, LaTeX, troff, etc.

       Note in the USAGE line, the source PostScript file must end in a .ps extention.  This is a GhostScript requirement, not mine...

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

OPTIONS
       -gs    Use ghostscript to convert to EPSI.

       -news  Use Sun's X/NeWS (OpenWindows) to convert to EPSI.

       -strip Strip all %% directives from the source file -- useful when dealing with Adobe Illustrator and others who use directives incompatible with this convention.

       -2x    Use 2X resolution.

       -noprev
              Do not include the preview bitmap.

       -debug Print debugging information.
