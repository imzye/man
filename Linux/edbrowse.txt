NAME
       edbrowse - text editor and web browser

SYNOPSIS
       edbrowse [ file1 ] [ file2 ] ...

       edbrowse [ url1 ] [ url2 ]  ...

DESCRIPTION
       Complete documentation can be found in the user's guide; see below.

       edbrowse is a line-oriented text editor very similar to ed(1), It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files.

       In addition edbrowse can be used to display web pages and edit the contents of these pages. It supports the use of forms and Javascript in web pages.

       If  edbrowse is invoked with a file argument, then a copy of file is read into the editor's buffer. If it is invoked with a url argument, then the url is read into the editor's buffer and the HTML
       is rendered as text.  Changes are made to this copy and not directly to file or url itself.

       Please refer to ed(1) for further details regarding the editing commands. Explanation of the browsing functions can be found in the HTML documentation.

EXAMPLES
       To read the HTML documentation you can do

              edbrowse /usr/share/doc/edbrowse/usersguide.html

       To read (say) 20 lines of the buffer at a time starting from the top use the command `0z20' followed by repeating `z' to scroll another 20 lines at a time.

       To quit the editor completely type `qt' . Upon quitting edbrowse, any changes not explicitly saved  with a `w' command are lost. The `w' command does not apply to URLs but one can save the  corre‐
       sponding buffer to a file by the command w file.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display the usage message.

       -e     Batch mode. This option causes edbrowse to exit when it encounters an error.

       -d?    Debug  level.  Can  be  set to a value between 0 and 9. The default is 1 which prints the sizes of buffers. Some people like 2 which prints out URLs as they are retrieved. This value can be
              changed within the editor with the dbx command with x a value between 0 and 9.

       -c     Edit config file. This command suppresses the processing of the configuration file $HOME/.ebrc and starts editing it instead. This option is useful if this file is  syntactically  incorrect
              or otherwise corrupted.

FILES
       $HOME/.ebrc         Configuration file. The file which edbrowse reads when it starts up. If the file exists then it must be syntactically correct.

DIAGNOSTICS
       When an error occurs, if edbrowse it prints a `?' and returns to command mode.  An explanation of the last error can be printed with the `h' (help) command.

       Attempting  to quit edbrowse with the `q' command or trying to edit another file before writing a modified buffer results in an error. If the command is entered a second time, it succeeds, but any
       changes to the buffer are lost.
