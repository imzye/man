NAME
       yamdi - yet another metadata injector (flv)

SYNOPSIS
       yamdi -i input file [-x xml file | -o output file [-x xml file]] [-t temporary file] [-c creator] [-a interval] [-skMXw] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       yamdi stands for Yet Another MetaData Injector and is a metadata injector for FLV files. It adds the onMetaData event to your FLV files.

OPTIONS
       -i     The source FLV file. If the file name is '-' the input file will be read from stdin. Use the -t option to specify a temporary file.

       -o     The resulting FLV file with the metatags. If the output file is '-' the FLV file will be written to stdout.

       -x     An XML file with the resulting metadata information. If the output file is ommited, only metadata will be generated.

       -t     A temporary file to store the source FLV file in if the input file is read from stdin.

       -c     A string that will be written into the creator tag.

       -s, -l Add the onLastSecond event.  The -l option is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

       -k     Add the onLastKeyframe event.

       -M     Strip all metadata from the FLV. The -s and -k options will be ignored.

       -X     Omit the keyframes tag in the XML output.

       -a     Time in milliseconds between keyframes if there is only audio. This option will be ignored if there is a video stream. No keyframes will be added if this option is omitted.

       -w     Replace the input file with the output file. -i and -o are required to be different files otherwise this option will be ignored.

       -h     Show summary of options.

EXIT STATUS
       yamdi exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
