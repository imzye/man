NAME
       gdalmanage -  Identify, delete, rename and copy raster data files.

SYNOPSIS
          Usage: gdalmanage mode [-r] [-u] [-f format]
                            datasetname [newdatasetname]

DESCRIPTION
       The  gdalmanage  program  can perform various operations on raster data
       files, depending on the chosen mode. This includes  identifying  raster
       data types and deleting, renaming or copying the files.

       <mode> Mode of operation

              identify <datasetname>:
                     List data format of file.

              copy <datasetname> <newdatasetname>:
                     Create a copy of the raster file with a new name.

              rename <datasetname> <newdatasetname>:
                     Change the name of the raster file.

              delete <datasetname>:
                     Delete raster file.

       -r     Recursively scan files/folders for raster files.

       -u     Report failures if file type is unidentified.

       -f <format>
              Specify  format  of  raster  file if unknown by the application.
              Uses short data format name (e.g. GTiff).

       <datasetname>
              Raster file to operate on.

       <newdatasetname>
              For copy and rename modes, you provide a source filename  and  a
              target  filename, just like copy and move commands in an operat‐
              ing system.

EXAMPLES
   Using identify mode
       Report the data format of the raster file by using  the  identify  mode
       and specifying a data file name:

          $ gdalmanage identify NE1_50M_SR_W.tif

          NE1_50M_SR_W.tif: GTiff

       Recursive mode will scan subfolders and report the data format:

          $ gdalmanage identify -r 50m_raster/

          NE1_50M_SR_W/ne1_50m.jpg: JPEG
          NE1_50M_SR_W/ne1_50m.png: PNG
          NE1_50M_SR_W/ne1_50m_20pct.tif: GTiff
          NE1_50M_SR_W/ne1_50m_band1.tif: GTiff
          NE1_50M_SR_W/ne1_50m_print.png: PNG
          NE1_50M_SR_W/NE1_50M_SR_W.aux: HFA
          NE1_50M_SR_W/NE1_50M_SR_W.tif: GTiff
          NE1_50M_SR_W/ne1_50m_sub.tif: GTiff
          NE1_50M_SR_W/ne1_50m_sub2.tif: GTiff

   Using copy mode
       Copy the raster data:

          $ gdalmanage copy NE1_50M_SR_W.tif ne1_copy.tif

   Using rename mode
       Rename raster data:

          $ gdalmanage rename NE1_50M_SR_W.tif ne1_rename.tif

   Using delete mode
       Delete the raster data:

          gdalmanage delete NE1_50M_SR_W.tif
