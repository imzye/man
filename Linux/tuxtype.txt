NAME
       tuxtype - TuxTyping typing tutor

SYNOPSIS
       tuxtype [OPTION] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tuxtype command.

       TuxTyping  is an educational typing tutorial game starring Tux, the Linux Penguin. The player guides Tux to eat fish which are falling from the top of the screen. Each fish has a letter written on
       it. When the player presses the corresponding key, Tux will position himself to eat the fish.  The game is intended for children learning to type, though it  does  have  higher  difficulty  levels
       which even experienced typers may find challenging.
