NAME
       primitivus - Salut à Toi's console interface

SYNOPSIS
       primitivus [ --profile=PROFILE | --help ]

DESCRIPTION
       Primitivus is Salut à Toi's console interface, based on Urwid.

       Primitivus is modal (vi-like), one can switch from one mode to another in the same way as in vi/vim:

       •   From any mode, press [Esc] to switch to normal mode.

       •   From normal mode, press : to switch to command mode.

       •   From normal mode, press i to switch to insert mode — the one you use to write messages to your contacts.

       Primitivus  can be handled either with the mouse, in a very intuitive way, or with the keyboard. The keyboard shortcuts are explained in the section KEYBOARD
       HANDLING.
