               GISDBASE/LOCATION/MAPSET

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to launch GRASS GIS. It will parse the command line arguments and then initialize GRASS for the user. Since GRASS modules require a spe‐
       cific environment, this program must be called before any other GRASS module can run. The command line arguments are optional and provide  the  user  with  a
       method to indicate the desired user interface, as well as the desired mapset to work on.

       The  startup  program will remember both the desired user interface and mapset. Thus, the next time the user runs GRASS, typing grass78 (without any options)
       will start GRASS with the previous settings for the user interface and mapset selected.

       If you specify a graphical user interface (--gui) the grass78 program will try to verify that the system you specified exists and that you can access it suc‐
       cessfully. If any of these checks fail then grass78 will automatically switch back to the text user interface mode.

FLAGS
       The flag --config option prints GRASS GIS configuration and version parameters, with the options:

           •   arch: system architecture (e.g., x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

           •   build: (e.g., ./configure --with-cxx --enable-largefile --with-proj [...])

           •   compiler: (e.g., gcc)

           •   date: (e.g., 2020-04-24T14:49:27+00:00)

           •   path: (e.g., /usr/lib64/grass78)

           •   revision: (e.g., 54aa6fb87)

           •   svn_revision: (e.g., 4aa6fb87)

           •   version: (e.g., 7.8.3)

SAMPLE DATA
       The  GRASS  GIS  project  provides  several  free  sample  geospatial datasets as ready-to-use locations. They are available to download at https://grass.os‐
       geo.org/download/sample-data/.  The "North Carolina data set" is a modern package of geospatial data from North Carolina (USA), and it includes raster,  vec‐
       tor,  LiDAR  and  satellite data. This is the most extensively used data set in the documentation and the examples throughout the user manual pages are based
       upon it.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       A number of environment variables are available at GRASS startup to assist with automation and customization. Most users will not need to bother with these.

       In addition to these shell environment variables GRASS maintains a number of GIS environment variables in the $HOME/.grass7/rc file.  User  changes  to  this
       file  will  be read during the next startup of GRASS. If this file becomes corrupted the user may edit it by hand or remove it to start afresh.  See the list
       of implemented GRASS variables for more information.  The rest of this help page will only consider shell environment variables.

       Note that you will need to set these variables using the appropriate method required for the UNIX shell that you use (e.g. in a Bash shell  you  must  export
       the variables for them to propagate).

   User Interface Environment Variable
       The  grass78 program will check for the existence of an environment variable called GRASS_GUI which indicates the type of user interface for GRASS to use. If
       this variable is not set when grass78 is run, then it will be created and then saved in the $HOME/.grass7/rc file for the next time GRASS is run. It  can  be
       set to text, gtext or gui.

       There is an order of precedence in the way grass78 determines the user interface to use. The following is the hierarchy from highest precedence to lowest.

       1      Command line argument

       2      Environment variable GRASS_GUI

       3      Value set in $HOME/.grass7/rc (GUI)

       4      Default value - gui

   Python Environment Variables
       If you choose to use wxGUI interface, then the GRASS_PYTHON environment variable can be used to override your system default python command.

       Suppose for example your system has Python 3.6 installed and you install a personal version of the Python 3.7 binaries under $HOME/bin. You can use the above
       variables to have GRASS use the Python 3.7 binaries instead.
          GRASS_PYTHON=python3.7

   Addon Path to Extra User Scripts
       This environment variable allows the user to extend the GRASS program search paths to include locally developed/installed GRASS modules or user scripts.
          GRASS_ADDON_PATH=/usr/mytools
          GRASS_ADDON_PATH=/usr/mytools:/usr/local/othertools

       In this example above path(s) would be added to the standard GRASS path environment.

   Addon Base for Extra Local GRASS Addon Modules
       This environment variable allows the user to extend the GRASS program search paths to include locally installed (see g.extension  for  details)  GRASS  Addon
       modules which are not distributed with the standard GRASS release.
          GRASS_ADDON_BASE=/usr/grass-addons

       In this example above path would be added to the standard GRASS path environment.

       If not defined by user, this variable is set by GRASS startup program to $HOME/.grass7/addons on GNU/Linux and $APPDATA\GRASS7\addons on MS Windows.

   HTML Browser Variable
       The GRASS_HTML_BROWSER environment variable allows the user to set the HTML web browser to use for displaying help pages.

   Running non-interactive batch jobs
       If  the  GRASS_BATCH_JOB environment variable is set to the full path and filename of a shell script then GRASS will be launched in a non-interactive way and
       the script will be run. The script itself can be interactive if that is what the user requires. When it is finished GRASS will automatically exit  using  the
       exit-success code given by the script. The script file must have its executable bit set.

EXAMPLES
       The following are some examples of how you could start GRASS

       grass78
           Start GRASS using the default user interface. The user will be prompted to choose the appropriate location and mapset.

       grass78 --gui
           Start GRASS using the graphical user interface. The user will be prompted to choose the appropriate location and mapset.

       grass78 --text
           Start  GRASS  using  the text-based user interface. Appropriate location and mapset must be set by environmental variables (see examples below) otherwise
           taken from the last GRASS session.

       grass78 --gtext
           Start GRASS using the text-based user interface. The user will be prompted to choose the appropriate location and mapset.

       grass78 $HOME/grassdata/spearfish70/user1
           Start GRASS using the default user interface and automatically launch into the given mapset, bypassing the mapset selection menu.

       grass78 --gui -
           Start GRASS using the graphical user interface and try to obtain the location and mapset from environment variables.

       grass78 -c EPSG:4326 $HOME/grassdata/mylocation
           Creates a new GRASS location with EPSG code 4326 (latitude-longitude, WGS84) in the specified GISDBASE

       grass78 -c EPSG:5514:3 $HOME/grassdata/mylocation
           Creates a new GRASS location with EPSG code 5514 (S-JTSK / Krovak East North - SJTSK) with datum transformation parameters used in Czech Republic in  the
           specified GISDBASE

       grass78 -c XY $HOME/grassdata/gnomonic --exec g.proj -c proj4=’+proj=gnom +lat_0=90 +lon_0=-50’
           Creates a new GRASS location from PROJ definition string (here: gnomonic) in the specified GISDBASE

       grass78 -c myvector.shp $HOME/grassdata/mylocation
           Creates a new GRASS location based on georeferenced Shapefile

       grass78 -c myraster.tif $HOME/grassdata/mylocation
           Creates a new GRASS location based on georeferenced GeoTIFF file

   Batch jobs with the exec interface
       Creating a new Location based on a geodata file’s projection (-c) and exit (-e) immediately:
       grass78 -c elevation.tiff -e /path/to/grassdata/test1/
       Linking external raster data to PERMANENT Mapset:
       grass78 /path/to/grassdata/test1/PERMANENT/ --exec r.external input=basins.tiff output=basins
       grass78 /path/to/grassdata/test1/PERMANENT/ --exec r.external input=elevation.tiff output=elevation
       Get statistics for one raster map:
       grass78 /path/to/grassdata/test1/PERMANENT/ --exec r.univar map=elevation
       Compare the rasters visually:
       grass78 /path/to/grassdata/test1/PERMANENT/ --exec g.gui.mapswipe first=elevation second=basins

   Execution of shell and Python scripts instead of single commands
       A sequence of commands can be bundled in a script and executed using the exec interface.

       Shell script example: the command to execute a shell script might be:
       grass78 /path/to/grassdata/test1/PERMANENT/ --exec sh test.sh
       A very simple bash script ("test.sh") may look like this:
       #!/bin/bash
       g.region -p
       g.list type=raster
       r.info elevation

       Python script example: the command to execute a Python script might be:
       grass78 /path/to/grassdata/test1/PERMANENT/ --exec python test.py
       A very simple Python script ("test.py") may look like this:
       #!/usr/bin/env python3
       # import GRASS Python bindings (see also pygrass)
       import grass.script as gscript
       import grass.script.setup as gsetup
       gscript.message(’Current GRASS GIS 7 environment:’)
       print(gscript.gisenv())
       gscript.message(’Available raster maps:’)
       for raster in gscript.list_strings(type=’raster’):
           print(raster)
       gscript.message(’Available vector maps:’)
       for vector in gscript.list_strings(type=’vector’):
           print(vector)

   Using temporary location
       Creating  a  new temporary location based on a georeferenced file’s projection coordinate reference system (CRS) and simultaneously starting computation in a
       shell script:
       grass78 --tmp-location elevation.tiff --exec test.sh
       The same, but using an EPSG code and a Python script:
       grass78 --tmp-location EPSG:3358 --exec test.py
       Finally, for special cases, we can create an XY location without any CRS:
       grass78 --tmp-location XY --exec test.py
       Temporary location is automatically deleted after computation, so the script is expected to export, link or otherwise preserve the output data before ending.

       A single command can be also executed, e.g. to examine properties of the temporary location:
       grass78 --tmp-location EPSG:3358 --exec g.proj -p
       A temporary XY location with single command is useful, e.g. to show help text of a module:
       grass78 --tmp-location XY --exec r.neighbors --help

   Troubleshooting
       Importantly, to avoid an "[Errno 8] Exec format error" there must be a shebang line at the top of the script (like #!/bin/sh, #!/bin/bash, or  #!/usr/bin/env
       python3) indicating which interpreter to be used for the script. The script file must have its executable bit set.

CAVEAT
       If  you  start GRASS using the wxGUI interface you must have a python command in your $PATH variable. That is, the command must be named python and not some‐
       thing like python3.6. Rarely some Python installations do not create a python command. In these cases you can override python by  GRASS_PYTHON  environmental
       variable.

       Furthermore,  if you have more than one version of Python installed, make sure that the version you want to use with GRASS is set by GRASS_PYTHON environmen‐
       tal variable.
