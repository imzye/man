NAME
       esolver - eigensolver for standard eigenvalue problems (Ritz values only)

SYNOPSIS
       esolver matrix_filename evalues_filename [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This program inputs the matrix data from matrix_filename and solves the standard eigenvalue problem A*x = l*x with the solver specified by options.  It outputs the specified number of Ritz values, the
       number of which is given by option -ss, to evalues_filename in the extended Matrix Market format (see Appendix of Lis User Guide). Both the Matrix Market format and the Harwell-Boeing format are  sup‐
       ported for the matrix filename.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -e eigensolver

                     -ss [1]
                            The size of the subspace

              -e {ai|8}

              -eprint {mem|1}
                     Save the residual history

              -eprint {out|2}
                     Output it to the standard output

              -eprint {all|3}
                     Save the residual history and output it to the standard output

       -omp_num_threads [t]
              The number of the threads (t represents the maximum number of the threads)

       -estorage [0]
              The matrix storage format

       -estorage_block [2]
              The block size of the BSR and BSC formats

       -ef [0]
              The precision of the eigensolver

              -ef {double|0}
                     Double precision

              -ef {quad|1}
                     Double-double (quadruple) precision

       See Lis User Guide for full description.
