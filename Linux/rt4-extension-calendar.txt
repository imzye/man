NAME
       RTx::Calendar - Calendar for RT due dates

DESCRIPTION
       This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in ticket search sub navigation menu.

       Date fields in the search results are displayed/used in the calendar, for example if you have a ticket with a due date, it won't be displayed on that date unless the Due field is included in
       the search result format.

       There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html), see the CONFIGURATION section below for details on adding it.
