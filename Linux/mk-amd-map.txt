NAME
       mk-amd-map - create database maps for Amd

SYNOPSIS
       mk-amd-map [ -p ] mapname

DESCRIPTION
       mk-amd-map  creates  the database maps used by the keyed map lookups in
       amd(8).  It reads input from the named file and outputs them to a  cor‐
       respondingly named hashed database.

       -p     This  option prints the map on standard output instead of gener‐
              ating a database.  This is usually used  to  merge  continuation
              lines into one physical line.
