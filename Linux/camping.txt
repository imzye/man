NAME
       camping - small Ruby web framework for MVC type applications

SYNOPSIS
       camping app1.rb app2.rb...

DESCRIPTION
       Camping  is  a  web  framework  which consistently stays at less than 4kb of code.  The idea here is to store a complete fledgling web application (written in Ruby) in a single file like many
       small CGIs, but to organize it as a Model-View-Controller application like Rails does.  You can then easily move it to Rails once you've got it going.

   Specific options:
       -h, --host HOSTNAME
              Host for web server to bind to (default is all IPs)

       -p, --port NUM
              Port for web server (defaults to 3301)

       -d, --database FILE
              SQLite3 database path (defaults to ~/.camping.db)

       -C, --console
              Run in console mode with IRB

       -s, --server NAME
              Server to force (mongrel, webrick, console)

   Common options:
       -?, --help
              Show this message

       -v, --version
              Show version

FILES
       ~/.camping.db
              The default database file.
