NAME
       PCPOTRF - compute the Cholesky factorization of an N-by-N complex hermitian positive definite distributed matrix sub( A ) denoting A(IA:IA+N-1, JA:JA+N-1)

SYNOPSIS
       SUBROUTINE PCPOTRF( UPLO, N, A, IA, JA, DESCA, INFO )

           CHARACTER       UPLO

           INTEGER         IA, INFO, JA, N

           INTEGER         DESCA( * )

           COMPLEX         A( * )

PURPOSE
       PCPOTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of an N-by-N complex hermitian positive definite distributed matrix sub( A ) denoting A(IA:IA+N-1, JA:JA+N-1).

       The factorization has the form

                 sub( A ) = U' * U ,  if UPLO = 'U', or

                 sub( A ) = L  * L',  if UPLO = 'L',

       where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

       Notes
       =====

       Each  global  data  object is described by an associated description vector.  This vector stores the information required to establish the mapping between an
       object element and its corresponding process and memory location.

       Let A be a generic term for any 2D block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an associated description vector DESCA.  In the following  com‐
       ments, the character _ should be read as "of the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       --------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A >= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be computed by:
               LOCr( M ) <= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) <= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

       This routine requires square block decomposition ( MB_A = NB_A ).

ARGUMENTS
       UPLO    (global input) CHARACTER
               = 'U':  Upper triangle of sub( A ) is stored;
               = 'L':  Lower triangle of sub( A ) is stored.

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows and columns to be operated on, i.e. the order of the distributed submatrix sub( A ). N >= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) COMPLEX pointer into the
               local  memory to an array of dimension (LLD_A, LOCc(JA+N-1)).  On entry, this array contains the local pieces of the N-by-N Hermitian distributed ma‐
               trix sub( A ) to be factored.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of sub( A ) contains the upper triangular part of the  matrix,
               and  its  strictly  lower  triangular part is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of sub( A ) contains the lower
               triangular part of the distribu- ted matrix, and its strictly upper triangular part is not referenced. On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the  upper  triangular
               part  of  the  distributed  matrix  contains the Cholesky factor U, if UPLO = 'L', the lower triangular part of the distribu- ted matrix contains the
               Cholesky factor L.

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       INFO    (global output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               < 0:  If the i-th argument is an array and the j-entry had an illegal value, then INFO = -(i*100+j), if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an  il‐
               legal value, then INFO = -i.  > 0:  If INFO = K, the leading minor of order K,
               A(IA:IA+K-1,JA:JA+K-1) is not positive definite, and the factorization could not be completed.
