NAME
       glob2 — Real Time Strategy Game

SYNOPSIS
       glob2 [-h ]  [-f ]  [-r ]  [-s640x480]  [-a ]  [-b ]  [-l ]  [-t [01]]  [-d /home/foo/bar]  [-u jack]  [-host MapName]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the glob2 command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       glob2 is a Real Time Strategy game, which can be compared with Warcraft and also Sims-games family. The primary aim of the game is to kill your opponents, just like in Warcraft-like games, and the
       whole control is processed through buildings, not units, as in Sims-games family.
