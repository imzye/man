Test::File::ShareDir::Module(3pm)                                                   User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                   Test::File::ShareDir::Module(3pm)

NAME
       Test::File::ShareDir::Module - Simplified module oriented ShareDir tester

VERSION
       version 1.001002

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::File::ShareDir::Module {
               '-root' => "some/root/path",
               'Module::Foo' => "share/ModuleFoo",
           };

       "-root" is optional, and defaults to "cwd"

       NOTE: There's a bug prior to 5.18 with "use Foo { -key => }", so for backwards compatibility, make sure you either quote the key: "use Foo { '-key' => }", or make it the non-first key.
