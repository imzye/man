NAME
       playback - IBM x3270 trace file playback tool

SYNOPSIS
       playback [ -p port ] trace_file

DESCRIPTION
       playback  opens  a trace file (presumably created by the x3270 Trace Data Stream facility) and plays the host data it contains back over a socket to processes that connect to it.  It also displays the
       data produced by the process in response.

       Once connected to a process, playback is used interactively.  Keyboard commands control the flow of data from the file to the socket.  These commands are:

       s      Send one line of data.

       r      Send one record of data (send data until the TELNET EOR sequence is reached).

       q      Exit playback.

       d      Disconnect the current socket and wait for another connection.

EXAMPLE
       Suppose you wanted to play back a trace file called /usr/tmp/x3trc.12345.  In one window, run:

            playback /usr/tmp/x3trc.12345

       In another window, start x3270 with the command:

            x3270 localhost 4001

       playback will announce the connection.

       Thereafter, the s and r commands will send data from the file to x3270.
