NAME
       POE::Loop::Tk - a bridge that allows POE to be driven by Tk

SYNOPSIS
       See POE::Loop.

         use Tk;
         use POE;

         # Rest of your program here.

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Loop::Tk replaces POE's internal event loop with the Tk module.  This allows programs to use both POE and Tk at the same time.

       POE::Loop::Tk implements the interface documented in POE::Loop.  Therefore it has no documentation of its own.  Please see POE::Loop for more details.

       POE::Loop::Tk is one of two versions of the Tk event loop bridge.  The other, POE::Loop::TkActiveState accommodates behavior differences in ActiveState's build of Tk.  Both versions share common
       code in POE::Loop::TkCommon.  POE::Loop::Tk dynamically selects the appropriate event loop bridge based on the runtime environment.
