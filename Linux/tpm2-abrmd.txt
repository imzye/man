NAME
       tpm2-abrmd - TPM2 access broker and resource management daemon

SYNOPSIS
       tpm2-abrmd [-m][-e][-i][-o][-l logger-name][-r][-s][-g /dev/urandom][-t conf]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm2-abrmd is a daemon that implements the TPM access broker and resource manager as described by the Trusted Computing Group (TGC) in the “TSS System Level API and TPM Command Transmission Inter‐
       face Specification”.  This daemon uses the DBus system bus and some pipes to communicate with clients.

OPTIONS
       -t, --tcti
              Provide  the daemon with a string that describes the TCTI and how to configure it for communication with the next component down the TSS2 stack. This string is formatted as "tcti-name:tcti-
              conf" where:

              'tcti-name'
                     The name of the TCTI library shared object file. Libraries are found using the same algorithm  as  dlopen  (3).  If  the  TCTI  library  file  name  follows  the  naming  convention:
                     libtss2-tcti-<name>.so.0 where <name> is the name for the TCTI, the value of <name> may be supplied in place of the full library file name. See 'EXAMPLES' below.

              'tcti-conf'
                     The configuration string passed to the TCTI library upon initialization.

              If  this  option is omitted (or a NULL string provided) then a default TCTI is used in it's default configuration. If the string does not contain a colon then it will be interpreted as only
              the 'tcti-name'. To provide only the configuration string (using the default TCTI) then the first character in the string passed to this option must be a colon followed by the configuration
              string. See examples below.

       -o, --allow-root
              Allow daemon to run as root. If this option is not provided the daemon will refused to run as the root user. Use of this option is not recommended.

       -m, --max-connections
              Set an upper bound on the number of concurrent client connections allowed.  Once this number of client connections is reached new connections will be rejected with an error. If  the  option
              is not specified the default is 27.

       -f, --flush-all
              Flush all objects and sessions when daemon is started.

       -l, --logger
              Direct logging output to named logging target. Supported targets are stdout and syslog. If the logger option is not specified the default is stdout.

       -e, --max-sessions
              Set and upper bound on the number of sessions that each client connection is allowed to create (loaded or active) at any one time. If the option is not specified the default is 4.

       -r, --max-transients
              Set an upper bound on the number of transient objects that each client connection allowed to load. Once this number of objects is reached attempts to load new transient objects will produce
              an error. If the option is not specified the default is 27.

       -n, --dbus-name
              Claim the given name on dbus. This option overrides the default of com.intel.tss2.Tabrmd.

       -g, --prng-seed-file
              Read seed for pseudo-random number generator from the provided file.

       -s, --session
              Connect daemon to the session dbus. If the option is not specified the daemon connects to the system dbus.

       -v, --version
              Display version string.

EXAMPLES
       Execute daemon with default TCTI and options:
          tpm2-abrmd

       Execute daemon with default TCTI and provided config string:
          tpm2-abrmd --tcti=":/dev/tpm0"

       This is equivalent to:
          tpm2-abrmd --tcti="device:/dev/tpm0"
          tpm2-abrmd --tcti="libtss2-tcti-device.so.0:/dev/tpm0"

       Have daemon use swtpm TPM2 Simulator tcti library
          ´libtss2-tcti-swtpm.so.0´.  This connects to a TPM2 simulator via a TCP swtpm.
          tpm2-abrmd --tcti="swtpm"
          tpm2-abrmd --tcti="libtss2-tcti-swtpm.so.0"

       Have daemon use tcti library ´libtss2-tcti-swtpm.so.0´ and config string
          ´host=127.0.0.1,port=5555´: tpm2-abrmd --tcti=swtpm:host=127.0.0.1,port=5555"
          tpm2-abrmd --tcti="libtss2-tcti-swtpm.so.0:host=127.0.0.1,port=5555"
