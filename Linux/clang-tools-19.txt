NAME
       clang-check - manual page for clang-check 19

DESCRIPTION
       USAGE: clang-check [options] <source0> [... <sourceN>]

       OPTIONS:

       Generic Options:

       --help                          - Display available options (--help-hidden for more)

       --help-list                     - Display list of available options (--help-list-hidden for more)

       --version                       - Display the version of this program

       clang-check options:

       --analyze                       - Run static analysis engine

       --analyzer-output-path=<string> - Write output to <file>

       --ast-dump                      - Build ASTs and then debug dump them

       --ast-dump-filter=<string>      - Use with -ast-dump or -ast-print to dump/print only AST declaration nodes having a certain substring in a qualified name. Use -ast-list to list all filterable de‐
              claration node names.

       --ast-list                      - Build ASTs and print the list of declaration node qualified names

       --ast-print                     - Build ASTs and then pretty-print them

       --extra-arg=<string>            - Additional argument to append to the compiler command line

       --extra-arg-before=<string>     - Additional argument to prepend to the compiler command line

       --fix-what-you-can              - Apply fix-it advice even in the presence of unfixable errors

       --fixit                         - Apply fix-it advice to the input source

       -p <string>                     - Build path

       --syntax-tree-dump              - dump the syntax tree

       --tokens-dump                   - dump the preprocessed tokens

       -p <build-path> is used to read a compile command database.

              For  example,  it  can  be a CMake build directory in which a file named compile_commands.json exists (use -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON CMake option to get this output). When no build
              path is specified, a search for compile_commands.json will be attempted through all parent paths of the first input file . See: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html for
              an example of setting up Clang Tooling on a source tree.

       <source0> ... specify the paths of source files. These paths are

              looked up in the compile command database. If the path of a file is absolute, it needs to point into CMake's source tree. If the path is relative, the current working directory needs to  be
              in  the CMake source tree and the file must be in a subdirectory of the current working directory. "./" prefixes in the relative files will be automatically removed, but the rest of a rela‐
              tive path must be a suffix of a path in the compile command database.

              For example, to run clang-check on all files in a subtree of the source tree, use:

              find path/in/subtree -name '*.cpp'|xargs clang-check

              or using a specific build path:

              find path/in/subtree -name '*.cpp'|xargs clang-check -p build/path

              Note, that path/in/subtree and current directory should follow the rules described above.
