NAME
       togeomview - send commands or OOGL objects to geomview

SYNOPSIS
       togeomview [-c] [-g]  [pipename  [program args ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       togeomview  sends a stream of geomview commands, or OOGL-format geomet‐
       ric data, to a cooperating copy of geomview.  If geomview is  not  run‐
       ning, it is automatically started.  ('geomview' must be on the $PATH of
       the user running 'togeomview' in order for this to work.)

       Typical usage is:
            someprogram | togeomview    (to send commands) or
            someprogram-generating-OOGL-data | togeomview -g  (to send geometry)
       i.e. a program pipes geometric data into ``togeomview'';  the  data  is
       displayed  by  a  copy  of  geomview  run with the -M option and a name
       matching the one given to togeomview.

       Togeomview uses a named pipe in the directory /tmp/geomview to communi‐
       cate with geomview.  If unspecified, the pipe's default name is "OOGL".
       When sending geometry (-g), a geomview object with the same name as the
       pipe appears in geomview's object browser.

       By  default,  when  no suitable copy of geomview is running, togeomview
       invokes "geomview" with  arguments  specifying  the  appropriate  named
       pipe.  A different command may be specified as in:

            togeomview  OOGL  gv -wpos 300x300 -c my_startup_script

       which  communicates  through  a pipe named OOGL, and (if necessary) in‐
       vokes the given gv command.  The pipe name is required if a command  is
       specified.

       After  togeomview  has  created it, the named pipe may be written as an
       ordinary file.  For example, one could use

            togeomview pipename < /dev/null

       to invoke a listening copy of geomview, and then run  a  program  which
       simply wrote to /tmp/geomview/pipename.

BUGS
       The pipe-based communications scheme imposes several restrictions.

       If  no  copy  of geomview is reading from the pipe, or if geomview gets
       far enough behind, a program writing data  to  ``togeomview''  will  be
       forced to block after sending a few kilobytes.

       Because  of  the buffering in the pipe, the sender may be substantially
       ahead of the geomview display.

       If geomview exits, the sending program receives a  write-on-broken-pipe
       (SIGPIPE) signal, which will kill it unless measures are taken to catch
       or ignore that signal.

       Only one copy of geomview can read from a given pipe at a time.   If  a
       second  copy  attempts  to read from it, both will probably fail.  It's
       fine to have multiple copies of geomview reading from different pipes.

       Note that togeomview will invoke geomview if no extant copy is  listen‐
       ing  to  the relevant pipe; it can't connect to an existing copy of ge‐
       omview started by other means.
