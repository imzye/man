NAME
       dleyna-server-service.conf - Configuration file for dleyna-server-service

       :Manual section:5

SYNOPSIS
          • /etc/dleyna-server-service.conf

          • $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dleyna-server-service.conf

DESCRIPTION
          The dleyna-server-service program provides the com.intel.dleyna-server name on the session message bus.  It is a service for discovering and manipulating DLNA Digital Media Renderers (or DMRs).

          Users or administrators should never need to start this daemon as it will be automatically started by dbus-daemon whenever a process sends a D-Bus message to the com.intel.dleyna-server name on
          the session bus.

          This file can be used to configure the behavior of the dleyna-server-service program

          pair must be contained in a section.
