   NAME
       mceliece - command-line interface for the libmceliece implementation of the Classic McEliece cryptosystem

   SYNOPSIS
       Key generation (for, e.g., mceliece6960119):

              mceliece6960119-keypair 5>publickey 9>secretkey

       Encapsulation (for, e.g., mceliece6960119):

              mceliece6960119-enc >ciphertext 7>sessionkey 4<publickey

       Decapsulation (for, e.g., mceliece6960119):

              mceliece6960119-dec 7>sessionkey <ciphertext 8<secretkey

   DESCRIPTION
       libmceliece is an implementation of the Classic McEliece (https://classic.mceliece.org) cryptosystem.  The command-line interface for libmceliece provides the following command-line tools:

              mceliece{6960119,6688128,8192128,460896,348864}-keypair
              mceliece{6960119,6688128,8192128,460896,348864}f-keypair
              mceliece{6960119,6688128,8192128,460896,348864}-enc
              mceliece{6960119,6688128,8192128,460896,348864}-dec

       Each tool exits 0 on success, nonzero on failure.

       These  tools  allow libmceliece to be easily used from shell scripts.  Other languages can also use libmceliece via these tools, but languages typically have good support for FFI and can use the C
       interface directly.

       The details below use mceliece6960119 as an example.

   KEY GENERATION
       Alice runs the mceliece6960119-keypair command.  This command randomly generates Alice’s secret key and Alice’s corresponding public key.  It writes the public key to file descriptor 5,  and  then
       writes the secret key to file descriptor 9.

       The mceliece6960119f-keypair command is internally more complicated than the mceliece6960119-keypair command but provides faster key generation.  The commands are interoperable.

   ENCAPSULATION
       Bob  runs  the mceliece6960119-enc command.  This command reads Alice’s public key from file descriptor 4.  It randomly generates a ciphertext and the corresponding session key.  It writes the ci‐
       phertext to stdout, and then writes the session key to file descriptor 7.

   DECAPSULATION
       Alice runs the mceliece6960119-dec command.  This command reads Alice’s secret key from file descriptor 8, and then reads a ciphertext from stdin.  It computes the corresponding session key, which
       it writes to file descriptor 7.
