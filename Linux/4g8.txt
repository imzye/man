NAME
       4g8 - Packet Capture and Interception for Switched Networks

SYNOPSIS
       4g8 -i <device> -g <gw_ip> -G <gw_mac> -s <host_ip> -S <host_mac> [-w file] [-Xh]

DESCRIPTION
       4G8  allows  you to capture traffic from a third party in a switched environment at the expense of a slight increase in latency to that third party host. Utilizing ARP cache poisoning, packet cap‐
       ture and packet reconstruction techniques, 4G8 works with nearly all TCP, ICMP and UDP IPv4 traffic flows.

   Required parameters:
       -g gw_ip
              IP address of gateway to impersonate

       -G gw_mac
              MAC address of gateway to impersonate

       -s host_ip
              IP address of victim host

       -S host_mac MAC address of victim host

OPTIONS
       -h     Display this message

       -i device
              Device to listen on

       -w file
              Write captured data to file

       -X     Dump the packet in hex and ascii
