COROSYNC-QDEVICE-TOOL(8)                                                                  System Manager's Manual                                                                  COROSYNC-QDEVICE-TOOL(8)

NAME
       corosync-qdevice-tool - corosync-qdevice control interface.

SYNOPSIS
       corosync-qdevice-tool [-Hhsv] [-p qdevice_ipc_socket_path]

DESCRIPTION
       corosync-qdevice-tool is a frontend to the internal corosync-qdevice IPC. Its main purpose is to show important information about the current internal state of corosync-qdevice.

OPTIONS
       -H     Properly shutdown the corosync-qdevice process

       -h     Display a short usage text

       -s     Display the status of the corosync-qdevice process. The output is described in its own section below.

       -v     Display more verbose output for the -s option.

       -p     Path to the corosync-qdevice communication socket.

       The  output  is  split into a generic qdevice section and a model specific section.  Most of the items are just taken from corosync.conf file. It's helpful to note that the Membership node list is
       the membership list of the current node and should match the quorum node list.  Last poll call is the timestamp (in iso format) of the last call to the votequorum_qdevice_poll function.

       For model net, it's good to check the Poll timer running state. Internally, model net supports 3 states. Not voting (when Poll timer running is No, which  means  corosync-qdevice  is  waiting  for
       corosync-qnetd to reply), voting (without cast vote, it means that the corosync-qnetd algorithm decides that the current node shouldn't get a vote) and voting (with cast vote).
