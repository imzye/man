NAME
       claws-mail-extra-plugins - extra plugins meta-package for Claws Mail

DESCRIPTION
       claws-mail-extra-plugins is a meta package for installing all extra plugins for the Claws Mail mailer.

       The manpage names corresponding to each available plugin can be found in the SEE ALSO section.

HISTORY
       The extra plugins is a collection of plugins which was initially released as a separate tarball download containing all the contributed plugins from the Claws Mail website.

       To allow faster releases, early in 2013 all the extra plugins were incorporated to the main CVS tree, next to the core plugins. Since then all of them were included in the main release tarball.
