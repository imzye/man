NAME
       cfte - Compiles fte config files

SYNOPSIS
       cfte sourcefile [destfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cfte.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because the original program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation in html for‐
       mat; see below.

       cfte compiles the .fterc binary for fte(1) from human readable sources. Example of these source files can be found at /usr/share/doc/fte/config-example.tar.gz.

EXAMPLES
       cfte /usr/share/doc/fte/config/main.fte
              compiles the example config tree to fte-new.cnf

       cfte main.fte ~/.fterc
              compiles the main.fte (in current directory) to ~/.fterc

FILES
       ~/.fterc
              Default Configuration file. Includes All keybinding and menus compiled with cfte from config files in /usr/share/doc/fte/config/main.fte.  There is a sample .fterc in /etc/fte/system.fterc.

       *.fte  Configuration sources. The syntax of these files is explained in /usr/share/doc/fte/contents.html.
