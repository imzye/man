SYNOPSIS
       aoqplot [<options>] [<observation>]

DESCRIPTION
       <observation>  can be a measurement set for opening a single observation.  To get statistics for a (remote) observation consisting of multiple measurement sets, specify a measurement set specifier in‐
       stead (generally a .ref, .vds .gvds or .gds file).

OPTIONS
       -help  Show syntax help.

       -version
              Print version info and exit.

       -save [filename prefix] [statistic name]
              Save every plot for the given kind of statistic as a PDF file. This will prevent the GUI from opening. You can repeat this parameter to save multiple kinds at once. A list of allowed names  can
              be retrieved with 'aoquality liststats'. Some common ones are: StandardDeviation, Variance, Mean, RFIPercentage, RFIRatio, Count.
