NAME
       SVN::Client - Subversion client functions

SYNOPSIS
           use SVN::Client;
           my $client = new SVN::Client();

           # setup to handle authentication the same as the command line client
           my $config_dir = undef; # use default location
           my $config = SVN:Core::config_get_config($config_dir);
           my $config_category = $cfg->{SVN::Core::CONFIG_CATEGORY_CONFIG};
           $client->auth(
             SVN::Core::cmdline_create_auth_baton(0,           #non_interactive
                                                  undef,       #username
                                                  undef,       #password
                                                  $config_dir,
                                                  0,           #no_auth_cache
                                                  0,           #trust_server_cert
                                                  $config_category,
                                                  undef)       #cancel_callback
           );

           # Use first argument as target and canonicalize it before using
           my $target;
           if (SVN::Core::path_is_url($ARGV[0])) {
             $target = SVN::Core::uri_canonicalize($ARGV[0]);
           } else {
             $target = SVN::Core::dirent_canonicalize($ARGV[0]);
           }

           # fetch the head revision of the target
           $client->cat(\*STDOUT, $target, 'HEAD');

DESCRIPTION
       SVN::Client wraps the highest level of functions provided by subversion to accomplish specific tasks in an object oriented API.  Methods are similar to the functions provided by the C API and as
       such the documentation for it may be helpful in understanding this interface.

       There are a few notable differences from the C API.  Most C function calls take a svn_client_ctx_t pointer as the next to last parameter.  The Perl method calls take a SVN::Client object as the
       first parameter.  This allows method call invocation of the methods to be possible.  For example, the following are equivalent:

         SVN::Client::add($client,$path, $recursive, $pool);
         $client->add($path, $recursive, $pool);

       Many of the C API calls also take a apr_pool_t pointer as their last argument.  The Perl bindings generally deal with this for you and you do not need to pass a pool parameter.  However, you may
       still pass a pool parameter as the last parameter to override the automatic handling of this for you.

       Users of this interface should not directly manipulate the underlying hash values but should use the respective attribute methods.  Many of these attribute methods do other things, especially when
       setting an attribute, besides simply manipulating the value in the hash.

PARAMETER NOTES
       The client methods described below take a variety of parameters.  Many of them are similar.  Methods accepting parameters named below will follow the rules below or will be noted otherwise in the
       method description.

       $client
           An SVN::Client object that you get from the constructor.

       $url
           This is a URL to a subversion repository.

       $path
           This is a path to a file or directory on the local file system.  Paths need to be canonicalized before being passed into the Subversion APIs.  Paths on the local file system are called dirents
           and can be canonicalized by calling "SVN::Core::dirent_canonicalize".

       $paths
           This argument can either be a single $path (as defined above) or a reference to an array of them.

       $target
           This  is  a path to a file or directory in a working copy or a URL to a file or directory in a subversion repository.  Both paths and URLs need to be canonicalized before being passed into the
           Subversion APIs.  Paths on the local file  system  are  called  dirents  and  can  be  canonicalized  by  calling  "SVN::Core::dirent_canonicalize".   URLs  can  be  canonicalized  by  calling
           "SVN::Core::uri_canonicalize".

       $targets
           This argument can either be a single $target (as defined above) or a reference to an array of them.

       $revision
           This specifies a revision in the Subversion repository.  You can specify a revision in several ways.  The easiest and most obvious is to directly provide the revision number.  You may also use
           the  strings (aka revision keywords) 'HEAD', 'BASE', 'COMMITTED', and 'PREV' which have the same meanings as in the command line client.  When referencing a working copy you can use the string
           'WORKING" to reference the BASE plus any local modifications.  "undef" may be used to specify an unspecified revision.  You may also pass a date by specifying  the  date  inside  curly  braces
           '{}'.   The  date  formats  accepted  are  the  same  as  the command line client accepts. Finally a "_p_svn_opt_revision_t" object is accepted (which may have been returned by some Subversion
           function).

       $recursive $nonrecursive.
           A boolean parameter that specifies if the action should follow directories.  It should only be 1 or 0.  $recursive means, 1 means to descend into directories, 0 means  not  to.   $nonrecursive
           has the inverse meaning.

       $pool
           Pool is always an option parameter.  If you wish to pass a pool parameter it should be a SVN::Pool or an apr_pool_t object.

METHODS
       The following methods are available:

       $client = SVN::Client->new( %options );
           This class method constructs a new "SVN::Client" object and returns a reference to it.

           Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the initial state of the user agent.  The following methods correspond to attribute methods described below:

               KEY                    DEFAULT
               ----------             ----------------------------------------
               auth                   auth_baton initiated with providers that
                                      read cached authentication options from
                                      the subversion config only.

               cancel                 undef

               config                 Hash containing the config from the
                                      default subversion config file location.

               log_msg                undef

               notify                 undef

               pool                   A new pool is created for the context.

       $client->add($path, $recursive, $pool);
           Similar to $client->add2(), but with $force always set to FALSE.

       $client->add2($path, $recursive, $force, $pool);
           Similar to $client->add3(), but with $no_ignore always set to FALSE.

       $client->add3($path, $recursive, $force, $no_ignore, $pool);
           Similar to $client->add4(), but with $add_parents always set to FALSE and $depth set according to $recursive; if TRUE, then depth is $SVN::Depth::infinity, if FALSE, then $SVN::Depth::empty.

       $client->add4($path, $depth, $force, $no_ignore, $add_parents, $pool);
           Schedule a working copy $path for addition to the repository.

           If  $depth  is  $SVN::Depth::empty,  add  just  $path  and  nothing below it.  If $SVN::Depth::files, add $path and any file children of $path.  If $SVN::Depth::immediates, add $path, any file
           children, and any immediate subdirectories (but nothing underneath those subdirectories).  If $SVN::Depth::infinity, add $path and everything under it fully recursively.

           $path's parent must be under revision control already (unless $add_parents is TRUE), but $path is not.

           Unless $force is TRUE and $path is already under version control, returns an $SVN::Error::ENTRY_EXISTS object.  If $force is set, do not error  on  already-versioned  items.   When  used  with
           $depth set to $SVN::Depth::infinity it will enter versioned directories; scheduling unversioned children.

           Calls the notify callback for each added item.

           If  $no_ignore  is  FALSE,  don't add any file or directory (or recurse into any directory) that is unversioned and found by recursion (as opposed to being the explicit target $path) and whose
           name matches the svn:ignore property on its parent directory or the global-ignores list in $client->config.  If $no_ignore is TRUE, do include  such  files  and  directories.   (Note  that  an
           svn:ignore property can influence this behaviour only when recursing into an already versioned directory with $force).

           If  $add_parents  is  TRUE,  recurse  up  $path's  directory  and  look  for  a  versioned  directory.   If  found,  add  all  intermediate  paths  between  it  and $path.  If not found return
           $SVN::Error::NO_VERSIONED_PARENT.

           Important: this is a scheduling operation.  No changes will happen to the repository until a commit occurs.  This scheduling can be removed with $client->revert().

           No return.

       $client->blame($target, $start, $end, \&receiver, $pool);
           Invoke \&receiver subroutine on each line-blame item associated with revision $end of $target, using $start as the default source of all blame.

           An Error will be raised if either $start or $end is undef.

           No return.

           The blame receiver subroutine receives the following arguments: $line_no, $revision, $author, $date, $line, $pool

           $line_no is the line number of the file (starting with 0).  The line was last changed in revision number $revision by $author on $date and the contents were $line.

           The blame receiver subroutine can return an svn_error_t object to return an error.  All other returns will be ignored.  You can create an svn_error_t object with SVN::Error::create().

       $client->cat(\*FILEHANDLE, $target, $revision, $pool);
           Outputs the content of the file identified by $target and $revision to the FILEHANDLE.  FILEHANDLE is a reference to a filehandle.

           If $target is not a local path and if $revision is 'PREV' (or some other kind that requires a local path), then an error will be raised, because the desired revision can not be determined.

       $client->checkout($url, $path, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Similar to $client->checkout2(), but with $peg_revision always set to undef (unspecified) and $ignore_externals always set to FALSE.

       $client->checkout2($url, $path, $peg_revision, $revision, $recursive, $ignore_externals, $pool);
           Similar to $client->checkout3(), but with $allow_unver_obstructions always set to FALSE, and $depth set according to $recurse: if $recurse is TRUE, $depth is $SVN::Depth::infinity, if $recurse
           is FALSE, set $depth to $SVN::Depth::files.

       $client->checkout3($url, $path, $preg_revision, $revision, $depth, $ignore_externals, $allow_unver_obstructions, $pool);
           Checkout a working copy of $url at $revision using $path as the root directory of the newly checked out working copy.

           The $peg_revision sets the revision at which the path in the $url is treated as representing.

           $revision must be a number, 'HEAD', or a date.  If $revision does not meet these requirements the $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION is raised.

           $depth is one of the constants in SVN::Depth and specifies the depth of the operation.  If set to $SVN::Depth::unknown, then behave as if for  $SVN::Depth::infinity,  except  in  the  case  of
           resuming a previous checkout of $path (i.e. updating) in which case use the depth of the existing working copy.

           $ignore_exteranls if set to TRUE the operation will ignore external definitions.

           $allow_unver_obstructions  if  set  to  TRUE the operation will tolerate existing unversioned items that obstruct incoming paths.  Only obstructions of the same type (file or dir) as the added
           item are tolerated.  The text of obstructing files is left as-is, effectively treating it as a user modification after the checkout.  Working properties of obstructing items are set  equal  to
           the base properties.  If set to FALSE, then abort if there are any unversioned obstructing items.

           Returns the value of the revision actually checked out of the repository.

       $client->cleanup($dir, $pool);
           Recursively cleanup a working copy directory, $dir, finishing any incomplete operations, removing lockfiles, etc.

       $client->commit($targets, $nonrecursive, $pool);
           Commit files or directories referenced by target.  Will use the log_msg callback to obtain the log message for the commit.

           If $targets contains no paths (zero elements), then does nothing and immediately returns without error.

           Calls   the   notify   callback   as   the   commit   progresses   with   any  of  the  following  actions:  $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_modified,  $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_added,
           $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_deleted, $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_replaced, $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_postfix_txdelta.

           Use $nonrecursive to indicate that subdirectories of directory targets should be ignored.

           Returns a svn_client_commit_info_t object.  If the revision member of the commit information object is $SVN::Core::INVALID_REVNUM and no error was raised, then the commit was a no-op;  nothing
           needed to be committed.

       $client->copy($src_target, $src_revision, $dst_target, $pool);
           Copies $src_target to $dst_target.

           $src_target  must  be  a  file or directory under version control, or the URL of a versioned item in the repository.  If $src_target is a URL, $src_revision is used to choose the revision from
           which to copy the $src_target.  $dst_path must be a file or directory under version control, or a repository URL, existing or not.

           If $dst_target is a URL, immediately attempt to commit the copy action to the repository.  The log_msg callback will be called to query for a commit  log  message.   If  the  commit  succeeds,
           return a svn_client_commit_info_t object.

           If  $dst_target  is  not a URL, then this is just a variant of $client->add(), where the $dst_path items are scheduled for addition as copies.  No changes will happen to the repository until a
           commit occurs.  This scheduling can be removed with $client->revert().  undef will be returned in this case.

           Calls the notify callback for each item added at the new location, passing the new, relative path of the added item.

       $client->delete($targets, $force, $pool);
           Delete items from a repository or working copy.

           If the paths in $targets are URLs, immediately attempt to commit a deletion of the URLs from the repository.  The log_msg callback will be called to query for a commit  log  message.   If  the
           commit succeeds, return a svn_client_commit_info_t object.  Every path must belong to the same repository.

           Else,  schedule  the  working copy paths in $targets for removal from the repository.  Each path's parent must be under revision control.  This is just a scheduling operation.  No changes will
           happen to the repository until a commit occurs.  This scheduling can be removed with $client->revert().  If a path is a file it is immediately removed from the working copy.  If the path is  a
           directory  it will remain in the working copy but all the files, and all unversioned items it contains will be removed.  If $force is not set then this operation will fail if any path contains
           locally modified and/or unversioned items.  If $force is set such items will be deleted.

           The notify callback is called for each item deleted with the path of the deleted item.

           Has no return.

       $client->diff($diff_options, $target1, $revision1, $target2, $revision2, $recursive, $ignore_ancestry, $no_diff_deleted, $outfile, $errfile, $pool);
           Produces diff output which describes the delta between $target1 at $revision1 and $target2 at $revision2.  They both must represent the same node type (i.e. they most both  be  directories  or
           files).  The revisions must not be undef.

           Prints the output of the diff to the filename or filehandle passed as $outfile, and any errors to the filename or filehandle passed as $errfile.

           Use $ignore_ancestry to control whether or not items being diffed will be checked for relatedness first.  Unrelated items are typically transmitted to the editor as a deletion of one thing and
           the addition of another, but if this flag is true, unrelated items will be diffed as if they were related.

           If $no_diff_deleted is true, then no diff output will be generated on deleted files.

           $diff_options  is  a  reference  to  an  array  of additional arguments to pass to diff process invoked to compare files.  You'll usually just want to use [] to pass an empty array to return a
           unified context diff (like `diff -u`).

           Has no return.

       $client->diff_summarize($target1, $revision1, $target2, $revision2, $recursive, $ignore_ancestry, \&summarize_func, $pool);
           Produce a diff summary which lists the changed items between $target1 at $revision1 and $target2 at $revision2 without creating text deltas.  $target1 and $target2 can be  either  working-copy
           paths or URLs.

           The function may report false positives if $ignore_ancestry is false, since a file might have been modified between two revisions, but still have the same contents.

           Calls \&summarize_func with with a svn_client_diff_summarize_t structure describing the difference.

           See diff() for a description of the other parameters.

           Has no return.

       $client->export($from, $to, $revision, $force, $pool);
           Export the contents of either a subversion repository or a subversion working copy into a 'clean' directory (meaning a directory with no administrative directories).

           $from is either the path to the working copy on disk, or a URL to the repository you wish to export.

           $to is the path to the directory where you wish to create the exported tree.

           $revision is the revision that should be exported, which is only used when exporting from a repository.  It may be undef otherwise.

           The notify callback will be called for the items exported.

           Returns the value of the revision actually exported or $SVN::Core::INVALID_REVNUM for local exports.

       $client->import($path, $url, $nonrecursive, $pool);
           Import file or directory $path into repository directory $url at head.

           If some components of $url do not exist then create parent directories as necessary.

           If  $path  is  a  directory,  the  contents  of  that directory are imported directly into the directory identified by $url.  Note that the directory $path itself is not imported; that is, the
           basename of $path is not part of the import.

           If $path is a file, then the dirname of $url is the directory receiving the import.  The basename of $url is the filename in the repository.  In this case if  $url  already  exists,  raise  an
           error.

           The    notify    callback    (if    defined)    will    be    called    as   the   import   progresses,   with   any   of   the   following   actions:   $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_added,
           $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::commit_postfix_txdelta.

           Use $nonrecursive to indicate that imported directories should not recurse into any subdirectories they may have.

           Uses the log_msg callback to determine the log message for the commit when one is needed.

           Returns a svn_client_commit_info_t object.

       $client->info($path_or_url, $peg_revision, $revision, \&receiver, $recurse);
           Invokes \&receiver passing it information about $path_or_url for $revision.  The information returned is system-generated metadata, not the sort of "property" metadata created by  users.   For
           methods available on the object passed to \&receiver, see svn_info_t.

           If both revision arguments are either svn_opt_revision_unspecified or NULL, then information will be pulled solely from the working copy; no network connections will be made.

           Otherwise, information will be pulled from a repository.  The actual node revision selected is determined by the $path_or_url as it exists in $peg_revision.  If $peg_revision is undef, then it
           defaults to HEAD for URLs or WORKING for WC targets.

           If $path_or_url is not a local path, then if $revision is PREV (or some other kind that requires a local path), an error will be returned, because the desired revision cannot be determined.

           Uses the authentication baton cached in ctx to authenticate against the repository.

           If $recurse is true (and $path_or_url is a directory) this will be a recursive operation, invoking $receiver on each child.

            my $receiver = sub {
                my( $path, $info, $pool ) = @_;
                print "Current revision of $path is ", $info->rev, "\n";
            };
            $client->info( 'foo/bar.c', undef, 'WORKING', $receiver, 0 );

       $client->log5($targets, $peg_revision, $revision_ranges, $limit, $discover_changed_paths, $strict_node_history, $include_merged_revisions, $revprops, \&log_entry_receiver, $pool);
           Invoke "log_entry_receiver" on each log message from each revision range in $revision_ranges in turn, inclusive (but never invoke "log_entry_receiver" on a given log message more than once).

           $targets  is  a  reference  to an array of either a URL followed by zero or more relative paths, or 1 working copy path, for which log messages are desired. If the array contains only a single
           element you may set $targets to this element instead.  "log_entry_receiver" is invoked only on messages whose revisions involved a change to some path in $targets.

           $peg_revision indicates in which revision $targets are valid.  If $peg_revision is "undef", it defaults to 'HEAD' for URLs or 'WORKING' for WC paths.

           $revision_ranges is either a single revision range or a reference to an array of them. A revision range may be specified as a reference to a two-element array "[$start, $end]" of $revisions or
           a SVN::Core::svn_opt_revision_range_t object. Examples:

             $revision_ranges = ['HEAD', 1];
             $revision_ranges = [[2, 3], [5, 8], [13, 21]];

           If $limit is non-zero only invoke "log_entry_receiver" on the first $limit logs.

           If $discover_changed_paths is true, then the changed_paths2 field in the $log_entry argument to "log_entry_receiver" will  be  populated  on  each  invocation.   Note:  The  text_modified  and
           props_modified fields of the changed_paths2 structure may have the value $SVN::Tristate::unknown if the repository does not report that information.

           If $strict_node_history is true, copy history (if any exists) will not be traversed while harvesting revision logs for each target.

           If $include_merged_revisions is true, log information for revisions which have been merged to $targets will also be returned.

           If $revprops is "undef", retrieve all revision properties.  Otherwise $revpros should be a reference to an array of property names and only these properties will be retrieved (i.e. none if the
           array is empty).

           Use $pool for any temporary allocation.

           Calls the notify subroutine with a $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::skip signal on any unversioned $targets.

           The "log_entry_receiver" takes the following arguments: "$log_entry, $pool".  $log_entry is a SVN::Core::svn_log_entry_t object.

       $client->log4($targets, $peg_revision, $start, $end, $limit, $discover_changed_paths, $strict_node_history, $include_merged_revisions, $revprops, \&log_entry_receiver, $pool);
           Similar to "$client->log5()", but takes explicit $start and $end parameters instead of $revision_ranges.

           Deprecated.

       $client->log3($targets, $peg_revision, $start, $end, $limit, $discover_changed_paths, $strict_node_history, \&log_message_receiver, $pool);
           Similar  to "$client->log4()", but using "log_message_receiver" instead of "log_entry_receiver".  Also, $include_merged_revisions is false and $revprops is [qw( svn:author svn:date and svn:log
           )].

           The "log_message_receiver" takes the following arguments: "$changed_paths, $revision, $author, $date, $message, $pool".  It is called once for each log $message from the $revision on $date  by
           $author.  $author, $date or $message may be "undef".

           If $changed_paths is defined it references a hash with the keys every path committed in $revision; the values are SVN::Core::svn_log_changed_path_t objects.

           Deprecated.

       $client->log2($targets, $start, $end, $limit, $discover_changed_paths, $strict_node_history, \&log_message_receiver, $pool);
           Similar to "$client->log3()", but with $peg_revision set to "undef".

           Deprecated.

       $client->log($targets, $start, $end, $discover_changed_paths, $strict_node_history, \&log_message_receiver, $pool);
           Similar to "$client->log2()", but with $limit set to 0.

           Special  case for repositories at revision 0: If $start is 'HEAD' and $end is 1, then handle an empty (no revisions) repository specially: instead of erroring because requested revision 1 when
           the highest revision is 0, just invoke "log_message_receiver" on revision 0, passing "undef" to $changed_paths and empty strings for the author and  date.   This  is  because  that  particular
           combination of $start and $end usually indicates the common case of log invocation; the user wants to see all log messages from youngest to oldest, where the oldest commit is revision 1.  That
           works fine, except there are no commits in the repository, hence this special case.

           Deprecated.

       $client->ls($target, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Returns a hash of svn_dirent_t objects for $target at $revision.

           If $target is a directory, returns entries for all of the directories' contents.  If $recursive is true, it will recurse subdirectories in $target.

           If $target is a file only return an entry for the file.

           If $target is non-existent, raises the $SVN::Error::FS_NOT_FOUND error.

       $client->merge($src1, $rev1, $src2, $rev2, $target_wcpath, $recursive, $ignore_ancestry, $force, $dry_run, $pool);
           Merge changes from $src1/$rev1 to $src2/$rev2 into the working-copy path $target_wcpath.

           $src1 and $src2 are either URLs that refer to entries in the repository, or paths to entries in the working copy.

           By 'merging', we mean: apply file differences and schedule additions & deletions when appropriate.

           $src1 and $src2 must both represent the same node kind; that is, if $src1 is a directory, $src2 must also be, and if $src1 is a file, $src2 must also be.

           If either $rev1 or $rev2 is undef raises the $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION error.

           If $recursive is true (and the URLs are directories), apply changes recursively; otherwise, only apply changes in the current directory.

           Use $ignore_ancestry to control whether or not items being diffed will be checked for relatedness first.  Unrelated items are typically transmitted to the editor as a deletion of one thing and
           the addition of another, but if this flag is true, unrelated items will be diffed as if they were related.

           If $force is not set and the merge involves deleting locally modified or unversioned items the operation will raise an error.  If $force is set such items will be deleted.

           Calls the notify callback once for each merged target, passing the targets local path.

           If $dry_run is true the merge is carried out, and the full notification feedback is provided, but the working copy is not modified.

           Has no return.

       $client->mkdir($targets, $pool);
           Similar to $client->mkdir2() except it returns an svn_client_commit_info_t object instead of a svn_commit_info_t object.

       $client->mkdir2($targets, $pool);
           Similar to $client->mkdir3(), but with $make_parents always FALSE, and $revprop_hash always undef.

       $client->mkdir3($targets, $make_parents, $revprop_hash, $pool);
           Similar to $client->mkdir4(), but returns a svn_commit_info_t object rather than through a callback function.

       $client->mkdir4($targets, $make_parents, $revprop_hash, \&commit_callback, $pool);
           Create a directory, either in a repository or a working copy.

           If $targets contains URLs, immediately attempts to commit the creation of the directories in $targets in the repository.  Returns a svn_client_commit_info_t object.

           Else, create the directories on disk, and attempt to schedule them for addition.  In this case returns undef.

           If $make_parents is TRUE, create any non-existent parent directories also.

           If not undef, $revprop_hash is a reference to a hash table holding additional custom revision properites (property names mapped to strings) to be set on the new revision in the event that this
           is a committing operation.  This hash cannot contain any standard Subversion properties.

           Calls the log message callback to query for a commit log message when one is needed.

           Calls  the  notify callback when the directory has been created (successfully) in the working copy, with the path of the new directory.  Note this is only called for items added to the working
           copy.

           If \&commit_callback is not undef, then for each successful commit, call \&commit_callback with the svn_commit_info_t object for the commit.

       $client->move($src_path, $src_revision, $dst_path, $force, $pool);
           Move $src_path to $dst_path.

           $src_path must be a file or directory under version control, or the URL of a versioned item in the repository.

           If $src_path is a repository URL:

           * $dst_path must also be a repository URL (existent or not).

           * $src_revision is used to choose the revision from which to copy the $src_path.

           * The log_msg callback will be called for the commit log message.

           * The move operation will be immediately committed.  If the commit succeeds, returns a svn_client_commit_info_t object.

           If $src_path is a working copy path

           * $dst_path must also be a working copy path (existent or not).

           * $src_revision is ignored and may be undef.  The log_msg callback will not be called.

           * This is a scheduling operation.  No changes will happen to the repository until a commit occurs.  This scheduling can be removed with $client->revert().  If $src_path is a file it is removed
           from the working copy immediately.  If $src_path is a directory it will remain in the working copy but all files, and unversioned items, it contains will be removed.

           * If $src_path contains locally modified and/or unversioned items and $force is not set, the copy will raise an error.  If $force is set such items will be removed.

           The notify callback will be called twice for each item moved, once to indicate the deletion of the moved node, and once to indicate the addition of the new location of the node.

       $client->propget($propname, $target, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Returns a reference to a hash containing paths or URLs, prefixed by $target (a working copy or URL), of items for which the property $propname is set, and whose values represent  the  property
           value for $propname at that path.

       $client->proplist($target, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Returns a reference to an array of svn_client_proplist_item_t objects.

           For each item the node_name member of the proplist_item object contains the name relative to the same base as $target.

           If $revision is undef, then get properties from the working copy, if $target is a working copy, or from the repository head if $target is a URL.  Else get the properties as of $revision.

           If  $recursive  is  false,  or  $target  is  a file, the returned array will only contain a single element.  Otherwise, it will contain one entry for each versioned entry below (and including)
           $target.

           If $target is not found, raises the $SVN::Error::ENTRY_NOT_FOUND error.

       $client->propset($propname, $propval, $target, $recursive, $pool);
           Set $propname to $propval on $target (a working copy or URL path).

           If $recursive is true, then $propname will be set recursively on $target and all children.  If $recursive is false, and $target is a directory, $propname will be set on only $target.

           A $propval of undef will delete the property.

           If $propname is an svn-controlled property (i.e. prefixed with svn:), then the caller is responsible for ensuring that $propval is UTF8-encoded and uses LF line-endings.

       $client->relocate($dir, $from, $to, $recursive, $pool);
           Modify a working copy directory $dir, changing any repository URLs that begin with $from to begin with $to instead, recursing into subdirectories if $recursive is true.

           Has no return.

       $client->resolved($path, $recursive, $pool);
           Removed the 'conflicted' state on a working copy path.

           This will not semantically resolve conflicts; it just allows $path to be committed in the future.  The implementation details are opaque.  If $recursive is set, recurse  below  $path,  looking
           for conflicts to resolve.

           If $path is not in a state of conflict to begin with, do nothing.

           If $path's conflict state is removed, call the notify callback with the $path.

       $client->revert($paths, $recursive, $pool);
           Restore the pristine version of a working copy $paths, effectively undoing any local mods.

           For each path in $paths, if it is a directory and $recursive is true, this will be a recursive operation.

       $client->revprop_get($propname, $url, $revision, $pool);
           Returns two values, the first of which is the value of $propname on revision $revision in the repository represented by $url.  The second value is the actual revision queried.

           Note  that  unlike  its  cousin  $client->propget(), this routine doesn't affect working copy at all; it's a pure network operation that queries an unversioned property attached to a revision.
           This can be used to query log messages, dates, authors, and the like.

       $client->revprop_list($url, $revision, $pool);
           Returns two values, the first of which is a reference to a hash containing the properties attached to $revision in the repository represented by $url.  The second value is the actual  revision
           queried.

           Note that unlike its cousin $client->proplist(), this routine doesn't read a working copy at all; it's a pure network operation that reads unversioned properties attached to a revision.

       $client->revprop_set($propname, $propval, $url, $revision, $force, $pool);
           Set $propname to $propval on revision $revision in the repository represented by $url.

           Returns the actual revision affected.  A $propval of undef will delete the property.

           If $force is true, allow newlines in the author property.

           If $propname is an svn-controlled property (i.e. prefixed with svn:), then the caller is responsible for ensuring that the value is UTF8-encoded and uses LF line-endings.

           Note  that unlike its cousin $client->propset(), this routine doesn't affect the working copy at all; it's a pure network operation that changes an unversioned property attached to a revision.
           This can be used to tweak log messages, dates, authors, and the like.  Be careful: it's a lossy operation, meaning that any existing value is replaced with  the  new  value,  with  no  way  to
           retrieve the prior value.

           Also note that unless the administrator creates a pre-revprop-change hook in the repository, this feature will fail.

       $client->status($path, $revision, \&status_func, $recursive, $get_all, $update, $no_ignore, $pool);
           Similar to $client->status2(), but with ignore_externals always set to FALSE, and with the status_func receiving a svn_wc_status2_t instead of a svn_wc_status_t object.

       $client->status2($path, $revision, \&status_func, $recursive, $get_all, $update, $no_ignore, $ignore_externals, $pool);
           Similar to $client->status3(), but with the changelists passed as undef, and with recursive instead of depth.

       $client->status3($path, $revision, \&status_func, $depth, $get_all, $update, $no_ignore, $ignore_externals, $changelists, $pool);
           Similar to $client->status4(), without the pool parameter to the callback and the return of the callback is ignored.

       $client->status4($path, $revision, \&status_func, $depth, $get_all, $update, $no_ignore, $ignore_externals, $changelists, $pool);
           Given $path to a working copy directory (or single file), call status_func() with a set of svn_wc_status2_t objects which describe the status of $path and its children.

           If $recursive is true, recurse fully, else do only immediate children.

           If $get_all is set, retrieve all entries; otherwise, retrieve only 'interesting' entries (local mods and/or out-of-date).

           If $update is set, contact the repository and augment the status objects with information about out-of-dateness (with respect to $revision).  Also, will return the value of the actual revision
           against with the working copy was compared.  (The return will be undef if $update is not set).

           Unless  ignore_externals  is  set, the function recurses into externals definitions ('svn:externals') after handling the main target, if any exist.  The function calls the notify callback with
           $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::status_external action before handling each externals definition, and with $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::status_completed after each.

           $changelists is a reference to an array of changelist names, used as a restrictive filter on items whose statuses are reported; that is don't report status about any item unless it's a  member
           of those changelists.  If changelists is empty (or altogether undef), no changelist filtering occurs.

           The status_func subroutine takes the following parameters: $path, $status, $pool

           $path is the pathname of the file or directory which status is being reported.  $status is a svn_wc_status2_t object.  $pool is an apr_pool_t object which is cleaned between invocations to the
           callback.

           The return of the status_func subroutine can be a svn_error_t object created by SVN::Error::create in order to propagate an error up.

       $client->switch($path, $url, $revision, $recursive, $pool);
           Switch working tree $path to $url at $revision.

           $revision must be a number, 'HEAD', or a date, otherwise it raises the $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION error.

           Calls the notify callback on paths affected by the switch.  Also invokes the callback for files that may be restored from the text-base because they were removed from the working copy.

           Summary  of  purpose:  This  is  normally  used  to  switch a working directory over to another line of development, such as a branch or a tag.  Switching an existing working directory is more
           efficient than checking out $url from scratch.

           Returns the value of the revision to which the working copy was actually switched.

       $client->update($path, $revision, $recursive, $pool)
           Similar to $client->update2() except that it accepts only a single target in $path, returns a single revision, and $ignore_externals is always set to FALSE.

       $client->update2($paths, $revision, $recursive, $ignore_externals, $pool)
           Similar to $client->update3() but with $allow_unver_obstructions always set to FALSE, $depth_is_sticky to FALSE, and $depth set according to $recursive: if $recursive is TRUE,  set  $depth  to
           $SVN::Depth::infinity, if $recursive is FALSE, set $depth to $SVN::Depth::files.

       $client->update3($paths, $revision, $depth, $depth_is_sticky, $ignore_externals, $allow_unver_obstructions, $pool)
           Similar to $client->update4() but with $make_parents always set to FALSE and $adds_as_modification set to TRUE.

       $client->update4($paths, $revision, $depth, $depth_is_sticky, $ignore_externals, $allow_unver_obstructions, $adds_as_modification, $make_parents)
           Update working trees $paths to $revision.

           $paths  is  a array reference of paths to be updated.  Unversioned paths that are the direct children of a versioned path will cause an update that attempts to add that path; other unversioned
           paths are skipped.

           $revision must be a revision number, 'HEAD', or a date or this method will raise the $SVN::Error::CLIENT_BAD_REVISION error.

           The paths in $paths can be from multiple working copies from multiple repositories, but even if they all come from the same repository there is no guarantee that revision represented by 'HEAD'
           will remain the same as each path is updated.

           If $ignore_externals is set, don't process externals definitions as part of this operation.

           If $depth is $SVN::Depth::infinity, update fully recursivelly.  Else if  it  is  $SVN::Depth::immediates  or  $SVN::Depth::files,  update  each  target  and  its  file  entries,  but  not  its
           subdirectories.  Else if $SVN::Depth::empty, update exactly each target, nonrecursively (essentially, update the target's properties).

           If $depth is $SVN::Depth::unknown, take the working depth from $paths and then describe as behaved above.

           If $depth_is_sticky is set and $depth is not $SVN::Depth::unknown, then in addition to update paths, also set their sticky ambient depth value to $depth.

           If  $allow_unver_obstructions  is  TRUE  then the update tolerates existing unversioned items that obstruct added paths.  Only obstructions of the same type (file or dir) as the added item are
           tolerated.  The text of obstructing files is left as-is, effectively treating it as a user modification after the update.  Working properties of obstructing items are set  equal  to  the  base
           properties.  If $allow_unver_obstructions is FALSE then the update will abort if there are any unversioned obstructing items.

           If $adds_as_modification is TRUE, a local addition at the same path as an incoming addition of the same node kind results in a normal node with a possible local modification, instead of a tree
           conflict.

           If $make_parents is TRUE, create any non-existent parent directories also by checking them out at depth=empty.

           Calls the notify callback for each item handled by the update, and also for files restored from the text-base.

           Returns an array reference to an array of revision numbers with each element set to the revision to which $revision was resolved for the corresponding element of $paths.

       $client->url_from_path($target, $pool); or SVN::Client::url_from_path($target, $pool);
           Returns the URL for $target.

           If $target is already a URL it returns $target.

           If $target is a versioned item, it returns $target's entry URL.

           If $target is unversioned (has no entry), returns undef.

       $client->uuid_from_path($path, $adm_access, $pool);
           Return the repository uuid for working-copy $path, allocated in $pool.

           Use $adm_access to retrieve the uuid from $path's entry; if not present in the entry, then call $client->uuid_from_url() to retrieve, using the entry's URL.

           Note: The only reason this function falls back on $client->uuid_from_url is for compatibility purposes.  Old working copies may not have uuids in the entries files.

           Note: This method probably doesn't work right now without a lot of pain, because SVN::Wc is incomplete and it requires an adm_access object from it.

       $client->uuid_from_url($url, $pool);
           Return repository uuid for url.

ATTRIBUTE METHODS
       The  following  attribute methods are provided that allow you to set various configuration or retrieve it.  They all take value(s) to set the attribute and return the new value of the attribute or
       no parameters which returns the current value.

       $client->auth(SVN::Client::get_username_provider());
           Provides access to the auth_baton in the svn_client_ctx_t attached to the SVN::Client object.

           This method will accept an array or array ref of values returned from the authentication provider functions see "AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS", which it will convert  to  an  auth_baton  for  you.
           This is the preferred method of setting the auth_baton.

           It will also accept a scalar that references a _p_svn_auth_baton_t such as those returned from SVN::Core::auth_open and SVN::Core::auth_open_helper.

       $client->notify(\&notify);
           Sets the notify callback for the client context to a code reference that you pass.  It always returns the current codereference set.

           The  subroutine pointed to by this reference will be called when a change is made to the working copy.  The return value of this function is ignored.  It's only purpose is to notify you of the
           change.

           The subroutine will receive 6 parameters.  The first parameter will be the path of the changed file (absolute or relative to the cwd).  The second is an integer specifying the type  of  action
           taken.   See  SVN::Wc  for  a  list  of  the  possible  actions  values  and  what  they  mean.   The 3rd is an integer specifying the kind of node the path is, which can be: $SVN::Node::none,
           $SVN::Node::file, $SVN::Node::dir, $SVN::Node::unknown.  The fourth parameter is the mime-type of the file or undef if the mime-type is unknown (it will always be undef for directories).   The
           5th  parameter  is  the  state  of the file, again see SVN::Wc for a list of the possible states.  The 6th and final parameter is the numeric revision number of the changed file.  The revision
           number will be -1 except when the action is $SVN::Wc::Notify::Action::update_completed.

       $client->log_msg(\&log_msg)
           Sets the log_msg callback for the client context to a code reference that you pass.  It always returns the current codereference set.

           The subroutine pointed to by this coderef will be called to get the log message for any operation that will commit a revision to the repo.

           It receives 4 parameters.  The first parameter is a reference to a scalar value in which the callback should place the log_msg.  If you wish to cancel the commit you can  set  this  scalar  to
           undef.   The 2nd value is a path to any temporary file which might be holding that log message, or undef if no such file exists (though, if log_msg is undef, this value is undefined).  The log
           message MUST be a UTF8 string with LF line separators.  The 3rd parameter is a reference to an array of svn_client_commit_item3_t objects, which may  be  fully  or  only  partially  filled-in,
           depending on the type of commit operation.  The 4th and last parameter will be a pool.

           If the function wishes to return an error it should return a svn_error_t object made with SVN::Error::create.  Any other return value will be interpreted as SVN_NO_ERROR.

       $client->cancel(\&cancel)
           Sets the cancellation callback for the client context to a code reference that you pass. See "CANCELLATION CALLBACK" below for details.  It always returns the current codereference set.

       $client->pool(new SVN::Pool);
           Method that sets or gets the default pool that is passed to method calls requiring a pool, but which were not explicitly passed one.

           See SVN::Core for more information about how pools are managed in this interface.

       $client->config(SVN::Core::config_get_config(undef));
           Method that allows access to the config member of the svn_client_ctx_t.  Accepts a Perl hash to set, which is what functions like SVN::Core:config_get_config() will return.

           It will return a _p_arp_hash_t scalar.  This is a temporary situation.  The return value is not particular useful.  In the future, this value will be tied to the actual hash used by the C API.

AUTHENTICATION PROVIDERS
       The  following  functions  get  authentication  providers  for  you.   They come in two forms.  Standard or File versions, which look for authentication information in the subversion configuration
       directory that was previously cached, or Prompt versions which call a subroutine to allow you to prompt the user for the information.

       The functions that return the svn_auth_provider_object_t for prompt style providers take a reference to a Perl subroutine to use for the callback.  The first parameter each  of  these  subroutines
       receive  is  a  credential  object.   The subroutines return the response by setting members of that object.  Members may be set like so: $cred->username("breser");  These functions and credential
       objects always have a may_save member which specifies if the authentication data will be cached.

       The providers are as follows:

               NAME                WHAT IT HANDLES
               ----------------    ----------------------------------------
               simple              username and password pairs

               username            username only

               ssl_server_trust    server certificates and failures
                                   authenticating them

               ssl_client_cert     client side certificate files

               ssl_client_cert_pw  password for a client side certificate file.

       SVN::Client::get_simple_provider
           Returns a simple provider that returns information from previously cached sessions.  Takes no parameters or one pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_simple_prompt_provider
           Returns a simple provider that prompts the user via a callback.  Takes two or three parameters, the first is the callback subroutine, the 2nd is the number of retries  to  allow,  the  3rd  is
           optionally  a  pool.   The  subroutine  gets  called  with  the  following  parameters:  a  svn_auth_cred_simple_t  object,  a  realm  string,  a  default  username, may_save, and a pool.  The
           svn_auth_cred_simple has the following members: username, password, and may_save.

       SVN::Client::get_username_provider
           Returns a username provider that returns information from a previously cached sessions.  Takes no parameters or one pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_username_prompt_provider
           Returns a username provider that prompts the user via a callback.  Takes two or three parameters, the first is the callback subroutine, the 2nd is the number of retries to allow,  the  3rd  is
           optionally  a  pool.   The  subroutine  gets  called  with  the  following  parameters:  a  svn_auth_cred_username_t  object,  a  realm  string,  a default username, may_save, and a pool.  The
           svn_auth_cred_username has the following members: username and may_save.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_server_trust_file_provider
           Returns a server trust provider that returns information from previously cached sessions.  Takes no parameters or optionally a pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_server_trust_prompt_provider
           Returns a server trust  provider that prompts the user via a callback. Takes one or two parameters the callback subroutine and optionally a pool parameter.  The subroutine gets called with the
           following parameters.  A svn_auth_cred_ssl_server_trust_t object, a realm string, an integer specifying how the certificate failed  authentication,  a  svn_auth_ssl_server_cert_info_t  object,
           may_save,  and  a  pool.   The  svn_auth_cred_ssl_server_trust_t object has the following members: may_save and accepted_failures.  The svn_auth_ssl_server_cert_info_t object has the following
           members (and behaves just like cred objects though you can't modify it): hostname, fingerprint, valid_from, valid_until, issuer_dname, ascii_cert.

           The masks used for determining the failures are in SVN::Auth::SSL and are named:

           $SVN::Auth::SSL::NOTYETVALID $SVN::Auth::SSL::EXPIRED $SVN::Auth::SSL::CNMISMATCH $SVN::Auth::SSL::UNKNOWNCA $SVN::Auth::SSL::OTHER

           You reply by setting the accepted_failures of the cred object with an integer of the values for what you want to accept bitwise AND'd together.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_client_cert_file_provider
           Returns a client certificate provider that returns information from previously cached sessions.  Takes no parameters or optionally a pool parameter.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_client_cert_prompt_provider
           Returns a client certificate provider that prompts the user via a callback.  Takes two or three parameters: the first is the callback subroutine, the 2nd is the number of retries to allow, the
           3rd is optionally a pool parameter.  The subroutine gets called with  the  following  parameters.   A  svn_auth_cred_ssl_client_cert  object,  a  realm  string,  may_save,  and  a  pool.   The
           svn_auth_cred_ssl_client_cert the following members: cert_file and may_save.

       SVN::Client::get_ssl_client_cert_pw_file_provider

           allow, the 3rd is optionally a pool parameter.  The subroutine gets called with the following parameters.  A svn_auth_cred_ssl_client_cert_pw object, a realm string, may_save, and a pool.  The
           svn_auth_cred_ssl_client_cert_pw has the following members: password and may_save.

CANCELLATION CALLBACK
       This callback will be called periodically to see if the operation should be canceled.  If the operation should be canceled, the function may return one of the following values:

       An svn_error_t object made with SVN::Error::create.

       Any true value, in which case the bindings will generate an svn_error_t object for you with the error code of SVN_ERR_CANCELLED and the string set to "By cancel callback".

       A string, in which case the bindings will generate an svn_error_t object for you with the error code of SVN_ERR_CANCELLED and the string set to the string you returned.

       Any other value will be interpreted as wanting to continue the operation.  Generally, it's best to return 0 to continue the operation.

OBJECTS
       These are some of the object types that are returned from the methods and functions.  Others are documented in SVN::Core and SVN::Wc.  If an object is not documented, it is more than likely opaque
       and not something you can do anything with, except pass to other functions that require such objects.

   svn_info_t
       $info->URL()
               Where the item lives in the repository.

       $info->rev()
               The revision of the object.  If path_or_url is a working-copy path, then this is its current working revnum.  If path_or_url is a URL, then this is  the  repos  revision  that  path_or_url
               lives in.

       $info->kind()
               The node's kind.

       $info->repos_root_URL()
               The root URL of the repository.

       $info->repos_UUID()
               The repository's UUID.

       $info->last_changed_rev()
               The last revision in which this object changed.

       $info->last_changed_date()
               The date of the last_changed_rev.

       $info->last_changed_author()
               The author of the last_changed_rev.

       $info->lock()
               An exclusive lock, if present.  Could be either local or remote.

       See SVN::Wc::svn_wc_entry_t for the rest of these.   svn_client.h indicates that these were copied from that struct and mean the same things.   They are also only useful when working with a WC.
