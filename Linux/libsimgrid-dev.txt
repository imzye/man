NAME
       smpiff - SMPI Fortran 77 wrapper compiler

SYNOPSIS
       smpiff …

DESCRIPTION
       smpiff  is  a  wrapper around the Fortran 77 compiler defined when building SimGrid, adding the right flags in order to use the SimGrid library and SMPI, the MPI implementation within it.  Most of
       the arguments filled to smpiff will be passed to the underlying compiler directly, except for --version which gives the SimGrid library version, and --compiler-version which gives the F77 compiler
       version. Please refer to the latter documentation in case of trouble.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       All environment variables taken into account by the underlying compiler will be used, but note that the compiler can not be modified.
