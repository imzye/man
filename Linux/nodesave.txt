NODESAVE(8)              Linux System Managers Manual              NODESAVE(8)

NAME
       nodesave - Saves NET/ROM routing information

SYNOPSIS
       nodesave [-p path] [-v] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Nodesave  saves  the  contents  of the /proc filesystem entries for the
       NET/ROM routing tables. The output of the program is in the form  of  a
       Bourne shell script that calls nrparms(8) to recreate the NET/ROM rout‐
       ing information. If no filename is given on the command line, the  pro‐
       gram writes the script to stdout.

       Typically  nodesave  would be used when taking a system off-air so that
       the NET/ROM routing may be quickly restored when the system is  brought
       back on-line.

OPTIONS
       -p path   Set  the  path  to  the nrparms binary. This only affects the
                 output of the program. Default is /usr/sbin.

       -v        Display the version.

FILES
       /proc/net/nr_neigh
       /proc/net/nr_nodes

SEE ALSO
       netrom(4), netromd(8), nrparms(8).
