       Provides a virtual printer for CUPS. This can be used for print preview or for print booklets.

DESCRIPTION
       Boomaga (BOOklet MAnager) is a virtual printer for viewing a document before printing it out using the physical printer or for print booklets.

       The  program  is very simple to work with. Running any program, click "print" and select "Boomaga" to see in several seconds (CUPS takes some time to respond) the Boomaga window open. If you print
       out one more document, it gets added to the previous one, and you can also print them out as one.

       -h, --help
              Show help about options

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit
