NAME
       cpangraph - Generate dependency chain graphs for CPAN modules

VERSION
       Version 0.12

SYNOPSIS
         cpangraph [options] <file>

           Options:
             --help            display a brief help message
             --perl=VERSION    filter those available in Perl core
             --phase=PHASE     filter those needed for a phase (e.g., build)
             --rankdir         controls the GraphViz 'rankdir' variable
             --reverse         graph reverse dependencies (dependents)
             --verbose         display additional debugging information

OPTIONS
       --help
           Prints a brief help message to the standard output and exits.

       --perl=VERSION
           This  displays  dependencies  which  have  been  available  in  Perl  core  since  the given VERSION. It does not currently know if a module has been removed from core, but this is an unlikely
           occurrence. Specify Perl versions in the form:

             5.008008 # for versions >= 5.8.8
             5.010    # for versions >= 5.10

       --phase=PHASE
           This displays dependencies which are needed for a given module's install or runtime PHASE. Available phases are:

           •   runtime: required whenever the module is used

           •   build: required to build the module

           •   configure: these are required while preparing the module for build

       --rankdir
           In GraphViz, the 'rankdir' attribute controls the direction that the nodes are linked together. If set, the graph will use left -> right linking  of  nodes  rather  than  the  default  up-down
           linking.

       --reverse
           Create a graph of the reverse dependencies of a package (the packages which depend on it, or dependent packages).

       --verbose
           Display extra output useful during debugging.

DESCRIPTION
       This script will use the CPAN Database to build a graph of a package's dependencies or reverse dependencies (dependent packages).
