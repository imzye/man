SYNOPSIS
       sndfile-generate-chirp [options] <sample rate> <length in seconds> <sound file>

DESCRIPTION
       sndfile-generate-chirp  generates  a  sound  file  containing  a  sine  wave  that sweeps from a low starting frequency to a higher ending frequency (ie a chirp).  The file is written using libsndfile
       (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/).

       The parameters allows the start and end sine wave frequencies to be set as well as specifying the shape of the sweep (ie linear, quadratic or logarithmic).   Run  "sndfile-generate-chirp  --help"  for
       more information.

       The format of the output file is determined by the filename extension of the output file.
