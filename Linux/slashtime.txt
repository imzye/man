NAME
       Shashtime - Display the time in various places.

SYNOPSIS
       slashtime [--hidden]

DESCRIPTION
       A  small program which displays the time in various places. It has a compact display of locations along with supporting information such as the date and the abbreviated code used to name that
       timezone.

       Time data displayed will be as accurate as the system's zoneinfo data is used.  Somewhat unusually, Slashtime shows the offset from the current location, not from UTC. When  running  you  can
       change  the center point by double-clicking on another city.  There is a meeting planner built into Slashtime. You can specify a date and time and see what the corresponding time in other lo‐
       cations will be.

OPTIONS
       Only one option is available:

       --hidden
              Do not maximize the window at startup.

BUGS
       No bugs.
