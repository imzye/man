NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReadmeFromPod - dzil plugin to generate README from POD

SYNOPSIS
           # dist.ini
           [ReadmeFromPod]

           # or
           [ReadmeFromPod]
           filename = lib/XXX.pod
           type = markdown
           readme = READTHIS.md

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin generates the README from "main_module" (or specified) by Pod::Readme.

   Options
       The following options are supported:

       "filename"

       The name of the file to extract the README from. This defaults to the main module of the distribution.

       "type"

       The type of README you want to generate. This defaults to "text".

       Other options are "html", "pod", "markdown" and "rtf".

       "pod_class"

       This is the Pod::Simple class used to translate a file to the format you want. The default is based on the "type" setting, but if you want to generate an alternative type, you can set this option
       instead.

       "readme"

       The name of the file, which defaults to one based on the "type".

   Conflicts with Other Plugins
       We will remove the README created by Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Readme automatically.
