NAME
       libgpsmm, libQgpsm - C++ and QT class wrappers for the GPS daemon

SYNOPSIS
       C++:

           #include <libgpsmm>

           struct gps_data_t * open(char * host char * port)

           struct gps_data_t * open(void)

           struct gps_data_t * send(char * request)

           struct gps_data_t * read(void)

           struct gps_data_t * waiting(int)

           struct gps_data_t * stream unsigned(int flags)

DESCRIPTION
       libgpsmm and libQgpsmm are mere wrappers over libgps. The important difference between the libraries is that libgpsmm is targeted at C++ applications and contained in libgps, while libQgpsmm is
       platform independent by using QTcpSocket to connect to gpsd and shipped as an additional library due to the necessary linking to QT. Method names are the same as the analogue C functions. For a
       detailed description of the functions please read libgps(3). open() must be called after class constructor and before any other method (open()` is not inside the constructor since it may fail,
       however constructors have no return value). The analogue of the C function gps_close() is in the destructor.
