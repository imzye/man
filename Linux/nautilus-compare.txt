NAME
       nautilus-compare-preferences - Preferences dialog for Nautilus Compare extension

SYNOPSIS
       nautilus-compare-preferences

DESCRIPTION
       A graphical preferences dialog for the Nautilus Compare simplifies choosing diff applications started via the context menu of the Nautilus file manager.

       Using  the  preferences  dialog you can select and switch between comparison tools to perform diffs, three-way diffs and multi-diffs. Known diff tools are detected from common install locations at
       /usr/[local/]bin and the preferences dialog is pre-filled with potential names for comparators.

       To apply the changes, a restart of the Nautilus file manager is required.  Run the command "nautilus -q" to quit Nautilus and restart it to reflect the updated settings.

       The extension and the preferences dialog were written in Python and GTK+.
