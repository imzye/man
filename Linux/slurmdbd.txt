NAME
       slurmdbd.conf - Slurm Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       slurmdbd.conf is an ASCII file which describes Slurm Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration information.  The file will always be located in the same directory as the slurm.conf.

       The  contents  of  the  file  are case insensitive except for the names of nodes and files. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated as a comment through the end of that line.
       Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of SlurmDBD or daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal unless otherwise noted.

       This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and should only be readable by the user which executes SlurmDBD (e.g. "slurm").  If the slurmdbd daemon is started as user root and
       changes to another user ID, the configuration file will initially be read as user root, but will be read as the other user ID in response to a SIGHUP signal.  This file should  be  protected  from
       unauthorized access since it contains a database password.  The overall configuration parameters available include:

       AllowNoDefAcct
              Remove requirement for users to have a default account. Boolean, yes to turn on, no (default) to enforce default accounts.

       AllResourcesAbsolute
              When  adding  a  resource (license) treat allocated/allowed counts as absolute numbers instead of percentage numbers. Boolean, yes to turn on, no (default) to use the numbers as percentages
              instead.

       ArchiveDir
              If ArchiveScript is not set the slurmdbd will generate a file that can be read in anytime with sacctmgr load filename. This directory is where the file will be placed after  a  purge  event
              has happened and archive for that element is set to true. Default is /tmp. The format for this files name is $ArchiveDir/$ClusterName_$ArchiveObject_archive_$BeginTimeStamp_$endTimeStamp We
              limit  archive  files  to 50000 records per file. If more than 50000 records exist during that time period, they will be written to a new file. Subsequent archive files during the same time
              period will have ".<number>" appended to the file, for example .2, with the number increasing by one for each file in the same time period.

       ArchiveEvents
              When purging events also archive them. Boolean, yes to archive event data, no otherwise. Default is no.

       ArchiveJobs
              When purging jobs also archive them. Boolean, yes to archive job data, no otherwise. Default is no.

       ArchiveResvs
              When purging reservations also archive them. Boolean, yes to archive reservation data, no otherwise. Default is no.

       ArchiveScript
              This script can be executed every time a rollup happens (every hour, day and month), depending on the Purge*After options. This script is used to transfer  accounting  records  out  of  the
              database into an archive. It is used in place of the internal process used to archive objects.  The script is executed with no arguments, and the following environment variables are set.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_EVENTS
                     1 for archive events 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_LAST_EVENT
                     Time of last event start to archive.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_JOBS
                     1 for archive jobs 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_LAST_JOB
                     Time of last job submit to archive.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_STEPS
                     1 for archive steps 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_LAST_STEP
                     Time of last step start to archive.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_SUSPEND
                     1 for archive suspend data 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_TXN
                     1 for archive transaction data 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_USAGE
                     1 for archive usage data 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_LAST_SUSPEND
                     Time of last suspend start to archive.

       ArchiveSteps
              When purging steps also archive them. Boolean, yes to archive step data, no otherwise. Default is no.

       ArchiveSuspend
              When purging suspend data also archive it. Boolean, yes to archive suspend data, no otherwise. Default is no.

       ArchiveTXN
              When purging transaction data also archive it. Boolean, yes to archive transaction data, no otherwise. Default is no.

       ArchiveUsage
              When purging usage data (Cluster, Association and WCKey) also archive it.  Boolean, yes to archive transaction data, no otherwise. Default is no.

       AuthAltTypes
              Comma-separated list of alternative authentication plugins that the slurmdbd will permit for communication. Acceptable values at present include auth/jwt.

              NOTE:  The  path to the required jwt_hs256.key must be specified with AuthAltParameters. The jwt_hs256.key should only be visible to the SlurmUser and root. It is not suggested to place the
              jwt_hs256.key on any nodes other than the machine running slurmctld and the machine running slurmdbd.  auth/jwt can be activated by the presence of the SLURM_JWT environment variable.  When
              activated, it will override the default

       AuthAltParameters
              Used to define alternative authentication plugins options. Multiple options may be comma separated.

              jwks=  Absolute  path  to  JWKS  file. Key should be owned by SlurmUser or root, must be readable by SlurmUser, with suggested permissions of 0400. It must not be writable by 'other'.  Only
                     RS256 keys are supported, although other key types may be listed in the file. If set, no HS256 key will be loaded by default (and token generation is disabled), although the  jwt_key
                     setting may be used to explicitly re-enable HS256 key use (and token generation).

              jwt_key=
                     Absolute path to JWT key file. Key must be HS256. Key should be owned by SlurmUser or root, must be readable by SlurmUser, with suggested permissions of 0400. It must not be accessi‐
                     ble by 'other'.

       AuthInfo
              Additional  information to be used for authentication of communications with the Slurm control daemon (slurmctld) on each cluster.  The interpretation of this option is specific to the con‐
              figured AuthType.  Multiple options may be specified in a comma-delimited list.  If not specified, the default authentication information will be used.

              socket        Path name to a MUNGE daemon socket to use (e.g. "socket=/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2").  The  default  value  is  "/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2".   Used  by  auth/munge  and
                            cred/munge.

              ttl           Credential lifetime, in seconds (e.g. "ttl=300").  The default value is dependent upon the MUNGE installation, but is typically 300 seconds.

              use_client_ids
                            Allow the auth/slurm plugin to authenticate users without relying on the user information from LDAP or the operating system.

       AuthType
              Define  the authentication method for communications between Slurm components. SlurmDBD must be terminated prior to changing the value of AuthType and later restarted. This should match the
              AuthType used in slurm.conf.  Acceptable values at present:

              auth/munge
                     Indicates that MUNGE is to be used (default).  (See "https://dun.github.io/munge/" for more information).

              auth/slurm
                     Use Slurm's internal authentication plugin.

       CommitDelay
              How many seconds between commits on a connection from a Slurmctld. This speeds up inserts into the database dramatically. If you are running a very high throughput of jobs you  should  con‐
              sider setting this. In testing, 1 second improves the slurmdbd performance dramatically and reduces overhead. There is a small probability of data loss though since this creates a window in
              which if the slurmdbd exits abnormally for any reason the data not committed could be lost. While this situation should be very rare, it does present an extremely small risk, but may be the
              only way to run in extremely heavy environments. In all honesty, the risk is quite low, but still present.

       CommunicationParameters
              Comma separated options identifying communication options.

              DisableIPv4    Disable IPv4 only operation for the slurmdbd. This should also be set in your slurm.conf file.

              EnableIPv6     Enable  using  IPv6 addresses for the slurmdbd. When using both IPv4 and IPv6, address family preferences will be based on your /etc/gai.conf file. This should also be set in
                             your slurm.conf file.

              keepaliveinterval=Specifies the interval, in seconds, between keepalive probes on idle
                             connections.  This affects most outgoing connections from the slurmdbd (e.g. between the primary and backup, or from the slurmdbd to the slurmctld).  The default value is  30
                             seconds.

              keepaliveprobes=Specifies the number of unacknowledged keepalive probes sent before considering
                             a  connection  broken.   This  affects  most outgoing connections from the slurmdbd (e.g. between the primary and backup, or from the slurmdbd to the slurmctld).  The default
                             value is 3.

              keepalivetime=Specifies how long, in seconds, a connection must be idle before starting to
                             send keepalive probes as well as how long to delay closing a connection to process messages still in the queue.  This affects most  outgoing  connections  from  the  slurmdbd
                             (e.g. between the primary and backup, or from the slurmdbd to the slurmctld).  The default value is 30 seconds.

       DbdAddr
              Name that DbdHost should be referred to in establishing a communications path. This name will be used as an argument to the getaddrinfo() function for identification. For example, "elx0000"
              might be used to designate the Ethernet address for node "lx0000". By default the DbdAddr will be identical in value to DbdHost.

       DbdBackupHost
              The short, or long, name of the machine where the backup Slurm Database Daemon is executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname -s").  This host must have access to the same un‐
              derlying database specified by the 'Storage' options mentioned below.

       DbdHost
              The short, or long, name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname -s").  This value must be specified.

       DbdPort
              The  port  number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) listens to for work. The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system build time. If no value is explicitly specified,
              it will be set to 6819.  This value must be equal to the AccountingStoragePort parameter in the slurm.conf file.

       DebugFlags
              Defines specific subsystems which should provide more detailed event logging.  Multiple subsystems can be specified with comma separators.  Most DebugFlags will result in additional logging
              messages for the identified subsystems if DebugLevel is at 'verbose' or higher.  More logging may impact performance.  Valid subsystems available today (with more to come) include:

              AuditRPCs
                     For all inbound RPCs to slurmdbd, print the originating address, authenticated user, and RPC type before the connection is processed.

              TLS    TLS plugin

       DebugLevel
              The level of detail to provide the Slurm Database Daemon's logs.  The default value is info.

              quiet     Log nothing

              fatal     Log only fatal errors

              error     Log only errors

              info      Log errors and general informational messages

              verbose   Log errors and verbose informational messages

              debug     Log errors and verbose informational messages and debugging messages

              debug2    Log errors and verbose informational messages and more debugging messages

              debug3    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              debug5    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

       DebugLevelSyslog
              The slurmdbd daemon will log events to the syslog file at the specified level of detail. If not set, the slurmdbd daemon will log to syslog at level fatal, unless there is no LogFile and it
              is running in the background, in which case it will log to syslog at the level specified by DebugLevel (at fatal in the case that DebugLevel is set to quiet) or it is run in the foreground,
              when it will be set to quiet.

              quiet     Log nothing

              fatal     Log only fatal errors

              error     Log only errors

              debug4    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              debug5    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              NOTE: By default, Slurm's systemd service files start daemons in the foreground with the -D option. This means that systemd will capture stdout/stderr output and print that to syslog, inde‐
              pendent of Slurm printing to syslog directly. To prevent systemd from doing this, add "StandardOutput=null" and "StandardError=null" to the respective service files or override files.

       DefaultQOS
              When adding a new cluster this will be used as the qos for the cluster unless something is explicitly set by the admin with the create.

       DisableCoordDBD
              Disable the coordinator status in all slurmdbd interactions.

              When this is set, a coordinator may not do the following in slurmdbd as they relate to the account(s) they coordinate:

              Add accounts
              Add/Modify/Remove associations
              Add/Remove coordinators
              Add/Modify/Remove users

              Boolean, yes to turn on, no (default) to recognize coordinator status in all slurmdbd interactions.

       HashPlugin
              Identifies the type of hash plugin to use for network communication.  Acceptable values include:

              hash/k12       Hashes are generated by the KangorooTwelve cryptographic hash function.  This is the default.

              hash/sha3      Hashes are generated by the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function.

              NOTE: Make sure that HashPlugin has the same value both in slurm.conf and in slurmdbd.conf.

       LogFile
              Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon's logs are written.  The default value is none (performs logging via syslog).
              See the section LOGGING in the slurm.conf man page if a pathname is specified.

       LogTimeFormat
              Format of the timestamp in slurmdbd log files. Accepted format values include "iso8601", "iso8601_ms", "rfc5424", "rfc5424_ms", "rfc3339", "clock", "short" and "thread_id". The values  end‐
              ing  in  "_ms"  differ from the ones without in that fractional seconds with millisecond precision are printed.  The default value is "iso8601_ms". The "rfc5424" formats are the same as the
              "iso8601" formats except that the timezone value is also shown.  The "clock" format shows a timestamp in microseconds retrieved with the C standard clock() function. The "short" format is a
              short date and time format. The "thread_id" format shows the timestamp in the C standard ctime() function form without the year but including the microseconds, the daemon's process  ID  and
              the  current  thread name and ID.  A special option "format_stderr" can be added to the format as a comma separated value (e.g. "LogTimeFormat=iso8601_ms,format_stderr"). It will change the
              default format of the logs on stderr stream by prepending the timestamp as specified by LogTimeFormat.

       MaxQueryTimeRange
              Return an error if a query is against too large of a time span, to prevent ill-formed queries from causing performance problems within SlurmDBD.  Default value is INFINITE which allows  any
              queries to proceed.  Accepted time formats are the same as the MaxTime option in slurm.conf.  Operator and higher privileged users are exempt from this restriction.  Note that queries which
              attempt to return over 3GB of data will still fail to complete with ESLURM_RESULT_TOO_LARGE.

       MessageTimeout
              Time permitted for a round-trip communication to complete in seconds. Default value is 10 seconds.

       Parameters
              Contains arbitrary comma separated parameters used to alter the behavior of the slurmdbd.

              PreserveCaseUser
                     When defining users do not force lower case which is the default behavior.

       PidFile
              Fully  qualified  pathname  of  a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon may write its process ID. This may be used for automated signal processing.  The default value is "/var/run/slur‐
              mdbd.pid".

       PluginDir
              Identifies the places in which to look for Slurm plugins.  This is a colon-separated list of directories, like the PATH environment variable.  The default value is the prefix given at  con‐
              figure time + "/lib/slurm".

       PrivateData
              This  controls what type of information is hidden from regular users.  By default, all information is visible to all users.  User SlurmUser, root, and users with AdminLevel=Admin can always
              view all information.  Multiple values may be specified with a comma separator.  Acceptable values include:

              accounts
                     prevents users from viewing any account definitions unless they are coordinators of them.

              events prevents users from viewing event information unless they have operator status or above.

              jobs   prevents users from viewing job records belonging to other users unless they are coordinators of the account running the job when using sacct.

              reservations
                     restricts getting reservation information to users with operator status and above.

              usage  prevents users from viewing usage of any other user.  This applies to sreport.

              users  prevents users from viewing information of any user other than themselves, this also makes it so users can only see associations they deal with.  Coordinators can see associations of
                     all users in the account they are coordinator of, but can only see themselves when listing users.

       PurgeEventAfter
              Events are purged from the database after this amount of time has passed since they ended.  This includes node down times and such.  The time is a numeric value and is a number  of  months.
              If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge everything older than 12
              hours).   The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If not set (de‐
              fault), then event records are never purged.

       PurgeJobAfter
              Individual job records are purged from the database after this amount of time has passed since they ended.  Aggregated information will be preserved to "PurgeUsageAfter".  The time is a nu‐
              meric value and is a number of months. If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get  those  more  frequent  purges  (i.e.  a  value  of
              "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at
              the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then job records are never purged.

       PurgeResvAfter
              Individual  reservation records are purged from the database after this amount of time has passed since they ended.  Aggregated information will be preserved to "PurgeUsageAfter".  The time
              is a numeric value and is a number of months. If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges (i.e. a value  of
              "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at
              the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then reservation records are never purged.

       PurgeStepAfter
              Individual  job step records are purged from the database after this amount of time has passed since they ended.  Aggregated information will be preserved to "PurgeUsageAfter".  The time is
              a numeric value and is a number of months. If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges  (i.e.  a  value  of
              "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at
              the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then job step records are never purged.

       PurgeSuspendAfter
              Individual  job suspend records are purged from the database after this amount of time has passed since they ended.  Aggregated information will be preserved to "PurgeUsageAfter".  The time
              is a numeric value and is a number of months. If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges (i.e. a value  of
              "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at
              the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then suspend records are never purged.

       PurgeTXNAfter
              Individual  transaction records are purged from the database after this amount of time has passed since they occurred.  The time is a numeric value and is a number of months. If you want to
              purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge everything older than 12  hours).   The
              purge  takes  place  at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then
              transaction records are never purged.

       PurgeUsageAfter
              Usage records (Cluster, Association and WCKey) are purged from the database after this amount of time has passed since they were created or last modified.  The time is a numeric  value  and
              is  a  number of months. If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge
              everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each
              month.  If not set (default), then usage records are never purged.

       SlurmUser
              The name of the user that the slurmdbd daemon executes as.  This user should match the SlurmUser used for all instances of slurmctld that report to slurmdbd. It must exist  on  the  machine
              executing  the  Slurm  Database Daemon and have the same UID as the hosts on which slurmctld executes.  For security purposes, a user other than "root" is recommended.  The default value is
              "root".

              NOTE: If the SlurmUser for slurmctld is root you can still use a non-root SlurmUser for slurmdbd (in any other case, both SlurmUsers should match) by explicitly setting  the  user's  Admin‐
              Level to Admin. After adding a user in this way, you must restart slurmctld.

       StorageBackupHost
              Define  the name of the backup host the database is running where we are going to store the data. This can be viewed as a backup solution when the StorageHost is not responding. It is up to
              the backup solution to enforce the coherency of the accounting information between the two hosts. With clustered database solutions (active/passive HA), you would not need to use this  fea‐
              ture.  Default is none.

       StorageHost
              Define  the name of the host the database is running where we are going to store the data.  This can be the host on which slurmdbd executes, but for larger systems, we recommend keeping the
              database on a separate machine.

       StorageLoc
              Specify the name of the database as the location where accounting records are written. Defaults to "slurm_acct_db".

       StorageParameters
              Comma separated list of key-value pair parameters. Currently supported values include options to establish a secure connection to the database:

              SSL_CERT
                The path name of the client public key certificate file.

              SSL_CA
                The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file.

              SSL_CAPATH
                The path name of the directory that contains trusted SSL CA certificate files.

              SSL_KEY
                The path name of the client private key file.

              SSL_CIPHER
                The list of permissible ciphers for SSL encryption.

       StoragePass
              Define the password used to gain access to the database to store the job accounting data. The '#' character is not permitted in a password.

       StoragePort
              The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) communicates with the database. Default is 3306.

       StorageType
              Define the accounting storage mechanism type.  Acceptable values at present include "accounting_storage/mysql".  The  value  "accounting_storage/mysql"  indicates  that  accounting  records
              should be written to a MySQL or MariaDB database specified by the StorageLoc parameter.  This value must be specified.

       StorageUser
              Define the name of the user we are going to connect to the database with to store the job accounting data.

       TCPTimeout
              Time permitted for TCP connection to be established. Default value is 2 seconds.

       TrackSlurmctldDown
              Boolean yes or no. If set the slurmdbd will mark all idle resources on the cluster as down when a slurmctld disconnects or is no longer reachable. The default is no.

       TrackWCKey
              Boolean  yes  or  no.  Used to set display and track of the Workload Characterization Key. Must be set to track wckey usage. This must be set to generate rolled up usage tables from WCKeys.
              NOTE: If TrackWCKey is set here and not in your various slurm.conf files all jobs will be attributed to their default WCKey.
