NAME
       htsearch - create document index and word database for the ht://Dig search engine

SYNOPSIS
       htsearch [options] [query_string]

DESCRIPTION
       Htsearch is used to search in de databases created by htdig for content.  is the actual search engine of the htdig search system. It is a CGI program that is expected to be invoked by an HTML form. It
       will accept both the GET and POST methods of passing data to the CGI program.

OPTIONS
       query_string
              A CGI-style query string can be given as a single argument, and is only used if the REQUEST_METHOD environment variable is not set.  If no query_string is given, and REQUEST_METHOD is not  set,
              htsearch will prompt for the query.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default (for security reasons this option is only available when htsearch is used on the commandline).

       -v -d  Run  in  verbose  mode.  This increases the verbosity of the program.  Using more than 2 is probably only useful for debugging purposes.  The default verbose mode gives a progress on what it is
              doing and where it is.
