NAME
       asn2all - generate reports from ASN.1 biological data

SYNOPSIS
       asn2all  [-]  [-A acc] [-F filename] [-G] [-J n] [-K n] [-M] [-T] [-X] [-a type] [-b] [-c] [-d path] [-f format] [-h] [-i filename] [-k] [-l] [-n policy] [-o filename] [-p path] [-r] [-s db] [-v file‐
       name] [-x ext]

DESCRIPTION
       asn2all is primarily intended for generating reports from the binary ASN.1 Bioseq-set release files downloaded from the NCBI ftp site (ncbi-asn1 directory).  It can produce GenBank and  GenPept  flat‐
       files, FASTA sequence files, INSDSet structured XML, TinySeq XML, and Sequin-style 5-column feature tables.

       The  release files (which have the extension .aso.gz) should be uncompressed with gunzip(1), resulting in files with the extension .aso.  For example, gbpri1.aso is the first file in the primate divi‐
       sion, and the command

              gunzip gbpri1.aso.gz

       will result in gbpri1.aso being created.  The original gbpri1.aso.gz file is removed after successful decompression.

       In asn2all, the name of the file to be processed is specified by the -i command line argument.  Use -a t to indicate that it is a release file and -b to indicate that it is binary ASN.1.  A text ASN.1
       file obtained from Entrez can be processed by using -a a instead of -a t -b.

       Nucleotide and protein records can be processed simultaneously.  Use the -o argument to indicate the nucleotide output file, and the -v argument for the protein output file.

       The -f argument determines the format to be generated, and is documented in more detail (along with other options) in the following section.
