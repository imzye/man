NAME
       gpm-microtouch-setup - Calibration program for Microtouch screens

SYNOPSIS
       gpm-microtouch-setup

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gpm-microtouch-setup command.

       This program calibrates Microtouch screens for use with gpm(8).

       The  gpm(8) daemon must already be running in order to run the program to work flawlessly, as the program stops and restarts gpm(8) internally (it depends on gpm(8) for correct serial port initializa‐
       tion). microtouch-setup uses /dev/mouse to access the serial port, so /dev/mouse should point to a "ttyS" device.
