NAME
       exiqsumm - Summarising the queue

SYNOPSIS
       exiqsumm [-a] [-c]

DESCRIPTION
       The exiqsumm utility is a Perl script which reads the output of exim -bp and produces a summary of the messages on the queue.  Thus, you use it by running a command such as

         exim -bp | exiqsumm

       The output consists of one line for each domain that has messages waiting for it, as in the following example:

           3   2322   74m   66m  msn.com.example

       This  lists  the number of messages for the domain, their total volume, and the length of time that the oldest and the newest messages have been waiting.  By default the output is sorted on the domain
       name, but exiqsumm has the options -a and -c, which cause the output to be sorted by oldest message and by count of messages, respectively.

       The output of exim -bp contains the original addresses in the message, so this also applies to the output from exiqsumm.  No domains from addresses generated by aliasing  or  forwarding  are  included
       (unless the “one_time” option of the redirect router has been used to convert them into ‘top level’ addresses).

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
