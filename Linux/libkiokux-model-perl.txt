NAME
       KiokuX::Model - A simple application specific wrapper for KiokuDB.

SYNOPSIS
               # start with the base class:

               KiokuX::Model->new( dsn => "bdb:dir=/var/myapp/db" );

               # later you can add convenience methods by subclassing:

               package MyApp::DB;
               use Moose;

               extends qw(KiokuX::Model);

               sub add_user {
                       my ( $self, @args ) = @_;

                       my $user = MyApp::User->new(@args);

                       $self->txn_do(sub {
                               $self->insert($user);
                       });

                       return $user;
               }

               # Then just use it like this:

               MyApp::DB->new( dsn => "bdb:dir=/var/myapp/db" );

               # or automatically using e.g. L<Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB>:

               $c->model("kiokudb");

DESCRIPTION
       This base class makes it easy to create KiokuDB database instances in your application. It provides a standard way to instantiate and use a KiokuDB object in your apps.

       As your app grows you can subclass it and provide additional convenience methods, without changing the structure of the code, but simply swapping your subclass for KiokuX::Model in e.g.
       Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB or whatever you use to glue it in.

ATTRIBUTES
       directory
           The instantiated directory.

           Created using the other attributes at "BUILD" time.

           This attribute has delegations set up for all the methods of the KiokuDB class.

       dsn e.g. "bdb:dir=root/db". See "connect" in KiokuDB.

       extra_args
           Additional arguments to pass to "connect".

           Can be a hash reference or an array reference.

       typemap
           An optional custom typemap to add. See KiokuDB::Typemap and "typemap" in KiokuDB.
