NAME
       smpeg-config - script to get information about the installed version of SMPEG

SYNOPSIS
       smpeg-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       smpeg-config is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use SMPEG library.

OPTIONS
       --version
               Print the currently installed version of SMPEG on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a SMPEG-using program.

       --library-libs
               Print  the  linker  flags  that  are necessary to link a library that uses SMPEG. (This excludes any static objects required for linking, since these must be linked only by executable pro‐
               grams.)

       --plugin-libs
               Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an SMPEG-using object that is to be accessed via dlopen(3).  This may include static objects with PIC  symbol  information.   This  option
               should not be used for ordinary shared libraries or standalone applications.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a SMPEG-using library or program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified,  use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that SMPEG was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec
               prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs, --library-libs, --plugin-libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that SMPEG was built with when computing the output for the --cflags, --libs,  --library-libs  and  --plugin-libs  options.
               This option must be specified before any --libs, --library-libs, --plugin-libs or --cflags options.
