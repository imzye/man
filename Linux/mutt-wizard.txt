NAME
       openfile - open a file with xdg-open in a external program

SYNOPSIS
       openfile file

DESCRIPTION
       openfile helps open a file with xdg-open from mutt/neomutt in a external program without weird side effects.

       It aims to be as simple and functional as possible for the user to associate a file extension with the program that will open it.

       It is not necessary to configure a specific program for each extension in mutt/neomutt, because this association will come from your environment settings, controlled by xdg-open.

       This  program ends up not being exclusive to mutt/neomutt, it can be used by command line in a terminal by the user to open any file in its respective default program, just by using the command as
       described in the Synopsis field.
