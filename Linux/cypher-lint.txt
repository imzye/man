NAME
       cypher-lint - a linting tool for Cypher

SYNOPSIS
       cypher-lint [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       cypher-lint  is  a  linting tool for Cypher. It reads from input files, reports any errors found, and optionally outputs the parsed AST. If file is a single dash (`-') or absent, cypher-lint reads
       from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -1     Only parse the first statement or client command and then exit.

       -a, --ast
              Output an AST representation for the parsed input.

       --colorize
              Enable colorization of output and errors using ANSI escape sequences.

       --no-colorize
              Disable colorization of output and errors even when connected to a TTY.

       -h, --help
              Display a brief help listing.

       --only-statements
              Only parse cypher statements and not client commands.

       --output-width <n>
              Attempt to limit output to the specified width, and render using wrapped columns.

       --stream
              Output each statement as it is read, rather than parsing the entire input first (note: will result in inconsistent formatting of AST dumps).

       --version
              Print the cypher-lint version and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       cypher-lint exits 0 if no errors are found, and >0 otherwise.
