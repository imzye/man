BOOTLOGD(8)                                                                         Linux System Administrator's Manual                                                                         BOOTLOGD(8)

NÉV
       bootlogd - record boot messages

ÖSSZEGZÉS
       /sbin/bootlogd [-c] [-d] [-e] [-r] [-s] [-v] [ -l logfile ] [ -p pidfile ]

LEÍRÁS
       bootlogd runs in the background and copies all strings sent to the /dev/console device to a logfile. If the logfile is not accessible, the messages will be kept in memory until it is.

KAPCSOLÓK
       -d     Do not fork and run in the background.

       -e     Print  escape  characters  to  the  boot  log file. This turns off filtering of escape characters and allows tools like GNU less(1) to see and use colour control characters (show the log in
              colour).

       -c     Attempt to write to the logfile even if it does not yet exist.  Without this option, bootlogd will wait for the logfile to appear before attempting to write to it.  This  behavior  prevents
              bootlogd from creating logfiles under mount points.

       -r     If there is an existing logfile called logfile rename it to logfile~ unless logfile~ already exists.

       -s     Ensure that the data is written to the file after each line by calling fdatasync(3).  This will slow down a fsck(8)  process running in parallel.

       -v     Show version.

       -l logfile
              Log to this logfile. The default is /var/log/boot.

       -p pidfile
              Put process-id in this file. The default is no pidfile.

MEGJEGYZÉS
       bootlogd  saves  log  data  which  includes  control characters. The log is technically a text file, but not very easy for humans to read. To address this the readbootlog(1) command can be used to
       display the boot log without the control characters.

BUGS
       bootlogd works by redirecting the console output from the console device.  (Consequently bootlogd requires PTY support in the kernel configuration.)  It copies that  output  to  the  real  console
       device  and  to  a log file.  There is no standard way of ascertaining the real console device if you have a new-style /dev/console device (major 5, minor 1)  so bootlogd parses the kernel command
       line looking for console=... lines and deduces the real console device from that.  If that syntax is ever changed by the kernel, or a console type is used that bootlogd does not  know  about  then
       bootlogd will not work.
