SIEVE-DUMP(1)                                                                                     Dovecot                                                                                     SIEVE-DUMP(1)

NAME
       sieve-dump - Pigeonhole's Sieve script binary dump tool

SYNOPSIS
       sieve-dump [options] sieve-binary [out-file]

DESCRIPTION
        command is part of Pigeonhole (pigeonhole(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC 5228) and ManageSieve (RFC 5804) support to Dovecot (dovecot(1)).

        command,  Sieve  binaries, which are produced for instance by sievec(1), can be transformed into a human-readable textual representation. This can provide valuable insight in how the Sieve script
       is executed. This is also particularly useful to view corrupt binaries that can result from bugs in the Sieve implementation. This tool is intended mainly for  development  purposes,  so  normally
       system administrators and users will not need to use this tool.

       The  format  of  the  output  is not explained here in detail, but it should be relatively easy to understand. The Sieve binaries comprise a set of data blocks, each of which can contain arbitrary
       data. For the base language implementation two blocks are used: the first containing a specification of all required language extensions and the second containing the main Sieve program.  Compiled
       Sieve programs are represented as flat byte code and therefore the dump of the main program is a disassembly listing of the interpreter operations. Extensions can define new operations and use ad‐
       ditional blocks. Therefore, the output of sieve-dump depends greatly on the language extensions used when compiling the binary.

OPTIONS
       -c config-file

           Alternative Dovecot configuration file path.

       -D

           Enable Sieve debugging.

       -h

           Produce per-block hexdump output of the whole binary instead of the normal human-readable output.

       -o setting=value

           Overrides  the  configuration  setting  from /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and from the userdb with the given value. In order to override multiple settings, the -o option may be specified multiple
           times.

       -u user/mask

           Run the command only for the given user. It's also possible to use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).

       -x auth_info

           auth_info specifies additional conditions for the user command. The auth_info option string has to be given as name = value pair. For multiple conditions the -x option could be supplied multi‐
           ple times.

           Possible names for the auth_info are:

           service

               The service for which the userdb lookup should be tested. The value may be the name of a service, commonly used with Dovecot. For example: imap, pop3 or smtp.

       session

           Session identifier.

       lip

           The local IP address (server) for the test.

       rip

           The remote IP address (client) for the test.

       lport

           The local port, e.g. 143

       rport

           The remote port, e.g. 24567

       real_lip

           The local IP to which the client connected on this host.

       real_rip

           The remote IP where client connected from to this host.

       real_lport

           The local port to which client connected to to this host.

       real_rport

           The remote port from where the client connected from to this host.

       forward_<field>

           Field to forward as %{forward:field} to auth process.

ARGUMENTS
       sieve-binary

           Specifies the Sieve binary file that needs to be dumped.

       out-file

           Specifies where the output must be written. This argument is optional. If omitted, the output is written to stdout.

EXIT STATUS
       sieve-dump will exit with one of the following values:

       0

           Dump was successful. (EX_OK, EXIT_SUCCESS)

       1

           Operation failed. This is returned for almost all failures. (EXIT_FAILURE)

       64

           Invalid parameter given. (EX_USAGE)

FILES
       /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf

           Dovecot's main configuration file.

       /etc/dovecot/conf.d/90-sieve.conf

           Sieve interpreter settings (included from Dovecot's main

           configuration file)
