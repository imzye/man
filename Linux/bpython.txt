NAME
       bpython-config - user configuration file for bpython

SYNOPSIS
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bpython/config

DESCRIPTION
       The configuration file contains various options controlling the behaviour of bpython.

GENERAL
       This refers to the [general] section in your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bpython/config file.

   arg_spec
       Display the arg spec (list of arguments) for callables, when possible (default: True).

   auto_display_list
       Display the autocomplete list as you type (default: True).  When this is off, you can hit tab to see the suggestions.

   autocomplete_mode
       There are four modes for autocomplete: none, simple, substring, and fuzzy. Simple matches methods with a common prefix, substring matches methods with a common subsequence, and fuzzy matches meth‐
       ods with common characters (default: simple). None disables autocompletion.

       Added in version 0.12.

   brackets_completion
       Whether opening character of the pairs (), [], "", and '' should be auto-closed (default: False).

       Added in version 0.23.

   color_scheme
       See Themes for more information.

       Color schemes should be put in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bpython/. For example, to use the theme $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bpython/foo.theme set color_scheme = foo

       Leave blank or set to "default" to use the default (builtin) theme.

   complete_magic_methods
       Whether magic methods should be auto completed (default: True).

   dedent_after
       Number of blank lines required before next line will be dedented (default: 1).  If set to 0, automatic dedenting never occurs.

   editor
       Editor for externally editing the current line, session, or config file.

       Added in version 0.13.

   flush_output
       Whether to flush all output to stdout on exit (default: True).

       Only relevant to bpython-curses and bpython-urwid.

   highlight_show_source
       Whether the source code of an object should be syntax highlighted (default: True).

   hist_duplicates
       Whether to store duplicate entries in the history (default: True).

   hist_file
       History file (default: ~/.pythonhist).

   hist_length
       Number of lines to store in history (set to 0 to disable) (default: 100).

   paste_time
       The time between keypresses before pastemode is deactivated in bpython-curses (default: 0.02).

   pastebin_confirm
       Whether pasting to a pastebin needs to be confirmed before sending the data (default: True).

   pastebin_expiry
       Time duration after which a paste should expire. Valid values are 1day, 1week and 1month (default: 1week).

       Added in version 0.14.

   pastebin_helper
       The  name  of a helper executable that should perform pastebin upload on bpython's behalf. If set, this overrides pastebin_url. The helper is expected to return the full URL to the pastebin as the
       first word of its output. The data is supplied to the helper via STDIN.

       An example helper program is pastebinit, available for most systems. The following helper program can be used to create gists:

          #!/usr/bin/env python

          import sys
          import requests
          import json

          def do_gist_json(s):
              """ Use json to post to github. """
              gist_public = False
              gist_url = "https://api.github.com/gists"

              data = {
                  "description": "Gist from bpython",
                  "public": gist_public,
                  "files": {
                      "sample": {
                          "content": s
                      },
                  },
              }

              headers = {
                  "Content-Type": "application/json",
                  "X-Github-Username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
                  "Authorization": "token YOUR_TOKEN",
              }

              try:
                  res = requests.post(gist_url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)
                  res.raise_for_status()
                  json_res = json.loads(res.read())
                  return json_res["html_url"]
              except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
                  return err

          if __name__ == "__main__":
            s = sys.stdin.read()
            print(do_gist_json(s))

       Added in version 0.12.

   pastebin_url
       The pastebin url to post to (without a trailing slash). This pastebin has to be a pastebin which provides a similar interface to bpaste.net's JSON interface (default: https://bpaste.net).

   save_append_py
       Whether to append .py to the filename while saving the input to a file.

       Added in version 0.13.

   single_undo_time
       Time duration an undo must be predicted to take before prompting to undo multiple lines at once. Use -1 to never prompt, or 0 to always prompt.  (default: 1.0)

       Added in version 0.14.

   syntax
       Syntax highlighting as you type (default: True).

   tab_length
