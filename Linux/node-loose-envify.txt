NAME
       loose-envify - replace Node.js environment variables with plain strings

SYNOPSIS
       loose-envify <javascript_source_file.js>

DESCRIPTION
       Performs  a  Javascript  source-to-source  transformation (transpiling), that efficiently replaces Node.js process.env environment variables with plain strings. This makes the environment variable
       checks faster and easier to optimize out.

EXAMPLES
       Running this source code:
         if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
           console.log('development only')
         }

       through loose-envify:
         loose-envify index.js > bundle.js

       with NODE_ENV set to production results in:
         if ("production" === "development") {
           console.log('development only')
         }

       which, when run through a minifier, would be stripped out completely.

       However, if you run the same script through loose-envify with NODE_ENV set to development it gives:
         if ("development" === "development") {
           console.log('development only')
         }

       The if statement will evaluate to true, so the code won't be removed.
