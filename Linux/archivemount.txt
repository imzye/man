NAME
       archivemount — mount an archive for access as a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       archivemount [-hVdf] [-o option[,option]…]… archive mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       Mounts, through fuse(8), a file tree contained in archive on directory mountpoint.  umount and fusermount -u can undo this mapping.

EXAMPLES
       $ ls
       files.tar.gz    mnt/
       $ tar -tf files.tar.gz
       file1           file2
       $ archivemount files.tar.gz mnt
       $ ls mnt
       file1           file2
       $ echo zupa > mnt/file3
       $ rm mnt/file1
       $ umount mnt
       $ ls
       files.tar.gz    files.tar.gz.orig       mnt/
       $ tar -tf files.tar.gz
       file2           file3

       $ tar -tf voreutils.tar.gz
       src/            src/…
       man/            man/aliases              man/basename.1
       README.md
       $ archivemount -o subtree=man voreutils.tar.gz mnt
       $ ls mnt
       aliases         basename.1

OPTIONS
       See fuse(8) for a complete list of the baseline FUSE options supported.  The following options are handled specially by archivemount:
       -h, --help        Write usage and all available options to standard error stream, then exit.
       -V, --version     Write version of archivemount, libarchive, and FUSE to the standard output stream, then exit.

       -r, -o ro, -o readonly: Disable writes entirely.
       -o password       Prompt for archive passphrase.
       -o nobackup       When saving writes, the original archive is moved to "archive.orig".  This flag removes that file afterward.
       -o nosave         Allow writes in memory, but don't actually write them out on unmount.

       -o subtree=regex  Hide files not matching regex, and on those that do match, remove the matched prefix (cf. second example above).  regex is a basic regular expression that behaves as-if prepended
                         with the equivalent of "^.?".  Implies -r.
       -o formatraw      archive is actually a compressed file, made available under mounpoint/saved-filename or mounpoint/data.  Implies -r.

BUGS
       Writing archives, probably.

ARCHIVE FORMATS
       See  libarchive(3)  for a definitive list, but all kinds of tar/ustar/pax/cpio archives, 7-Zip, ISO9660, ar, and RAR/Zip may be read.  These may be compressed with gzip(1), xz(1), zstd(1), &c. and
       are processed transparently.  The same applies for writing (except you can't write RARs).
