NAME
       Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets  - downsample a data set while retaining its visual characteristics

VERSION
       Version 1.00

DESCRIPTION
       Implements a downsample technique known as Largest Triangle Three Buckets as defined in Sveinn Steinarsson MS thesis.

       http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/15343/37285/3/SS_MSthesis.pdf

       The idea is to downsample a data set without losing the visual character of the plotted data.  The technique draws on ideas in cartographic generalization or polyline simplification.  This
       technique is often useful in client-server applications such as webserver-browser where the length of the data far exceeds the pixels available to plot. Reducing the data size significantly speeds
       up data transfer and rendering time.

SYNOPSIS
       use Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets;

       my $lttb = new Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets( {threshold=>1000} );

       my $data_src = [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], ... ]; # <-- load your data source here as reference to a list of a list

       my $data_sampled = $lttb->lttb($data_src);

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   lttb()
       my $data_sampled = $lttb->lttb($data_src);

       Also can overwrite the class threashold variable such as

       my $data_sampled = $lttb->lttb($data_src,20000);

       This function is an optimized version of the algorithm given in Sveinn Steinarsson paper.  Several of the math operation are factored out of the loops and it executes better than 33% faster.

   lttb_ref()
       my $data_sampled = $lttb->lttb_ref($data_src);

       The reference function implimentation of the algorithm given in Sveinn Steinarsson paper and used to verify that the optimized version is giving correct results.
