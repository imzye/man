       --ports,    -p - ports to operate on    [all hub ports].
       --location, -l - limit hub by location  [all smart hubs].
       --level     -L - limit hub by location level (e.g. a-b.c is level 3).
       --vendor,   -n - limit hub by vendor id [any] (partial ok).
       --search,   -s - limit hub by attached device description.
       --delay,    -d - delay for cycle/flash action [2 sec].
       --repeat,   -r - repeat power off count [1] (some devices need it to turn off).
       --exact,    -e - exact location (no USB3 duality handling).
       --force,    -f - force operation even on unsupported hubs.
       --nodesc,   -N - do not query device description (helpful for unresponsive devices).
       --nosysfs,  -S - do not use the Linux sysfs port disable interface.
       --reset,    -R - reset hub after each power-on action, causing all devices to reassociate.
       --wait,     -w - wait before repeat power off [20 ms].
       --version,  -v - print program version.
       --help,     -h - print this text.
