SYNTAX
       The  allowed expression syntax is similar to that of C expressions.  It
       allows for prefix unary and common syntax binary  operators,  functions
       and  variables.   There  are  four supported types: cardinal (integral,
       positive), integer (integral), real (real) and text (string).
