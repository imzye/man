NAME
       garmin_save_runs - retrieve track logs from a Forerunner device.

SYNOPSIS
       garmin_save_runs

       garmin_save_runs  retrieves  track logs from a Garmin Forerunner device
       connected to an USB port, and saves the information into files.   Files
       are saved with the extension ".gmn" and are named by the run start time
       (e.g. '20070121T151814.gmn').  The .gmn file format is  a  binary  file
       format  that  can be unpacked with he garmin_dump or garmin_gmap utili‐
       ties.  It is substantially more efficient than the bloated  XML  format
       that Garmin uses.

       The  output  of garmin_save_runs will tell you where on your filesystem
       the actual .gmn files were saved.  The default is to save them in a di‐
       rectory  tree (by year and month) under the current directory.  You can
       override this by setting the environment variable  GARMIN_SAVE_RUNS  to
       whatever directory you like. Existing files are not overwritten.
