NAME
       Usage: - Send arbitrary IP packets

SYNOPSIS
       sendip [-v] [-d data] [-h] [-f datafile] [-p module] [module options] hostname

DESCRIPTION
       -d data
              add  this  data  as  a string to the end of the packet Data can be: rN to generate N random(ish) data bytes; 0x or 0X followed by hex digits; 0 followed by octal digits; any other stream of
              bytes

       -s options
              set socket options Valid options are: b (SO_BROADCAST) allow sending packets to broadcast addresses; i (IP_HDRINCL) (ON BY DEFAULT) include IP headers (expert use only!); 6 (IPV6_*) (ON  BY
              DEFAULT) various options for setting ipv6 headers

       -f datafile
              read packet data from file

       -h     print this message

       -p module
              load the specified module (see below)

       -v     be verbose

       Modules  are loaded in the order the -p option appears.  The headers from each module are put immediately inside the headers from the previous model in the final packet.  For example, to embed bgp
       inside tcp inside ipv4, do sendip -p ipv4 -p tcp -p bgp ....

   Modules available at compile time:
              ipv4 ipv6 icmp tcp udp bgp rip ntp

       -d data

              bytes
