CONTENTS
   What is Pympress?
       Pympress is a PDF presentation tool designed for dual-screen setups such as presentations and public talks.  Highly configurable, fully-featured, and portable

       It comes with many great features (more below):

       • supports embedded gifs (out of the box), videos, and audios (with VLC or Gstreamer integration)

       • text annotations displayed in the presenter window

       • natively supports beamer's notes on second screen, as well as Libreoffice notes pages!

       Pympress is a free software, distributed under the terms of the GPL license (version 2 or, at your option, any later version).

       Pympress was originally created and maintained by Schnouki <https://github.com/Schnouki>, on his repo <https://github.com/Schnouki/pympress>.

   Usage
   Opening a file
       Simply  start  Pympress  and  it will ask you what file you want to open.  You can also start pympress from the command line with a file to open like so: pympress slides.pdf or python3 -m pympress
       slides.pdf

   Functionalities
       All functionalities are available from the menus of the window with slide previews. Don't be afraid to experiment with them!

       Keyboard shortcuts are also listed in these menus. Some more usual shortcuts are often available, for example Ctrl+L, and F11 also toggle fullscreen, though the main shortcut is just F.

       A few of the fancier functionalities are listed here:

       • Two-screen display: See on your laptop or tablet display the current slide, the next slide, the talk time and wall-clock time, and annotations (either PDF annotations,  beamer  notes  on  second
         slide, or Libreoffice notes pages).  The position of the beamer or Libreoffice notes in the slide is detected automatically and can be overridden via a menu option.

         If  you  do not want to use second-slide beamer notes but prefer to have notes on their own pages, you can enable auto-detection of these notes.  Use the following snippet that prefixes the page
         labels with notes: on notes pages:

            \addtobeamertemplate{note page}{}{\thispdfpagelabel{notes:\insertframenumber}}

       • Media support: supports playing video, audio, and gif files embedded in (or linked from) the PDF file, with optional start/end times and looping.

       • Highlight mode: Allows one to draw freehand on the slide currently on screen.

       • Go To Slide: To jump to a selected slide without flashing through the whole presentation on the projector, press G or click the "current  slide" box.  Using J or clicking the  slide  label  will
         allow you to navigate slide labels instead of page numbers, useful e.g. for multi-page slides from beamer \pause.

         A spin box will appear, and you will be able to navigate through your slides in the presenter window only by scrolling your mouse, with the Home/Up/Down/End keys, with the + and - buttons of the
         spin box, or simply by typing in the number of the slide. Press Enter to validate going to the new slide or Esc to cancel.

       • Deck Overview: Pressing D will open an overview of your whole slide deck, and any slide can be opened from can simply clicking it.

       • Software pointer: Clicking on the slide (in either window) while holding ctrl down will display a software laser pointer on the slide. Or press L to permanently switch on the laser pointer.

       • Talk  time  breakdown:  The  Presentation  > Timing Breakdown menu item displays a breakdown of how much time was spent on each slide, with a hierarchical breakdown per chapters/sections/etc. if
         available in the PDF.

       • Automatic file reloading: If the file is modified, pympress will reload it (and preserve the current slide, current time, etc.)

       • Big button mode: Add big buttons (duh) for touch displays.

       • Swap screens: If Pympress mixed up which screen is the projector and which is not, press S

       • Automatic full screen: pympress will automatically put the content window fullscreen on your non-primay screen when:

         • connecting a second screen,

         • extending your desktop to a second screen that was mirroring your main screen,

         • when starting pympress on a two-screen display.  To disable this behaviour, untick “Content fullscreen” under the “Starting configuration” menu.

       • Estimated talk time: Click the Time estimation box and set your planned talk duration. The color will allow you to see at a glance how much time you have left.

       • Adjust screen centering: If your slides' form factor doesn't fit the projectors' and you don't want the slide centered in the window, use the "Screen Center" option in the "Presentation" menu.

       • Resize Current/Next slide: You can drag the bar between both slides on the Presenter window to adjust their relative sizes to your liking.

       • Caching: For efficiency, Pympress caches rendered pages (up to 200 by default). If this is too memory consuming for you, you can change this number in the configuration file.

       • Configurability: Your preferences are saved in a configuration file, and many options are accessible there directly. These include:

         • Customisable key bindings (or shortcuts),

         • Configurable layout of the presenter window, with 1 to 16 next slides preview

         • and many more.

         See the configuration file documentation for more details,

       • Editable PDF annotations: Annotations can be added, removed, or changed, and the modified PDF files can be saved

       • Automatic next slide and looping

   Command line arguments
       • -h, --help: Shows a list of all command line arguments.

       • -t mm[:ss], --talk-time=mm[:ss]: The estimated (intended) talk time in minutes and optionally seconds.

       • -n position, --notes=position: Set the position of notes on the pdf page (none, left, right, top, or bottom). Overrides the detection from the file.

       • --log=level: Set level of verbosity in log file (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

   Media and autoplay
       To enable media playback, you need to have either:

       • Gstreamer  installed  (enabled  by  default),  with  its  gtk  plugin  (libgstgtk)  which  is  sometimes  packaged  separately  (e.g.  as  gst-plugin-gtk  or  gstreamer1.0-gtk3),   and   plugins
         gstreamer-good/-bad/-ugly based on which codecs you need, or

       • VLC installed (and the python-vlc module), with enabled = on under the [vlc] section of your config file.

       On macOS, issues with the gstreamer brew formula may require users to set GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH manually. For default homebrew configurations the value should be /opt/homebrew/lib/gstreamer-1.0/.
       Make sure to set this environmental variable globally, or pympress might not pick it up.

       To produce PDFs with media inclusion, the ideal method is to use beamer’s multimedia package, always with \movie:

          \documentclass{beamer}
          \usepackage{multimedia}

          \begin{frame}{Just a mp4 here}
              \centering
              \movie[width=0.3\textwidth]{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{frame1.png}}{movie.mp4}

              \movie[width=0.3\textwidth]{}{animation.gif}

              \movie[width=0.3\textwidth]{}{ding.ogg}
          \end{frame}

       If you desire autoplay, ensure you have pympress ≥ 1.7.0 and poppler ≥ 21.04, and use the movie15 package as follows:

          \documentclass{beamer}
          \usepackage{movie15}
          \begin{document}

          \begin{frame}
            \begin{center}
              \includemovie[attach=false,autoplay,text={%
                  \includegraphics{files/mailto.png}%
                }]{0.4\linewidth}{0.3\linewidth}{files/random.mpg}
            \end{center}
          \end{frame}

          \end{document}

       context and keep continuity between translations of succcessive versions.  This means removed strings are unused and do not need translating.

   Configuration file
       Pympress has a number of options available from its configuration file.

       This file is usually located in:

       • ~/.config/pympress on Linux,

       • %APPDATA%/pympress.ini on Windows,

       • ~/Library/Preferences/pympress on macOS,

       • in the top-level of the pympress install directory for portable installations.

       The path to the currently used configuration file can be checked in the Help > About information window.

   Shortcuts
       The shortcuts are parsed using Gtk.accelerator_parse() <https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/functions.html#Gtk.accelerator_parse>:
          The format looks like “<Control>a” or “<Shift><Alt>F1” or “<Release>z” (the last one is for key release).

          The parser is fairly liberal and allows lower or upper case, and also abbreviations such as “<Ctl>” and “<Ctrl>”. Key names are parsed using Gdk.keyval_from_name() <https://lazka.github.io/pgi-
          docs/#Gdk-3.0/functions.html#Gdk.keyval_from_name>. For character keys the name is not the symbol, but the lowercase name, e.g. one would use “<Ctrl>minus” instead of “<Ctrl>-”.

       This means that any value in this list of key constants <https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gdk-3.0/constants.html#Gdk.KEY_0> is valid (removing the initial Gdk.KEY_ part). You can verify that this
       value is parsed correctly from the Help > Shortcuts information window.

   Layouts
       The panes (current slide, next slide, notes, annotations, etc.) can be rearranged arbitrarily by setting the entries of the layout section in the configuration file.  Here are a couple examples of
       layouts, with Cu the current slide, No the notes half of the slide, Nx the next slide:

       • All-horizontal layout:

            +----+----+----+
            | Cu | No | Nx |
            +----+----+----+

         Setting:

            notes = {"children": ["current", "notes", "next"], "proportions": [0.33, 0.33, 0.33], "orientation": "horizontal", "resizeable": true}

       • All-vertical layout:

            +----+
            | Cu |
            +----+
            | No |
            +----+
            | Nx |
            +----+

         Setting:

            notes = {"children": ["current", "notes", "next"], "proportions": [0.33, 0.33, 0.33], "orientation": "vertical", "resizeable": true}

       • Vertical layout with horizontally divided top pane:

            +----+----+
            | Cu | No |
            +----+----+
            |    Nx   |
            +---------+

         Setting:

            notes = {"children": [
                             {"children": ["current", "notes"], "proportions": [0.5, 0.5], "orientation": "horizontal", "resizeable": true},
                             "next"
                        ], "proportions": [0.5, 0.5], "orientation": "vertical", "resizeable": true}

       • Horizontal layout with horizontally divided right pane:

            +----+----+
            |    | Nx |
            + Cu +----+
            |    | No |
            +---------+

         Setting:

            notes = {"children": [
                             "current",
                             {"children": ["next", "notes"], "proportions": [0.5, 0.5], "orientation": "vertical", "resizeable": true}
                        ], "proportions": [0.5, 0.5], "orientation": "horizontal", "resizeable": true}

       And so on. You can play with the items, their nesting, their order, and the orientation in which a set of widgets appears.

       For each entry the widgets (strings that are leaves of "children" nodes in this representation) must be:

       • for notes: "current", "notes", "next"

       • for plain: "current", "next" and "annotations" (the annotations widget is toggled with the A key by default)

       • for highlight: same as plain with "highlight" instead of "current"

       A few further remarks:

       • If you set "resizeable" to false, the panes won’t be resizeable dynamically with a handle in the middle

       • "proportions"  are normalized, and saved on exit if you resize panes during the execution. If you set them to 4 and 1, the panes will be 4 / (4 + 1) = 20% and 1 / (4 + 1) = 100%, so the ini will
         contain something like 0.2 and 0.8 after executing pympress.

   Themes on Windows
       Pympress uses the default Gtk theme of your system, which  makes  it  easy  to  change  on  many  OSs  either  globally  via  your  Gtk  preferences  or  per  application  <https://www.linuxupris‐
       ing.com/2019/10/how-to-use-different-gtk-3-theme-for.html>.  Here’s the way to do it on windows:

       1. Install a theme

          There  are  2  locations,  either install the theme for all your gtk apps, e.g. in C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\themes, or just for pympress, so in %INSTALLDIR%\share\themes (for me that’s
          C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\pympress\share\themes)

          Basically pick a theme e.g. from this list of dark themes <https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/cat/135/ord/rating/?tag=dark> and make sure to unpack it in the  selected  directory,  it  needs  at
          least %THEMENAME%\gtk-3.0\gtk.css and %THEMENAME%\index.theme, where THEMENAME is the name of the theme.

          There are 2 pitfalls to be aware of, to properly install a theme:

          • themes that are not self-contained (relying on re-using css from default linux themes that you might not have), and

          • linux  links  (files  under  gtk-3.0/ that point to a directory above and that need to be replaced by a directory containing the contents of the target directory that has the same name as the
            link file).

       2. Set the theme as default

          Create a settings.ini file, either under C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\gtk-3.0 (global setting) or %INSTALLDIR%\etc\gtk-3.0 (just pympress) and set the contents:

             [Settings]
             gtk-theme-name=THEMENAME

       In testing this  found these 2 stackoverflow questions useful:

       • Change GTK+3 look on Windows <https://stackoverflow.com/a/39041558/1387346> which contains a list of all interesting directories

       • How to get native windows decorations on GTK3 on Windows 7+ and MSYS2 <https://stackoverflow.com/a/37060369/1387346> which details the process
