NAME
       tdbc::sqlite3 - TDBC driver for the SQLite3 database manager

SYNOPSIS
       package require tdbc::sqlite3 1.0

       tdbc::sqlite3::connection create db fileName ?-option value...?

DESCRIPTION
       The  tdbc::sqlite3  driver  provides  a  database interface that conforms to Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl script to connect to a SQLite3
       database.  It is also provided as a worked example of how to write a database driver in Tcl, so that driver authors have a starting point for further  devel‐
       opment.

       Connection  to  a  SQLite3 database is established by invoking tdbc::sqlite3::connection create, passing it a string to be used as the connection handle fol‐
       lowed by the file name of the database. The side effect of tdbc::sqlite3::connection create is to create a new  database  connection..   As  an  alternative,
       tdbc::sqlite::connection  new may be used to create a database connection with an automatically assigned name. The return value from tdbc::sqlite::connection
       new is the name that was chosen for the connection handle. See tdbc::connection(3tcl) for the details of how to use the connection to manipulate a database.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       The standard configuration options -encoding, -isolation, -readonly and -timeout are all recognized, both on tdbc::sqlite3::connection create and on the con‐
       figure method of the resulting connection.

       Since  the encoding of a SQLite3 database is always well known, the -encoding option accepts only utf-8 as an encoding and always returns utf-8 for an encod‐
       ing. The actual encoding may be set using a SQLite3 PRAGMA statement when creating a new database.

       Only the isolation levels readuncommitted and serializable are implemented. Other isolation levels are promoted to serializable.

       The -readonly flag is not implemented. -readonly 0 is accepted silently, while -readonly 1 reports an error.

BUGS
       If any column name is not unique among the columns in a result set, the results of -as dicts returns will be missing all but the rightmost of the  duplicated
       columns.  This  limitation  can  be  worked around by adding appropriate AS clauses to SELECT statements to ensure that all returned column names are unique.
       Plans are to fix this bug by using a C implementation of the driver, which will also improve performance significantly.
