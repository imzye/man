       --help    Prints the help text

       --demo    Demonstration mode. Generates one hand with permutations and the tutorial for how to use them.

       --generate=N
                 Generate N random boards

       --load=boards.txt
                 Load boards+analysis from boards.txt

       --load-dds=boards.dds
                 Load boards from boards.dds in dds format

       --load-analysis=tricks.txt
                 Load analysis from tricks.txt

       --permutations=permutations.txt
                 Generate the permutations and save them to the given file

       --curtains=curtains.txt
                 Save curtain cards to file curtains.txt

       --save=boards.txt
                 Save the boards+analysis to boards.txt

       --save-dds=boards.dds
                 Save the boards to boards.dds in dds format

       --save-analysis=tricks.txt
                 Save the analysis to tricks.txt

       --format=html|txt|pdf
                 Set the output mode to the given format

       --title=title
                 Set the title for the output

       --stats   Generate statistics about the set of boards; included in the hands output

       --analyze Run the dds analyzer on the boards and print the resulting numberof tricks (warning SLOW)

       --criteria=''criteria...''
                 A  list  of  criteria  to  apply to each generated hand to generate specific hand types.  The list should be space separated and each item may be suffixed with a colon and a (fractional)
                 probability value which can be used to weight the criteria.

                 E.g. --criteria="weaknt:0.8 strongnt:0.5"

                 Valid criteria are: unbalanced weaknt strongnt twont strongtwo weaktwo three twoclubs 4441 singlesuit twosuits partscore game slam game-invite slam-invite jumpshift jumpfit splinter  ba‐
                 con weird

       --probability=factor
                 Generate  hands  matching the criteria with only the given probability. Factor is in the range 0 to 1. On each attempt to generate a board it is rejected if it doesn't match the criteria
                 with the given probability.  A factor of about 0.8 gives roughly half matching boards
