NAME
       rio - program to control a Diamond RIO MP3 player

SYNOPSIS
       rio [options] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rio command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       rio is a CLI controller for a Diamond Rio MP3 file player.

       The default ioport is 0x378.  If this is not the ioport for your printer port, you will have to use the -p option.

INITIALIZATION
       Initialization  should  only be performed on new or corrupt cards.  You can initialize with bad block checking enabled (-iy) which will test all blocks on the internal or external flash ram (which
       ever is selected) and note all bad blocks. This process will take some time (upto 20 minutes on slow machines).  You can also initialize with bad  block  checking  disabled  (-in)  which  is  much
       quicker but all blocks (even bad blocks) will be used.

       If you want to delete all files on the device, the (-za) option should be used instead of using the initialization options mentioned above.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options are included below.

       -d     Display Directory

       -iy    initialize with check for bad blocks

       -in    initialize without check for bad blocks

       -x     perform operations on external flash ram

       -u     specify file(s) to upload

       -g     specify file to download

       -z     specify file to delete

       -za    delete all files

       -o     specify new playlist order in quotes

       -p     specify parallel port base IO address, default=0x378

       -v     enable verbose mode

       -di    specify initialization delay

       -dt    specify tx delay

       -dr    specify rx delay

EXAMPLES

       rio -za -f playlist.txt -x

       initialize, upload files in playlist and then display directory

       rio -d -in -f playlist.txt

       download file then delete it and finally display directory

       rio -d -g mp3Files/song.mp3 -z song.mp3
