NAME
       ExtUtils::XSBuilder::WrapXS - create perl XS wrappers for C functions

   DESCRIPTION
       For more information, see ExtUtils::XSBuilder

   new_parsesource (o)
       Returns an array ref of new ParseSource objects for all source files that should be used to generate XS files

   new_typemap (o)
       Returns a new typemap object

   new_podtemplate (o)
       Returns a new podtemplate object

   xs_includes (o)
       Returns a list of XS include files.

       Default: use all include files that "ParseSource::find_includes" returns, but strip path info

   xs_glue_dirs (o)
       Returns a list of additional XS glue directories to seach for maps in.

   xs_base_dir (o)
       Returns a directory which serves as a base for other directories.

       Default: '.'

   xs_map_dir (o)
       Returns the directory to search for map files in

       Default: "<xs_base_dir"/xsbuilder/maps>

   xs_incsrc_dir (o)
       Returns the directory to search for files to include into the source. For example, "<xs_incsrc_dir"/Apache/DAV/Resource/Resource_pm> will be included into the "Apache::DAV::Resource" module.

       Default: "<xs_base_dir"/xsbuilder>

   xs_include_dir (o)
       Returns a directory to search for include files for pm and XS

       Default: "<xs_base_dir"/xsinclude>

   xs_target_dir (o)
       Returns the directory to write generated XS and header files in

       Default: "<xs_base_dir"/xs>

   makefilepl_text (o)
       Returns text for Makefile.PL

   h_filename_prefix (o)
       Defines a prefix for generated header files

       Default: 'xs_'

   my_xs_prefix (o)
       Defines a prefix used for all XS functions

       Default: 'xs_'

   my_cnv_prefix (o)
       Defines a prefix used for all conversion functions/macros.

       Default: "my_xs_prefix"

   needs_prefix (o, name)
       Returns true if the passed name should be prefixed

   pm_text (o, module, isa, code)
       Returns the text of a ".pm" file, or undef if no ".pm" file should be written.

       Default: Create a ".pm" file which bootstraps the XS code

   mapline_elem  (o, elem)
       Called for each structure element that is written to the map file by checkmaps. Allows the user to change the element name, for example adding a different perl name.

       Default: returns the element unmodified

   mapline_func  (o)
       Called for each function that is written to the map file by checkmaps. Allows the user to change the function name, for example adding a different perl name.

       Default: returns the element unmodified
