NAME
       mandelbulber2 - 3D fractal renderer and animator

SYNOPSIS
       mandelbulber2 [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mandelbulber2 command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       mandelbulber2 is a ray-tracing application for drawing three-dimensional fractals, like Mandelbulb, Mandelbox, Julia, trigonometric, hypercomplex or IFS fractals. It is highly customizable and
       features complex shading algorithms (among the others there are shadows, depth of field, ambient occlusion).

       mandelbulber2 is also able to produce animations and has a simple built-in 3D navigator for exploring the fractals.

       mandelbulber2 is a complete rewriting from scratches of mandelbulber by the same author. It will obsolete Mandelbulber as soon as it reaches feature parity.

OPTIONS
       mandelbulber2 is mainly meant to be used via its graphical interface and doesn't support many command-line arguments. You can have a list of the supported options with their meanings using the --help
       option.

       The non-option arguments will be interpreted as settings file names to load once the program has started.
