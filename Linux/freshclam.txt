NAME
       freshclam - update virus databases

SYNOPSIS
       freshclam [options]

DESCRIPTION
       freshclam is a virus database update tool for ClamAV.

OPTIONS
       FreshClam reads its configuration from freshclam.conf. The settings can be overwritten with command line options.

       -h, --help
              Output help information and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose. This option causes freshclam to print much additional information.

       --debug
              Enable debug messages from LibClamAV.

       --quiet
              Be quiet - output only error messages.

       --no-warnings
              Don't print and log warnings.

       --stdout
              Write all messages to stdout.

       --show-progress
              Show download progress percentage.

       --config-file=FILE
              Read configuration from FILE.

       -l FILE, --log=FILE
              Log report to FILE.

       -d, --daemon
              Run in a daemon mode. Defaults to 12 checks per day unless otherwise specified by --checks or freshclam.conf.

       -p FILE, --pid=FILE
              Write daemon's pid to FILE.

       -F, --foreground
              Don't fork into background (for use in daemon mode).

       -u USER, --user USER
              Run as USER. By default (when started by root) freshclam drops privileges and operates as the '' user.

       --no-dns
              This option forces old non-DNS verification method (without a TTL delay).

       -c #n, --checks=#n
              Check #n times per day for a new database. #n must be between 1 and 50.

       --datadir=DIRECTORY
              Install new database in DIRECTORY. The directory must be writable for the '' user or unprivileged user running freshclam.

       --daemon-notify=/path/to/clamd.conf
              Notify the daemon about the new database. By default it reads a hardcoded config file but you can use a different one. Both local and TCP sockets are supported.

       -a IP, --local-address=IP
              Use (local) IP for HTTP downloads. Useful for multi-homed systems. If binding fails for whatever reason, a warning is issued and freshclam behaves like without this flag.

       --on-update-execute=COMMAND
              Execute COMMAND after successful update.

       --on-error-execute=COMMAND
              Execute  COMMAND  if error occurred. Remember, that virus database freshness is the most important thing in anti-virus system. With this option freshclam can alert you (eg. send SMS) when some‐
              thing is going wrong.

       --on-outdated-execute=COMMAND
              Execute COMMAND when freshclam reports outdated version. In the command string %v will be replaced by the new version number.

       --update-db=DBNAME
              With this option you can limit updates to a subset of database files. The DBNAME should be "main", "daily", "bytecode", "safebrowsing" or one of the 3rd party database names. This option can be
              used  multiple  times and only works with the official and 3rd party databases distributed through the ClamAV mirrors, your custom databases (specified with DatabaseCustomURL in freshclam.conf)
              will not be ignored.

EXAMPLES
       (0) Download database to default directory:

              freshclam

       (1) Download database to current directory:

              freshclam --datadir=.

       (2) Run as a daemon and check 2 times per day for new database:

              freshclam -d -c 2

RETURN CODES
       Some return codes of freshclam can be overwritten with a built-in command EXIT_n which can be passed to --on-*-execute, eg. --on-update-execute=EXIT_1 will force freshclam to  always  return  1  after
       successful database update.

       0 : Database is up-to-date or successfully updated.

       40: Unknown option passed.

       50: Can't change directory.

       51: Can't check MD5 sum.

       52: Connection (network) problem.

       53: Can't unlink file.

       54: MD5 or digital signature verification error.

       55: Error reading file.

       56: Config file error.

       57: Can't create new file.

       58: Can't read database from remote server.
