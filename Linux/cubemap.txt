NAME
       cubemap - scalable video reflector, designed to be used with VLC

SYNOPSIS
       cubemap [options] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       cubemap is a high-performance, high-availability video reflector, specifically made for use with VLC.

       • High-performance, through a design with multiple worker threads, epoll and sendfile (yes, sendfile); a 2GHz quadcore can saturate 10 gigabit Ethernet, given a modern kernel, a modern NIC and the
         right kernel tuning.

       • High-availability.  You can change any part of the configuration (and even upgrade to a newer version of Cubemap) by changing cubemap.config and sending a SIGHUP; all clients will continue as if
         nothing had happened (unless you delete the stream they are watching, of course).  Cubemap also survives the encoder dying and reconnecting.

       • Support for setting max pacing rate through the fq packet scheduler (depends on Linux 3.13 or newer).

       • Reflects anything VLC can reflect over HTTP, even the muxes VLC has problems reflecting itself (in particular, FLV).

       • Multicast support, both for sending and receiving (supports only protocols that can go over UDP, e.g. MPEG-TS). Supports both ASM and SSM.

       • IPv4 support. Yes, Cubemap even supports (some) legacy protocols.

OPTIONS
       --test-config, -t
              tests the config and exits

       FILE   configuration file (defaults to cubemap.config in the current directory)
