NAME
       rosversion - rosverion command

SYNOPSIS
       rosversion <stack> | -d

DESCRIPTION
       The rosversion command prints version information for ROS stacks and can also print the name of the active ROS distribution.

       rosversion takes in a single ROS stack name as an argument, or a -d option with no arguments to print the distribution version instead.  If the version number for a stack is not known, "<unversioned>"
       will be printed instead.

OPTIONS
       -d
          Print codename for current ROS distribution.
