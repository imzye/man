NAME
       denemo - gtk+ frontend to GNU Lilypond

SYNOPSIS
       denemo

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the denemo command.

       GNU  denemo  is  a  GUI musical score editor written in C/gtk+.  It is intended primarily as a frontend to GNU Lilypond, but is adaptable to other computer-music-related purposes as well.  You can
       compose, transcribe, arrange, listen to the music and much more.

       Denemo itself does not engrave the music for printout - it uses LilyPond which generates beautiful sheet music to the highest publishing standards. Denemo just displays the staffs in  a  slim  and
       efficient way, so you can enter and edit the music efficiently.

       The word Denemo is a corruption of the French word dénouement.

       The full documentation for denemo is kept in html format and can be found at /usr/share/doc/denemo-doc/denemo-manual.html after you have installed the denemo-doc package.
