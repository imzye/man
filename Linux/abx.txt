NAME
       abx - audio ABX testing software

SYNOPSIS
       abx [OPTIONS...] <SAMPLE-A> <SAMPLE-B>

DESCRIPTION
       abx  is  a  program  for  performing software-based audio ABX testing on GNU/Linux systems. ABX test (Wikipedia, Hydrogenaudio) is a statistical test for assessing whether you are able to tell for
       audible differences between two samples. For example, one sample can be a compressed audio file such as OGG Vorbis file and another one its uncompressed variant (WAV, AU, ...). You  can  then  use
       abx to infer whether you are able to separate the two samples due to compression artifacts.
