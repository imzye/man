NAME
       rpmsoname - list files that provide sonames in RPM package(s)

SYNOPSIS
       rpmsoname [-h] [options] [FILE...] [DIR...]

DESCRIPTION
       rpmsoname produces two-column output (typically one line per each soname).  Column one contains file path; column two contains corresponding soname.  When processing a directory, an additional column
       is prepended to the output, which is typically RPM file basename.

       Note that the name rpmsoname is probably a misnomer: the script does not deal with ELF "DT_SONAME" entries.  What it does is try to map soname-like entries from RPM "PROVIDES" list to regular files
       within the very same RPM package (using "BASENAMES", "FILENAMES", and "FILELINKTOS" lists from RPM header).

OPTIONS
       Options and arguments manage a set of RPM packages to be processed; they are those of rpmargs(1).
