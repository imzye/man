NAME
       ntfy - Simple pub-sub notification service

SYNOPSIS
       ntfy [OPTIONS]
       ntfy <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       ntfy - pronounced "notify" - is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service.  With ntfy, you can send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer

COMMANDS
       This program provides both the client and server commands for ntfy.  Both can be run as services but are usually disabled.

       For command-specific options, run ntfy <command> --help

   CLIENT COMMANDS
       publish [OPTIONS] <topic> [message]
           Send message via a ntfy server to a topic
           aliases: send trigger pub

       subscribe [OPTIONS] <[SERVER/]topic> [EXECUTE_COMMAND]
       subscribe [OPTIONS] --from-config
           Subscribe to a topic which could be on a different server.
           If an optional command argument is passed, it will be executed when a message arrives.
           The second form can subscribe to multiple topics from config file.
           aliases: sub

   SERVER COMMANDS
       These are server-only commands, with the exception of serve.  They will directly manage the user.db as defined in the server config file server.yml. They require a properly defined 'auth-file'.

       access [USERNAME [TOPIC [PERMISSION]]]
           Show the access control list, as well as change it, depending on how it is called.
           PERMISSION can be one of the following:
               read-write (alias: rw)
               read-only (aliases: read, ro)
               write-only (aliases: write, wo)
               deny (alias: none)
           Please also refer to the related command user.

       serve
       serve --listen-http :8080
           Run the ntfy server in the foreground (default port 80)

       tier [list|add|change|remove] [OPTIONS]
           Manage/show tiers
           The command allows you to add/remove/change tiers in the ntfy user database. Tiers are used
           to grant users higher limits, such as daily message limits, attachment size, or make it
           possible for users to reserve topics.

       token <list|add|remove> [OPTIONS]
           List, add or delete user tokens which can be used publish, subscribe, or perform any other user-specific tasks.
           Tokens have full access, and can perform any task a user can do. They are meant to be used to
           avoid spreading the password to various places.

       user [list|add|remove|change-pass|change-role] [OPTIONS]
           List/add/remove/change users in the ntfy user database, as well as change passwords or roles.
           Please also refer to the related command access.
