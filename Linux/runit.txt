NAME
       runsvchdir - change services directory of runsvdir(8)

SYNOPSIS
       runsvchdir dir

DESCRIPTION
       dir is a services directory for the use with runsvdir(8).  If dir does not start with a slash, it is searched in /etc/runit/runsvdir/.  dir must not start with a dot.

       runsvchdir switches to its working directory, by default /etc/runit/runsvdir/: then it copies current to previous, and replaces current with a symlink pointing to dir.

       Normally /etc/service is a symlink to current, and runsvdir(8) is running /etc/service/.

ENVIRONMENT
       RUNSVDIR
              The environment variable $RUNSVDIR overrides the default working directory /etc/runit/runsvdir/.

EXIT CODES
       runsvchdir prints an error message and exits 111 on error.  runsvchdir exits 0 on success.

FILES
        /etc/runit/runsvdir/previous
        /etc/runit/runsvdir/current
        /etc/runit/runsvdir/current.new
