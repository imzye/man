HTPROXYPUT(1)                   GridSite Manual                  HTPROXYPUT(1)

NAME
       htproxyput,  htproxydestroy, htproxytime, htproxyunixtime, htproxyrenew
       - GSI proxy delegations and querying, using  GridSite/gLite  delegation
       API

SYNOPSIS
       htproxyput,  htproxydestroy, htproxytime, htproxyunixtime, htproxyrenew
       [options] Service-URL

       htproxyinfo [options]

DESCRIPTION
       htproxyput is a client to perform GSI proxy delegations using the Grid‐
       Site/gLite  delegation Web Service portType. The gridsite-delegation(8)
       CGI program is the complementary server-side implementation.

       htproxyinfo examines a local copy of a GSI proxy, and outputs a summary
       of its X.509 and VOMS contents.

OPTIONS
       -v/--verbose
              Turn on debugging information.

       --delegation-id <ID>
              Explicitly specify the Delegation ID to use.

       --destroy
              Instead  of  delegating  a proxy, delete the proxy from the ser‐
              vice's proxy cache. Calling the program  as  htproxydestroy  has
              the same effect.

       --time Instead of delegating a proxy, report the expiration time of the
              proxy, in the local time of the client. Calling the  program  as
              htproxytime has the same effect.

       --unixtime
              Instead of delegating a proxy, report the expiration time of the
              proxy, as the number of seconds since 00:00:00  1970-01-01  UTC.
              Calling the program as htproxyunixtime has the same effect.

       --renew
              Delegate an updated version of an existing proxy. The Delegation
              ID must be given when using this option. Calling the program  as
              htproxyrenew has the same effect.

       --info Examine  a  local  proxy file, and output a summary of the X.509
              certificates and VOMS attributes it contains. Calling  the  pro‐
              gram as htproxyinfo has the same effect.

       --cert <X.509 cert path>  and  --key <X.509 key path>
              Path  to the PEM-encoded X.509 or GSI Proxy user certificate and
              key to use for HTTPS connections, instead of  "anonymous  mode."
              If only one of --key or --cert is given, then that will be tried
              for both. If neither is  given,  then  the  following  order  of
              precedence   is  used:  the  file  name  held  by  the  variable
              X509_USER_PROXY; the file /tmp/x509up_uID (with Unix  UID  equal
              to  ID);  the file names held by X509_USER_CERT / X509_USER_KEY;
              the  files  ~/.globus/usercert.pem   and   ~/.globus/userkey.pem
              (where ~/ is the home directory of the user.)

       --capath <X.509 CA root certs directory or file>
              Path to the PEM-encoded CA root certificates to use when verify‐
              ing remote servers' host certificates in HTTPS connections. Ide‐
              ally  this should be a directory of hash.0 files as described in
              the OpenSSL verify(1) man page, but a file may be used  instead.
              If  --capath is not given, the value of the environment variable
              X509_CERT_DIR will  be  tried.   If  this  is  not  valid,  then
              /etc/grid-security/certificates will be used.

       --no-verify
              Do  not  use CA root certificates to verify remote servers' host
              certificates.  This is useful for  testing  sites  before  their
              certificate  is  set  up  properly, but leaves you vulnerable to
              "man in the middle" attacks by hostile servers  masquerading  as
              your target.

FILES
       /tmp/x509up_uID
              Default GSI Proxy file for Unix UID equal to ID.

       /etc/grid-security/certificates
              Default  location  for trusted Certification Authority root cer‐
              tificates to use when checking server certificates.

       /tmp/.ca-roots-XXXXXX
              Prior to 7.9.8, the underlying curl library did not support  the
              CA root certificates directory.  If built with an old version of
              libcurl, htproxyput will concatenate the certificates in the  CA
              roots directory into a unique temporary file and use that.

ENVIRONMENT
       X509_CERT_DIR
              Holds  directory to search for Certification Authority root cer‐
              tificates when verifying server certificates. (Tried if --capath
              is not given on the command line.)

       X509_USER_PROXY
              Holds  file  name  of  a  GSI  Proxy to use as user certificate.
              (Tried if --cert or --key are not given on the command line.)

       X509_USER_CERT and X509_USER_KEY
              Holds file name of X.509 user certificate  and  key.  (Tried  if
              X509_USER_PROXY is not valid.)

EXIT CODES
       0 is returned on complete success, and non-zero on error.

TO DO
       Better error recovery.
