Term::ProgressBar::Simple(3pm)                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                      Term::ProgressBar::Simple(3pm)

NAME
       Term::ProgressBar::Simple - simpler progress bars

SYNOPSIS
           # create some things to loop over
           my @things = (...);
           my $number_of_things = scalar @things;

           # create the progress bar object
           my $progress = Term::ProgressBar::Simple->new( $number_of_things );

           # loop
           foreach my $thing (@things) {

               # do some work
               $thing->do_something();

               # increment the progress bar object to tell it a step has been taken.
               $progress++;
           }

           # See also use of '$progress += $number' later in pod

DESCRIPTION
       Progress bars are handy - they tell you how much work has been done, how much is left to do and estimate how long it will take.

       But they can be fiddly!

       This module does the right thing in almost all cases in a really convenient way.

FEATURES
       Lots - does all the best practice:

       Wraps Term::ProgressBar::Quiet so there is no output unless the code is running interactively - lets you put them in cron scripts.

       Deals with minor updates - only refreshes the screen when it will change what the user sees so it is efficient.

       Completes the progress bar when the progress object is destroyed (explicitly or by going out of scope) - no more '99%' done.

METHODS
   new
           # Either...
           my $progress = Term::ProgressBar::Simple->new($count);

           # ... or
           my $progress = Term::ProgressBar::Simple->new(
               {
                   count => $count,               #
                   name  => 'descriptive text',
               }
           );

       Create a new progress bar. Either just pass in the number of things to do, or a config hash. See Term::ProgressBar for details.

   increment ( ++ )
           $progress++;

       Incrementing the object causes the progress display to be updated. It is smart about checking to see if the display needs to be updated.

   increment ( += )
           $progress += $number_done;

       Sometimes you'll have done more than one step between updates. A good example is processing logfiles, where the time taken is relative to the size of the file.  In this case code like this would
       give a better feel for the progress made:

           # Get the total size of all the files
           my $total_size = sum map { -s } @filenames;

           # Set up object with total size as steps to do
           my $progress = Term::ProgressBar::Simple->new($total_size);

           # process each file and increment by the size of each file
           foreach my $filename (@filenames) {
               process_the_file($filename);
               $progress += -s $filename;
           }

   message
           $progress->message('Copying $filename');

       Output a message. This is very much like print, but we try not to disturb the terminal.

GOTCHAS
       Not all operators are overloaded, so things might blow up in interesting ways.  Patches welcome.

BUGS
       There are no tests - there should be. The smart way would be to trap the output and check it is right.
