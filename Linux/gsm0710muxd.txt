NAME
       gsm0710muxd - a GSM 07.10 muxer

SYNOPSIS
       gsm0710muxd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       A  GSM muxer is needed to keep a PPP/GPRS up & running while sms and calls are still signaled on another channel. Some modems even support using GPRS while a call is active, others suspend GPRS during
       calls.

       The muxer supports various options to change the behaviour for different modems. Use -h to see a brief help screen.

       All logging is done through syslog, see the syslog for errors and warnings.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -d   Fork, get a daemon (default: no)

       -v   Verboser logging (give twice for even more verbose)

       -s <serial port name>
            Serial port device to connect to (default: /dev/modem)

       -t <timeout>
            reset modem after this number of seconds of silence (default: 0)

       -P <pin-code>
            PIN code to unlock SIM (default: <not set>). This is normally not needed but some modems need the pin before enabling the muxer mode.

       -p <number>
            use ping and reset modem after this number of unanswered pings (default: 0)

       -l <filename>
            set logfile name (default: <not set>)

       -x <dir>
            power management base dir (default: <not set>)

       -a <mode>
            additional_functionality (default: 0). This is a bit-set enabling quirks for different modem. The quirks are: WAKEUP_WITH_SYSFS = 1, WAKEUP_WITH_SEQUENCE  =  2,  SIEMENS_C35  =  4,  ENFORA  =  8,
            SHORT_INIT = 16.

       -b <baudrate>
            muxer-mode baudrate (default: 115200)

       -B <baudrate>
            serial port baudrate (default: 115200)

       -m <mode>
            Mode (basic, advanced) (default: advanced)

       -f <framsize>
            Frame size (default: 64)

       -h   Show a help message and display current settings.

HISTORY
       The name 'gsm0710muxd' was chosen because the GSM specs describe this method in document 7.10.

BUGS/LIMITATIONS
       gsm0710muxd There may accure bufferoverruns and thus missing data between muxer and client under certain situations.

       Some settings could be determined by a AT-command at startup. This wouldn't be much reliable because modems often lie so i did not invest to much work in this.
