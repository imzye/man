              The default output is int16. The TV mode will determine if the output is real or complex.

              If no valid output prefix is provided, file: is assumed.

       Supported television modes:

       i      = PAL colour, 25 fps, 625 lines, AM (complex), 6.0 MHz FM audio

       b, g   = PAL colour, 25 fps, 625 lines, AM (complex), 5.5 MHz FM audio

       pal-fm = PAL colour, 25 fps, 625 lines, FM (complex), 6.5 MHz FM audio

       pal    = PAL colour, 25 fps, 625 lines, unmodulated (real)

       m      = NTSC colour, 30/1.001 fps, 525 lines, AM (complex)

       ntsc   = NTSC colour, 30/1.001 fps, 525 lines, unmodulated (real)

       l      = SECAM colour, 25 fps, 625 lines, AM (complex), 6.5 MHz AM

              audio

       secam  = SECAM colour, 25 fps, 625 lines, unmodulated (real)

       e      = No colour, 25 fps, 819 lines, AM (complex)

       a      = No colour, 25 fps, 405 lines, AM (complex)

       405    = No colour, 25 fps, 405 lines, unmodulated (real)

       240-am = No colour, 25 fps, 240 lines, AM (complex)

       240    = No colour, 25 fps, 240 lines, unmodulated (real)

       30-am  = No colour, 12.5 fps, 30 lines, AM (complex)

       30     = No colour, 12.5 fps, 30 lines, unmodulated (real)

              apollo-fsc-fm = Field sequential colour, 30/1.001 fps, 525 lines, FM (complex)

              1.25 MHz FM audio

       apollo-fsc
              = Field sequential colour, 30/1.001 fps, 525 lines, unmodulated

              (real)

       apollo-fm
              = No colour, 10 fps, 320 lines, FM (complex), 1.25 MHz FM audio

       apollo = No colour, 10 fps, 320 lines, unmodulated (real)

       NOTE: The number of samples per line is rounded to the nearest integer, which may result in a slight frame rate error.

       For modes which include audio you also need to ensure the sample rate is adequate to contain both the video signal and audio subcarriers.

       16MHz works well with PAL modes, and 13.5MHz for NTSC modes.

       Teletext

       Teletext is a digital information service transmitted within the VBI lines of the video signal. Developed in the UK in the 1970s, it was used throughout much of Europe until the end of analogue TV
       in the 2010s.

       hacktv supports TTI files. The path can be either a single file or a directory. All files in the directory will be loaded.

       Raw packet sources are also supported with the raw:<source> path name.  The input is expected to be 42 byte teletext packets. Use - for stdin.

       Lines 7-22 and 320-335 are used, 16 lines per field.

       Teletext support in hacktv is only compatible with 625 line PAL modes.  NTSC and SECAM variations exist and may be supported in the future.

       WSS (Widescreen Signaling)

       WSS provides a method to signal to a TV the intended aspect ratio of the video. The following modes are supported:

       4:3    = Video is 4:3.

       16:9   = Video is 16:9 (Anamorphic).

              14:9-letterbox = Crop a 4:3 video to 14:9.  16:9-letterbox = Crop a 4:3 video to 16:9.  auto           = Automatically switch between 4:3 and 16:9.

       Currently only supported in 625 line modes. A 525 line variant exists and may be supported in future.

       Videocrypt I

       A video scrambling system used by the Sky TV analogue satellite service in the UK in the 1990s. Each line of the image is cut at a point determined by a pseudorandom number generator, then the two
       parts are swapped.

       hacktv supports the following modes:

       free   = Free-access, no subscription card is required to decode.

              conditional = A valid Sky card is required to decode. Sample data from MTV.

       Videocrypt is only compatiable with 625 line PAL modes. This version works best when used with samples rates at multiples of 14MHz.

       Videocrypt II

       A variation of Videocrypt I used throughout Europe. The scrambling method is identical to VC1, but has a higher VBI data rate.

       hacktv supports the following modes:

       free   = Free-access, no subscription card is required to decode.

       Both VC1 and VC2 cannot be used together except if both are in free-access mode.

       Videocrypt S (Simulation)

       A variation of Videocrypt II used on the short lived BBC Select service. This mode uses line-shuffling rather than line cut-and-rotate.

       hacktv supports the following modes:

       free   = Free-access, no subscription card is required to decode.

       This is a simulation and will not work with real hardware.  Audio inversion is not yet supported.

       Nagravision Syster

       Another video scrambling system used in the 1990s in Europe. The video lines are vertically shuffled within a field.

       Syster is only compatible with 625 line PAL modes and does not currently work with most hardware.

       Audio inversion is not yet supported.
