NAME
       XML::XSLT - A perl module for processing XSLT

SYNOPSIS
        use XML::XSLT;

        my $xslt = XML::XSLT->new ($xsl, warnings => 1);

        $xslt->transform ($xmlfile);
        print $xslt->toString;

        $xslt->dispose();

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the W3C's XSLT specification. The goal is full implementation of this spec, but we have not yet achieved that. However, it already works well.  See "XML::XSLT Commands" for
       the current status of each command.

       XML::XSLT makes use of XML::DOM and LWP::Simple, while XML::DOM uses XML::Parser.  Therefore XML::Parser, XML::DOM and LWP::Simple have to be installed properly for XML::XSLT to run.

Specifying Sources
       The stylesheets and the documents may be passed as filenames, file handles regular strings, string references or DOM-trees.  Functions that require sources (e.g. new), will accept either a named
       parameter or simply the argument.

       Either of the following are allowed:

        my $xslt = XML::XSLT->new($xsl);
        my $xslt = XML::XSLT->new(Source => $xsl);

       In documentation, the named parameter `Source' is always shown, but it is never required.

   METHODS
       new(Source => $xml [, %args])
           Returns a new XSLT parser object.  Valid flags are:

           DOMparser_args
             Hashref of arguments to pass to the XML::DOM::Parser object's parse method.

           variables
             Hashref of variables and their values for the stylesheet.

           base
             Base of URL for file inclusion.

           debug
             Turn on debugging messages.

           warnings
             Turn on warning messages.

           indent
             Starting amount of indention for debug messages.  Defaults to 0.

           indent_incr
             Amount to indent each level of debug message.  Defaults to 1.

       open_xml(Source => $xml [, %args])
           Gives the XSLT object new XML to process.  Returns an XML::DOM object corresponding to the XML.

           base
               The base URL to use for opening documents.

           parser_args
               Arguments to pase to the parser.

       open_xsl(Source => $xml, [, %args])
           Gives the XSLT object a new stylesheet to use in processing XML.  Returns an XML::DOM object corresponding to the stylesheet.  Any arguments present are passed to the XML::DOM::Parser.

           base
               The base URL to use for opening documents.

           parser_args
               Arguments to pase to the parser.

       process(%variables)
           Processes the previously loaded XML through the stylesheet using the variables set in the argument.

       transform(Source => $xml [, %args])
           Processes the given XML through the stylesheet.  Returns an XML::DOM object corresponding to the transformed XML.  Any arguments present are passed to the XML::DOM::Parser.

       serve(Source => $xml [, %args])
           Processes the given XML through the stylesheet.  Returns a string containing the result.  Example:

             use XML::XSLT qw(serve);

             $xslt = XML::XSLT->new($xsl);
             print $xslt->serve $xml;

           http_headers
               If true, then prepends the appropriate HTTP headers (e.g. Content-Type, Content-Length);

               Defaults to true.

           xml_declaration
               If true, then the result contains the appropriate <?xml?> header.

               Defaults to true.

           xml_version
               The version of the XML.

               Defaults to 1.0.

           doctype
               The type of DOCTYPE this document is.  Defaults to SYSTEM.

           Get or set the <xsl:output method= attribute.  Valid arguments are 'html', 'text' and 'xml'

       toString
           Returns the result of transforming the XML with the stylesheet as a string.

       to_dom
           Returns the result of transforming the XML with the stylesheet as an XML::DOM object.

       media_type
           Returns the media type (aka mime type) of the object.

       dispose
           Executes the "dispose" method on each XML::DOM object.

DEPRECATIONS
       Methods and interfaces from previous versions that are not documented in this version are deprecated.  Each of these deprecations can still be used but will produce a warning when the  deprecation
       is first used.  You can use the old interfaces without warnings by passing "new()" the flag "use_deprecated".  Example:

        $parser = XML::XSLT->new($xsl, "FILE",
                                 use_deprecated => 1);

       The deprecated methods will disappear by the time a 1.0 release is made.

       The deprecated methods are :

       output_string
         use toString instead

       result_string
         use toString instead

       output
         use toString instead

       result
         use toString instead

       result_mime_type
         use media_type instead

       output_mime_type
         use media_type instead

       result_tree
         use to_dom instead

       output_tree
         use to_dom instead

       transform_document
         use transform instead

       process_project
         use process instead

       open_project
         use "Source" argument to new() and transform instead.

       print_output
         use serve() instead.

BUGS
       Yes.

HISTORY
       Geert  Josten  and  Egon  Willighagen developed and maintained XML::XSLT up to version 0.22.  At that point, Mark Hershberger started moving the project to Sourceforge and began working on it with
       Bron Gondwana.
