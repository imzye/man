NAME
       freight-cache - (re)builds package repositories

SYNOPSIS
       freight cache [-k] [-g email] [-p passphrase file] [-c conf] [-v] [-h] [manager/distro][...]

DESCRIPTION
       freight-cache  converts  each  manager/distro  given into a package repository (only Debian archives are supported currently). The manager indicates the type of repository (again, apt is the only sup‐
       ported value). The distro is an arbitrary string that should match a release of the target operating system (for example, "lenny" or "lucid"). If  none  are  given,  freight-cache  converts  all  man‐
       ager/distro pairs found in $VARLIB.

       Packages are read from the Freight library ($VARLIB in the configuration, see freight(5)) and organized into a working repository in the Freight cache ($VARCACHE in the configuration).

       Serving  the  repositories  is  left  as  an exercise for the reader. The Freight cache is the only directory that needs to be exposed, so create a virtual host with $VARCACHE as its document root and
       everything will be fine.

       From version 0.0.8 onwards, distros in an APT repository no longer share the contents of the pool/. After upgrading to this version and running freight-cache for all your distros, it is safe and  rec‐
       ommended to rm -rf $VARCACHE/pool/main to reset link counts to the proper value.

OPTIONS
       -k, --keep
              Keep unreferenced versions of packages. This is different than keeping multiple versions of a package in the repository, which is supported without any special options.

       -g email, --gpg=email
              Use an alternate GPG key. May be given multiple times.

       -p passphrase file, --passphrase-file=passphrase file
              Use an alternate file containing the GPG key passphrase. This file should obviously be protected and only readable by the user running Freight.

       -a digest algorithm, --digest-algo=digest algorithm
              Message digest algorithm that GPG should use to sign the repository, e.g SHA512

       -c conf, --conf=conf
              Use an alternate configuration file.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode.

       -h, --help
              Show a help message.

FILES
       /etc/freight.conf, ~/.freight.conf, etc/freight.conf, .freight.conf
              The default configuration files. See freight(5).

       $VARCACHE/pubkey.gpg
              The exported public key used for signing each release.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       FREIGHT_CONF
              The pathname of an alternate configuration file. See freight(5).
