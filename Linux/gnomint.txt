NAME
       gnoMint - X.509 Certification Authority management tool for GNOME

SYNOPSIS
       gnomint

DESCRIPTION
       gnoMint  is  a  tool  for easily creating and managing certification authorities. It provides fancy visualization of all the pieces of information that pertain to a CA, such as X.509 certificates,
       CSRs, and CRLs.

       gnoMint is currently capable of managing a CA that emits certificates that are able to authenticate people or machines in VPNs (IPSec or other protocols), secure HTTP communications with  SSL/TLS,
       authenticate and cipher HTTP communications through Web-client certificates, and sign or crypt email messages.
