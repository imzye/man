Mixin::ExtraFields::Param(3pm)                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                      Mixin::ExtraFields::Param(3pm)

NAME
       Mixin::ExtraFields::Param - make your class provide a familiar "param" method

VERSION
       version 0.022

SYNOPSIS
         package Widget::Parametric;
         use Mixin::ExtraFields::Param -fields => { driver => 'HashGuts' };;

         ...

         my $widget = Widget::Parametric->new({ flavor => 'vanilla' });

         printf "%s: %s\n", $_, $widget->param($_) for $widget->param;

DESCRIPTION
       This module mixes in to your class to provide a "param" method like the ones provided by CGI, CGI::Application, and other classes.  It uses Mixin::ExtraFields, which means it can use any
       Mixin::ExtraFields driver to store your data.

       By default, the methods provided are:

       •   param

       •   exists_param

       •   delete_param

       These  methods  are  imported  by  the  "fields"  group,  which  must  be  requested.   If  a  "moniker"  argument  is  supplied, the moniker is used instead of "param".  For more information, see
       Mixin::ExtraFields.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no  promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

METHODS
   param
        my @params = $object->param;        # get names of existing params

        my $value = $object->param('name'); # get value of a param

        my $value = $object->param(name => $value); # set a param's value

        my @values = $object->param(n1 => $v1, n2 => $v2, ...); # set many values

       This method sets or retrieves parameters.
