       - calculate date and time difference
       - add, subtract duration (timeslice) to/from date (time)
       - calculate diff from today and now
       - countdown timer with command piggybacking
       - custom resolution stopwatch
       - non-verbose mode for background timers
       - show current date, time and timezone

EXAMPLES
       1.  Calculate diff from today:

              $ pdd 2014 Jan 15

       2.  Calculate diff from now:

              $ pdd 24:00:00
              $ pdd 0

       3.  Calculate date diff:

              $ pdd -d 1983 jul 3 2014 1 15

       4.  Calculate time diff:

              $ pdd -t 45:50 6:17:33

       5.  Show current date, time and timezone:

              $ pdd

       6.  Specify time with roll-over:

              $ pdd -t 5:80:75 6:17:33

       7.  Add a duration (3 years, 2 months, 1 day) to 28 Feb, 2000:

              $ pdd -d 2000 FEB 28 3 2 1 --add

       8.  Add a timeslice (1 hour 2 mins 3 secs) to 23:45:37:

              $ pdd -t 23:45:37 1:2:3 --add

       9.  Add a duration (3 years, 2 months, 1 day) to today:

              $ pdd 3 2 1 --add

       10. Add a timeslice (1 hour 2 minutes 3 seconds) to now:

              $ pdd 1:2:3 --add

       11. Subtract a duration (1 day) from 1 Mar, 2000:

              $ pdd -d 2000 Mar 01 0 0 1 --sub

       12. Subtract a timeslice (1 sec) from midnight:

              $ pdd -t 00:00:00 0:0:1 --sub

       13. Subtract a duration (3 years, 2 months, 1 day) from today:

              $ pdd 3 2 1 --sub

       14. Subtract a timeslice (1 hour 2 minutes 3 seconds) from now:

              $ pdd 1:2:3 --sub

       15. Show the day of the week on 15 Jan 2014:

              $ pdd --day 2014 Jan 15

       16. Start a countdown timer or stopwatch in quiet mode in the background:

              $ pdd -qs &
              $ pdd -qc 3:0:0 &

           To see the final counter run fg and press Ctrl-C.

       17. Run a command when countdown timer reaches 0:

              $ pdd -c 00:00:5 -r 'ps -aux'
