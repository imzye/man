NAME
       kc2tap - convert KC files to raw KC tape images

SYNOPSIS
       kc2tap <infile> <outfile>

DESCRIPTION
       kc2tap converts the following file types to raw KC tape images

       1) files used by the KC emulator by Arne Fitzenreiter (usually named .TAP)

       2) files used by the GEMINI-SOFT KC emulator (usually named .GPF for machine code files and .GBF for basic files)

       3) BASIC files (usually named .SSS)

       4)  KC  image  files that contain the data written by the KC tape routines without block number and checksum (usually named .KCC or .KCB where the .KCB files are BASIC files with an autostart
       routine)
