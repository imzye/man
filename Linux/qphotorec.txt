NAME
       qphotorec - Recover lost files from harddisk, digital camera and cdrom

SYNOPSIS
       qphotorec

DESCRIPTION
          QPhotoRec  is a GUI file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from Hard Disks and CDRom and lost pictures (Photo Recovery) from digital cam‐
       era memory. QPhotoRec ignores the filesystem and goes after the underlying data, so it'll work even if your media's filesystem is severely damaged or formatted. PhotoRec is safe to use, it will  never
       attempt to write to the drive or memory support you are about to recover lost data from.
          For more information on how to use, please visit the wiki pages on www.cgsecurity.org
