NAME
       Boost::Geometry::Utils - Bindings for the Boost Geometry library

VERSION
       version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
           use Boost::Geometry::Utils qw(polygon linestring polygon_linestring_intersection);

           my $square = [  # ccw
               [10, 10],
               [20, 10],
               [20, 20],
               [10, 20],
           ];
           my $hole_in_square = [  # cw
               [14, 14],
               [14, 16],
               [16, 16],
               [16, 14],
           ];
           my $polygon = polygon($square, $hole_in_square);
           my $linestring = linestring([ [5, 15], [30, 15] ]);

           my $intersection = polygon_linestring_intersection($polygon, $linestring);

           # $intersection is:
           # [
           #     [ [10, 15], [14, 15] ],
           #     [ [16, 15], [20, 15] ],
           # ]

ABSTRACT
       This module provides bindings to perform some geometric operations using the Boost Geometry library. It does not aim at providing full bindings for such library, and that's why I left the
       Boost::Geometry namespace free. I'm unsure about the optimal architectural for providing full bindings, but I'm interested in such a project -- so, if you have ideas please get in touch with me.

       Warning: the API could change in the future.

METHODS
   polygon_linestring_intersection
       Performs an intersection between the supplied polygon and linestring, and returns an arrayref of linestrings (represented as arrayrefs of points).  Note that such an intersection is also called
       clipping.

   polygon_multi_linestring_intersection
       Same as polygon_linestring_intersection but it accepts a multilinestring object to perform multiple clippings in a single batch.

   multi_polygon_multi_linestring_intersection
       Same as polygon_multi_linestring_intersection but it accepts a multipolygon object to perform multiple clippings in a single batch.

   multi_linestring_multi_polygon_difference
       Performs a difference between the supplied multilinestring and the supplied multipolygon. It returns a multilinestring object.

   polygon_to_wkt
       Converts one or more arrayref(s) of points to a WKT representation of a polygon (with holes).

   linestring_to_wkt
       Converts an arrayref of points to a WKT representation of a multilinestring.

   wkt_to_multilinestring
       Parses a MULTILINESTRING back to a Perl data structure.

   linestring_simplify
       Accepts an arrayref of points representing a linestring and a numeric tolerance and returns an arrayref of points representing the simplified linestring.

   multi_linestring_simplify
       Accepts an arrayref of arrayrefs of points representing a multilinestring and a numeric tolerance and returns an arrayref of arrayrefs of points representing the simplified linestrings.

   point_covered_by_polygon
       Accepts a point and an arrayref of points representing a polygon and returns true or false according to the 'cover_by' strategy.

   point_covered_by_multi_polygon
       Same as above but accepts a multipolygon arrayref.

   point_within_polygon
       Accepts a point and an arrayref of points representing a polygon and returns true or false according to the 'within' strategy.

   point_within_multi_polygon
       Same as above but accepts a multipolygon arrayref.

   linestring_length
       Returns length of a linestring.

   polygon_centroid
       Returns the centroid point of a given polygon.

   linestring_centroid
       Returns the centroid point of a given linestring.

   multi_linestring_centroid
       Returns the centroid point of a given multi_linestring.

   correct_polygon
       Corrects the orientation(s) of the given polygon.

   correct_multi_polygon
       Corrects the orientation(s) of the given multi_polygon.

   polygon_area
       Returns the area of the given polygon.

       Thanks to mauke and mst (Matt S. Trout (cpan:MSTROUT) <mst@shadowcat.co.uk>) for their valuable help in getting this to compile under Windows (MinGW) too.  Thanks to Mark Hindness for his work on
       data types conversion.
