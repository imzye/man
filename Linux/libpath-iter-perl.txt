NAME
       Path::Iter - Simple Efficient Path Iteration

VERSION
       This document describes Path::Iter version 0.2

SYNOPSIS
           use Path::Iter;

           my $fetch = Path::Iter::get_iterator('foo');

           while ( my $next_path = $fetch->() ) {
               # do something with $next_path
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Iterate through the contents of a given path without having to build the entire list first.

INTERFACE
   Path::Iter::get_iterator()
       This returns an code reference that when called returns the next path.

       When there are no more (or a directory can't be opened and you have told it to stop as soon as that happens) it returns false.

       It takes one or more paths to process and an optional argument hashref as the last argument (See "%ARGS")

       The paths returned contain the initial argument and its contents (if any).

       Assuming 'foo' in the SYNOPSIS:

           is a symlink:   you'd iterate through foo
           is a file:      you'd iterate through foo
           is a directory: you'd iterate through foo, foo/bar, foo/wop, foo/bar/baz,

   %ARGS
       These are all optional.

       errors

       This is an array of hashref's where any errors get put.

           my @err;
           my $iter = Path::Iter::get_iterator($path, {errors => \@err});
           while(my $next = $iter->()) {
               ...
           }
           if (@err) {
               ... handle error ...
           }

       The keys for each error in the array are as follows:

           'path'     => $path,
           'function' => 'opendir',
           'args'     => [\*DIR, $path],
           'errno'    => int($!),
           'error'    => int($!) . ": $!",

       stop_when_opendir_fails

       Boolean, when, if true will short circuit the iteration if an opendir() call fails.

       readdir_handler

       A coderef to be used to process and return directory contents (IE readdir() results)

           sub {
               my($working_path, @contents) = @_;

               if ($working_path eq '.data') {
                   @contents = grep !/^\.private\-.*/, @contents; # ignore .private-... files in .data/ dir
               }

               return sort { $a cmp $b } @contents; # return what is left in sorted order
           }

       The first argument is the directory and the rest is its contents.

       The @contents have already had the $working_path prepended.

       It should return the contents how you wish them to appear in the iteration.

       symlink_handler

       By default syminks are not followed.

       This is a coderef that can control how symlinks are handled.

       !! IF YOU ALTER THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR YOU WILL NEED TO CHECK FOR LINK LOOPS AND INFINITE RECURSION !!

       It receives two arguments: the path and a boolean of if it was an initial argument or not.

       If it returns true the path will be followed. If the true value is '2' it will be tranformed into its target.

       !! IF YOU ALTER THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR YOU WILL NEED TO CHECK FOR LINK LOOPS AND INFINITE RECURSION !!

       Assume we have a link named 'link' whose target is 'path':

           sub {
               my ($path, $is_initial_arg) = @_;
               ...
               return; # default behavior = link
           }

           sub {
               my ($path, $is_initial_arg) = @_;
               ...
               return 1; # link link/dir link/file link/dir/etc
           }

           sub {
               my ($path, $is_initial_arg) = @_;
               ...
               return 2; # path path/dir path/file path/dir/etc
           }

       !! IF YOU ALTER THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR YOU WILL NEED TO CHECK FOR LINK LOOPS AND INFINITE RECURSION !!

       initial

       This is a hashref used internally as a lookup of initial args as they are after any initialization.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Throws no warnings or errors of its own. You can catch internal opendir failures. See "errors" and "stop_when_opendir_fails"

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
