ftpcount(1)                 General Commands Manual                ftpcount(1)

NAME
       ftpcount  -  show current number of connections for each proftpd server
       configuration

SYNOPSIS
       ftpcount

DESCRIPTION
       The ftpcount command shows the current number of connections per server
       and  virtualhost/anonymous  configuration  defined  in the proftpd.conf
       file.  Connections spawned by inetd are counted separately  from  those
       created by a master proftpd standalone server.

OPTIONS
       -h,--help   Display  a short usage description, including all available
                   options.

       -f,--file scoreboard-file
                   Specify the full path to proftpd's run-time scoreboard file
                   (configured    via    the   ScoreboardFile   directive   in
                   proftpd.conf ).  If proftpd's default  directory  has  been
                   changed  via this directive, ftpcount must either be recom‐
                   piled or  this  option  must  be  used  in  order  to  find
                   proftpd's scoreboard.

       -S,--server server-name
                   Specify  the  ServerName  for  a specific virtual host.  If
                   used, ftpcount will only show the  session  count  for  the
                   given virtual host.
