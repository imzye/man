NAME
       sml - an interactive Standard ML system

SYNOPSIS
       sml [SML-OPTIONS] [OPTIONS] [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       It is an incremental, interactive compiler that accepts declarations and expressions to be evaluated from standard input.

OPTIONS
       @SMLload=IMAGE
           specifies heap image

       @SMLrun=RUNTIME
           specifies runtime system

       @SMLversion
           echo the version of SML/NJ to standard output and then exit

       @SMLsuffix
           echo the heap suffix for the system to standard output and then exit

       @SMLalloc=SIZE
           Specify the prefered sice of the

       @SMLcmdname=NAME
           set the command name; this is the value returned by CommandLine.name().

       @SMLverbose
           show heap image load progress

       @SMLquiet
           load heap image silently (default)

       @SMLobjects
           show list of executable objects

       @SMLdebug=FILE
           write debugging info to file

       -Cctl=value
           set the control ctl to value.

       -Dname=value
           define the CM variable name to have the given value.

       -D'name
           define the CM variable name to have the value 1.

       -Uname
           remove any definition of the CM variable name.

       -H
           produce complete help listing

       -h
           produce minimal help listing

       -hlevel
           help with obscurity limit

       -S
           list all the controls along with their default value

       -slevel
           limited list of settings. The number of levels of the control heirarchy is controled by level, with 0 printing just the root of the heirarchy.

           list all the controls along with their corresponding environment variables

       -elevel
           limited list of environment variables; The number of levels of the control heirarchy is controled by level, with 0 printing just the root of the heirarchy.

       -m
           switch to CM.make

       -a
           switch to CM.autoload; default

       file.cm
           run CM.make or CM.autoload on file.cm and then return to the SML prompt. Which command is run is determined by the -m and -a flags.

       file.sig
           execute usefile.sig before entering the SML top-level loop.

       file.sml
           (use) execute usefile.sml before entering the SML top-level loop.

       file.fun
           (use) execute usefile.fun before entering the SML top-level loop.
