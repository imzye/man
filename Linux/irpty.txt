IRPTY(1)                         User Commands                        IRPTY(1)

NAME
       irpty - Pseudo tty driver.

SYNOPSIS
       irpty [options] config_file -- program [args ...]

DESCRIPTION
       irpty  connects to lircd to receive infrared codes and converts them to
       key strokes. E.g. type irpty ~/.config/lircrc --  workbone  to  control
       the  CD-player  program  workbone. Of course you will have to create an
       appropriate config file for this purpose first. The config string  will
       be  passed  to  the  desired  application. Note that you can use escape
       sequences to specify non printable characters. Have a look at the .lir‐
       crc file format description for details.
