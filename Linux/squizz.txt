NAME
       squizz - Sequence format checker" 4

SYNOPSIS
       squizz [-AShlnsv] [-c format] [-f format] file

OPTIONS
       Following command line options are allowed:

       -A  Restrict detection/verification to alignment formats (conflict with -S option).

       -S  Restrict detection/verification to sequence formats (conflict with -A option).

       -c format
           Convert detected sequence/alignment into format. This option implies strict alignment checking.

       -f format
           Assume input format is format. Do not try to detect the format, just verify that the given one is correct.

       -h  Display help message and exit.

       -l  List all supported formats.

       -n  Count  and  report  detected  entries.  This  option  is only available when the detection is restricted to a single type (with -A or -S options) and strict checks (without -s option) are
           enabled.

       -s  Disable strict format checks (enabled by default).

       -v  Display version information and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       squizz is a sequence format file checker, but it has some conversion capabilities too.

       squizz can detect the most common sequence and alignment formats :

       * CODATA, EMBL, FASTA, GCG, GDE, GENBANK, IG, NBRF (pir), RAW, and SWISSPROT.

       * CLUSTAL, FASTA, MSF, NEXUS, PHYLIP (interleaved and sequential) and STOCKHOLM.

       squizz can do some conversions too, if the format the input format is supported. Only 3 types are available : sequence to sequence, alignment to alignment, and alignment to sequence (the last
       one, sequence to alignment, require multiple alignments algorithms and cannot be handled with formatting tools).

       Strict format checks validate the previously detected objects, by making some sanity checks:

       - sequence strings must exists.
       - alignment is made of more than one sequence.
       - alignment sequence strings must have the same length.
       - alignment sequence names must exists, and be unique.
