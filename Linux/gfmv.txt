NAME
       gfmv - move (rename) Gfarm file

SYNOPSIS
       gfmv [options] src dest-file

       gfmv [options] src... dest-dir

DESCRIPTION
       In its first form, gfmv renames a Gfarm file from src to dest-file.

       In its second form, gfmv moves Gfarm files, which are specified by the src parameter, to under the existing dest-dir.

OPTIONS
       -f
           Do not prompt before overwriting not-writable files.

       -i
           Prompt before overwriting.

       -x
           Do not allow moving a directory between different directory quota settings. If this option is not specified, gfmv tries to emulate such moving by recursively creating the directory hierarchy.
