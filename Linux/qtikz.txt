NAME
       qtikz - editor for the TikZ language

SYNOPSIS
       qtikz [url | file]

DESCRIPTION
       QtikZ  is  a small application to assist in the creation of diagrams and drawings  using the TikZ macros from the LaTeX package "pgf".  It consists of a text editor pane in which the TikZ code for
       the drawing is edited and a preview pane showing the drawing as rendered by latex. The preview pane can be updated in real-time.  Common drawing tools, options and styles are  available  from  the
       menus to assist the coding process.

       qtikz accepts no command line options other than the name of the file to open.

SEE ALSO
       Full user documentation is available through Help -> QtikZ Handbook.  You can also run `assistant -collectionFile /usr/share/qtikz/documentation/qtikz.qhc' from the command-line.
