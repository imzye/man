NAME
       x2goversion - Retrieve Code Versions of X2Go Server Components

SYNOPSIS
       x2goversion [<x2go-component>]

DESCRIPTION
       x2goversion allows one to retrieve code versions of X2Go server components.

       If the [<x2go-component>] parameter is omitted then a list of all available X2Go server component names and versions is listed.

       If an X2Go component is specified with the [<x2go-component>] parameter, then only the component's version is printed to stdout.

       The x2goversion tool can be used by X2Go client implementations to query server-side versions of X2Go components.

RETURN VALUES
       x2goversion reports X2Go component version information to stdout.

       As exitcode x2goversion always returns 0.
