NAME
       rosbuilder - execute appropriate build commands for ROS packages

SYNOPSIS
       rosbuilder [options]

DESCRIPTION
       rosbuilder is invoked internally by the ros buildsystem. You can use this in your debian/rules with dh --buildsystem=ros.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --sourcedir DIR
              root directory of the source package

       --search-depth N
              limit maximum depth to N directory levels when searching for packages recursively (default: 2)

       --unlimited-search-depth
              do not limit maximum depth when searching for packages

       --builddir DIR
              build directory

       --destdir DIR
              install staging directory (default: debian/tmp)

       --install-prefix DIR
              install prefix (default: /usr)

       --verbose
              make verbose output

       --detect
              detect if ROS packages are to be built

       --build-types
              list detected build types

       --build-order
              list packages in build order

ENVIRONMENT
       The rosbuilder behavior can be customized by setting various environment variables in debian/rules.

       Remember to prefix the declarations with the export keyword, or the variables will not propagate to the environment properly.

   General behavior
       ROS_DESTDIR
              override the location for the staged installation

       ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX
              override the install prefix

       ROS_IGNORE_TEST_RESULTS
              do not fail the build if the dh_auto_test step fails for the listed packages. If set to the special value 1, test failures for all packages will be ignored.

       ROS_PYTHON_VERSION
              set to 2 or 3 to force the respective Python version for the build

       ROS_SKIP_PACKAGES
              do not build the listed packages at all

       ROS_SKIP_TESTS
              skip tests for the listed packages. If set to the special value 1, all package tests will be skipped. This is equivalent to passing nocheck via DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

   Customizing dh_auto_*
       For  the  clean, configure, build, test, and install steps, there are hooks to run additional commands before and after each step.  Also, either additional arguments can be passed to the dh_auto_*
       helpers or the whole step can be replaced by a different command.

       ROS_step_ARGS
              pass additional arguments to a dh step. The placeholder step stands for one of CONFIGURE, BUILD, TEST, INSTALL, or CLEAN, all in upper-case.

       ROS_step_type_ARGS
              pass additional arguments to a dh step, but only for packages with a particular build type. Known build types are AMENT_CMAKE, AMENT_PYTHON, CATKIN, and CMAKE.

       ROS_step_WRAPPER
              wrap a dh step with another command, i.e., prepend the command line with the given command and its arguments. The wrapper command is expected to execute the remainder of its  arguments.  An
              example for a wrapper is xvfb-run, which can be used to run tests in a virtual X server.

       ROS_step_type_WRAPPER
              wrap a dh step with another command, but only for a particular build type.

       ROS_EXECUTE_BEFORE_step
              execute additional commands before a dh step. The value is subject to some variable expansion (see below) and treated as shell command line.

       ROS_EXECUTE_AFTER_step
              execute additional commands before a dh step

       ROS_EXECUTE_BEFORE_step_type
              execute additional commands before a dh step for packages of build type type.

       ROS_EXECUTE_AFTER_step_type
              execute additional commands after a dh step for packages of build type type.

       ROS_EXECUTE_CUSTOM_step
              replace the dh step by a custom shell command line. This will replace the entire command line, so any COMMAND_PREFIX will be ignored as well.

       ROS_EXECUTE_CUSTOM_step_type
              replace the dh step for packages of build type type by a custom shell command line. This will replace the entire command line, so any WRAPPER will be ignored as well.

   Variable expansions for shell command lines
       rosbuilder supports a few placeholders in custom command lines. All values will be quoted as required to prevent spurious shell expansions.

       {dir}  the source directory of the currently processed ROS package

       {build_dir}
              the temporary build directory of the currently processed ROS package

       {destdir}
              the location for the staged installation

       {homedir}
              the temporary directory that is used for ROS_HOME during building and testing

       {package}
              the name of the currently processed ROS package

       {package!id}
              the sanitized package name, suitable for use as variable identifier

       {version}
              the version number of the currently procssed ROS package

       {build_type}
              the build type of the currently processed ROS package

       {prefix}
              the install prefix
