NAME
       App::Git::Autofixup - create fixup commits for topic branches

SYNOPSIS
           git-autofixup [<options>] [<revision>]

DESCRIPTION
       git-autofixup parses hunks of changes in the working directory out of "git diff" output and uses "git blame" to assign those hunks to commits in "<revision>..HEAD", which will typically represent
       a topic branch, and then creates fixup commits to be used with "git rebase --interactive --autosquash". It is assumed that hunks near changes that were previously committed to the topic branch are
       related. "<revision>" defaults to "git merge-base --fork-point HEAD @{upstream} || git merge-base HEAD @{upstream}", but this will only work if the current branch has an upstream/tracking branch.
       See "git help revisions" for info about how to specify revisions.

       If any changes have been staged to the index using "git add", then git-autofixup will only consider staged hunks when trying to create fixup commits. A temporary index is used to create any
       resulting commits.

       By default a hunk will be included in a fixup commit if all the lines in the hunk's context blamed on topic branch commits refer to the same commit, so there's no ambiguity about which commit the
       hunk corresponds to. If there is ambiguity the assignment behaviour used under "--strict 1" will be used to attempt to resolve it. If "--strict 1" is given the same topic branch commit must be
       blamed for every removed line and at least one of the lines adjacent to each added line, and added lines must not be adjacent to lines blamed on other topic branch commits. All the same
       restrictions apply when "--strict 2" is given, but each added line must be surrounded by lines blamed on the same topic branch commit.

       For example,  the added line in the hunk below is adjacent to lines committed by commits "99f370af" and "a1eadbe2". If these are both topic branch commits then it's ambiguous which commit the
       added line is fixing up and the hunk will be ignored.

           COMMIT  |LINE|HEAD                          |WORKING DIRECTORY
           99f370af|   1|first line                    | first line
                   |    |                              |+added line
           a1eadbe2|   2|second line                   | second line

       But if that second line were instead blamed on an upstream commit (denoted by "^"), the hunk would be added to a fixup commit for "99f370af":

           99f370af|   1|first line                    | first line
                   |    |                              |+added line
           ^       |   2|second line                   | second line

       Output similar to this example can be generated by setting verbosity to 2 or greater by using the verbosity option multiple times, eg. "git-autofixup -vv", and can be helpful in determining how a
       hunk will be handled.

       git-autofixup is not to be used mindlessly. Always inspect the created fixup commits to ensure hunks have been assigned correctly, especially when used on a working directory that has been changed
       with a mix of fixups and new work.

OPTIONS
       -h  Show usage.

       --help
           Show manpage.

       --version
           Show version.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity. Can be used up to two times.

       -c N, --context N
           Change the number of context lines "git diff" uses around hunks. Default: 3. This can change how hunks are assigned to fixup commits, especially with "--strict 0".

       -s N, --strict N
           Set how strict git-autofixup is about assigning hunks to fixup commits. Default: 0. Strictness levels are described under DESCRIPTION.

       -g ARG, --gitopt ARG
           Specify  option  for  git.  Can  be used multiple times. Useful for testing, to override config options that break git-autofixup, or to override global diff options to tweak what git-autofixup
           considers a hunk. Deprecated in favor of "GIT_CONFIG_{COUNT,KEY,VALUE}" environment variables; see "git help config".

           Note ARG won't be wordsplit, so to give multiple arguments,  such  as  for  setting  a  config  option  like  "-c  diff.algorithm",  this  option  must  be  used  multiple  times:  "-g  -c  -g
           diff.algorithm=patience".

       -e, --exit-code
           Use more detailed exit codes:

           0:  All hunks have been assigned.

           1:  Only some hunks have been assigned.

           2:  No hunks have been assigned.

           3:  There was nothing to be assigned.

           255:
               Unexpected error occurred.

INSTALLATION
       If  cpan  is  available,  run  "cpan  -i  App::Git::Autofixup".  Otherwise,  copy  git-autofixup  to  a  directory in "PATH" and ensure it has execute permissions. It can then be invoked as either
       "git-autofixup" or "git autofixup", since git searches "PATH" for appropriately named binaries.

       Git is distributed with Perl 5 for platforms not expected to already have it installed, but installing modules with cpan requires other tools that might not be available, such as make. This script
       has no dependencies outside of the standard library, so it is hoped that it works on any platform that Git does without much trouble.

       Requires a git supporting "commit --fixup": 1.7.4 or later.

BUGS/LIMITATIONS
       git-autofixup works on Windows, but be careful not to use a perl compiled for cygwin with a git compiled for msys, such as Git for Windows <https://gitforwindows.org/>. It can be used from Git for
       Windows' "Git Bash" or "Git CMD", or you can install git using Cygwin's package manager and use git-autofixup from Cygwin. Note that while every release gets tested on Cygwin via the CPAN  Testers
       network,  testing  with  Git  for  Windows  requires more effort since it's a constrained environment; thus it doesn't get tested as often. If you run into any issues, please report them on GitHub
       <https://github.com/torbiak/git-autofixup/issues>.

       If a topic branch adds some lines in one commit and subsequently removes some of them in another, a hunk in the working directory that re-adds those lines will  be  assigned  to  fixup  the  first
       commit, and during rebasing they'll be removed again by the later commit.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       git-autofixup  was inspired by a description of hg absorb <https://bitbucket.org/facebook/hg-experimental/src/38d6e5d7f355f58330cd707059baac38d69a1210/hgext3rd/absorb/__init__.py> in the Mercurial
       Sprint     Notes     <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.version-control/nh4fITFlEMk>.     While      I      was      working      on      it      I      found      git-superfixup
       <https://gist.github.com/oktal3700/cafe086b49c89f814be4a7507a32a3f7>, by oktal3700, which was helpful to examine.
