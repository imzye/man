NAME
       openlayer-config - - script to get information about the installed version of libopenlayer.

SYNOPSIS
       openlayer-config [--example=that] [{--libs}] [{--cflags}] [{--version}]

DESCRIPTION
       openlayer-config is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the
       openlayer library. It is intended to be used on Unix systems instead of the simple "-lopenlayer" call.

OPTIONS
       --libs
           Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an openlayer program.

       --cflags
           Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile an openlayer program.

       --version
           Print version information.

EXAMPLE
       gcc -o myprogram myprogram.o `openlayer-config --libs`
