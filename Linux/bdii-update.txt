NAME
       bdii-update - the bdii update process

SYNOPSIS
       bdii-update [-d ] -c config-file

DESCRIPTION
       The bdii-update process obtains the LDIF by reading files found the ldif directory, running providers found in the provider directory and running plugins found in the plugin
        directory.   The  difference  between providers and plugins is that providers return complete entries and plugins provide modifications to existing entries.  The process can be run either as a daemon
       that periodically syncronizes an LDAP database or as a command that will print the result to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -d     Run as a daemon process.

       -c config
              The configuration to use.

FILES
       /etc/bdii.conf
              The default configuration file.
