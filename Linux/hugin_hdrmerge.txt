NAME
       hugin_hdrmerge - Merge overlapping images

SYNOPSIS
       hugin_hdrmerge [options] -o output.exr input-files

DESCRIPTION
       TODO.

OPTIONS
       -o prefix
           Output file

       -m mode
           Merge mode, can be one of: avg, avg_slow, khan (default), if avg, no -i, -s, or -d options apply

       -i iter
           Number of iterations to execute (default is 1)

       -c  Only consider pixels that are defined in all images (avg mode only)

       -s file
           Debug files to save each iteration, can be one of:

           a - all debug files (can only be used alone)
           w - calculated weights from each iteration
           r - result image from each iteration
           s - source images before processing

           If verbose >= 3, all debug files are output unless specified

       -a calcs
           Apply one or more advanced calculations, can be one or more of:

           b - biasing weights logarithmically
           c - choose pixels with highest weight instead of averaging (overrides options -a b and -a d)
           d - choose a pixel with the highest weight instead of averaging when all pixel weights are within 10% of each other
           h - favour a high signal to noise ratio
           i - ignore alpha channel
       -e  Export each initial weight to <input_file_paths>_iw.<ext>

       -l  Load a previously exported initial weight with respect to the input file names

           NOTE: if both -e and -l options are on, the program will calculate and save the initial weights, then wait until user indicates that it can continue by loading the previously saved weights

       -v  Verbose, print progress messages, repeat for even more verbose output

       -h  Display help summary.
