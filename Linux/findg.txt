NAME
       findg - locates calls to all entries in pre-GKS NCAR Graphics

SYNOPSIS
       findg <fortran-file

DESCRIPTION
       findg  reads  an  input  FORTRAN file, fortran-file, from the standard input and prints out those lines (along with line numbers) which contain calls to old plotting entries from the pre-GKS NCAR plot
       package.  In conversions to GKS, the user should examine these calls for possible changes.  Many entries will require no change.  For details on needed changes, see the "Conversion Guide"  section  of
       the Version 2.00 User's Guide.

       If the single character $ is read in column 1 of any input line, then a complete list of the entry points being searched for is printed, and execution is terminated.
