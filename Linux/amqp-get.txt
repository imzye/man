NAME
       amqp-get - Get a message from a queue on an AMQP server

SYNOPSIS
       amqp-get [OPTION...] {-q queue name}

DESCRIPTION
       amqp-get attempts to consume a single message from a queue on an AMQP server, and exits. Unless the queue was empty, the body of the resulting message is sent to standard output.

OPTIONS
       -q, --queue=queue name
           The name of the queue to consume messages from.

EXIT STATUS
       If the queue is not empty, and a message is successfully retrieved, the exit status is 0. If an error occurs, the exit status is 1. If the queue is found to be empty, the exit status is 2.

EXAMPLES
       Get a message from the queue “myqueue”, and display its body on standard output:

               $ amqp-get -q myqueue
