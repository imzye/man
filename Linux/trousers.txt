NAME
       tcsd.conf - configuration file for the trousers TCS daemon.

DESCRIPTION
       This file, by default /etc/tcsd.conf is read by the trousers TCSD daemon, tcsd (see tcsd(8)). The tcsd.conf file that is installed by trousers contains all the default options, commented out.

OPTIONS
       port The port that TCSD will listen on for connections, local and remote, from applications.

       num_threads  The maximum number of threads that the TCSD will spawn simultaneously to service applications. After num_threads threads have been spawned, any application that attempts to connect to
       the TCSD will receive an error.

       system_ps_file The location of the system persistent storage file. The system persistent storage file holds keys and data across restarts of the TCSD and system reboots.

       firmware_log_file Path to the file containing the current firmware PCR event log data. The interface to this log is usually provided by the TPM device driver.

       kernel_log_file Path to the file containing the current kernel PCR event log data. By default, this data will be parsed in the format provided by the Integrity Measurement Architecture LSM.

       firmware_pcrs A list of PCR indices that are manipulated only by the system firmware and therefore are not extended or logged by the TCSD. Applications that call Tcsi_PcrExtend on PCRs listed here
       will receive an error.

       kernel_pcrs A list of PCR indices that are manipulated only by the kernel and therefore are not extended or logged by the TCSD. Applications that call Tcsi_PcrExtend on PCRs listed here  will  re‐
       ceive an error.

       platform_cred Path to the platform credential for your TPM.  Your TPM manufacturer may have provided you with a set of credentials (certificates) that should be used when creating identities using
       your TPM. When a user of your TPM makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as part of that process. See the 1.1b TPM Main specification section 9.3 for information on this process.

       conformance_cred Path to the conformance credential for your TPM.  Your TPM manufacturer may have provided you with a set of credentials (certificates) that should be used when creating identities
       using  your  TPM.  When  a  user  of  your TPM makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as part of that process. See the 1.1b TPM Main specification section 9.3 for information on this
       process.

       endorsement_cred Path to the endorsement credential for your TPM.  Your TPM manufacturer may have provided you with a set of credentials (certificates) that should be used when creating identities
       using your TPM. When a user of your TPM makes an identity, this credential will be encrypted as part of that process. See the 1.1b TPM Main  specification  section  9.3  for  information  on  this
       process.

       remote_ops A list of TCS commands which will be allowed to be executed on this machine's TCSD by TSP's on non-local hosts (over the internet). By default, access to all operations is denied.

       host_platform_class  Determines  the TCG specification of the host's platform class. This refers to one of the specifications contained in the TCG web site. The default is PC specification version
       1.2 .

       all_platform_classes Specifies all the TCG defined platforms associated with the host platform. The host_platform_class must not be defined here. By default, all platforms but  the  host  platform
       are associated.

EXAMPLE
              port = 30003
              num_threads = 10
              system_ps_file = /usr/local/var/tpm/system.data
              firmware_log_file = /proc/tpm/firmware_events
              kernel_log_file = /proc/tcg/measurement_events
              firmware_pcrs = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
              kernel_pcrs = 10,11
              platform_cred = /usr/local/var/lib/tpm/platform.cert
              conformance_cred = /usr/local/var/lib/tpm/conformance.cert
              endorsement_cred = /usr/local/var/lib/tpm/endorsement.cert
              remote_ops = create_key,random
              host_platform_class = server_12
              all_platform_classes = pc_11,pc_12,mobile_12
