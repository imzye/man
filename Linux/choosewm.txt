NAME
       choosewm - Select a window manager to be used.

SYNOPSIS
       choosewm [-f] [-p] [-t]
       choosewm [-t] -c

DESCRIPTION
       choosewm  presents a window to let the user choose a window manager to start.  By default it shows everything registered as window manager at the Debian menu system, but it allows global and local
       configuration to change that data.

OPTIONS
       -c, --config
              Allow the user to change the default.  Beside telling choosewm to not start the chosen window manger, this mostly changes the text of some buttons and labels

       -f, --force
              Show the selection window unconditionally.

       -p, --print
              Do not start the window-manager, but print it to stdout.

       -t, --text
              Do not ask by opening an X11 window, but ask on the terminal.  Needs a terminal as stdin.  This is activated by default with -c and DISPLAY not set.

CONFIG FILES
       After reading /var/lib/choosewm/windowmanagers, treating anything before a equal (=) sign in a line a name and everything after that as window manager path, choosewm checks  /etc/X11/choosewm/con‐
       fig  and  after  that  by default .choosewm/config in the user's $HOME-directory.  Lines containing only spaces or starting with a # are ignored.  Every other line may contain one of the following
       commands:

       add: name=path
              Add an additional window manager to the list. name will be shown in the list, path will be started.

              This option is only useful to add something that should be only added to this list.  If you installed a window manager by hand, please consider to register it in the  Debian  menu  instead.
              That way all potent enough window managers will be able to offer switching to that window manager by menu.

       remove: path
              Do not list the window manager with path in the list to choose from.

       default: defaultwindowmanagerpath
              Use the window manager defaultwindowmanagerpath as default, when no last selection of the window manager is available.

       userconf: filename
              Read the user's config from $(HOME)/filename.  If filename is -, no user config is read.

              Default is .choosewm/config

       dontaskfile: filename
              Create the file $(HOME)/filename, if the user selected to not be asked about the window manger, and do not ask if this file is present.  (Unless -f is command line argument.)

              Default is .choosewm/dontask

       lastdecisionfile: filename
              Read the last decision from the file $(HOME)/filename, and save the decision of the user there.

              Default is .choosewm/lastwm

       inalias: oldold=newpath
              If the last decision is oldpath, change it to newpath.

       askalias: oldold=newpath
              If the last decision is oldpath, change it to newpath and force showing of the selection window.

       outalias: path=output
              If the user has chosen path as window manager, write instead output to the file as new last decision.

       sTAG: text
              Are used to set strings to be shown to the user in labels, buttons or headers.  The CONFIGTAG variants are used with -c.

              The following are the currently definied Tags and their default values:
              sCONFIGHEADER: Choose default Window Manager
              sHEADER: Choose Window Manager
              sCONFIGWELCOME: Please choose the default window manager and whether to reask at start time.
              sWELCOME: Welcome, please select a Window manager to use.

              sASK: _Ask again at every login

              sSELECT: _Start
