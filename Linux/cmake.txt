NAME
       cpack - CPack Command-Line Reference

SYNOPSIS
          cpack [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
       The cpack executable is the CMake packaging program.  It generates installers and source packages in a variety of formats.

       For  each  installer  or  package format, cpack has a specific backend, called "generator". A generator is responsible for generating the required inputs and invoking the specific package creation
       tools. These installer or package generators are not to be confused with the makefile generators of the cmake command.

       All supported generators are specified in the cpack-generators manual.  The command cpack --help prints a list of generators supported for the target platform.  Which of them are to be used can be
       selected through the CPACK_GENERATOR variable or through the command-line option -G.

       The cpack program is steered by a configuration file written in the CMake language. Unless chosen differently through the command-line option --config, the file CPackConfig.cmake  in  the  current
       directory is used.

       In the standard CMake workflow, the file CPackConfig.cmake is generated by the cmake executable, provided the CPack module is included by the project's CMakeLists.txt file.

OPTIONS
       -G <generators>
              <generators>  is  a semicolon-separated list of generator names.  cpack will iterate through this list and produce package(s) in that generator's format according to the details provided in
              the CPackConfig.cmake configuration file.  If this option is not given, the CPACK_GENERATOR variable determines the default set of generators that will be used.

       -C <configs>
              Specify the project configuration(s) to be packaged (e.g. Debug, Release, etc.), where <configs> is a semicolon-separated list.  When the CMake project uses a multi-configuration  generator
              such as Xcode or Visual Studio, this option is needed to tell cpack which built executables to include in the package.  The user is responsible for ensuring that the configuration(s) listed
              have already been built before invoking cpack.

       -D <var>=<value>
              Set a CPack variable.  This will override any value set for <var> in the input file read by cpack.

       --config <configFile>
              Specify the configuration file read by cpack to provide the packaging details.  By default, CPackConfig.cmake in the current directory will be used.

       -V, --verbose
              Run cpack with verbose output.  This can be used to show more details from the package generation tools and is suitable for project developers.

       --debug
              Run cpack with debug output.  This option is intended mainly for the developers of cpack itself and is not normally needed by project developers.

       --trace
              Put the underlying cmake scripts in trace mode.

       --trace-expand
              Put the underlying cmake scripts in expanded trace mode.

       -P <packageName>
              Override/define the value of the CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME variable used for packaging.  Any value set for this variable in the CPackConfig.cmake file will then be ignored.

       -R <packageVersion>
              Override/define  the  value  of  the  CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION  variable  used  for  packaging.   It  will override a value set in the CPackConfig.cmake file or one automatically computed from
              CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR, CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.

       -B <packageDirectory>
              Override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY, which controls the directory where CPack will perform its packaging work.  The resultant package(s) will be created at this location by default  and
              a _CPack_Packages subdirectory will also be created below this directory to use as a working area during package creation.

       --vendor <vendorName>
              Override/define CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR.

       --preset <presetName>
              Use a preset from cmake-presets(7).

       --list-presets
              List presets from cmake-presets(7).
