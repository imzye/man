NAME
       zeek - passive network traffic analyzer

SYNOPSIS
       zeek  [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Zeek  is  primarily  a security monitor that inspects all traffic on a link in depth for signs of suspicious activity. More generally, however, Zeek supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks
       even outside of the security domain, including performance measurements and helping with trouble-shooting.

       Zeek comes with built-in functionality for a range of analysis and detection tasks, including detecting malware by interfacing to external registries, reporting  vulnerable  versions  of  software
       seen on the network, identifying popular web applications, detecting SSH brute-forcing, validating SSL certificate chains, among others.

       You must have the necessary permissions to access to the files or interfaces specified.

OPTIONS
       <file> policy file, or read stdin

       -a, --parse-only
              exit immediately after parsing scripts

       -b, --bare-mode
              don't load scripts from the base/ directory

       -d, --debug-policy
              activate policy file debugging

       -e, --exec <zeek code>
              augment loaded policies by given code

       -f, --filter <filter>
              tcpdump filter

       -h, --help|-?
              command line help

       -i, --iface <interface>
              read from given interface

       -p, --prefix <prefix>
              add given prefix to policy file resolution

       -r, --readfile <readfile>
              read from given tcpdump file

       -s, --rulefile <rulefile>
              read rules from given file

       -t, --tracefile <tracefile>
              activate execution tracing

       -w, --writefile <writefile>
              write to given tcpdump file

       -x, --print-state <file.bst>
              print contents of state file

       -C, --no-checksums
              When  this  option  is  set,  Zeek  ignores invalid packet checksums and does process the packets. Furthermore, if this option is set Zeek also processes IP packets with a zero total length
              field, which is typically caused by TCP (TCP Segment Offloading) on the NIC.

       -F, --force-dns
              force DNS

       -I, --print-id <ID name>
              print out given ID

       -N, --print-plugins
              print available plugins and exit (-NN for verbose)

       -P, --prime-dns
              prime DNS

       -Q, --time
              print execution time summary to stderr

       -R, --replay <events.bst>
              replay events

       -S, --debug-rules
              enable rule debugging

       -T, --re-level <level>
              set 'RE_level' for rules

       -U, --status-file <file>
              Record process status in file

       -W, --watchdog
              activate watchdog timer

       -X, --zeekygen <cfgfile>
              generate documentation based on config file

       --pseudo-realtime[=<speedup>]
              enable pseudo-realtime for performance evaluation (default 1)

       --load-seeds <file>
              load seeds from given file

       --save-seeds <file>
              save seeds to given file

       The following option is available only when Zeek is built with the --enable-debug configure option:

       -B, --debug <dbgstreams>
              Enable debugging output for selected streams ('-B help' for help)

       The following options are available only when Zeek is built with gperftools support (use the --enable-perftools and --enable-perftools-debug configure options):

       -m, --mem-leaks
              show leaks

       -M, --mem-profile
              record heap

ENVIRONMENT
       ZEEKPATH
              file search path

       ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH
              plugin search path

       ZEEK_PLUGIN_ACTIVATE
              plugins to always activate

       ZEEK_PREFIXES
              prefix list

       ZEEK_DNS_FAKE
              disable DNS lookups

       ZEEK_SEED_FILE
              file to load seeds from

       ZEEK_LOG_SUFFIX
              ASCII log file extension

       ZEEK_PROFILER_FILE
              Output file for script execution statistics

       ZEEK_DISABLE_ZEEKYGEN
              Disable Zeekygen (Broxygen) documentation support

OUTPUT FORMAT
       Output is written in multiple files depending on configuration. The default location is the current directory.

       The output written by Zeek can be formatted in multiple ways using the logging framework.

       The default are files in human-readable (ASCII) format. The data is organized into columns (tab-delimited). The data can be processed using, e.g., the zeek-cut tool.

EXAMPLES
       Read a capture file and generate the default logs:
           # zeek -r test-capture.pcap

       When running on live traffic, Zeek is usually started by running zeekctl. To configure Zeek with an initial configuration, install, and restart:
           # zeekctl deploy

       Note: the zeekctl configuration may need to be updated before first use. Especially the network interface used should be the correct one.
