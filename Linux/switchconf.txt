NAME
       switchconf - Change system configuration to one of many predefined

SYNOPSIS
       switchconf [ -f conf_file ] -help | -list | config_scheme

DESCRIPTION
       switchconf is a command line tool that helps nomad laptop users to easily change their configuration.

OPTIONS
       switchconf  takes only one mandatory argument. If this argument is -help, the command synopsis is output.  If it is -list, a list of all known configuration schemes is returned for the current set
       (found in $conf_top_dirs). If the argument is a configuration scheme, this configuration will be installed on the laptop.

       switchconf can take an optional argument, which must be first, flagged by -f.  This argument specifies the set of configuration schemes to work with.  It names a configuration  file,  with  format
       described below, located on the current directory.  If no optional argument is present, the default file /etc/switchconf/conf is used.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file (default /etc/switchconf/conf) is simple.  The following entries are defined:

       conf_top_dirs
              This specify where are located the configurations schemes.

       dest_dir
              This specify in which top directory you want to install the new configuration. This option is pretty useful if you want to debug your configuration without overwritting the actual one.

       exec_dir_before, exec_dir_after
              This specify the name of the exec directory : all files included will be executed before or after configuration changes

       run_parts
              This specifies the path to the run-parts command which is used to execute the scripts.  Leave it empty to use the internal implementation of run-parts.

       config_method
              This specify the method to use to copy the configuration files, to their places: softlink, hardlink, copy

       /etc/switchconf/conf should be written so it is parsable as a shell script - There should be no spaces between the variable name and its value.

SCHEMES
       You  should create a directory for each configuration scheme you define, including all the files it should set in the system. Inside /etc/switchconf the directories you should create the files in‐
       cluding the full path (i.e., /etc/switchconf/home/etc/network/interfaces for /etc/network/interfaces).

       No scheme should be named as either the exec_dir_before or the exec_dir_after, unless the conf_top_dirs is moved out of its default directory, /etc/switchconf.

       Although it is not really necessary, you should probably ensure that all the files existing in one of the schemes exist on every other scheme, in order to ensure you do not  end  up  in  a  hybrid
       state.

FILES
       /etc/switchconf/conf
              Configuration file.

       /var/lib/misc/switchconf.lastcfg
              Memory file, has the name of the current active scheme

       /var/lock/switchconf
              Lock file.

BUGS
       Actually no bugs are reported.
