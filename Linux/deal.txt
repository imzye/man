NAME
       deal - bridge hand generator

SYNOPSIS
       deal [ -ltv ] [ -e expr ] [ -i condition file ] [ -I format ] [ -s seed ] [ -[NSEW] hand-spec ] [ count ]

DESCRIPTION
       deal is a program to generate bridge hands.

OPTIONS
       -l     Write deals in a "single-line" format.

       -t     Print distribution table and exit.  The distribution table is an ordered list of all possible hand patterns for a single hand.

       -v     Be verbose, print sample count.

       -e expr
              Evaluate the Tcl expression expr.

       -i condition file
              File that defines the hand type to generate or the output format.  (Can be given multiple times.)

       -I format
              Read  hands  from  stdin.  Formats available are: ddline, giblib, line, pbn, smartstack.  You might deal, say, 10,000 hands which satisfy specific criteria, saving them to a file.  Then you
              can use that output for input with deal -I to find out which hands satisfy other constraints.

       -s seed
              Initialize random generator with seed.

       -[NSEW] hand-spec
              Specifies the cards held by the specified hand. The hand-spec should be of the form: "AK8532 - KQ72 A65". Voids must be represented with a '-' character.  hand-spec should be one  argument,
              so the string should be quoted on the command line.

       count  Number of hands to generate, default is 10.
