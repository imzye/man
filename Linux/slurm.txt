NAME
       slurm - yet another network load monitor

SYNOPSIS
       slurm [-hHz] [-csl] [-d delay] -i interface

DESCRIPTION
       slurm is a generic network load monitor which shows device statistics together with a nice ascii graph. Three different types of graphs are supported.

OPTIONS
       -h      Print usage information and quit.

       -H      add hostname to title

       -c      start slurm with classic/combined graph

       -s      start slurm in split graph mode

       -l      start slurm in large split graph mode

       -z      virtually zero traffic counters instead of showing values stored in kernel

       -d delay
               delay between screen updates in seconds (must be between 1 and 300)

       -i interface
               select interface to monitor (required)

KEYS
       slurm supports several different keys for interaction:

       c       switch to classic mode

       s       switch to split graph mode

       l       switch to large graph mode

       L       enable TX/RX led

       m       switch between classic, split and large view

       z       zero counters

       r       redraw screen

       q       quit slurm

BUGS
       Several features of slurm are not supported on certain platforms, i.e.  Interface speed detection is only supported on *BSD. Please check the source code documentation to see if your bug is really
       a bug.  Please report bugs at https://github.com/mattthias/slurm/issues
