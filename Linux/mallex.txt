NAME
       mallex - generate a Malaga run-time lexicon

SYNOPSIS
       mallex [-binary|-readable|-prelex] project-file

       mallex [-binary|-readable|-prelex] symbol-file rule-file [lexicon-file]
       [prelex-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Malaga is a development environment for natural-language grammars based
       on the Left-Associative Grammar formalism.  Malaga grammars can be used
       for automatic morphological and/or syntactic analysis.

       The program mallex generates a Malaga run-time lexicon by letting allo‐
       morph  rules process a base-form lexicon. It can be started in interac‐
       tive mode to help find bugs in the base-form lexicon or  in  the  allo‐
       morph rules.

       mallex uses the following grammar components:

       symbol-file
              The  symbol-file  has  the  suffix .sym and contains the symbols
              that are used in the lexicon and/or the allomorph rules.

       rule-file
              The rule-file has the suffix .all  and  contains  the  allomorph
              rules used to create the runtime-lexicon.

       lexicon-file
              The  lexicon-file has the suffix .lex and contains the base-form
              lexicon entries that are used as input for the allomorph rules.

       prelex-file (optional)
              The prelex-file has the suffix .prelex and contains  precompiled
              allomorph  entries,  which  have been created by a former run of
              mallex with the option -prelex.

       You can give the names of the grammar components as command line  argu‐
       ments,  in any order.  Alternatively, you can describe these components
       in a project-file and use the name of the project file as mallex'  sin‐
       gle command-line argument. A project file has the suffix .pro.

       If  no command line options are given, mallex runs in interactive mode,
       and you can enter commands.  The lexicon-file and prelex-file  are  not
       used  in interactive mode. If you are not sure about the name of a com‐
       mand, use the command help to get an overview of all mallex commands.

       If you want to quit mallex, enter the command quit.

       See info Malaga for details.

OPTIONS
       -b[inary]
              Create the run time lexicon file from the base form lexicon file
              and  the  optional prelex file, and save it as a binary run-time
              lexicon, which can be used by malaga.

       -h[elp]
              Print a help text about mallex' command line arguments and exit.

       -p[relex]
              Create the run time lexicon, and save it  as  a  binary  prelex-
              file,  which can be read in later by another mallex run.  output
              stream.

       -r[eadable]
              Create the run time lexicon but don't save  it,  but  print  its
              entries in human-readable form on the standard output stream.

       -v[ersion]
              Print mallex' version number and exit.
