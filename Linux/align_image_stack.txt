NAME
       align_image_stack - Align overlapping images for HDR or focus stack creation

SYNOPSIS
       align_image_stack [options] input files

DESCRIPTION
       align_image_stack is used for the alignment of slightly misaligned images or for the registration of a stereo images pair.  When several differently exposed images are taken in the process of creating
       a High Dynamic Range image, the images are not perfectly aligned, and the quality of the HDR image created will suffer from this.  align_image_stack uses the tools available to hugin to optimize the
       roll, pitch and yaw, as well as some parameters of the lens geometry, to align the images.

OPTIONS
       Modes of operation:

       -p file
           Output .pto file (useful for debugging, or further refinement)

       -a prefix
           Output aligned images as prefix_xxxx.tif

       -o output
           Align images and merge them to HDR, generate output.hdr

       Modifiers:

       -v  Verbose, print progress messages. Repeat for higher verbosity

       -e  Assume input images are full frame fish eye (default: rectilinear)

       -t num
           Remove all control points with an error higher than num pixels (default: 3)

       --corr=num
           Correlation threshold for identifying control points (default: 0.9)

       -f HFOV
           Approximate horizontal field of view of input images, use if EXIF info not complete

       -m  Optimize field of view for all images, except for first. Useful for aligning focus stacks with slightly different magnification.

       -d  Optimize radial distortion for all images, except for first.

       -i  Optimize image center shift for all images, except for first.

       -x  Optimize X coordinate of camera position

       -y  Optimize Y coordinate of camera position

       -z  Optimize Z coordinate of camera position

       -S  Assume stereo images - allow horizontal shift of control points.

       -A  Align stereo window - assumes -S

       -P  Align stereo window with pop-out effect - assumes -S

       -C  Auto crop the image to the area covered by all images

       -c num
           Number of control points (per grid) to create between adjacent images (default: 8)

       -l  Assume linear input files

       -s scale
           Scale down image by 2^scale (default: 1 [2x down-sampling])

       -g gsize
           Break image into a rectangular grid (gsize x gsize) and attempt to find num control points in each section (default: 5 [5x5 grid])

       --distortion
           Try to load distortion information from lens database

       --use-given-order
           Use the image order as given on the command line.  (By default images will be sorted by exposure values.)

       --gpu
           Use GPU for remapping

       -h  Display help summary.
