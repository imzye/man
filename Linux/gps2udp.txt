GPS2UDP(1)                    GPSD Documentation                    GPS2UDP(1)

NAME
       gps2udp - feed the take from gpsd to one or more aggregation sites

SYNOPSIS
       gps2udp [-h] [-n] [-j] [-a] [-u hostname:udpport] [-c count] [-d 1|2]
               [-v] [server [:port [:device]]]

DESCRIPTION
       gps2udp is a tool to connect to gpsd and output the received sentences
       to one or many UDP host:port destinations. This makes the program
       useful for feeding AIS information from gpsd to aishub, marinetraffic,
       shipfinder,...

       gps2udp does not require root privileges, and can be run concurrently
       with other tools connecting to the local gpsd without causing problems.

       The output will consist of one or both of NMEA (-n option) or JSON (-j
       option) gpsd sentences. The output is sent to one or many destinations
       host through a UDP network socket (-u host:port options) .

       Optionally a server, TCP/IP port number and remote device can be given.
       If omitted, gps2udp connects to localhost on the default port (2947)
       and watches all devices opened by gpsd.

       gps2udp may be run as a daemon (-b option).

       gps2udp is designed to run smoothly in background; it reconnects
       automatically to gpsd whenever it is restarted. For debugging
       purporses, there is an option to exit gracefully after a given count of
       packets (-c option).

OPTIONS
       -h makes gps2udp print a usage message and exit.

       -n causes NMEA sentences to be output.

       -j causes JSON sentences to be output.

       -u host:port UDP destination for output sentenses (up to five
       destinations).

       -a output only AIS messages.

       -b causes gps2udp to run as a daemon.

       -c [count] causes [count] sentences to be output.  gps2udp will then
       exit gracefully.

       -d 1 prints sent packet on stdout.

       -v prints the version, then exits.

EXAMPLE
       With a running gpsd accessible on the network

       gps2udp -d 1 -n -u data.aishub.net:2222 will collect data from
       localhost:gpsd display them on stdout and send a copy to test aishub in
       NMEA format.

       gps2udp -a -n -b -u data.aishub.net:2222 -u 5.9.207.224:5321 -u
       109.200.19.151:4001 fridu.net:2947 will collect data from a remote gpsd
       located on fridu.net host, will filter AIS messages and send them to 3
       destination (aishub, marinetraffic, shipfinder) in NMEA format, command
       is running in background mode
