OPTIONS
        How to use Calf plugins:

        * LV2 plugins
              Calf is installed as calf.lv2 library in your LV2 directory (typically /usr/lib/lv2). It means that typical LV2 hosts should be able to find Calf's plugins.

        * JACK client application
              You  can  also  use  Calf plugins as one or more separate applications, connecting to other applications using JACK Audio Connection Kit (version 0.103 or newer is required). To run the client,
              type:

                      calfjackhost monosynth !

              (! means "connect", last "!" means "connect to output")

              Other examples:

                      calfjackhost monosynth ! vintagedelay ! flanger !

              (runs monosynth into vintagedelay and vintagedelay into flanger, then to output)

                      calfjackhost ! reverb !

              (takes signal from system:capture_1 and _2, puts it through reverb, and then sends to system:playback_1 and _2)
