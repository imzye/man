TREK(6)                        BSD Games Manual                        TREK(6)

NAME
     trek — trekkie game

SYNOPSIS
     trek [[-a] file]

DESCRIPTION
     trek is a game of space glory and war.  Below is a summary of commands.
     For complete documentation, see Trek by Eric Allman.

     If a filename is given, a log of the game is written onto that file.  If
     the -a flag is given before the filename, that file is appended to, not
     truncated.

     The game will ask you what length game you would like.  Valid responses
     are “short”, “medium”, and “long”.  You may also type “restart”, which
     restarts a previously saved game.  You will then be prompted for the
     skill, to which you must respond “novice”, “fair”, “good”, “expert”,
     “commodore”, or “impossible”.  You should normally start out with a
     novice and work up.

     In general, throughout the game, if you forget what is appropriate the
     game will tell you what it expects if you just type in a question mark.
