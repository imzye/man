NAME
       cobbler-register

SYNOPSIS
       cobbler-register [--server=<cobbler.example.org>] --profile=<cob‐
       bler-profile-name> [--hostname=<hostname>]

DESCRIPTION
       Running cobbler-register on a system will create a cobbler system
       record for that system on a remote cobbler server.  No changes will be
       made on the system itself.

DETAILS
       When installing new machines into a cobbler managed datacenter/lab, it
       helps to not have to manually enter in the network information for
       those systems.  Using cobbler register either from a kickstart or a
       live environment (or even SSH) can help seed the cobbler database.

       Network information is discovered automatically for all physical inter‐
       faces.  cobbler-register will attempt to discover the hostname, though
       if 'localhost.localdomain' is found, it will have to use some other
       data for the cobbler system record.  This is probably not what you
       want, so specify --hostname in this instance to override that registra‐
       tion value.

       For this to work, the "register_new_installs" setting must be enabled
       on the remote cobbler server.

       When the remote system record is created, for safety reasons, it will
       be set in Cobbler to be "netboot disabled".  Use "cobbler system edit
       --name=foo --netboot-enabled=1" to set the machine to reinstall, where
       "foo" is the name of the new system record.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       cobbler-register respects the COBBLER_SERVER variable to specify the
       cobbler server to use.  This is a convenient way to avoid using the
       --server option.  This variable is set automatically on systems
       installed via cobbler, assuming standard kickstart templates are used.
       If you need to change this on an installed system, edit /etc/pro‐
       file.d/cobbler.{csh,sh}.

ADDITIONAL
       Reading the cobbler manpage, the koan manpage, and fedora‐
       hosted.org/cobbler is highly recommended.
