NAME
       create_makefile - Creates Makefile.in and Makefile from a Makefile.am

SYNOPSIS
       create_makefile [relativepath/Makefile] [relativepath]

DESCRIPTION
       create_makefile creates the Makefile.in and Makefile in a subdirectory containing a Makefile.am. This script saves time compared to re-running configure completely

       Note that you must supply the path to the desired Makefile Makefile.am (though the final /Makefile may be omitted).

       This script may be run from the toplevel directory (the one containing configure) or from one of it's subdirectories.

       If the source directory is different from the build directory (see the environment variables below), it will be assumed that the Makefile.am and Makefile.in belong beneath the source directory and
       that the Makefile belongs beneath the build directory.

       This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.

ENVIRONMENT
       One of the following variables (but not both) should be set if the source directory is different from the build directory. If the build directory is simply a subdirectory of the source directory, the
       simpler variable OBJ_SUBDIR should be used.

       OBJ_SUBJDIR
           Indicates that the build directory is in the given subdirectory of the source directory. For instance, if the source directory is kdesdk and the build directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux, then
           OBJ_SUBDIR should be set to obj-i386-linux.

       OBJ_REPLACEMENT
           A sed expression that is used to transform the source directory into the build directory. For instance, if the source directory is ~/src/kdesdk and the build directory is ~/src/kdesdk-obj, then
           OBJ_REPLACEMENT should be set to s#kdesdk#kdesdk-obj#.
