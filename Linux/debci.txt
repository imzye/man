NAME
       debci - Debian Continuous Integration

       debci COMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       debci is the main entry point for debci programs. Most of the commands are intended to be used by the debci system itself. However, there are a few commands that are useful for users, and they are
       listed below.

       debci setup [OPTIONS]
           Sets up a test bed for running local tests. For most of the backends, this should be usually ran as root.

       debci localtest [OPTIONS] SOURCEPACKAGE [BINARY ...]
           Runs the tests from SOURCEPACKAGE, in exactly the same way they would be ran on ci.debian.net.

           SOURCEPACKAGE  can  be  a  source package name, a local .dsc file, a local .changes file, a local unpacked source package directory, or anything else that autopkgtest(1) would take as a source
           package.

           You can also pass any quantity of BINARY packages that will also be used in the test.

COMMON OPTIONS
       The following options apply to every debci command.

       -c DIR, --config DIR
           Uses DIR as the debci configuration directory.

       -a ARCH, --arch ARCH
           selects the architecture to run tests for (default: host architecture)

       -b BACKEND, --backend BACKEND
           selects the backends to run tests on (default: lxc)

       -s SUITE, --suite SUITE
           selects suite to run tests for (default: unstable)

       -d DIR, --data-dir DIR
           The directory in which debci will store its data, and where it will read from.

       --amqp amqp://[user:password@]hostname[:port]
           AMQP server to connect to (default: amqp://localhost)

       -q, --quiet
           Prevents debci from producing any output on stdout. Errors and warnings will still be sent to stderr.

       --help
           Display usage information.
