       stack   Displays the RPN stack.

       clear stack
               Clears the entire RPN stack.

       copy [index]
               Duplicates  a value on the RPN stack to the top of the stack. If no index is specified, the top of the stack is duplicated. Index 1 is the top of stack and negative index values count from
               the bottom of the stack.

       move index 1 [index 2]
               Changes the position of a value on the RPN stack. Index 1 is the top of stack and negative index values count from the bottom of the stack.

       rotate [direction]
               Rotates the RPN stack up (default) or down.

       swap [index 1] [index 2]
               Swaps position of values on the RPN stack. If no index is specified, the values on the top of the stack (index 1 and index 2) will be swapped and if only one index is specified, the  value
               at this index will be swapped with the top value. Index 1 is the top of stack and negative index values count from the bottom of the stack.
               Example: swap 2 4

       When a line begins with '/', the text that follows is always interpreted as a command.

KEYBINDINGS
       Tab (Ctrl+I)
               shows a list of functions, variables, and units that matches the last object in the current expression, or, if cursor is at beginning of line or after operator, inserts the previous result
               (either with text of value, or as a temporary variable for approximate or long values)

       Ctrl+A  saves the current result in a temporary variable

       Ctrl+D  terminates the program

       Ctrl+E  switches between approximation modes (exact, try exact, auto)

       Ctrl+F  switches between fraction modes (simple, decimal, auto)

       Ctrl+L  clears the screen

SETTINGS
       These settings are changed using the set command (e.g. set base 16) or the -s, --set command line option (e.g. qalc -s "base 16"). Possible values are shown in parenthesis. 1 and 0 can be used in‐
       stead of on and off, yes and no. If the value is left out, a value of 1 is generally assumed. The default value is marked with '*'.

SYNTAX
       Mathematical entities:

              Numbers
              These are the regular numbers composed by digits 0-9 and a decimal sign — a dot, or a comma if it is the default decimal point in the locale/language used. If comma is used as decimal sign,
              the  dot  is still kept as an alternative decimal sign, if not explicitly deactivated. Numbers include integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. The imaginary part of complex numbers are
              written with as regular number followed by the special variable "i" (can be changed to a "j"), which represents the square root of -1. Spaces between digits are ignored ("5  5 =  55").  "E"
              (or  "e") can be considered as a shortcut for writing many zeroes and is equivalent to multiplication by 10 raised to the power of the right-hand value (e.g. "5E3 = 5000"). Sexagesimal num‐
              bers (and time) can be entered directly using colons (e.g. "5:30 = 5.5"). A number immediately preceded "0b", "0o", "0d" or "0x" are interpreted as a number with base 2, 8, 12  or  16,  re‐
              spectively (e.g. "0x3f = 63").

              Intervals
              A  number  interval  can be entered using the interval() function, the uncertainty() function, or using "±" or "+/-" (e.g. 5±1 = uncertainty(5, 0.2) = interval(4, 6)). If the read precision
              option is activated, decimal numbers are interpreted as an interval between the numbers that are normally rounded to the entered number (e.g. 1.1 = 1.1±0.05). If interval calculation  using
              variance formula is activated (default), the interval represents the standard uncertainty (deviation) of the value.

              Vectors and Matrices
              A  matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular array of mathematical objects. Vectors are matrices with only one row or column, and thus one-dimensional sequences of objects. Vectors and matri‐
              ces are generated by various functions, or using syntax in the form of [1 2 3 4] and [1 2; 3 4], with columns separated by space or comma and rows separated by semi-colon, or (1, 2,  3,  4)
              and  ((1,  2),  (3, 4)). A vector with sequence of numbers can be created using "..." (e.g. "1...4"), or colon (e.g. "[1:4]", or "[1:1:4]" where the second value specifies the increment). A
              single element of a vector can be selected by placing the index (first index is 1) in parenthesis after a variable or function (e.g. "v(1)" or "f[1]").

              Variables/Constants
              See the list of variables in the GUI manual or using the command .I list variables

              Functions
              See the list of functions in the GUI manual or using the command .I list functions

              Units and Prefixes
              See the list of units and prefixes in the GUI manual or using the command .I list units.  Abbreviated, plural and singular forms of unit names and prefixes are generally  allowed.  Prefixes
              must  be  put immediately before the unit to be interpreted as prefixes (eg. 5 mm = 0.005 m, but 5 m m = 5 m^2). For convenience units allow the power operator to be left out (e.g. 5 m2 = 5
              m^2), with currencies excluded.

              Unknowns
              Unknowns are text strings without any associated value. These are temporary unknown variables with default assumptions. Unknowns can also be explicitly entered by placing  a  backslash  (\)
              before  a  single character (e.g. 5\a + 2\b) or using quotation mark before and after a text string (e.g. 5 "apples" + 2 "bananas"). If unknowns are activated characters without any associ‐
              ated variable, function or unit in an expression, will be regarded as an unknown variable.

              Date and Time
              Date/time values are specified using quoted text string (quotation marks are not needed for function arguments), using standard date and time format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS). Some  local  for‐
              mats are also supported, but not recommended. The local time zone are used, unless a time zone is specified at the end of the time string (Z/UTC/GMT or +/-HH:MM). Date/time supports a small
              subset of arithmetic operations. The time units represents calendar time, instead of average values, when added or subtracted to a date.

              Text
              This category represent a number of different function argument types, such as regular text and file names. They can, but do not need to be put in quotes except when containing the argument
              separator.

              Comments
              All text after a hashtag (e.g. (5*2)/2 #calculating triangle area) is treated as a comment.

       Operations and operators (word operators such as AND must be surrounded by space):

              Addition (+)

              Subtraction (-)

              Multiplication (*)

              Division (/)

              Remainder (%, rem) and modulo (%%, mod)
              Returns the remainder after division.

              Integer division (//, div)
              Rounds the result of division towards zero.

              Exponentiation (^, **)
              Note  that  x^y^z  equals x^(y^z), and not (x^y)^z. Note also that for non-integer exponents with negative bases, the principal root is returned and not the real root ((-8)^(1/3) equals 1 +
              1.73i, and not -2). To calculate the real root for negative values, use the cbrt() and root() functions.

              10^x (E)

              Parenthesis ((, ))

              Parellel sum (∥, ||)
              Returns the reciprocal value of a sum of reciprocal values. || is interpreted as parallel if units are used, otherwise as logical OR.

              Logical operators (!, NOT, ||, OR, &&, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND)

              Bitwise operators (~, |, &, <<, >>, XOR)

              Comparison operators (=, !=, <, <=, >, >=)
              Returns 1 if expression is true and 0 if false. The x variable is isolated if the expression does not evaluate as true or false. Primarily used for equations and inequalities.

              Dot product (.)

              Element-wise operators (.*, ./, .^)

              Save operator (:=, =)
              Saves the expression to the right of the operator as a variable or function (e.g. var1:=5, func1():=x+y, var1=ln(5)+2). If the colon is omitted the expression is calculated before it is as‐
              signed to the variable.

       Evaluation priority order: parenthesis, 10^x, exponentiation, functions, bitwise NOT, logical NOT, multiplication/division/remainder,  parallel  sum,  addition/subtraction,  bitwise  NOT,  bitwise
       shift, comparisons, bitwise AND, bitwise XOR, bitwise OR, logical AND, logical OR.

       The  evaluation of short/implicit multiplication without any multiplication sign (e.g. 5x, 5(2+3)), differs depending on the parsing mode. In the conventional mode implicit multiplication does not
       differ from explicit multiplication (12/2(1+2) = 12/2*3 = 18, 5x/5y = 5 * x/5 * y = xy). In the parse implicit multiplication first mode, implicit multiplication is parsed before  explicit  multi‐
       plication  (12/2(1+2)  = 12/(2 * 3) = 2, 5x/5y = (5 * x)/(5 * y) = x/y). The default adaptive mode works as the parse implicit multiplication first mode, unless spaces are found (1/5x = 1/(5 * x),
       but 1/5 x = (1/5) * x). In the adaptive mode unit expressions are parsed separately (5 m/5 m/s = (5 * m)/(5 * (m/s)) = 1 s). Function arguments without parentheses are an exception, where implicit
       multiplication in front of variables and units is parsed first regardless of mode (sqrt 2x = sqrt(2x)).

       In chain mode, expressions are calculated from left to right, ignoring standard order of operations, like the immediate execution mode of a traditional calculator (1+2*3 = (1+2)*3 = 9).

       The "to"-operator is used for unit conversion and manipulation of how the result is presented. Place " to " or a right arrow (e.g. "->") followed by one of expressions/commands  listed  below,  at
       the end of an expression.

               prepend with - to show as simple fraction

       Other conversion commands
               - factors (factorize result)

       Similarly  where  (or  alternatively  "/.")  can  be  used at the end (but before "to"), for variable assignments, function replacements, etc. (e.g. "x+y where x=1 and y=2", "x^2=4 where x>0", and
       "sin(5) where sin()=cos()"). Variables assignments can also be placed before the expression, separated by comma, e.g. <quote>x=1, y=2, x+y</quote>, but this syntax is more strict.

       Note that to and where can only be applied to the whole expression. Everything before the operator is always treated as the expression to convert (or apply replacement to), and everything after as
       the conversion/replacement expression, regardless of any parentheses.

       Note that semicolon can be replaced with comma, if comma is not used as decimal or thousands separator.
