NAME
       sitepods - print out the paths to the modules that this site added

DESCRIPTION
       This program shows the paths to module pods that are in the site_perl
       directories.

EXAMPLES
           $ sitepods
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/site_perl/5.00554/i686-linux/XML/Parser/Expat.pm
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/site_perl/5.00554/i686-linux/XML/Parser.pm

       You can also run this using alternate perl binaries, like so:

           $ oldperl -S sitepods
           ....
