NAME
       tpm_getpcrhash - return the signed data produced by a TPM quote

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_getpcrhash [-r HOST] [-hv] UUID-FILE HASH-FILE PCR-VALUE-FILE PCRS

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  returns  the  signed data produced by a TPM quote in the file HASH-FILE and the list of Platform Configuration Register values in the file PCR-VALUE-FILE.  PCRS is a sequence of integers
       that specify the Platform Configuration Registers used to produce the signed data.  The key used for the operation is the one registered under the UUID in UUID-FILE.  The nonce used while  quoting  is
       unpredictable.  The nonce field in the signed data is ignored when using the signed data to verify a quote.

       -r HOST
              Perform operation on remote HOST.

       -h     Display command usage info.

       -v     Display command version info.
