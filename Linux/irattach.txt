NAME
       irattach - binds the Linux-IrDA stack to a IrDA port

SYNOPSIS
       irattach [ <dev> ] [ -s ] [ -d dongle ] [ -v ] [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       irattach  binds  the Linux-IrDA stack to an IrDA port. It configures the low level of the Linux-IrDA stack in the kernel. This step is usually necessary before you (or applications) can use the higher
       layer of the IrDA stack.

       The irattach command loads the necessary Linux-IrDA driver, which configures the IrDA hardware, and configures the IrDA stack to operate on the new IrDA port. Multiple  IrDA  ports  can  be  activated
       through multiple irattach commands.

       irattach  by default uses the irtty driver which connects to the Linux TTY subsystem and use the standard Linux serial driver. This works well for most machines and configurations, but limits the baud
       rate to 115200bps (IrDA SIR mode). The mode of operation will work with most FIR hardware (as found in laptops - they provide serial emulation) and most serial dongles (provided the proper dongle type
       is specified), making it a safe choice. However, USB dongles and a few FIR hardware don't support serial emulation and can't be used with the irtty driver.

       irattach  can  also  use one of the Linux FIR drivers (including USB dongle drivers) instead of the irtty driver. Most FIR drivers require proper configuration of module parameters (this is documented
       below). FIR drivers allow you to use higher baud rates (generally up to 4Mbps). In general, Linux FIR support is not as stable and mature, due to lack of time and documentation.

       irattach must be run as root or installed setuid root, as it requires root privileges. If you have compiled the IrDA stack as modules (recommended), then you will need to  edit  the  /etc/modules.conf
       file.  See the Infrared-HOWTO for details.

OPTIONS
       <dev> : this is the name of a TTY, an IrDA interface or IrDA driver. irattach decides to use the irtty driver or one of the FIR drivers based on this argument.

       • TTY  name : this is the serial port to be configured using the irtty driver, such as /dev/ttyS0. irattach will use the irtty driver, so only SIR will be available. You need to check your serial con‐
         figuration or BIOS to know which serial port is the IrDA port that need to be passed to irattach.

       • interface name : this is the device name of an IrDA interface, such as irda0. irattach will use one of the FIR drivers (including USB dongle drivers). The selected FIR driver must be loaded prior to
         the call to irattach, or the proper alias for the device name must be set in /etc/modules.conf.

       • module name : this is the name of an FIR driver module, such as nsc-ircc (see list below). All new IrDA interfaces created after loading the module will be configured, so this won't work if the mod‐
         ule is already loaded. This feature is still experimental.

       -s : starts discovery of remote IrDA devices (note that the form "-s 1" is no longer supported)

       -v : shows version information (this happens, when no option is given, too)

       -h : shows help information.

       -d dongle : attaches an additional dongle driver to the IrDA port.

       You need a dongle driver if you have an infrared device that connects to your computer's serial port (normal 9-pin serial port connector). These devices are called dongles, and can currently  be  used
       by any SIR driver (IrTTY or irport).  This option is not compatible with FIR drivers, and only works with the irtty and irport drivers.

       The currently known (serial) dongles are:

       • esi        Extended Systems JetEye PC ESI-9680

       • tekram     Tekram IrMate IR-210B dongle

       • actisys    ACTiSYS IR-220L dongle

       • actisys+   ACTiSYS IR-220L+ dongle

       • girbil     Greenwich GIrBIL dongle

       • litelink   Parallax LiteLink dongle & Extended Systems JetEye PC ESI-9680B

       • airport    N.N.

       • old_belkin Belkin (old) SmartBeam dongle or any dongle only capable of 9600 bauds

       • ep7211     IR port driver for the Cirrus Logic EP7211 processor (ARM based)

       • mcp2120    Dongles based on the MCP2120 (Microchip)

       • act200l    ACTiSYS Ir-200L dongles

       • ma600      Mobile Action ma600 dongles

       • toim3232   Vishay/Temic TOIM3232 and TOIM4232 based dongles

FIR DRIVER MODULES
       If  you  are one of the lucky people which have a FIR chipset or USB dongle that is supported by one of the Linux-IrDA drivers, you can use irattach with the interface name of the IrDA port to config‐
       ure. You will need to configure /etc/conf.modules appropriately, with at least an alias of irda0 to the driver name, or load the driver manually beforehand.

       You don't strictly need to use irattach with FIR drivers, you can use modprobe to load the driver, ifconfig to bring up the interface and set the various sysctl by hand, but irattach  offer  a  conve‐
       nient way to do it.

       Of  course,  you  need to know which FIR driver applies to your hardware.  You may use findchip to get information about the FIR chip. If this doesn't help, the Infrared-HOWTO shows other means to re‐
       trieve these data.

       Also, you often need to configure the Linux-serial driver to ignore the IrDA port, otherwise both drivers will conflict. This can usually be done with setserial /dev/ttySx uart none.

       The currently known FIR drivers are:

       • ali-ircc ALi FIR Controller Driver for ALi M5123 (options: io, irq, dma).  This driver supports SIR, MIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.  This chipset is used by e.g.:

         The ALi M5123 FIR Controller is embedded in ALi M1543C, M1535, M1535D, M1535+, M1535D South Bridge.

       • irda-usb IrDA-USB device driver, for USB devices/dongles that comply with the official IrDA-USB class specification. Note: USB 2.0 is not yet tested.  (options: qos_mtt_bits int, description  "Mini‐
         mum Turn Time").  This is used, for e.g.:

         ACTiSYS ACT-IR2000U

         KC Technology KC-180

         Extended Systems XTNDAccess ESI-9685

         Note that there is another USB driver for those devices called ir-usb which is NOT compatible with the IrDA stack and conflict with irda-usb. Because it always loads first, you have to remove ir-usb
         completely.

         Devices based on the SigmaTel chip are not not compliant with the IrDA-USB class specification and therfore not supported by this driver.

       • nsc-ircc NSC IrDA device driver (options: io, irq, dma, dongle_id, qos_mtt_bits).  This chipset is used by e.g.:

         IBM ThinkPad  dongle_id=0x09

         HP OmniBook 6000 dongle_id=0x08

       • sa1100_ir Infrared driver for devices based on the StrongARM SA1100 embedded microprocessor (options: power_level, tx_lpm).  This driver may support FIR on devices that can do it.  This  chipset  is
         used by e.g.:

         Samsung YOPY, COMPAQ iPAQ, SHARP Zaurus SL5000/5500

       • smc-ircc SMC IrCC controller driver (options: ircc_dma, ircc_irq).  This chipset is used by e.g.:

         Fujitsu-Siemens Lifebook 635t Sony PCG-505TX

       • w83977af_ir Winbond W83977AF IrDA device driver (options: io, irq, qos_mtt_bits).  This chipset is used by e.g.:

         Corel NetWinder

       • toshoboe Toshiba OBOE IrDA device driver, supports Toshiba Type-O IR chipset.  (options: max_baud).  This chipset is used by e.g.:

         Toshiba Libretto 100CT., and many more old Toshiba laptops.

       • donauboe is a new version of toshoboe and has better FIR support and compability with the Donauoboe chip http://libxg.free.fr/lib-irda.html (options: ..).  This chipset is used by e.g.:

         Toshiba Libretto 100CT., Tecra 8100, Portege 7020 and many more Toshiba laptops.

       • vlsi_ir VLSI 82C147 SIR/MIR/FIR device driver This chipset is used by e.g.:

         HP Omnibook 800

         (options: ..).

         • clksrc int, description "clock input source selection"

         • ringsize int array (min = 1, max = 2), description "tx, rx ring descriptor size"

         • sirpulse int, description "sir pulse width tuning"

         • mtt_bits int, description "IrLAP bitfield representing min-turn-time"

EXAMPLES
       Attach the IrDA stack to the second serial port (integrated IrDA port using serial emulation) and start discovery:

       • irattach /dev/ttyS1 -s

       Attach the IrDA stack to the first serial port where you have an external ACTiSYS serial dongle and start discovery:

       • irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d actisys+ -s

       Attach the IrDA stack to the first IrDA-USB dongle and start discovery:

       • modprobe irda-usb ; irattach irda0 -s

       Attach the IrDA stack to the NSC FIR (4Mbps) device driver on a Thinkpad laptop:

       • modprobe nsc-ircc dongle_id=0x9 ; irattach irda0 -s.

       Attach the IrDA stack to the NSC FIR (4Mbps) device driver on a Thinkpad laptop:

       • irattach irda0 -s.

         This assume that you have added the following entries to /etc/conf.modules:

         options nsc-ircc dongle_id=0x09

         alias irda0 nsc-ircc

CAVEATS
       The  following  hints  are  a very short introduction into the configuration of Linux/IrDA. If this doesn't help read the Linux/IrDA-Tutorial and/or the Infrared-HOWTO .  Before configuring Linux/IrDA
       make sure whether you want to configure SIR or FIR. It's recommended to try SIR first, unless your device is not compatible with SIR (for example USB dongles).

       To get the SIR "serial" device have a look into the BIOS. Then run dmesg | grep tty to get a survey of tty devices supported by your machine. Now try to choose the one, which is probably the IrDA  de‐
       vice and use irattach /dev/ttySx -s.

       If you don't succeed with SIR (which seems a rare case) you may try FIR. First look up the BIOS. Then run findchip to get information about the IrDA controller chip. Use setserial /dev/ttySx uart none
       to avoid conflicts with the serial driver.  Note: don't use setserial if you configure SIR.  Now you may use irattach.

       Finally irdadump should show at least your computer itself. If it doesn't start at the beginning.

       This man page deal only with the low level of the IrDA stack (IrDA ports and IrDA drivers). After this step is done, you usually need to setup your favorite application to access the high  level  IrDA
       stack (via IrCOMM, IrLPT, IrNET, IrLAN or IrSOCK), which is documented elsewhere.

       This man page doesn't document the usage of the irport driver. The irport driver support the same hardware as the irtty driver, but is configured like a FIR driver.
