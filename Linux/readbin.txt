NAME
       readbin - ATLC's binary file information provider

SYNOPSIS
       readbin  filename.bin

WARNING
       This  man  page  is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages are produced.  The
       best documentation that was current at the time this version was produced should be found on your hard drive, usually at
       /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
       although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors are corrected in the documentation and placed at http://atlc.sourceforge.net/  be‐
       fore a new release of atlc is released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

DESCRIPTION
       readbin  reports on the number and type of pixels created by the program atlc.

OPTIONS
       There are no options for readbin

EXAMPLE
       % readbin coax2.V.bin
       file length=127008 bytes = 15876 pixels
       there are: 489 ones, 10852 zeros, 0 -ones, 4535 other values

FILES
       atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs/index.html
       the full documentation.  bitmapfile.bmp
          Original bitmap file. Must be 24-bit colour uncompressed.
       bitmapfile.Ex.bin
          X-component of E-field as a binary.
       bitmapfile.Ey.bin
          y-component of E-field as a binary. .
       bitmapfile.E.bin
          Sqrt(Ex^2+Ey^2), as a binary.  bitmapfile.V.bin
       bitmapfile.V.bin
          Voltage as a binary.

       All the saved binary files (.bin's) are saved as a double precision number for each of the pixels. The first double is the top left, the last the bottom right.
