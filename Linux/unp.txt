NAME
       unp - unpack everything

SYNOPSIS
       unp [OPTION]... [FILE]... -- [TOOL-OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       file: compressed file(s) to expand/extract

       Use -- [ ARGUMENTS ] to pass arguments to external programs, eg. some tar options: unp fastgl.tgz xmnt.tgz -- -C /tmp

OPTIONS

       -f Continue even if program availability checks fail or directory collision occurs

       -u Special helper mode.

              For most archive types: a) create directory <filename without suffix>/, b) extract contents there.

              For Debian/Ubuntu packages: a) extract data.tar.gz after each operation in local directory, b) extract control.tar.gz into control/<package_version_arch>/.

       -U Smart mode, acts like -u (see above) if archive contains multiple elements but if there is only one file/directory element then it's stored in the current directory.

       -s Show the list of supported formats

       -n, --dry-run Display the calculated commands, don't run them. NOTE: the printed commands shall be carefully examined for malicious filenames.

       -v More verbosity

       --version Show the tool version

       -h Show this help
