NAME
       aewm++_appbar - a small application launcher

SYNOPSIS
       aewm++_appbar

DESCRIPTION
       appbar is a small application launcher. It uses small 16x16 pixmaps to form icons so that you can quickly launch your favorite programs.

       NOTE: Currently using any other size pixmap will result in unwanted behavior in that the appbar main window will not have proper placement of those icons.

       To change the list of icons, edit the file /etc/X11/appbar/appbar.rc

       The install process installs some pixmaps into /usr/share/appbar/images/ , these are 16x16 pixmaps for use with the appbar. They were downloaded from http://wm-icons.sourceforge.net/data/wm-icons-
       current/icons/16x16-general/ and are GPL'd.

RC FILE SYNTAX
       The resource file syntax is simple. A definition of an icon looks like the following.

       use vertical_placement or horizontal_placement to customize the appbar look.

            icon {
                 image = images/terminal.xpm;
                 execute = xterm -bg black -fg white -ls;
            }

       Inside the icon construct you have two additional variables. The first variable is the name of the image followed by an equals sign then the path and filename of the xpm followed by a semi-colon.

       The second variable is execute. Its syntax is similar in that the only difference from images is the path to the executable you wish this icon to launch when clicked.

       For appbar placement use the following commands in the rc file.

            Appbar Style
                 vertical_placement
                 horizontal_placement

            Appbar Screen Placement
                 northwest_placement
                 northeast_placement
                 southwest_placement
                 southeast_placement

       To configure a different background gradient for the appbar use the following commands.

            appbar_color_from {
                 red=99;
                 green=99;
                 blue=99;
            }

            appbar_color_to {
                 red=cc;
                 green=cc;
                 blue=cc;
            }

       NOTE: image and execute variables are ended with a semi-colon. The icon construct is enclosed in braces.

       Usage: Appbar is extremely simple to use. When icons are clicked they launch applications associated with them. When the grill is clicked (at the right edge) it shades the window to the upper left
       corner. Clicking it again unshades it to its original size. Middle clicking on the grill will close the application.

       Gradient Theme: Appbar takes advantage of blackbox's image gradient code. You can configure a different color theme only by editing appbar.cc in the appbar constructor.

       Appbar uses a default icon which was taken from fspanel, credit goes to the author for it. This icons purpose is a fail safe backup incase the requested icon cannot be found.

RC FILE EXAMPLE
            vertical_placement
            northwest_placement

            appbar_color_from {
                 red=99;
                 green=99;
                 blue=99;
            }

            appbar_color_to {
                 red=cc;
                 green=cc;
                 blue=cc;
            }

            icon {
                 image = /usr/X11/share/appbar/images/terminal.xpm;
                 execute = xterm -bg black -fg white -ls;
            }

            icon {
                 image = /usr/X11/share/appbar/images/netscape.xpm;
                 execute = /opt/mozilla/./mozilla;
            }
