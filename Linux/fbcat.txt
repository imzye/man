NAME
       fbgrab - takes a screenshot using the framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS

       fbgrab [option...] png-file

       fbgrab -?

DESCRIPTION
       fbgrab is a wrapper around fbcat which emulates the behaviour of Gunnar Monell's fbgrab utility.

OPTIONS
       fbgrab accepts the following options:

       -c N
           Grab the /dev/ttyN virtual terminal.

               Note
               This option might require root privileges (or CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability).

       -C N
           Switch to the /dev/ttyN virtual terminal, then wait a few seconds before grabbing it.

               Note
               This option might require root privileges (or CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability).

       -d fb-device
           Use the fb-device framebuffer device.

           By default, the device name is taken from the FRAMEBUFFER environment variable. If it is unset or empty, the default is /dev/fb0.

       -i
           Enable PNG interlacing.

       -s N
           Sleep N seconds before making the screenshot or switching virtual terminals.

       -?
           Display help and exit.

       Specify png-file as “-” to write to standard output.

UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS
       The following options of Gunnar Monell's fbgrab are recognized but not supported:

       -f fb-dump-file

       -b N

       -w N
