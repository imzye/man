NAME
       claws-mail-bsfilter-plugin - spam filtering using the bsfilter program

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-bsfilter-plugin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-bsfilter-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       Enables spam mails to be feed to the bsfilter program so it can learn to filter them out.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named bsfilter.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

SEE ALSO
       bsfilter(1), claws-mail(1), claws-mail-extra-plugins(7).
