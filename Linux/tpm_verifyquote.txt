NAME
       tpm_verifyquote - verify the signature produced by a TPM quote

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_verifyquote [-hv] PUBKEY-FILE HASH-FILE NONCE-FILE [QUOTE-FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  verifies  the signature produced by a TPM quote in the file QUOTE-FILE, or when absent, the quote read from standard input.  The file PUBKEY-FILE contains the public key used to validate
       the signature.  The file HASH-FILE contains the signed data generated using the same key and Platform Configuration Registers used to generate the quote.  Critically, the signed data includes the  PCR
       composite hash used to validate that the PCRs contain their expected values.  The file NONCE-FILE contains the nonce used to generate the quote.
