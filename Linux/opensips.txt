NAME
       opensips - flexible and roboust SIP (RFC3261, RFC3263) server for Voice over IP (VoIP)

SYNOPSIS
       opensips  [ -hcCrRvdDEVT ] [ -f config-file ] [ -l address ] [ -n processes-no ] [ -N tcp processes-no ] [ -b max_rcv_buf_size ] [ -m shared_mem_size ] [ -w working-dir ] [ -W method ] [ -t chroot-dir
       ] [ -u uid ] [ -g gid ] [ -P pid-file ] [ -i fifo-path ] [ -x socket-path ]

DESCRIPTION
       OpenSIPS  is a SIP-based VoIP server running on most Unix-like operating systems. It supports UDP, TCP and TLS transport layers. Among its features:

       *      SIP Proxy Server, SIP Registrar Server, SIP Redirect Server, SIP Location Server, SIP Application Server

       *      Call Processing Language (RFC3880)

       *      ENUM support

       *      server side NAT traversal

       *      load balancing

       *      AAA with database (MySQL, Postgres, Unixodbc) or RADIUS backend

       *      audio, video, instant messaging and pressence

OPTIONS
       -h          Displays a short usage description, including all available options.

       -c          Checks the config file and displays the aliases and listen interface list.

       -C          Similar to -c but in addition checks the flags of exported functions from included route blocks.

       -r          Uses dns to check if it is necessary to add a "received=" field to a via.

       -R          Same as -r but uses reverse dns.

       -v          Turns on via host checking when forwarding replies.

       -d          Turns on debugging, multiple -d increase the debug level.

       -D          Runs opensips in the foreground (it doesn't fork into daemon mode).

       -E          Sends all the log messages to stderr.

       -T          Disables TCP support.

       -V          Displays the version number.

       -f config-file
                   Reads the configuration from  config-file (default /usr/etc/opensips/opensips.cfg ).

       -l address  Listens on the specified address/interface. Multiple -l mean listening on multiple addresses. The address format is [proto:]address[:port], where proto = udp|tcp and address =  host|ip_ad‐
                   dress|interface_name. Example: -l localhost, -l udp:127.0.0.1:5080, -l eth0:5062.  The default behaviour is to listen on all the ipv4 interfaces.

       -n processes-no
                   Specifies the number of children processes forked per interface (default 8).

       -N tcp processes-no
                   Specifies the number of children processes forked to handle tcp incoming connections (by default is equal to -n ).

       -b max_rcv_buf_size
                   Maximum receive buffer size which will not be exceeded by the auto-probing procedure even if the OS allows.

       -m shared_mem_size
                   Size of the shared memory which will be allocated (in Megabytes).

       -w working-dir
                   Specifies the working directory. In the very improbable event that opensips will crash, the core file will be generated here.

       -W method   Specify poll method.

       -t chroot-dir
                   Forces opensips to chroot after reading the config file.

       -u uid      Changes the user id under which opensips runs.

       -g gid      Changes the group id under which opensips runs.

       -P pid-file Creates a file containing the pid of the main opensips process.

       -i fifo-path
                   Creates a fifo, useful for monitoring opensips status.

       -x socket-path
                   Creates a unix socket, useful for monitoring opensips status ( same as -i fifo-path but using instead unix sockets).
