Name

Synopsis
       gitolite  sub-command [option...]

Description
       The following built-in subcommands are available; they should all respond to '-h' if you want further details on each:

           setup                       1st run: initial setup; all runs: hook fixups
           compile                     compile gitolite.conf

           query-rc                    get values of rc variables

           list-groups                 list all group names in conf
           list-users                  list all users/user groups in conf
           list-repos                  list all repos/repo groups in conf
           list-phy-repos              list all repos actually on disk
           list-memberships            list all groups a name is a member of
           list-members                list all members of a group

       Warnings:
         - list-users is disk bound and could take a while on sites with 1000s of repos
         - list-memberships does not check if the name is known; unknown names come
           back with 2 answers: the name itself and '@all'

       In addition, running 'gitolite help' should give you a list of custom commands available.  They may or may not respond to '-h', depending on how they were written.
