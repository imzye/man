NAME
       Image::Magick - call GraphicsMagick routines with ImageMagick interface

SYNOPSIS
       use Image::Magick

DESCRIPTION
       This Perl wrapper provides GraphicsMagick bindings in the namespace traditionally used by ImageMagick's PerlMagick extension. It is used to turn GraphicsMagick into a drop-in replacement for
       ImageMagick in Perl scripts. It is recommended that scripts are ported to use GraphicsMagick natively instead of using this compatibility wrapper.

       GraphicsMagick was forked from ImageMagick version 5.5.2, and has since been developed with an emphasis on interface stability. Therefore, Perl scripts supporting ImageMagick version 5.5.2 can
       usually be ported to GraphicsMagick with little effort.
