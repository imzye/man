NAME
       "Business::CreditCard" - Validate/generate credit card checksums/names

SYNOPSIS
           ##
           # new-style, supported since 0.36 released Jun 14 2016
           ##

           use Business::CreditCard qw( 0.36 :NEW );

           print validate_card("5276 4400 6542 1319");
           print cardtype("5276 4400 6542 1319");

           ##
           # old interface, deprecated but still supported for backwards compatibility
           ##

           use Business::CreditCard;

           print validate("5276 4400 6542 1319");
           print cardtype("5276 4400 6542 1319");

       Business::CreditCard is available at a CPAN site near you.

DESCRIPTION
       These subroutines tell you whether a credit card number is self-consistent -- whether the last digit of the number is a valid checksum for the preceding digits.

       The validate_card() subroutine returns 1 if the card number provided passes the checksum test, and 0 otherwise.

       The cardtype() subroutine returns a string containing the type of card.  The list of possible return values is more comprehensive than it used to be, but additions are still most welcome.

       Possible return values are:

         VISA card
         MasterCard
         Discover card
         American Express card
         enRoute
         JCB
         BankCard
         Switch
         Solo
         China Union Pay
         Laser
         Isracard
         Unknown

       "Not a credit card" is returned on obviously invalid data values.

       Versions before 0.31 may also have returned "Diner's Club/Carte Blanche" (these cards are now recognized as "Discover card").

       cardtype() will accept a partial card masked with "x", "X", ".", "*" or "_".  Only the first 2-6 digits and the length are significant; whitespace and dashes are removed.  With two digits, Visa,
       MasterCard, Discover and Amex are recognized (versions before 0.36 needed four digits to recognize all Discover cards).  With four digits, almost all cards except some Switch cards are recognized.
       With six digits (the full "BIN" or "IIN"), all cards are recognized.  Six digits are also required for receipt_cardtype().

       The generate_last_digit() subroutine computes and returns the last digit of the card given the preceding digits.  With a 16-digit card, you provide the first 15 digits; the subroutine returns the
       sixteenth.

       This module does not tell you whether the number is on an actual card, only whether it might conceivably be on a real card.  To verify whether a card is real, or whether it's been stolen, or to
       actually process charges, you need a Merchant account.  See Business::OnlinePayment.

       These subroutines will also work if you provide the arguments as numbers instead of strings, e.g. "validate_card(5276440065421319)".

PROCESSING AGREEMENTS
       Credit card issuers have recently been forming agreements to process cards on other networks, in which one type of card is processed as another card type.

       By default, Business::CreditCard returns the type the card should be treated as in the US.  You can change this to return the type the card should be treated as in a different country by setting
       $Business::CreditCard::Country to your two-letter country code.  This is probably what you want to determine if you accept the card, or which merchant agreement it is processed through.

       You can also set $Business::CreditCard::Country to a false value such as the empty string to return the "base" card type.  This is probably only useful for informational purposes when used along
       with the default type.

       Here are the currently known agreements:

       Most Diner's club is now identified as Discover.  (This supercedes the earlier identification of some Diner's club cards as MasterCard inside the US and Canada.)
       JCB cards in the 3528-3589 range are identified as Discover inside the US and territories.
       China Union Pay cards are identified as Discover cards in the US, Mexico and most Caribbean countries.

RECEIPT REQUIREMENTS
       Discover  requires some cards processed on its network to display "PayPal" on receipts instead of "Discover".  The receipt_cardtype() subroutine will return "PayPal card" for these cards only, and
       otherwise the same output as cardtype().

       Use this for receipt display/printing only.

       Note: this subroutine is not exported by default like the others.  Before 0.36, you needed to call this subroutine fully-qualified, as Business::CreditCard::receipt_cardtype()

       In 0.36 and later, you can import it into your namespace:

         use Business::CreditCard qw( :DEFAULT receipt_cardtype );

REPOSITORY
       The code is available from our public git repository:

         git clone git://git.freeside.biz/Business-CreditCard.git

       Or on the web:

         http://freeside.biz/gitweb/?p=Business-CreditCard.git
         Or:

BUGS
       (paraphrasing Neil Bowers) We export all functions by default.  It would be better to let the user decide which functions to import.  And validate() is a bit of a generic name.

       The question is, after almost 2 decades with this interface (inherited from the original author, who probably never expected it to live half this long), how to change things to behave  in  a  more
       modern fashion without breaking existing code?  "use Business::CreditCard <some_minimum_version>" turns it off?  Explicitly ask to turn it off and list that in the SYNOPSIS?

   validate() and @EXPORT transition plan
       First (done in 0.36):

       validate_card() is the new name for validate().  Both work for now.

       New-style usage (not recommended for code that needs to support B:CC before 0.36):

         use Business::CreditCard qw( :NEW );

       You get validate_card(), cardtype() and receipt_cardtype().  You can also ask for them explicitly / individually:

         use Business::CreditCard qw( validate_card cardtype receipt_cardtype );

       Second:

       Waiting for 0.36+ to become more prevalent.

       Third (we're at now now):

       Recommend new-style usage.  Maybe asking for a specific minimum version turns it on too?

       Fourth:
        (this is the incompatible part):

       Don't export validate() (or anything else [separately?]) by default.

       This  is  the  part  that  will  break  things  and  we probably won't do for a long time, until new-style usage is the norm and the tradeoff of breaking old code is worth it to stop our namespace
       pollution.  Maybe do a 1.00 release with the current API and 2.00 is when this happens (with a 1.99_01 pre-release)?
