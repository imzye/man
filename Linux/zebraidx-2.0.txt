NAME
       zebraidx - Zebra Administrative Tool

SYNOPSIS
       zebraidx [-c config] [-d database] [-f number] [-g group] [-l file] [-L] [-m mbytes] [-n] [-s] [-v level] [-t type] [-v] {command} [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       zebraidx allows you to insert, delete or updates records in Zebra.  zebraidx accepts a set options (see below) and exactly one command (mandatory).

COMMANDS
       update directory
           Update the register with the files contained in directory. If no directory is provided, a list of files is read from stdin. See Administration in the Zebra Manual.

       delete directory
           Remove the records corresponding to the files found under directory from the register.

       adelete directory
           Remove the records corresponding to the files found under directory from the register. Unlike command delete this command does not fail if a record does not exist (but which is attempted deleted).

       commit
           Write the changes resulting from the last update commands to the register. This command is only available if the use of shadow register files is enabled (see Shadow Registers in the Zebra Manual).

       check options
           Runs consistency check of register. May take a long time. Options may be one of quick, default or full.

       clean
           Clean shadow files and "forget" changes.

       create database
           Create database.

       drop database
           Drop database (delete database).

       init
           Deletes an entire register (all files in shadow+register areas).

OPTIONS
       -c config-file
           Read the configuration file config-file instead of zebra.cfg.

       -d database
           The records located should be associated with the database name database for access through the Z39.50 server.

       -f number
           Specify how many per-record log lines, zebraidx, should produce during indexing and during register check (check command). If this option is not given, a value of 1000 is used.

       -g group
           Update the files according to the group settings for group (see Zebra Configuration File in the Zebra manual).

       -l file
           Write log messages to file instead of stderr.

       -L
           Makes zebraidx skip symbolic links. By default, zebraidx follows them.

       -m mbytes
           Use mbytes of memory before flushing keys to background storage. This setting affects performance when updating large databases.

       -n
           Disable the use of shadow registers for this operation (see Shadow Registers in the Zebra manual).

       -s
           Show analysis of the indexing process. The maintenance program works in a read-only mode and doesn't change the state of the index. This options is very useful when you wish to test a new profile.

       -t type
           Update all files as type. Currently, the types supported are text, alvis and grs.subtype. Generally, it is probably advisable to specify the record types in the zebra.cfg file (see Record Types in
           the Zebra manual), to avoid confusion at subsequent updates.

       -V
           Show Zebra version.

       -v level
           Set the log level to level.  level should be one of none, debug, and all.
