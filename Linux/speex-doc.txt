NAME
       type99 - Python Type TXT to Type 99/SPF conversion script

VERSION
       2.0.9

DESCRIPTION
       The type99script will convert DNS TXT strings to a binary equivalent suitable for use in a BIND zone file.  Since use of DNS type SPF (99) was removed in RFC
       7208, this script should be of historical interest only.

USAGE
       The type99 script is called from the command line as follows:

       python type99 "v=spf1 -all" {Note: Use your desired SPF record instead.}

       \# 12 0b763d73706631202d616c6c {This is the correct result for "v=spf1 -all"}

       or

       python type99 - {File name}

       The input file format is a standard BIND Zone file.  The type99 script will add a Type99 record for each TXT record found in the file.
