MAC-VENDOR(5)                                                                               File Formats Manual                                                                               MAC-VENDOR(5)

NAME
       mac-vendor - Ethernet vendor file for arp-scan

SYNOPSIS
       mac-vendor.txt

DESCRIPTION
       The  mac-vendor.txt contains Ethernet MAC to vendor string mappings for arp-scan.  It is used in addition to the IEEE OUI listings in ieee-oui.txt.  It is for MAC-vendor mappings that are not cov‐
       ered by the IEEE manufacturer listings.

       Each line in the mac-vendor.txt file contains a MAC-vendor mapping in the form:

       <MAC-Prefix><TAB><Vendor>

       Where <MAC-Prefix> is the prefix of the MAC address in hex, and <Vendor> is the name of the vendor.  The prefix can be of any length from two hex digits (one  octet)  to  twelve  hex  digits  (six
       octets, the entire Ethernet hardware address).

       Alphabetic hex characters [A-F] may use either upper or lower case, and seperator symbols such as ":", "-" and "." are ignored. This permits the use of standard format MAC addresses in this file.

       For example:
       01:23:45      matches 01:23:45:xx:xx:xx, where xx represents any value;
       01:23:45:6    matches 01:23:45:6x:xx:xx; and
       01:23:45:67   matches 01:23:45:67:xx:xx.

       Do  not  include  entries  from  the IEEE OUI listings, as these are already in the file ieee-oui.txt, which is automatically used by arp-scan.  See get-oui(1) for details of how to update the OUI
       listings.

       The order of entries in the file is not important.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.  arp-scan will attempt to match larger prefixes before trying to match smaller ones, and will stop at the first match.
