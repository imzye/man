NAME
       binfmtc-interpreter - binfmt_misc C handler

SYNOPSIS
       binfmtc-interpreter C-source-file-name [command-line opions ...]

DESCRIPTION
       binfmtc-interpreter compiles a C source file specified on the command-line using C compiler, and executes the resulting file.

       It is designed to be used as a handler for binfmt_misc handler, which is a system used in Linux for handling arbitrary files as executables.

       The command-line options are passed on to the compiled binary.

FILE MAGIC
       There is a requirement for C source files to have the magic characters /*BINFMTC: at the beginning of the file.

       That line also is used to specify the additional command-line options for C compiler.

ENVIRONMENT
       GCC    The compiler used.  The default is to use gcc

       CC     The compiler used, if GCC variable is not set.

       BINFMTCTMPDIR

              Temporary directory used for binary and execution.

              Falls back to $TMPDIR $TEMPDIR or /tmp

       BINFMTC_DEBUG
              enables debug output if set.

       BINFMTC_GCC_OPTS
              Additional GCC options.  Use BINFMTC_DEBUG to verify the options being passed on to gcc.

              The default is  -O2 -Wall -g
