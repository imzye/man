NAME
       CPAN::Meta::Check - Verify requirements in a CPAN::Meta object

VERSION
       version 0.018

SYNOPSIS
        warn "$_\n" for verify_dependencies($meta, [qw/runtime build test/], 'requires');

DESCRIPTION
       This module verifies if requirements described in a CPAN::Meta object are present.

FUNCTIONS
   check_requirements($reqs, $type, $incdirs)
       This function checks if all dependencies in $reqs (a CPAN::Meta::Requirements object) are met, taking into account that 'conflicts' dependencies have to be checked in reverse. It returns a hash
       with the modules as keys and any problems as values; the value for a successfully found module will be undef. Modules are searched for in @$incdirs, defaulting to @INC.

   verify_dependencies($meta, $phases, $types, $incdirs)
       Check all requirements in $meta for phases $phases and type $type. Modules are searched for in @$incdirs, defaulting to @INC. $meta should be a CPAN::Meta::Prereqs or CPAN::Meta object.

   requirements_for($meta, $phases, $types)
       This function is deprecated and may be removed at some point in the future, please use CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->merged_requirements instead.

       This function returns a unified CPAN::Meta::Requirements object for all $type requirements for $phases. $phases may be either one (scalar) value or an arrayref of valid values as defined by the
       CPAN::Meta spec. $type must be a relationship as defined by the same spec. $meta should be a CPAN::Meta::Prereqs or CPAN::Meta object.
