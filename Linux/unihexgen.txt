NAME
       unihexgen - Generate Unifont 4- or 6-digit hexadecimal glyphs

SYNOPSIS
       unihexgen startpoint endpoint

DESCRIPTION
       unihexgen produces unifont.hex entries in the Unicode code point range startpoint to endpoint (specified as the two command-line arguments).  Output is to STDOUT.  If a codepoint is less than or equal
       to "FFFF" (i.e., 0xFFFF), a four-digit hexadecimal number is encoded within the corresponding Unifont glyph as two digits on each of two rows.  Otherwise, a six-digit hexadecimal number is encoded  as
       three digits on each of two rows.

OPTIONS
       There are no options.

FILES
       *.hex as output.

EXAMPLE
       To generate the Private Use Area glyphs in the Unicode range U+E000..U+F8FF, invoke unihexgen with these arguments:

              unihexgen e000 f8ff

BUGS
       No known real bugs exist, except that this software does not perform extensive error checking on its command-line arguments.  If they're not in the format of the original bitmapped output from unihex‐
       gen, all bets are off.
