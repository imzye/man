NAME
       prottest - Selection of best-fit models of protein evolution (sequential version)

SYNOPSIS
       prottest -i alignm_file [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
        PROTTEST (ModelTest's relative) is a program for selecting the model of
        protein evolution that best fits a given set of sequences (alignment).
        This java program is based on the Phyml program (for maximum likelihood
        calculations and optimization of parameters) and uses the PAL library as
        well. Models included are empirical substitution matrices (such as WAG,
        LG, mtREV, Dayhoff, DCMut, JTT, VT, Blosum62, CpREV, RtREV, MtMam,
        MtArt, HIVb, and HIVw) that indicate relative rates of amino acid
        replacement, and specific improvements (+I:invariable sites, +G: rate
        heterogeneity among sites, +F: observed amino acid frequencies) to
        account for the evolutionary constraints impossed by conservation of
        protein structure and function. ProtTest uses the Akaike Information
        Criterion (AIC) and other statistics (AICc and BIC) to find which of the
        candidate models best fits the data at hand.
