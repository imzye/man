NAME
       perli11ndoc - view documentation of installed libraries bound using Glib::Object::Introspection

ABSTRACT
       perli11ndoc allows you to view Perl documentation for Glib libraries bound to Perl using Glib::Object::Introspection. Glib::Object::Introspection uses the gobject-introspection and libffi projects
       to dynamically create Perl bindings for a wide variety of libraries. Examples include gtk+, webkit, libsoup and many more. All libraries currently installed will be shown with Perl-specific
       documentation and examples. Where Glib::Object::Introspection differs from the C library, differences are pointed out and the Perl-specific interface is defined.

DEPENDENCIES
       perli11ndoc requires that XML::LibXML be installed to run. It also requires that the corresponding C library headers be installed on the system to provide documentation. For instance, on a Debian-
       based system you would need libgtk-3-dev to see the Perl introspected documentation for Gtk3.
