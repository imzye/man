NAME
       CHI::Driver::Redis - Redis driver for CHI

SYNOPSIS
           use CHI;

           my $foo = CHI->new(
               driver => 'Redis',
               namespace => 'foo',
               server => '127.0.0.1:6379',
               debug => 0
           );

DESCRIPTION
       A CHI driver that uses "Redis" to store the data.  Care has been taken to not have this module fail in fiery ways if the cache is unavailable.  It is my hope
       that if it is failing and the cache is not required for your work, you can ignore its warnings.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
   Namespaces.
       Redis does not have namespaces.  Therefore, we have to do some hoop-jumping.

       Namespaces are tracked in a set named "chinamespaces".  This is a list of all the namespaces the driver has seen.

       Keys in a namespace are stored in a set that shares the name of the namespace.  The actual value is stored as "$namespace||key".

   Encoding
       This CHI driver uses Redis.pm.  Redis.pm by default automatically encodes values to UTF-8.  This driver sets the Redis encoding option to undef to disable
       automatic encoding.

CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS
       "redis"
           option for the constructed "Redis" object

       "redis_options"
           for hash of options to the "Redis" constructor

       Other options, including "server", "debug", and "password" are passed to the "Redis" constructor.

ATTRIBUTES
   redis
       Contains the underlying "Redis" object.
