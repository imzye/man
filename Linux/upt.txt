NAME
       upt - Universal Packaging Tool

SYNOPSIS
       upt list-backends

       upt list-frontends

       upt package [-f FRONTEND] [-b BACKEND] [-o OUTPUT] [--debug] [--quiet] PACKAGE

DESCRIPTION
       Create a package for a distribution (such as OpenBSD, Fedora, etc.) from a language-specific package archive (such as the Python Package Index, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, etc.).

       Upt works with two kinds of modules:

       • frontends, which parse package metadata from a software archive;

       • backends, which create package definitions suitable for inclusion in your favorite distribution.

       The following subcommands are available:

       list-backends
              List all installed backends.

       list-frontends
              List all installed frontends.

       package [options...] <package>
              Package the given package.  This usually requires options, described below.

OPTIONS
       -b BACKEND, --backend BACKEND
              Specify backend to use.  Must be one of the values returned by “upt list-backends”.  At least one backend must be installed.  If only one backend is installed, this is optional; otherwise it is
              required.  See BACKENDS.

       --debug
              Print debug messages.  Cannot be used with --quiet.

       -f FRONTEND, --frontend FRONTEND
              Specify frontend to use.  Must be one of the values returned by “upt list-frontends”.  At least one frontend must be installed.  If only one frontend is installed, this is  optional;  otherwise
              it is required.  See FRONTENDS.

       -h, --help
              Show help and return.

       -o, --output OUTPUT
              Specify  an  output file or directory.  If this option is not specified, stdout will be used (if possible).  The exact meaning of this option may vary depending on the backend: it should do the
              most natural thing.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress all logging output.  Cannot be used with --debug.

       -r, --recursive
              Recursively package requirements.

BACKENDS

       upt-nix
              Create packages for Nix

       upt-openbsd
              Create packages for OpenBSD

FRONTENDS
       upt-cpan
              Gather metadata about packages hosted on cpan.org

       upt-pypi
              Gather metadata about packages hosted on pypi.org

       upt-rubygems
              Gather metadata about packages hosted on rubygems.org

EXAMPLES
       List installed frontends
              upt list-frontends

       List installed backends
              upt list-backends

       Package “requests” from PyPI, for use in GNU Guix
              upt package -f pypi -b guix requests

       Same, omitting “-b” when there is only one installed backend
              upt package -f pypi requests

       Same, omitting “-f” when there is only one installed frontend
              upt package requests
