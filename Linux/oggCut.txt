NAME
       oggCut - extracts parts of an ogg file (.ogv, .ogg and .oga)

SYNOPSIS
       oggCut [options] inputfile outputfile

DESCRIPTION
       oggCut creates a new ogg file named outputfile as a subpart of the original file named inputfile

       oggCut is able to cut video (theora) only files, audio (vorbis) only files or files with both video and audio streams.

       The start and end time for the cut area must be given in milliseconds with the options -s and -e.

       As  a  video  stream  consists of I‐frames (which are full pictures) and P‐frames (which are delta pictures to the leading I‐frame) the oggCut algorithm searches for the first I‐frame. If a video file
       would start with a p‐frame, the player is not able to interpret this picture, as the leading I‐frame (on where it is based) is not available.  oggCut starts the I‐frame search at the start time  given
       by the -s option. So expect a shorter video time than the calculated seconds for the new file.

       oggCut does not do any reencoding, therefore the output quality is completely the same as from the input file.

       For those involved into the ogg container format: The file is cut on packet basis, not on page basis.

       There is another tool called oggCut out in the internet with a different synopis. This one has not been written by the author of this tool you are actually using.

OPTIONS
       -s     Cut start position in ms. If the input file is a video file, the cut area starts with the next keyframe found. Default: 0

              Example: -s 5000

       -l     Length of the cut area in ms. If -e is also given, the length is ignored.

              Example: -l 10000

       -e     Cut end position in ms. If -l is also used, the end position is preferred. If the end position is set to -1, the end of the stream is assumed.

              Default: -1

              Example: -e 20000

       -i

       -o     Input file and output file set (alternative).  These parameters can be used alternatively. They are overwritten by the arguments after the options. If there is one argument given, it is used as
              the input file (and overwrites a file given with -i). If there are two arguments, the input and output files from the -i and -o option values are overwritten.

EXAMPLE
       oggCut -s 1000 -e 21000 myVideo.ogv myOutput.ogv

       Creates a new video called myOutput.ogv from the video myVideo.ogv starting after 1 second ending after 21 seconds
