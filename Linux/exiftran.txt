NAME
       exiftran - transform digital camera jpeg images

SYNOPSIS
       exiftran [options] file1 file2 ... fileN

       exiftran -i [transform options] [others options] file1 file2 ... fileN

       exiftran -o outputfile [transform options] [other options] inputfile

       exiftran -d file1 file2 ... fileN > exifinfo

DESCRIPTION
       Exiftran is a command line utility to transform digital camera jpeg images. It can do lossless rotations like jpegtran(1), but unlike jpegtran(1) it cares about the EXIF data: It can rotate images
       automatically  by checking the exif orientation tag; it updates the exif information if needed (image dimension, orientation); it also rotates the exif thumbnail. It can process multiple images at
       once.

TRANSFORM OPTIONS
       -a     Automatic (using exif orientation tag).

       -9     Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

       -1     Rotate by 180 degrees clockwise.

       -2     Rotate by 270 degrees clockwise.

       -f     Mirror image vertically (top / bottom).

       -F     Mirror image horizontally (left to right).

       -t     Transpose (across UL-to-LR corner).

       -T     Transverse (across UR-to-LL corner).

       -nt    Don't transform exif thumbnail.

       -ni    Don't transform jpeg image. You might need this or the -nt option to fixup things in case you transformed the image with some utility which ignores the exif thumbnail. Just generating a new
              thumbnail with -g is another way to fix it.

       -no    Don't update the orientation tag. By default exiftran sets the orientation to "1" (no transformation needed) to avoid other exif-aware applications try to rotate the  already-rotated  image
              again.

       -np    Don't  pare lost edges. By default exiftran don't preserve image size of the images that do not meet a multiple of 8 pixels. He prefers to cut a strip of a few pixels rather than offering a
              damaged image. Use this option if you want them all the same.

OTHER OPTIONS
       -h     Print a short help text.

       -d     Dump exif data for the file(s).

       -c text
              Set jpeg comment tag to text.

       -g     (re)generate exif thumbnail.

       -o file
              Specify output file. Only one input file is allowed in this mode.

       -i     Enable in-place editing of the images.  Exiftran allows multiple input files then. You must specify either this option or a output file with -o for all operations  which  modify  the  image
              (i.e.  everything but -d right now).

       -b     Create a backup file when doing in-place editing (imply -i).

       -p     Preserve timestamps (atime + mtime) when doing in-place editing (imply -i).

EXAMPLES
       Autorotate all jpeg files in the current directory:

              exiftran -ai *.jpeg
