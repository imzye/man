NAME
       dq-server - run a command on all tasks in an IPC::DirQueue queue

SYNOPSIS
       dq-server --dir qdirectory [--njobs N] command arg arg ...

DESCRIPTION
       dq-server will remove each task in turn from an "IPC::DirQueue" directory, running the named command on each one.  Once the queue is empty, it will wait indefinitely for more tasks to arrive.   A
       limit on how many jobs to dequeue can be specified using --njobs.

       The command is run as:

           command arg arg ... nameofdatafile

OPTIONS
       --njobs N  (default: 0)
           How many jobs to dequeue from the queue directory.   0 means unlimited.
