NAME
       ply - dynamically instrument the kernel

SYNOPSIS
       ply program-file
       ply program-text

DESCRIPTION
       ply  dynamically  instruments the running kernel to aggregate and extract user-defined data. It compiles an input program to one or more Linux bpf(2) binaries and attaches them to arbitrary points
       in the kernel using kprobes and tracepoints.

OPTIONS
       -c command, --command=command
              When all probes are running, run command. When the command exits, stop all probes and exit. The command is run as if invoked with sh -c <command>.

       -d, --debug
              Enable debugging output.

       -e, --dry-run
              Exit after compilation, without actually instrumenting the system. Typically used in conjunction with --dump.

       -h, --help
              Print usage message.

       -k, --keep-going
              Instead of printing a warning and exiting whenever any trace data is lost, only print the warning and keep going.

       -S, --dump
              After compilation, dump the internal AST, generated BPF instructions and other internal information. This is very useful to include when reporting a bug.

       -T, --self-test
              Run the built-in self-test which verifies that the required features in the kernel are available and that all providers are operational.

       -u, --unbuffer
              Unconditionally disable buffering of stdout/stderr - even when they are not connected to a TTY. This is useful in interactive sessions where the output is futher processed by  another  pro‐
              gram.

       -v, --version
              Print version information.

SYNTAX
       The syntax is C-like in general, taking its inspiration dtrace(1) and, by extension, from awk(1).

   Probes
       A program consists of one or more probes, which are analogous to awk's pattern-action statements. The syntax for a probe is as follows:

           provider:probe-definition ['/' predicate '/']
           {
                statement ';'
               [statement ';' ... ]
           }

       The  provider selects which probe interface to use. See the PROVIDERS section for more information about each provider. It is then up to the provider to parse the probe-definition to determine the
       point(s) of instrumentation.

       When tracing, it is often desirable to filter events to match some criteria. Because of this, ply allows you to provide a predicate, i.e. an expression that must evaluate to a  non-zero  value  in
       order for the probe to be executed.

       Then follows a block of statements that perform the actual information gathering.

       A provider may define a default probe clause to be used if the user does not supply one.

   Control of Flow
       Probes support basic conditional control of flow via an if-statement, which conforms to the same rules as C's equivalent:

           'if' '(' expr ')'
               statement ';' | block
           [else
               statement ';' | block]

       In  order to ensure that a probe will have a finite run-time the kernel does not allow backwards branching. As a result, ply does not have any loop construct like for or while. A simple for state‐
       ment with an invariant that is known at compile-time could be added later. In that case we could unroll the loop when generating BPF.

   Type System
       The type system is modeled after C. As such ply understands the difference between signed and unsigned integers, the difference between a short and a long long, what separates an  integer  from  a
       pointer, how a struct is laid out in memory and so on. It is not complete though, notably floating point numbers and unions are missing.

       Programs  are statically typed, but all types are inferred automatically. Thus, the type system is mostly hidden from the user. Plans are to expose more of it in the future by allowing casts, type
       declarations and so on.

       Numbers and string literals are specified in the same way as in C.

   Maps
       The primary way to extract information is to store it in a map, i.e. in a hash table. Like awk(1), ply dynamically creates any referenced maps and their key and value types are inferred  from  the
       context  in which they are used. All maps are in the global scope and can thus be used both for extracting data to the end-user, and for carrying data between probes. Map names follow the rules of
       identifiers from C.

           mapname[exprs]

       Data can be stored in a map by assigning a value to a given key:

           mapname[exprs] = expr

       The delete keyword can be used to remove an association from a map:

           delete mapname[exprs]

       You can also remove all elements in the map using clear function.

   Aggregations
       More often than not, looking at each individual datum from a trace is not nearly as helpful as an aggregation of the data. Therefore ply supports aggregating data at the source,  thereby  reducing
       tracing  overhead.  Aggregations are syntactically similar to maps, indeed they are a kind of map, but they are distinguished by a leading '@'. Also, they can only be assigned the result of one of
       the following aggregation functions:

       @agg[exprs] = count()
              Bump a counter.

       @agg[exprs] = sum(scalr-expr)
              Evaluates the argument and aggregates the result.

       @agg[exprs] = quantize(scalar-expr)
              Evaluates the argument and aggregates on the most significant bit of the result. In other words, it stores the distribution of the expression.

PROVIDERS
       A provider makes data available to the user by exporting functions and variables to the probe. Function calls use the same syntax as most  languages  that  inherit  from  C.  In  addition  to  the
       provider-specific functions, all providers inherits a set of common functions and variables:

       •   char[16] comm, char[16] execname name of the running process's executable.

       •   u32 cpu CPU ID of the processor on which the probe fired.

       •   u32 gid Group ID of the running process.

       •   u32  kpid:  Kernel  PID of the running process. Also known as pid by the kernel. For a single-threaded process kpid is equal to pid. For multi-threaded processes, kpid will be unique while pid
           will be the same across all threads.

       •   char[N] mem(void *address [, int size]) Copy size bytes from address. If size is omitted, 64 bytes will be copied.

       •   s64 time, s64 walltime: Nanoseconds elaped since system boot. time is intended for time deltas and walltime should be used for timestamps. They refer to the same data, but with  different  de‐
           fault output formats.

       •   u32 pid: Process ID of the running process. Also known as thread group ID (tgid) by the kernel.

       •   void print(...): Print each expression with its default output format, separated by commas and terminated with a newline, to ply's standard out.

       •   void printf(format, ...): Prints formatted output to ply's standard out. In addition to the formats recognized by the printf sitting in your

       •   int  strcmp(char  *a,  char *b): Returns -1, 0 or 1 if the first argument is less than, equal to or greater than the second argument respectively. Strings are compared by their lexicographical
           order.

       •   u32 uid: User ID of the running process.

   kprobe and kretprobe
       These providers use the corresponding kernel features to instrument arbitrary instructions in the kernel. The probe-definition may be either an address or a symbol name. When using a symbol  name,
       glob expansion is performed allowing a single probe to be inserted at multiple locations. An offset relative to a symbol may also be specfied for kprobes.

       Examples:

       •   kretprobe:schedule: Trace every time schedule returns.

       •   kprobe:SyS_*: Trace every time a syscall is made.

       •   kprobe:dev_hard_start_xmit+8: Trace function with offset.

       Shared variables:

       struct pt_regs *regs
              Hardware register contents from when the probe was triggered. This matches the definition in <sys/ptrace.h> on your system.

       u32 stack
              Stack  trace  ID  of the current probe. This is just returns an index into a separate map containing the actual instruction pointers. As a user though, you can think of this function as re‐
              turning a string containing the stack trace at the current location. Indeed print(stack) will produce exactly that.

              CAUTION: On some architectures (looking at you, ARM), capturing stack traces at the entry of a function, before the prologue has run, does not work. Setting your probe  after  the  prologue
              will work around the issue (typically two instructions, or +8, on ARM).

       kprobe specific functions:

       arg0, arg1 ... argN:

       void *caller
              The program counter, as recorded in regs, at the time the probe was triggered. was attached. The default output format will resolve it to a symbolic name if one is available.

       kretprobe specific function:

       retval Return value of the probed function.

   tracepoint
       The  tracepoint provider can instrument all stable tracepoints in the kernel. They are identified by their relative path from the /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events directory, where each leaf direc‐
       tory corresponds to a tracepoint.

       Examples:

       •   tracepoint:sched/sched_wakeup: Trace every time a process is awoken.

       •   tracepoint:irq/irq_handler_entry: Trace every time an interrupt is handled.

       Variables:

       struct <X> *data
              A struct is dynamically generated for each tracepoint by parsing its format file. I.e. if the contents of the format file looks like the following:

               name: tcp_send_reset
               ID: 1304
               format:
                    field:unsigned short common_type;  offset:0; size:2;   signed:0;
                    field:unsigned char common_flags;  offset:2; size:1;   signed:0;
                    field:unsigned char common_preempt_count;    offset:3; size:1;   signed:0;
                    field:int common_pid;    offset:4; size:4;   signed:1;

                    field:const void * skbaddr;   offset:8; size:8;   signed:0;
                    field:const void * skaddr;    offset:16;     size:8;   signed:0;
                    field:__u16 sport;  offset:24;     size:2;   signed:0;
                    field:__u16 dport;  offset:26;     size:2;   signed:0;
                    field:__u8 saddr[4];     offset:28;     size:4;   signed:0;
                    field:__u8 daddr[4];     offset:32;     size:4;   signed:0;
                    field:__u8 saddr_v6[16]; offset:36;     size:16;  signed:0;
                    field:__u8 daddr_v6[16]; offset:52;     size:16;  signed:0;

       Then data would point to a struct of the following type:

               struct data {
                   unsigned short common_type;
                   unsigned char common_flags;
                   unsigned char common_preempt_count;
                   int common_pid;

                   const void * skbaddr;
                   const void * skaddr;
                   __u16 sport;
                   __u16 dport;
                   __u8 saddr[4];
                   __u8 daddr[4];
                   __u8 saddr_v6[16];
                   __u8 daddr_v6[16];
               };

       Functions:

       char[N] dyn(void *address [, int size])
              Copy size bytes from a dynamic data pointer in data, i.e. a member marked with __data_loc. If size is omitted, the default string size determines the number of bytes to be copied.

   BEGIN and END
       These special providers are called at the beginning and the end of the tracing session like awk and bpftrace. The names are case sensitive. Users can print some messages  or  fill  maps  to  known
       info.

   interval
       The interval provider will be trigger at each given interval. Users can specify time and unit (optional). If unit is omitted, then second is used. The supported units are:

       •   m: minutes

       •   s: seconds (default)

       •   ms: milli-seconds

       •   us: micro-seconds

       •   ns: nano-seconds

       Examples:

       •   interval:1: Called for every second

       •   interval:500ms: Called for every 500 milli-second

   profile
       The profile provider supports profiling by allowing the user to specify how many times it will fire per-second. Values of 1-1000 are supported, and the profile provider supports two probe formats:

       •   profile:[N]hz: Profile on all CPUs N times per second

       •   profile:[C]:[N]hz: Profile on CPU C N times per second

EXAMPLE
   Extracting data
       Print all openated files on the system, and who opened them:

           kprobe:SyS_openat
           {
               print(comm, pid, str(arg1));
           }

   Quantize
       Record the distribution of the return value of read(2):

           kretprobe:SyS_read
           {
               @["dist"] = quantize(retval);
           }

   Wildcards
       Count all syscalls made on the system, grouped by function:

           kprobe:SyS_*
           {
               @[caller] = count();
           }

       Count all syscalls made by every dd(1) process, grouped by function:

           kprobe:SyS_* / !strcmp(execname, "dd") /
           {
               @[caller] = count();
           }

   Object Tracking
       Record the distribution of the time it takes an skb to go from netif_receive to ip_rcv:

           kprobe:__netif_receive_skb_core
           {
               rx[arg0] = time;
           }

           kprobe:ip_rcv / rx[arg0] /
           {
               @["diff"] = quantize(time - rx[arg0]);
           }

RETURN VALUE
       0      Program was successfully compiled and loaded into the kernel.

       Non-Zero
              An error occurred during compilation or during kernel setup.
