NAME
       antennavis - Antenna Radiation Pattern Visualization Software

SYNOPSIS
       antennavis

DESCRIPTION
       Antennavis  lets  the  user  fly around and view antenna systems and their patterns from any angle in 3D. There are several means of viewing the patterns, through rendered, variable-size cubes, smooth
       shaded polygonal surface approximations, and color-mapped spheres.

       Antennavis works together with nec2. Nec2 simulates the electromagnetic response of antennas and metal structures and can be called from within antennavis. Antennavis then uses the TkAnt OpenGL widget
       to render the nec output.

AUTHORS
       The program was originally developed by Kenneth Harker WM5R and Adrian Agogino.  It is currently maintained by Nanakos Chrysostomos, nanakos@wired-net.gr.
