NAME
       alien_hunter - Interpolated Variable Order Motifs for identification of horizontally acquired DNA

SYNOPSIS
       alien_hunter <sequence.file> <output.file> [Options]

DESCRIPTION
       Alien_hunter is an application for the prediction of putative Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) events with the implementation of Interpolated Variable Order Motifs (IVOMs). An IVOM approach exploits
       compositional  biases  using  variable  order  motif distributions and captures more reliably the local composition of a sequence compared to fixed-order methods. Optionally the predictions can be
       parsed into a 2-state 2nd order Hidden Markov Model (HMM), in a change-point detection framework, to optimize the localization of the boundaries of the predicted regions.   The  predictions  (embl
       format) can be automatically loaded into Artemis genome viewer freely available at: http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Artemis/.

       INPUT: raw genomic sequence PREDICTION: HGT regions based on Interpolated Variable Order Motifs (IVOMs) arguments:

       <sequence.file>
              raw genomic sequence

       <output.file>
              filename for output data

       Optional arguments:

       -a     to load the prediction file into Artemis

       -c     optimize predicted boundaries with a change-point detection 2 state 2nd order HMM

       Output files:

       <output.file>
              predictions (tab file) in embl format

       <output.file>.opt
              optimized (HMM) predictions (tab file) in embl format

       <output.file>.plot
              predictions in Artemis User Plot format to be loaded manually using Graph -> Add User Plot...

       <output.file>.opt.plot
