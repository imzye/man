NAME
       jzexe - Generates standalone Z-Code programs

SYNOPSIS
       jzexe <story file> [jzip program]
       jzexe -x <standalone program>
       jzexe

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jzexe command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       jzexe is a program that generates a standalone Z-Code executable program by gluing jzip and the specified Z-Code program together. It assumes jzip is located at /usr/games/jzip, which can be over‐
       ridden by the command line. It calls a standalone executable <story file>.exe, and saves its output in the current directory.

       jzexe can also extract Z-Code programs from the executables it creates.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options are included below.

       -x     Extract a program from a stand alone executable, naming it <standalone name>.z<z-code version>

       Run jzexe with no arguments to view invocation options.
