NAME
       ttylog - serial device logger

SYNOPSIS
       ttylog [-b|--baud] [-d|--device] [-f|--flush] [-t|--timeout] > /path/to/logfile

       If  you  are not using the timeout option, you can stop it running by pressing a ctrl-c when it's going to the screen or doing "kill -HUP nnnn" (where nnnn is the process ID for ttylog) if running
       in the background.

DESCRIPTION
       This program writes everything that comes from a serial device like /dev/ttyS1 onto stdout. You can specify the device and the baud rate of the device.
