   NAME
       ckati - experimental GNU make clone

   SYNOPSIS
       ckati [OPTION]...  [TARGET]...

   DESCRIPTION
       ckati is a C++ implementation of kati, an experimental make clone.

       The motivation of kati was to speed up Android platform build.  The Android platform’s build system is built on GNU make and allows developers to write build rules in a descriptive way.

       ckati is a complete rewrite of GNU make from scratch, focused on speeding up incremental builds.

       ckati supports two modes of execution.  It can directly execute the commands specified in the Makefile, or it can generate a ninja file corresponding to the Makefile.

       The ninja generator mode is the main mode of operation, since the built-in executor of ckati lacks important features for a build system like parallel builds.

       The  ninja  generator  mode  is not fully compatible with GNU make due to a feature mismatch between make and ninja.  Since ninja only allows one command per a rule, when the Makefile has multiple
       commands, ckati generates a rule with the commands joined with &&.  When $(shell ...) is used, ckati translates it into shell’s $(...).  This works in many cases, but doesn’t when  the  result  of
       $(shell ...) is passed to another function:

              all:
                  echo $(if $(shell echo),FAIL,PASS)

       If -\-regen flag is specified, ckati checks if anything in your environment has changed after the previous run.  If the ninja file doesn’t need to be regenerated, it finishes quickly.

       The following is checked when deciding whether the ninja file should be regenerated or not:

       • The command line flags passed to ckati

       • Timestamps of the Makefiles used to generate the previous ninja file

       • Environment variables used while evaluating Makefiles

       • Results of $(wildcard ...)

       • Results of $(shell ...)

       Ckati doesn’t run $(shell date ...) and $(shell echo ...) during these checks.

       Ckati optimises $(shell find ...) calls, since the Android’s build system uses a lot of them to create a list of all .java/.mk files under a directory, and they are slow.  Ckati has a built-in em‐
       ulator  of GNU find.  The find emulator traverse the directory tree and creates an in-memory directory tree.  When $(shell find ...) is used, the find emulator returns results of find commands us‐
       ing the cached tree, giving a performance boost.

   OPTIONS
       -d     Print debugging information.

       --warn Print ckati warnings.

       -f FILE
              Use FILE as a Makefile.

       -c     Do not run anything, only perform a syntax check.

       -i     Dry run mode: print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them.

       -s     Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.

       -j JOBS
              Specifies the number of JOBS (commands) to run simultaneously.

       --no_builtin_rules
              Do not provide any built-in rules.

       --ninja
              Ninja generator mode: do not execute commands directly, but generate a ninja file.  By default, the ninja file is saved as build.ninja, and a shell script  to  execute  ninja  is  saved  as
              ninja.sh.  An optional suffix can be added to the file names by using --ninja_suffix option.

       --ninja_dir
              The directory where the ninja file will be generated; the default is the current directory.

       --ninja_suffix
              The ninja file suffix; the default is no suffix.

       --use_find_emulator
              Emulate find command calls to improve build performance.

       --regen
              Regenerate the ninja file only when necessary.

       --detect_android_echo
              Detect the use of $(shell echo ...) in Android build system.

       --detect_depfiles
              Detect dependency files.

       The following options can emit warnings or errors if certain Makefile features are used:

       --werror_overriding_commands
              Fail when overriding commands for a previously defined target.

       --warn_implicit_rules, --werror_implicit_rules
              Warn or fail when implicit rules are used.

       --warn_suffix_rules, --werror_suffix_rules
              Warn or fail when suffix rules are used.

       --warn_real_to_phony, --werror_real_to_phony
              Warn or fail when a real target depends on a PHONY target.

       --warn_phony_looks_real, --werror_phony_looks_real
              Warn or fail when a PHONY target contains slashes.

       --werror_writable
              Fail when writing to a read-only directory.
