NAME
       icecc-scheduler - Icecream scheduler

SYNOPSIS
       icecc-scheduler [-d] [-r] [-l log-file] [-n net-name] [-p port] [-u user] [-v[v[v]]]

DESCRIPTION
       The Icecream scheduler is the central instance of an Icecream compile network. It distributes the compile jobs and provides the data for the monitors.

OPTIONS
       -d, --daemonize
              Detach daemon from shell.

       -r, --persistent-client-connection
              Client connections are not disconnected from the scheduler even if there is a better scheduler available.

       -h, --help
              Print help message and exit.

       -l, --log-file log-file
              Name of file where log output is written to.

       -n, --netname net-name
              The name of the Icecream network the scheduler controls.

       -p, --port port
              IP port the scheduler uses.

       -u, --user-uid user
              Specify the system user used by the daemon, which must be different than ‘root’. If not specified, the daemon defaults to the ‘icecc’ system user if available, or ‘nobody’ if not.

       -v, -vv, -vvv
              Control verbosity of daemon. The more v the more verbose.
