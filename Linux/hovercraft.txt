INTRODUCTION
   GUI tools are limiting
       I  used  to  do  presentations with typical slideshow software, such as OpenOffice/LibreOffice Impress, but these tools felt restricted and limiting.  I need to do a lot of reorganizing and moving
       around, and that might mean changing things from bullet lists to headings to text to pictures and back to bullet lists over again. This happens through the whole process. I might realize something
       that was just a bullet point needs to be a slide, or that a set of slides for time reasons need to be shortened down to bullet points.  Much of the reorganization comes from seeing  what  fits  on
       one  slide  and  what does not, and how I need to pace the presentation, and to some extent even what kinda of pictures I can find to illustrate what I try to say, and if the pictures are funny or
       not.

       Presentation software should give you complete freedom to reorganize your presentation on every level, not only by reorganizing slides.

       The solution for me and many others, is to use a text-markup language, like reStructuredText, Markdown or similar, and then use a tool that generates an HTML slide show from that.

       Text-markup gives you the convenience and freedom to quickly move parts around as you like.

       I chose reStructuredText, because I know it and because it has a massive feature set. When I read the documentations of other text-markup langages it was not obvious if they  has  the  features  I
       needed or not.

   Pan, rotate and zoom
       The tools that exist to make presentations from text-markup will make slideshows that has a sequence of slides from left to right. But the fashion now is to have presentations that rotate and zoom
       in and out. One open source solution for that is impress.js.

       With impress.js you can make modern cool presentations.

       But impress.js requires you to write your presentation as HTML, which is annoying, and the markup isn't flexible enough to let you quickly reorganize things from bullet points to headings etc.

       You also have to position each slide separately, and if you insert a new slide in the middle, you have to reposition all the slides that follow.

   Hovercraft!
       So what I want is a tool that takes the power, flexibility and convenience of reStructuredText and allows me to generate pan, rotate and zoom presentations with impress.js, without having to manu‐
       ally reposition each slide if I reorganize a little bit of the presentation. I couldn't find one, so I made Hovercraft.

       Hovercraft’s power comes from the combination of reStructuredText’s convenience with the cool of impress.js, together with a flexible and powerful solution to position the slides.

       There are four ways to position slides:

          1. Absolute positioning: You simply add X and Y coordinates to a slide, in pixels. Doing only this will not be fun, but someone might need it.

          2. Relative  positioning  to  last  slide:  By  specifying x and/or y with with a starting r,you specify the distance from the previous slide. By using this form of positioning you can insert a
             slide, and the other slides will just move to make space for the new slide.

          3. Relative positiong to any slide: You can reference any previous slide by its id and specify the position relative to it. This will work for all positioning fields. However,  you  should  not
             use r as a slide id since the positioning might not behave as you expect.

          4. Automatically:  If you don’t specify any position the slide will have the same settings as the previous slide. With a relative positioning, this means the slide will move as long as the pre‐
             vious slide moved. This defaults to moving 1600px to the right, which means that if you supply no positions at all anywhere in the presentation, you get the standard  slide-to-the-left  pre‐
             sentation.

          5. With  an  SVG  path:  In this last way of positioning, you can take an SVG path from an SVG document and stick it into the presentation, and that slide + all slides following that has no ex‐
             plicit positioning will be positioned on that path. This can be a bit fiddly to use, but can create awesome results, such as positioning the slides as snaking Python or similar.

       Hovercraft! also includes a presenter console that will show you your notes, slide previews and the time, essential tools for any presentation.

   Shortcut/Navigation Keys:
       A help popup appears upon launching a presentation; it shows the keyboard shortcuts.

       • H     -> Toggle the help popup

       • Right, Down, Page Down, Space -> Next slide

       • Left, Up, Page Up     -> Previous slide

       • G     -> Go to slide

       • P     -> Open presenter console

USING HOVERCRAFT!
       You can either use Hovercraft! to generate the presentation as HTML in a target directory, or you can let Hovercraft! serve the presentation from its builtin webserver.

       The latter have several benefits. One is that most webbrowsers will be very reluctant to open popup-windows from pages served from the file system.   This  is  a  security  measure  which  can  be
       changed, but it's easier to just point the browser to http://localhost:8000 instead.

       The  second  benefit  is  that Hovercraft! will monitor the source files for the presentation, and if they are modified Hovercraft! will generate the presentation again automatically. That way you
       don't have to run Hovercraft!  everytime you save a file, you only need to refresh the browser.

   Parameters
       hovercraft [-h] [-t TEMPLATE] [-c CSS] [-j JS] [-a] [-s] [-n] [-p PORT] <presentation> [<targetdir>]

       Positional arguments:

          <presentation>
                 The path to the reStructuredText presentation file.

          <targetdir>
                 The directory where the presentation is saved. Will be created if it does not exist. If you do not specify a targetdir Hovercraft! will instead start a webserver and serve the  presenta‐
                 tion from that server.

       Optional arguments:

          -h, --help
                 Show this help.

          -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
                 Specify a template. Must be a .cfg file, or a directory with a template.cfg file. If not given it will use a default template.

          -c CSS, --css CSS
                 An additional CSS file for the presentation to use.  See also the :css: settings of the presentation.

          -j JS, --js JS
                 An additional Javascript file for the presentation to use.  Added as a js-body script.  See also the :js-body: settings of the presentation.

          -a, --auto-console
                 Open  the  presenter  console  automatically. This is useful when you are rehearsing and making sure the presenter notes are correct.  You can also set this by having :auto-console: true
                 first in the presentation.

          -s, --skip-help
                 Do not show the initial help popup. You can also set this by having :skip-help: true first in the presentation.

          -n, --skip-notes
                 Do not include presenter notes in the output.

          -p PORT, --port PORT
                 The address and port that the server uses. Ex 8080 or 127.0.0.1:9000. Defaults to 0.0.0.0:8000.

          --mathjax MATHJAX
                 The URL to the mathjax library. (It will only be used if you have rST math:: in your document)

          -N, --slide-numbers
                 Show the current slide number on the slide itself and in the presenter console. You can also set this by having slide-numbers: true in the presentation preamble.

          -v, --version
                 Show program's version number and exit

   Presenter Console
       The presenter console feature is designed for showing an annotated version of the presentation on the local laptop display, while showing the presentation itself on a projector.

       To use this feature, open the presentation in a browser, and press p. A new browser tab will be created, and the browser focus will switch to that tab automatically. At this point,  the  two  tabs
       are linked, and the slide navigation controls will affect both tabs.

       Now,  you'll  need  to move the presenter console tab into its own browser window. With Firefox, right-click on the tab title, and click on Move Tab --> Move to New Window. With Chromium, drag the
       tab title down and the tab will be moved into a new browser window.

       Finally, drag the presentation window onto the projector's part of the desktop, and press F11 to make the presentation fullscreen.

   Built in templates
       There are two templates that come with Hovercraft! One is called default and will be used unless you specify a template. This is the template you will use most of the time.

       The second is called simple and right now it only lacks the Goto function.  You can ignore it.

MAKING PRESENTATIONS
   A note on terminology
       Traditionally a presentation is made up of slides. Calling them "slides" is not really relevant in an impress.js context, as they can overlap and doesn't necessarily slide.  The  name  "steps"  is
       better, but it's also more ambiguous.  Hence impress.js uses the terms "slide" and "step" as meaning the same thing, and so does Hovercraft!

   Hovercraft! syntax
       Presentations are reStructuredText files. If you are reading this documentation from the source code, then you are looking at a reStructuredText document already.

       It's fairly simple, you underline headings to mark them as headings:

          This becomes a h1
          =================

          And this a h2
          -------------

       The  different ways of underlining them doesn't mean anything, instead the order of them is relevant, so the first type of underline encountered in the file will make a level 1 heading, the second
       type a level 2 heading and so on. In this file = is used for level 1, and - for level 2.

       You can also mark text as italic or bold, with *single asterixes* or **double asterixes** respectively.

       You can also have bullet lists:

          * Bullet 1

            * Bullet 1.1

          * Bullet 2

          * Bullet 3

       And numbered lists:

          1. Item 1

              1.1. Item 1.1

          2. Item 2

          3. Item 3

       You can include images:

          .. image:: path/to/image.png
              :height: 600px
              :width: 800px

       As you see you can also specify height and width and loads of other parameters, but they are all optional.

       You can also include videos:

          .. raw:: html

              <video width="100%" controls>
                  <source src="./path/to/your/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                  Your browser does not support the video element.
              </video>

       or audio:

          .. raw:: html

              <audio controls>
                  <source src="./path/to/your/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                  Your browser does not support the audio element.
              </audio>

       And you can mark text as being preformatted. You do that by ending the previous row with double colons, or have a row of double colons by itself:

          ::

              This code here will be preformatted
               and shown with a  monospaced font
              and    all    spaces     preserved.

       If you want to add source code, you can use the code directive, and get syntax highlighting:

          .. code:: python

              def some_example_code(foo):
                  return foo * foo

       The syntax highlighting is done by Pygments and supports lots and lots of languages.

       You are also likely to want to put a title on the presentation. You do that by having a .. title:: statement before the first slide:

          .. title:: This is the presentation title

       That is the most important things you'll need to know about reStructuredText for making presentations. There is a lot more to know, and a lot of advanced features like links, footnotes, and  more.
       It is in fact advanced enough so you can write a whole book in it, but for all that you need to read the documentation.

   Presenter notes
       To add presenter notes, that will be displayed in the presenter console, use the following syntax:

          .. note::

              Here goes the presenter note.

   External files
       Any  image  file  referenced in the presentation by a relative path will be copied to the target directory, keeping it's relative path to the presentation. The same goes for images or fonts refer‐
       enced in any CSS files used by the presentation or the template.

       Images or fonts referenced by absolute paths or URI's will not be copied.

   Styling your Presentation
       The css that is included by the default template are:

       • highlight.css contains a default style for code syntax highlighting, as that otherwise would be a lot of work. If you don't like the default colors or styles in the  highlighting,  this  is  the
         file you should copy and modify.

       • hovercraft.css, which only includes the bare minimum: It hides the impress.js fallback message, the presenter notes, and sets up a useful default of having a step width be 1000 pixels wide.

       For this reason you want to include your own CSS to style your slides. To include a CSS file you add a :css:-field at the top of the presentation:

          :css: css/presentation.css

       You can also optionally specify that the css should be only valid for certain CSS media:

          :css-screen,projection: css/presentation.css
          :css-print: css/print.css

       You can specify any number of css files in this way.  You can also add one extra CSS-file via a command-line parameter:

          hovercraft --css=my_extra.css presentationfile.rst outdir/

   Styling the console
       You can also optionally add styles to your slides that are only used when the slide is shown in the presenter console:

          :css-preview: css/slidepreview.css

       You can also style the presenter console itself:

          :css-console: css/console.css

       There are default styles that are automatic, anything you add in the file for the css-console will just be to override the existing styling.

   Adding Javascript
       In a similar fashion you can add Javascript files to either header or body:

          :js-header: js/firstjsfile.js
          :js-body: js/secondjsfile.js

       You can also add one extra Javascript-file via a command-line parameter:

          hovercraft --js=my_extra.js presentationfile.rst outdir/

   Adding Headers and Footers
       If  you  want  static  content,  content that doesn't move with each slide; for example a header, footer, your company logo or a slide background pattern, then you can insert that content with the
       header and footer commands:

          .. header::

             .. image:: images/company-logo.png

          .. footer::

              "How to use Hovercraft", Yern Busfern, ImaginaryCon 2017

       The header will be located in the resulting HTML before the first slide and the footer will be located after the last slide. However, they will be displayed statically on every slide, and you will
       have to position them with CSS. By default the header will be displayed behind the slides and the footer in front of the slides, so the header is useful for background designs and the  footer  for
       designs that should be in the foreground.

       It doesn't matter where in the presentation you add these commands, I would recommend that you add them before the first slide.

   Styling a specific slide
       If you want to have specific styling for a specific slide, it is a good idea to give that slide a unique ID:

          :id: the-slide-id

       You can then style that slide specifically with:

          div#the-slide-id {
              /* Custom CSS here */
          }

       If  you  don't give it a specific ID, it will get an ID based on its sequence number. And that means the slide's ID will change if you insert or remove slides that came before it, and in that case
       your custom stylings of that slide will stop working.

   Adding a custom class to slides
       If you want to apply the same style to one or more slides you may prefer adding a class to those slides instead (or in addition to) a unique ID:

          :class: my-custom-class

       You can then style those slides by adding CSS rules with:

          .my-custom-class {
              /* Custom CSS here */
          }

   Adding a custom directive
       If you want to use a custom docutils directive, you'll want to run hovercraft in the same process where you register your directive. For example, you can create a custom startup  script  like  the
       following:

          from docutils import nodes
          from docutils.parsers.rst import Directive, directives

          import hovercraft

          class HelloWorld(Directive):
              def run(self):
                  para = nodes.paragraph(text='Hello World')
                  return [para]

          directives.register_directive('hello-world', HelloWorld)

          if __name__ == "__main__":
              cmd = ['--skip-help', 'slides.rst']
              hovercraft.main(cmd)

       While  creating  your  own directive might be daunting, it's possible to reuse useful directives from other projects. For example, you can reuse Pelican's custom code block, which adds an hl_lines
       option to highlight specific lines of code. To use that directive, simply add the following import to the above script:

          import pelican.rstdirectives

   Portable presentations
       Since Hovercraft! generates HTML5 presentations, you can use any computer that has a modern browser installed to view or show the presentation. This allows you both to put up the presentation  on‐
       line and to use a borrowed computer for your conference or customer presentation.

       When  you  travel  you  don't know what equipment you have to use when you show your presentaton, and it's surprisingly common to encounter a projector that refuses to talk to your computer. It is
       also very easy to forget your dongle if you have a MacBook, and there have even been cases of computers going completely black and dead when you connect them to a projector, even though all  other
       computers seem to work fine.

       The  main way of making sure your presentation is portable is to try it on different browsers and different computers. But the latter can be unfeasible, not everyone has both Windows, Linux and OS
       X computers at home. To help make your presentations portable it is a good idea to define your own @font-face's and use them, so you are sure that the target browser will use the same fonts as you
       do. Hovercraft! will automatically find @font-face definitions and copy the font files to the target directory.

   impress.js fields
       The documentation on impress.js is contained as comments in the demo html file. It is not always very clear, so here comes a short summary for convenience.

       The different data fields that impress.js will use in 0.5.3, which is the current version, are the following:

       • data-transition-duration: The time it will take to move from one slide to another. Defaults to 1000 (1 second). This is only valid on the presentation as a whole.

       • data-perspective: Controls the "perspective" in the 3d effects. It defaults to 500. Setting it to 0 disables 3D effects.

       • data-x: The horizontal position of a slide in pixels. Can be negative.

       • data-y: The vertical position of a slide in pixels. Can be negative.

       • data-scale: Sets the scale of a slide, which is what creates the zoom.  Defaults to 1. A value of 4 means the slide is four times larger. In short: Lower means zooming in, higher  means  zooming
         out.

       • data-rotate-z: The rotation of a slide in the x-axis, in degrees. This will cause the slide to be rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise.

       • data-rotate: The same as data-rotate-z.

       • data-rotate-x:  The  rotation  of  a  slide in the x-axis, in degrees. This means you are moving the slide in a third dimension compared with other slides. This is generally cool effect, if used
         right.

       • data-rotate-y: The rotation of a slide in the x-axis, in degrees.

       • data-z: This controls the position of the slide on the z-axis. Setting this value to -3000 means it's positioned -3000 pixels away. This is only useful when you  use  data-rotate-x  or  data-ro‐
         tate-y, otherwise it will only give the impression that the slide is made smaller, which isn't really useful.

   Hovercraft! specialties
       Hovercraft!  has some specific ways it uses reStructuredText. First of all, the reStructuredText "transition" is used to mark the separation between different slides or steps. A transition is sim‐
       ply a line with four or more dashes:

          ----

       You don't have to use dashes, you can use any of the characters used to underline headings, = - ` : . ' " ~ ^ _ * + #. And just as width headings, using different  characters  indicates  different
       "levels".  In  this  way you can make a hierarchical presentation with multiple "levels" of steps.  However, impress.js does not support that, so this is only useful if you make your own templates
       that uses another Javascript library, for example Reveal.js. If you have more than one transition level with  the  templates  included  with  Hovercraft,  the  resulting  presentation  may  behave
       strangely.

       All reStructuredText fields are converted into attributes on the current tag.  Most of these will typically be ignored by the rendering to HTML, but there are two places where the tags will make a
       difference, and that is by putting them first in the document, or first on a slide.

       Any  fields you put first in a document will be rendered into attributes on the main impress.js <div>. The only ones that Hovercraft! will use are data-transition-duration, skip-help, auto-console
       and slide-numbers.

       Any fields you put first in a slide will be rendered into attributes on the slide <div>. This is used primarily to set the position/zoom/rotation of the slide, either with the data-x,  data-y  and
       other impress.js settings, or the hovercraft-path setting, more on that later.

       Hovercraft! will start making the first slide when it first encounters either a transition or a header. Everything that comes before that will belong to the presentation as a whole.

       A presentation can therefore look something like this:

          :data-transition-duration: 2000
          :skip-help: true

          .. title: Presentation Title

          ----

          This is the first slide
          =======================

          Here comes some text.

          ----

          :data-x: 300
          :data-y: 2000

          This is the second slide
          ========================

          #. Here we have

          #. A numbered list

          #. It will get correct

          #. Numbers automatically

   Showing lists item by item
       A  common  feature  in  presentation software is to have a list that appears item by item. This is called "substeps" and is enabled by setting the substep class on the items to be shown. In Hover‐
       craft! the easiest was to do this is to use paragraphs, since you can set the class on multiple paragraphs at once:

          .. class:: substep

              This paragraph will be shown when you press <next>

              This will show on the second <next> press

              And this will be shown third

       You can also set the class just on individual paragraphs, in which case all other paragraphs will be visible from the beginning:

          This paragraph will always be visible

          .. class:: substep

              This paragraph will be shown when you press <next>

          And this paragraph will also be always visible

          .. class:: substep

              And this paragraph will show second

       You can also do it with bullet lists or numbered lists:

          .. class:: substep

              * This is an unordered list

                  * In two levels

                  * One new item will be shown on every <next> press

       And, as with pagarphs you can have individual control of each item. But due to the ReStructuredText syntax you can't have individual control on the first item of a list, it will  always  be  shown
       from the start:

          #. This will be shown when you get to this slide

             .. class:: substep

          #. The second item shows only after you press <next>

          #. This also will always be shown.

             .. class:: substep

          #. And this will be shown after another <next> press.

   Mathematical equations
       If you add a math directive then hovercraft! will add a link to the MathJax CDN so that this:

          .. math:: e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0

       will  be  rendered by the MathJax javascript library. The math directive can also be used as a "role" with the equations inlined with the text flow. Note that if you use the math statement, by de‐
       fault the MathJax library will be loaded from the internet, meaning that your presentation will need network connectivity to work, which can be a problem when presenting and conferences, which of‐
       ten have bad network connectivity.

       This can be solved by specifying a local copy of mathjax with the --mathjax command line.

   Relative positioning
       Hovercraft! gives you the ability to position slides relative to each other.  You do this by starting the coordinates with "r". This will position the slide 500 pixels to the right and a  thousand
       pixels above the previous slide:

          :data-x: r500
          :data-y: r-1000

       Relative paths allow you to insert and remove slides and have other slides adjust automatically. It's generally the most useful way of positioning.

   Automatic positioning
       If you don't specify an attribute, the slide settings will be the same as the previous slide. This means that if you used relative positioning, the next slide will move the same distance.

       This gives a linear movement, and your slides will end up in a straight line.

       By  default  the  movement  is  1600 pixels to the right, which means that if you don't position any slides at all, you get a standard presentation where the slides will simply slide from right to
       left.

   SVG Paths
       Hovercraft! supports positioning slides along an SVG path. This is handy, as you can create a drawing in a software that supports SVG, and then copy-paste that drawings path  into  your  presenta‐
       tion.

       You specify the SVG path with the :hovercraft-path: field. For example:

          :hovercraft-path: m275,175 v-150 a150,150 0 0,0 -150,150 z

       Every following slide that does not have any explicit positioning will be placed on this path.

       There are some things you need to be careful about when using SVG paths.

   Relative and absolute coordinates
       SVG coordinates can either be absolute, with a reference to the page origin; or relative, which is in reference to the last point. Hovercraft! can handle both, but what it can not handle very well
       is a mixture of them.

       Specifically,  if  you take an SVG path that starts with a relative movement and extract that from the SVG document, you will lose the context. All coordinates later must then also be relative. If
       you have an absolute coordinate you then suddenly regain the context, and everything after the first absolute coordinate will be misplaced compared to the points that come before.

       Most notable, the open source software "Inkscape" will mix absolute and relative coordinates, if you allow it to use relative coordinates. You therefore need to go into it's settings  and  uncheck
       the checkbox that allows you to use relative coordinates. This forces Inkscape to save all coordinates as absolute, which will work fine.

   Start position
       By  default the start position of the path, and hence the start position of the first slide, will be whatever the start position would have been if the slide had no positioning at all. If you want
       to change this position then just include :data-x: or :data-y: fields. Both relative and absolute positioning will work here.

       In all cases, the first m or M command of the SVG path is effectively ignored, but you have to include it anyway.

   SVG transforms
       SVG allows you to draw up path and then transform it. Hovercraft! has no support for these transforms, so before you extract the path you should make sure the SVG software doesn't use  transforms.
       In Inkscape you can do this by the "Simplify" command.

   Other SVG shapes
       Hovercraft!  doesn't support other SVG shapes, just the path. This is because organising slides in squares, etc, is quite simple anyway, and the shapes can be made into paths. Usually in the soft‐
       ware you will have to select the shape and tell your software to make it into a path. In Inkscape, transforming an object into a path will generally mean that the whole path is made of CubicBezier
       curves, which are unnecessarily complex. Using the "Simplify" command in Inkscape is usually enough to make the shapes into paths.

   Shape-scaling
       Hovercraft! will scale the path so that all the slides that need to fit into the path will fit into the path. If you therefore have several paths in your presentation, they  will  not  keep  their
       relative sizes, but will be resized so the slides fit. If you need to have the shapes keep their relative sizes, you need to combine them into one path.

DESIGNING YOUR PRESENTATIONS
       There are several tricks to making presentations. I certainly do not claim to be an expert, but here are some beginners hints.

   Take it easy
       Don't go too heavy on the zoom. Having a difference between two slides in scale of more than 5 is rarely going to look good. It would make for a nice cool zooming effect if it did, but this is not
       what browsers are designed for, so it won't.

       And the 3D effects can be really cool if used well. But not all the time, it gets tiring for the audience.

       Try,  if you can, to use the zoom and 3D effects when they make sense in the presentation. You can for example mention the main topics on one slide, and then zoom in on each topic when you discuss
       it in more detail. That way the effects help clarify the presentation, rather than distract from it.

   Custom fonts
       Browsers tend to render things subtly differently.

       They also have different default fonts, and different operating systems have different implementations of the same fonts. So to make sure you have as much control over the design as possible,  you
       should  always  include  fonts  with the presentation. A good source for free fonts are Google Webfonts. Those fonts are free and open source, so you can use them with no cost and no risk of being
       sued. They can also be downloaded or included online.

   Online vs Downloaded
       If you are making a presentation that is going to run on your computer at a conference or customer meeting, always download the fonts and have them as a part of the presentation.  Put  them  in  a
       folder called fonts under the folder where your presentation is.

       You also need to define the font-family in your CSS. Font Squirrel's webfont generator will provide you with a platform-independent toolkit for generating both the varius font formats and the CSS.

       If the presentation is online only, you can put an @include-statement in your CSS to include Googles webfonts directly:

          @import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Libre+Baskerville|Racing+Sans+One|Satisfy);

       But don't use this for things you need to show on your computer, as it requires you to have internet access.

   Test with different browsers
       If you are putting the presentation online, test it with a couple of major browsers, to make sure nothing breaks and that everything still looks good.  Not only are there subtle differences in how
       things may get positioned, different browsers are also good at different things.

       I've tested some browsers, all on Ubuntu, and it is likely that they behave differently on other operating systems, so you have to try for yourself.

   Firefox
       Firefox  18  is  quite slow to use with impress.js, especially for 3D stuff, so it can have very jerky movements from slide to slide. It does keep text looking good no matter how much you zoom. On
       the other hand, it refuses to scale text infinitely, so if you scale too much characters will not grow larger, they will instead start moving around.

       Firefox 19 is better, but for 3D stuff it's still a bit slow.

   Chrome
       Chrome 24 is fast, but will not redraw text in different sizes, but will instead create an image of them and rescale them, resulting in the previous slide having a fuzzy pixelated effect.

   Epiphany
       Epiphany 3.4.1 is comparable to Firefox 19, possibly a bit smoother, and the text looks good. But it has bugs in how it handles 3D data, and the location bar is visible in fullscreen mode,  making
       it less suitable for any sort of presentation.

TEMPLATES
       Luckily,  for  most cases you don't need to create your own template, as the default template is very simple and most things you need to do is doable with css. However, I don't want Hovercraft! to
       set up a wall where it isn't flexible enough for your needs, so I added support to make your own templates.

       You need to create your own template if you are unsatisfied with the HTML that Hovercraft! generates, for example if you need to use another version of HTML or if the reStructuredText you are  us‐
       ing  isn't  being rendered in a way that is useful for you. Although if you aren't happy with the HTML generated from the reStructuredText that could very well be a bug, so open an issue on Github
       for discussion.

       Hovercraft! generates presentations by converting the reStructuredText into XML and then using XSLT to translate the XML into HTML.

       Templates are directories with a configuration file, a template XSL file, and any number of CSS, JS and other resource files.

   The template configuration file
       The configuration file is normally called template.cfg, but if you have several configuration files in one template directory, you can specify which one to use by specifying the full path  to  the
       configuration file. However, if you just specify the template directory, template.cfg will be used.

       Template files are in configparser format, which is an extended ini-style format. They are very simple, and have only one section, [hovercraft]. Any other sections will be ignored. Many of the pa‐
       rameters are lists that often do not fit on one line. In that case you can split the line up over several lines, but indenting the lines. The amount of indentation doesn't make any difference, ex‐
       cept aesthetically.

       The parameters in the [hovercraft] section are:

          • template The name of the xsl template.

          • css A list of CSS filenames separated by whitespace. These files will get included in the final file with "all" as the media specification.

          • css-<media>  A  list  of  CSS  filenames  separated by whitespace. These files will get included in the final file with the media given in the parameter. So the files listed for the parameter
            "css-print" will get "print" as their media specification and a key like "css-screen,print" will return media "screen,print".

          • js-header A list of filenames separated by whitespace. These files will get included in the target file as header script links.

          • js-body A list of filenames separated by whitespace. These files will get included in the target file as script links at the end of the file. The files impress.js, impressConsole.js and  hov‐
            ercraft.js typically need to be included here.

          • resources  A list of filenames separated by whitespace that will be copied to the target directory, but nothing else is done with them. Images and fonts used by CSS will be copied anyway, but
            other resources may be added here.

          • resource-directories A list of directory names separated by whitespace. These will be treated like resources above, ie only copied to the target directory.  The  directory  contents  will  be
            copied recursively, but hidden files (like files starting with a . are ignored.

       An example:

          [hovercraft]
          template = template.xsl

          css = css/screen.css

          css-print = css/print.css

          js-header = js/dateinput.js

          js-body = js/impress.js
                    js/hovercraft.js

          resources = images/back.png
                      images/forward.png
                      images/up.png
                      images/down.png

   The template file
       The file specified with the template parameters is the actual XSLT template that will perform the translation from XML to HTML.

       Most  of  the time you can just copy the default template file in hovercraft/templates/default/template.xsl and modify it. XSLT is very complex, but modifying the templates HTML is quite straight‐
       forward as long as you don't have to touch any of the <xsl:...> tags.

       Also, the HTML that is generated is XHTML compatible and quite straightforward, so for the most case all you would need to generate another version of HTML, for example strict XHTML, would  be  to
       change the doctype.

       But  if  you need to add or change the main generated HTML you can add and change HTML statements in this main file as you like. See for example how the little help-popup is added to the bottom of
       the HTML.

       If you want to change the way the reStructuredText is rendered things get slightly more complex. The XSLT rules that convert the reStructuredText XML into HTML are contained in  a  separate  file,
       reST.xsl. For the most part you can just include it in the template file with the following code:

          <xsl:import href="resource:templates/reST.xsl" />

       The  resource: part here is not a part of XSLT, but a part of Hovercraft!  It tells the XSLT translation that the file specified should not be looked up on the file system, but as a Python package
       resource. Currently the templates/reST.xsl file is the only XSLT resource import available.

       If you need to change the way reStructuredText is rendered you need to make a copy of that file and modify it. You then need to make a copy of the main template and change the reference in  it  to
       your modified XSLT file.

       None of the XSLT files need to be copied to the target, and should not be listed as a resource in the template configuration file.
