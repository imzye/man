NAME
       apticron - Generate a mail listing packages which are pending an upgrade

SYNOPSIS
       apticron [--cron]

DESCRIPTION
       apticron is a shell script which generates a mail with a list of all packages currently pending an upgrade, as well as summary of changes - using apt-listchanges - to a configurable Email address.

       apticron is mainly intended for automatic notification of pending security updates but can also be used in many other situations where timely updates are necessary.

       The --cron option is only meant to be used when invoked by cron in order to run no more than once a day.

FILES
       /etc/apticron/apticron.conf
              Custom  settings  go into this file, such as email and profile for apt-listchanges. You can use /usr/lib/apticron/apticron.conf as a template.  The values set in /etc/apticron/apticron.conf
              will override the default settings in /usr/lib/apticron/apticron.conf.

       /etc/cron.d/apticron
              Cron job for executing apticron daily.

       /var/lib/apticron/cron_run
              Time stamp file used by apticron when invoked with --cron option.

SEE ALSO
       apt-get(8), apt-listchanges(1), cron(8)

BUGS
       In a particular situation apticron may report non-installed packages to be upgraded. It's inconvenient, but it's not a bug in apticron itself. Please see https://bugs.debian.org/544481#105 for de‐
       tails.
