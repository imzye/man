NAME
       App::Nopaste::Service::Gist - Service provider for GitHub gist - http://gist.github.com/

VERSION
       version 1.013

GitHub Authorization
       In order to create gists you have to get an oauth token. That could be easily obtained via curl:

           curl -X POST 'https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@api.github.com/authorizations' \
               -d '{"scopes":["gist"],"note":"App::Nopaste"}'

       or you can use this module to do the same:

           perl -MApp::Nopaste::Service::Gist -e 'App::Nopaste::Service::Gist->create_token'

       You can also generate a token by navigating to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and generate a new token with the 'Create gists' ability.

       Then, export the resulting token as the the "GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN" environment variable.  This will grant gist rights to App::Nopaste (or anything else that Don't worry, you can revoke access rights
       anytime from the GitHub profile settings.

       Alternatively, you can export the "GITHUB_USER" and "GITHUB_PASSWORD" environment variables, just like for the gist <https://github.com/defunkt/gist> utility.

       You can also simply store your credentials in plaintext in ~/.github as in:

           login bob
           password ilikeducks

       That's it!
