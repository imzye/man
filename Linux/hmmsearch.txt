NAME
       hmmsearch - search profile(s) against a sequence database

SYNOPSIS
       hmmsearch [options] <hmmfile> <seqdb>

DESCRIPTION
       hmmsearch  is  used to search one or more profiles against a sequence database.  For each profile in <hmmfile>, use that query profile to search the target database of sequences in <seqdb>, and output
       ranked lists of the sequences with the most significant matches to the profile.  To build profiles from multiple alignments, see hmmbuild.

       Either the query <hmmfile> or the target <seqdb> may be '-' (a dash character), in which case the query profile or target database input will be read from a <stdin> pipe instead of from a  file.  Only
       one  input  source  can  come through <stdin>, not both.  An exception is that if the <hmmfile> contains more than one profile query, then <seqdb> cannot come from <stdin>, because we can't rewind the
       streaming target database to search it with another profile.

       The output format is designed to be human-readable, but is often so voluminous that reading it is impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The --tblout and --domtblout options save output in simple tab‐
       ular formats that are concise and easier to parse.  The -o option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing it away in /dev/null.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING OUTPUT
       -o <f> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <f> instead of the default stdout.

       -A <f> Save a multiple alignment of all significant hits (those satisfying inclusion thresholds) to the file <f>.

       --tblout <f>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-target output, with one data line per homologous target sequence found.

       --domtblout <f>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-domain output, with one data line per homologous domain detected in a query sequence for each homologous model.

       --acc  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       --noali
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       --notextw
              Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120 characters per line, which helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but can truncate
              target profile description lines.

       --textw <n>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <n> characters per line. The default is 120.

OPTIONS CONTROLLING REPORTING THRESHOLDS
       Reporting thresholds control which hits are reported in output files (the main output, --tblout, and --domtblout).  Sequence hits and domain hits are ranked by statistical significance  (E-value)  and
       output  is generated in two sections called per-target and per-domain output. In per-target output, by default, all sequence hits with an E-value <= 10 are reported. In the per-domain output, for each
       target that has passed per-target reporting thresholds, all domains satisfying per-domain reporting thresholds are reported. By default, these are domains with conditional E-values of <= 10. The  fol‐
       lowing options allow you to change the default E-value reporting thresholds, or to use bit score thresholds instead.

       -E <x> In  the  per-target output, report target sequences with an E-value of <= <x>.  The default is 10.0, meaning that on average, about 10 false positives will be reported per query, so you can see
              the top of the noise and decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       -T <x> Instead of thresholding per-profile output on E-value, instead report target sequences with a bit score of >= <x>.

       --domE <x>
              In the per-domain output, for target sequences that have already satisfied the per-profile reporting threshold, report individual domains with a conditional E-value of <= <x>.  The  default  is
              10.0.   A  conditional  E-value  means  the expected number of additional false positive domains in the smaller search space of those comparisons that already satisfied the per-target reporting
              threshold (and thus must have at least one homologous domain already).

       --domT <x>
              Instead of thresholding per-domain output on E-value, instead report domains with a bit score of >= <x>.

OPTIONS FOR INCLUSION THRESHOLDS
       Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.  Inclusion thresholds control which hits are considered to be reliable enough to be included in an output alignment or a subsequent  search
       round, or marked as significant ("!") as opposed to questionable ("?")  in domain output.

       --incE <x>
              Use  an  E-value  of  <=  <x> as the per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01, meaning that on average, about 1 false positive would be expected in every 100 searches with different
              query sequences.

       --incT <x>
              Instead of using E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, instead use a bit score of >= <x> as the per-target inclusion threshold.  By default this option is unset.

       --incdomE <x>
              Use a conditional E-value of <= <x> as the per-domain inclusion threshold, in targets that have already satisfied the overall per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01.

       --incdomT <x>
              Instead of using E-values, use a bit score of >= <x> as the per-domain inclusion threshold.

OPTIONS FOR MODEL-SPECIFIC SCORE THRESHOLDING
       Curated profile databases may define specific bit score thresholds for each profile, superseding any thresholding based on statistical significance alone.

       To use these options, the profile must contain the appropriate (GA, TC, and/or NC) optional score threshold annotation; this is picked up by  hmmbuild  from  Stockholm  format  alignment  files.  Each
       thresholding  option  has  two  scores: the per-sequence threshold <x1> and the per-domain threshold <x2> These act as if -T<x1> --incT<x1> --domT<x2> --incdomT<x2> has been applied specifically using
       each model's curated thresholds.

       --cut_ga
              Use the GA (gathering) bit scores in the model to set per-sequence (GA1) and per-domain (GA2) reporting and inclusion thresholds. GA thresholds are generally considered to be the  reliable  cu‐
              rated thresholds defining family membership; for example, in Pfam, these thresholds define what gets included in Pfam Full alignments based on searches with Pfam Seed models.

       --cut_nc
              Use  the  NC (noise cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set per-sequence (NC1) and per-domain (NC2) reporting and inclusion thresholds. NC thresholds are generally considered to be the
              score of the highest-scoring known false positive.

       --cut_tc
              Use the TC (trusted cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set per-sequence (TC1) and per-domain (TC2) reporting and inclusion thresholds. TC thresholds are generally considered to be the
              score of the lowest-scoring known true positive that is above all known false positives.

OPTIONS CONTROLLING THE ACCELERATION PIPELINE
       HMMER3  searches are accelerated in a three-step filter pipeline: the MSV filter, the Viterbi filter, and the Forward filter. The first filter is the fastest and most approximate; the last is the full
       Forward scoring algorithm. There is also a bias filter step between MSV and Viterbi. Targets that pass all the steps in the acceleration pipeline are then subjected to postprocessing -- domain identi‐
       fication and scoring using the Forward/Backward algorithm.

       Changing  filter  thresholds  only  removes or includes targets from consideration; changing filter thresholds does not alter bit scores, E-values, or alignments, all of which are determined solely in
       postprocessing.

       --max  Turn off all filters, including the bias filter, and run full Forward/Backward postprocessing on every target. This increases sensitivity somewhat, at a large cost in speed.

       --F1 <x>
              Set the P-value threshold for the MSV filter step.  The default is 0.02, meaning that roughly 2% of the highest scoring nonhomologous targets are expected to pass the filter.

       --F2 <x>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Viterbi filter step.  The default is 0.001.

       --F3 <x>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Forward filter step.  The default is 1e-5.

       --nobias
              Turn off the bias filter. This increases sensitivity somewhat, but can come at a high cost in speed, especially if the query has biased residue composition (such as a  repetitive  sequence  re‐
              gion,  or if it is a membrane protein with large regions of hydrophobicity). Without the bias filter, too many sequences may pass the filter with biased queries, leading to slower than expected
              performance as the computationally intensive Forward/Backward algorithms shoulder an abnormally heavy load.

OTHER OPTIONS
       --nonull2
              Turn off the null2 score corrections for biased composition.

       -Z <x> Assert that the total number of targets in your searches is <x>, for the purposes of per-sequence E-value calculations, rather than the actual number of targets seen.

       --domZ <x>
              Assert that the total number of targets in your searches is <x>, for the purposes of per-domain conditional E-value calculations, rather than the number of targets  that  passed  the  reporting
              thresholds.

       --seed <n>
              Set  the  random  number seed to <n>.  Some steps in postprocessing require Monte Carlo simulation.  The default is to use a fixed seed (42), so that results are exactly reproducible. Any other
              positive integer will give different (but also reproducible) results. A choice of 0 uses a randomly chosen seed.

       --tformat <s>
              Assert that the target sequence database file is in format <s>.  Accepted formats include fasta, embl, genbank, ddbj, uniprot, stockholm, pfam, a2m, and afa.  The default is to  autodetect  the
              format of the file.

       --cpu <n>
              Set  the  number  of parallel worker threads to <n>.  By default, HMMER sets this to the number of CPU cores it detects in your machine - that is, it tries to maximize the use of your available
              processor cores. Setting <n> higher than the number of available cores is of little if any value, but you may want to set it to something less. You can also control this number  by  setting  an
              environment variable, HMMER_NCPU.

              This option is only available if HMMER was compiled with POSIX threads support. This is the default, but it may have been turned off at compile-time for your site or machine for some reason.

       --stall
              For  debugging  the  MPI  master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to attach debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the
              pause.  (Under gdb: (gdb) signal SIGCONT) (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.)

       --mpi  Run in MPI master/worker mode, using mpirun.  (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.)
