NAME
       NanoMsg::Raw::Message - Message buffer for NanoMsg::Raw

SYNOPSIS
           use NanoMsg::Raw;

           {
               my $msg = nn_allocmsg(3, 0);
               $msg->copy('foo');
               nn_send($sock, $msg);
           }

           {
               nn_recv($sock, my $buf);
               warn $buf;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Instances of this class represent a message buffer allocated by nanomsg. New empty buffers can be allocated using "nn_allocmsg". Both "nn_recv" and "nn_recvmsg" can be used to allocate buffers
       initialised with the contents of a received message.

       "NanoMsg::Raw::Message"s can be used to send and receive data in a zero-copy fashion.

       When using a message instance as a string, its overloading will produce a string containing a copy of the buffer content.

       A string pointing to the actual buffer content, without having to create a copy of it, can be obtained by dereferencing the message instance as a scalar.

       copy($data)
               $msg->copy('foo');

           Copies $data to the beginning of the buffer. If the data is larger than the space allocated for the buffer, an exception will be thrown.
