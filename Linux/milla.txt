NAME
       milla - wrapper for Milla profile

DESCRIPTION
       "milla" is a command line wrapper for Dist::Milla. It's a wrapper for "dzil", but with overriding default arguments for some commands such as "new", "release" and "install".

       Specifically:

       •   "milla new" is equivalent to "dzil new -P Milla"

       •   "milla install" is equivalent to "dzil install --install-command="cpanm .""

       •   "milla release" is equivalent to "DZIL_CONFIRMRELEASE_DEFAULT=1 dzil release"

       Other commands would behave exactly the same as "dzil".
