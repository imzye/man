NAME
       gping - ping(1), but with a graph

SYNOPSIS
       gping OPTIONS [HOSTS]

       gping ccc.de

       gping -s -b 20 ccc.de

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gping commmand.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       gping is essentially ping(1), but with a TUI graph.

OPTIONS
       --cmd  Graph the execution time for a list of commands rather than pinging hosts

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Print version information

       -n, --watch-interval <WATCH_INTERVAL>
              Watch interval seconds (provide partial seconds like `0.5').  Default for ping is 0.2, default for cmd is 0.5.

       -b, --buffer <BUFFER>
              Determines the number of seconds to display in the graph.  [default: 30]

       -4     Resolve ping targets to IPv4 address

       -6     Resolve ping targets to IPv6 address

       -i, --interface <INTERFACE>
              Interface to use when pinging.

       -s, --simple-graphics
              Uses dot characters instead of braille

       --vertical-margin <VERTICAL_MARGIN>
              Vertical margin around the graph (top and bottom) [default: 1]

       --horizontal-margin <VERTICAL_MARGIN>
              Horizontal margin around the graph (left and right) [default: 0]

       -c, –color <color>
              Assign  color to a graph entry.  This option can be defined more than once as a comma separated string, and the order which the colors are provided will be matched against the hosts or com‐
              mands passed to gping.  Hexadecimal RGB color codes are accepted in the form of `#RRGGBB' or the following color names: `black', `red', `green', `yellow', `blue', `magenta',`cyan',  `gray',
              `dark-gray', `light-red', `light-green', `light-yellow', `light-blue', `light-magenta', `light-cyan', and `white'
