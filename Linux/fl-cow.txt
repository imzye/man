NAME
       cow - wrapper to run single command using fl-cow

SYNOPSIS
       cow command [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This wrapper executes a single command using fl-cow, ensuring that the fl-cow library is appropriately preloaded.

NOTES
       fl-cow  is  a library to implement copy-on-write of hard linked files, that is if a program opens a file with write permissions the hard-linked copy is replaced by a non-hard linked version of the
       file.

EXAMPLES
       For instance, to run a shell with fl-cow enabled:

       cow bash

                                                                                               April 8, 2014                                                                                         cow(1)
