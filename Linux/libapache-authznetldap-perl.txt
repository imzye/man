DESCRIPTION
       After you have authenticated a user (perhaps with Apache::AuthNetLDAP ;) you can use this module to determine whether they are authorized to access the Web resource under this modules control.

       You can control authorization via one of four methods. The first two are pretty standard, the second two are unique to LDAP.

       "require" options --

       user -> Will authorize access if the authenticated user's username.

       valid-user -> Will authorize any authenticated user.

       group -> Will authorize any authenticated user who is a member of the LDAP group specified by groupdn. This module supports groupOfMember, groupOfUniquemember and Netscape's dynamic group object
       classes.

       ldap-url -> This will authorize any authenticated user who matches the query specified in the given LDAP URL. This is enables users to get the flexibility of Netscape's dynamic groups, even if
       their LDAP server does not support such a capability.

CONFIGURATION NOTES
        It is important to note that this module must be used in conjunction with an authentication module. (...?
       Is this true?  I just thought, that you might want to only authorize a user, instead of authenticate...)
       If you are using an authentication module, then the following lines will not need to be duplicated:

         PerlSetVar BindDN "cn=Directory Manager"
         PerlSetVar BindPWD "password"
         PerlSetVar BaseDN "ou=people,o=unt.edu"
         PerlSetVar LDAPServer ldap.unt.edu
         PerlSetVar LDAPPort 389
         PerlSetVar UIDAttr uid
        #PerlSetVar UIDAttr mail

         PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthNetLDAP

       The following lines will not need to be duplicated if supported by the authentication module:

         #require valid-user
         #require user mewilcox
         #require user mewilcox@venus.acs.unt.edu
         #require group "cn=Peoplebrowsers1,ou=UNTGroups,ou=People, o=unt.edu"
         #require ldap-url ldap://pandora.acs.unt.edu/o=unt.edu??sub?sn=wilcox
         #require ldap-url ldap://pandora.acs.unt.edu/o=unt.edu??sub?sn=smith
         #require ldap-url ldap://castor.acs.unt.edu/ou=people,o=unt.edu??sub?untcourse=

       Obviously, the ldap-url attribute is probably only support by this module.
