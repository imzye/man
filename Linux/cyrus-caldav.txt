NAME
       httpd - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       HTTP server process

SYNOPSIS
          httpd [ -C config-file ] [ -U uses ] [ -T timeout ] [ -D ]
              [ -H ] [ -s ] [ -p ssf ] [ -q ]

DESCRIPTION
       httpd  is  an HTTP server. It accepts commands on its standard input and responds on its standard output. It MUST be invoked by master(8) with those descriptors attached to a remote client connec‐
       tion.

       httpd reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by -C.

       If the directory <configdirectory>/log/user exists, then httpd will create protocol telemetry logs for sessions authenticating as user. The telemetry logs will be stored in the log/user  directory
       with a filename of the httpd process-id.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the default imapd.conf(5).

       -U uses
              The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.

       -T timeout
              The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new connection before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero) will disable the timeout.  The default is 60.

       -D     Run external debugger specified in debug_command.

       -H     Tell httpd to expect a HAProxy protocol header from the sender.

       -s     Serve HTTP over SSL (https).  All data to and from httpd is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer.

       -p ssf Tell httpd that an external layer exists.  An SSF (security strength factor) of 1 means an integrity protection layer exists.  Any higher SSF implies some form of privacy protection.

       -q     Ignore quotas on DAV appends. This feature was introduced in version 3.0.

EXAMPLES
       httpd is commonly included in the SERVICES section of cyrus.conf(5) like so:

          SERVICES {
              imap        cmd="imapd -U 30" listen="imap" prefork=0
              imaps       cmd="imapd -s -U 30" listen="imaps" prefork=0 maxchild=100
              lmtpunix    cmd="lmtpd" listen="/var/run/cyrus/socket/lmtp" prefork=0 maxchild=20
              sieve       cmd="timsieved" listen="sieve" prefork=0
              notify      cmd="notifyd" listen="/var/run/cyrus/socket/notify" proto="udp" prefork=1
              httpd       cmd="httpd" listen=8080 prefork=1 maxchild=20
          }

HISTORY
       A beta release of httpd was first introduced in the caldav branch of Cyrus in version 2.4.17, and was included in the mainline releases beginning in version 2.5.0.

       The quota override option, -q, was introduced with Cyrus version 3.0.
