SIG2DOT(1)                                                                                  General Commands Manual                                                                                  SIG2DOT(1)

NAME
       sig2dot - creates a .dot file from a GPG signature listing

SYNOPSIS
       sig2dot [OPTIONS] < input-file > output-file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the sig2dot command.  Sig2dot parses the output of "gpg --list-sigs" and produces a .dot file that can be used as input to a graphing program.

OPTIONS
       sig2dot accepts the following options:

       -b              Black and white / do not colorize.

       -d <date>       Render graph as it appeared on <date> (ignores more recent signatures).  Date must be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".  Will also ignore keys that have since been revoked.

       -s <html-file-name>
                       Produces a sory HTML statistics file with the number of signatures per node.

       -a              Graph all keys, even if they do not have a signature

       -r <key-revoked-string>
                       Sets  the  text  for  the  key-revoked string used by GnuPG. The default is what is used in the English version. This parameter can be set for versions of GnuPG localized to other lan‐
                       guages. Default: "[revoked".

       -t <title>      Sets the title for the graph generated. Default: "Keyring Statistics".

       -u <user-not-found-string>
                       Sets the text for the user-not-found string used by GnuPG. The default is what is used in the English version. This parameter can be set for versions of GnuPG localized to  other  lan‐
                       guages. Default: "[user id not found]".

       -q              Be quiet.

       -h              Print help and exit.

       -v              Print version and exit.
