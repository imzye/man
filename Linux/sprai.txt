NAME
       SPRAI - single-pass nucleotide sequencing read accuracy improvement

SYNOPSIS
       ezez_vx1 ec.spec {asm.spec | -ec_only} [options]
       ezez4qsub_vx1 ec.spec {asm.spec | -ec_only} [options]
       ezez4makefile_v4.pl ec.spec [asm.spec] && make -jnproc [ec_only]

DESCRIPTION
       Sprai  is  a  tool to correct sequencing errors in single-pass reads for de novo assembly. It is originally designed for correcting sequencing errors in single-molecule DNA sequencing reads, espe‐
       cially in Continuous Long Reads (CLRs) generated by PacBio RS sequencers. The goal of Sprai is not maximizing the accuracy of error-corrected reads. Instead, Sprai aims at maximizing the  continu‐
       ity (i.e., N50 contig length) of assembled contigs after error correction.

OPTIONS
       -n     Show parameters in ec.spec and exit.

       -ec_only
              Perform error correction only.  With this option, asm.spec does not need to be passed in, as assembly is not performed.

       -now yyyymmdd_hhmmss
              Use an existing result_yyyymmdd_hhmmss directory from a previous run, detect unfinished jobs, and restart at the appropriate stage.
