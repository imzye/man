NAME
       filetea - Web based file sharing service daemon

SYNOPSIS
       filetea [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the filetea command.

       FileTea  is a Web service that provides instant and anonymous file-sharing using only a standard browser as client. Unlike traditional Web based file-sharing services, FileTea does not store files
       server-side. Instead, files are just routed on-the-fly from seeder to leecher, through the server.

       filetea is the service daemon that runs on a FileTea server. It handles peer synchronization, file routing and status reporting; and also acts as web-server for static HTML  content  when  run  in
       standalone mode.
