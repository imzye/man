NAME
       spread-phy - analyze and visualize phylogeographic reconstructions

SYNOPSIS
       spread-phy

DESCRIPTION
       SPREAD is a user-friendly application to analyze and visualize phylogeographic reconstructions resulting from Bayesian inference of spatio-temporal diffusion.

       There is a tutorial for SPREAD online at http://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/tutorial/spread_tutorial.html

       Originally this program is named spread.  However, there is just such a package inside Debian and thus a 'phy-' for phylogeny was prepended.
