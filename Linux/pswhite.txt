NAME
       pswhite - PostScript filter.

SYNOPSIS
       pswhite < input_PostScript_file > output_PostScript_file

DESCRIPTION
       pswhite is a filter which reads a PostScript file as input and writes a PostScript file as output.  In the output file the filter forces a white background and complements the intensity values (values
       with R=G=B) so that the default white foreground appears as black on the white background.  This filter works only on PostScript files produced by ctrans - the CGM  translator  in  the  NCAR  Graphics
       software.
