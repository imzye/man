        secs     - Seconds since the system epoch
        dlptime  - Palm OS DlpDateTimeType (raw)
        datetime - Palm OS DateTimeType (raw)
        palmtime - Decoded date/time (a hashref)
                     KEY     VALUES
                     second  0-59
                     minute  0-59
                     hour    0-23
                     day     1-31
                     month   1-12
                     year    4 digits

SUBROUTINES
   datetime_to_palmtime
         $palmtime = datetime_to_palmtime($datetime)

       Converts Palm OS DateTimeType to a palmtime hashref.  In addition to the usual keys, $palmtime will contain a "wday" field.

   dlptime_to_palmtime
         $palmtime = dlptime_to_palmtime($dlptime)

       Converts Palm OS DlpDateTimeType to a palmtime hashref.

   dlptime_to_secs
         $secs = dlptime_to_secs($dlptime)

       Converts a Palm OS DlpDateTimeType to epoch time.

   palmtime_to_ascii
         $string = palmtime_to_secs(\%palmtime)

       Converts a palmtime hashref to a "YYYYMMDDhhmmss" string (e.g. 20011116200051).  %palmtime must contain all standard fields.

   palmtime_to_dlptime
         $dlptime = palmtime_to_dlptime(\%palmtime)

       Converts a palmtime hashref to a Palm OS DlpDateTimeType.  %palmtime must contain all standard fields.

   palmtime_to_iso8601
         $string = palmtime_to_iso8601(\%palmtime)

       Converts a palmtime hashref to a "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ" string (e.g. "2001-11-16T20:00:51Z").  %palmtime must contain all standard fields.  GMT timezone ("Z") is assumed.

   palmtime_to_secs
         $secs = palmtime_to_secs(\%palmtime)

       Converts a palmtime hashref to epoch seconds.  %palmtime must contain all standard fields.

   secs_to_dlptime
         $dlptime = secs_to_dlptime($secs)

       Converts epoch time to a Palm OS DlpDateTimeType.

   secs_to_palmtime
         $palmtime = secs_to_palmtime($secs)

       Converts epoch seconds to a palmtime hashref.
