NAME
       mandos.conf - Configuration file for the Mandos server

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/mandos/mandos.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/mandos/mandos.conf is a configuration file for mandos(8), and is read by it at startup. The configuration file starts with “[DEFAULT]” on a line by itself, followed by any number of
       “option=value” entries, with continuations in the style of RFC 822.  “option: value” is also accepted. Note that leading whitespace is removed from values. Lines beginning with “#” or “;” are
       ignored and may be used to provide comments.

OPTIONS
       interface = NAME
           If this is specified, the server will only announce the service and listen to requests on the specified network interface. Default is to use all available interfaces.  Note: a failure to bind
           to the specified interface is not considered critical, and the server will not exit, but instead continue normally.

       address = ADDRESS
           If this option is used, the server will only listen to the specified IPv6 address. If a link-local address is specified, an interface should be set, since a link-local address is only valid on
           a single interface. By default, the server will listen to all available addresses. If set, this must normally be an IPv6 address; an IPv4 address can only be specified using IPv4-mapped IPv6
           address syntax: “::FFFF:192.0.2.3”. (Only if IPv6 usage is disabled (see below) must this be an IPv4 address.)

       port = NUMBER
           If this option is used, the server will bind to that port. By default, the server will listen to an arbitrary port given by the operating system.

       debug = { 1 | yes | true | on | 0 | no | false | off }
           If the server is run in debug mode, it will run in the foreground and print a lot of debugging information. The default is to not run in debug mode.

       priority = STRING
           GnuTLS priority string for the TLS handshake. The default is

           “SECURE128:!CTYPE-X.509:+CTYPE-RAWPK:!RSA:!VERS-ALL:+VERS-TLS1.3:%PROFILE_ULTRA” when using raw public keys in TLS, and “SECURE256:!CTYPE-X.509:+CTYPE-OPENPGP:!RSA:+SIGN-DSA-SHA256” when using
           OpenPGP keys in TLS,. See gnutls_priority_init(3) for the syntax.  Warning: changing this may make the TLS handshake fail, making server-client communication impossible. Changing this option
           may also make the network traffic decryptable by an attacker.

       servicename = NAME
           Zeroconf service name. The default is “Mandos”. This only needs to be changed if for some reason is would be necessary to run more than one server on the same host. This would not normally be
           useful. If there are name collisions on the same network, the newer server will automatically rename itself to “Mandos #2”, and so on; therefore, this option is not needed in that case.

       use_dbus = { 1 | yes | true | on | 0 | no | false | off }
           This option controls whether the server will provide a D-Bus system bus interface. The default is to provide such an interface.

       use_ipv6 = { 1 | yes | true | on | 0 | no | false | off }
           This option controls whether the server will use IPv6 sockets and addresses. The default is to use IPv6. This option should never normally be turned off, even in IPv4-only environments. This
           is because mandos-client(8mandos) will normally use IPv6 link-local addresses, and will not be able to find or connect to the server if this option is turned off.  Only advanced users should
           consider changing this option.

       restore = { 1 | yes | true | on | 0 | no | false | off }
           This option controls whether the server will restore its state from the last time it ran. Default is to restore last state.

       statedir = DIRECTORY
           Directory to save (and restore) state in. Default is “/var/lib/mandos”.

       socket = NUMBER
           If this option is used, the server will not create a new network socket, but will instead use the supplied file descriptor. By default, the server will create a new network socket.

FILES
       The file described here is /etc/mandos/mandos.conf

BUGS
       The [DEFAULT] is necessary because the Python built-in module ConfigParser requires it.

       Please report bugs to the Mandos development mailing list: <mandos-dev@recompile.se> (subscription required). Note that this list is public. The developers can be reached privately at

EXAMPLE
       No options are actually required:

           [DEFAULT]

       An example using all the options:

           [DEFAULT]
           # A configuration example
           interface = enp1s0
           address = fe80::aede:48ff:fe71:f6f2
           port = 1025
           debug = True
           priority = SECURE128:!CTYPE-X.509:+CTYPE-RAWPK:!RSA:!VERS-ALL:+VERS-TLS1.3:%PROFILE_ULTRA
           servicename = Daena
           use_dbus = False
           use_ipv6 = True
           restore = True
           statedir = /var/lib/mandos

           Section 2.5.5.2: IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address

           Section 2.5.6, Link-Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses
               The clients use IPv6 link-local addresses, which are immediately usable since a link-local addresses is automatically assigned to a network interface when it is brought up.

       Zeroconf[1]
           Zeroconf is the network protocol standard used by clients for finding the Mandos server on the local network.
