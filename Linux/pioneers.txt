NAME
       pioneers - network implementation of Settlers of Catan

SYNOPSIS
       pioneers [ --server server ] [ --port port ] [ --name name ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pioneers command.

       Pioneers  is  an implementation of the popular, award-winning "Settlers of Catan" board game for the GNOME desktop environment.  It uses a client/server model for networked play of between two and
       eight players.  You will need to connect to a machine running either pioneers-server-gtk or pioneers-server-console to play.  An AI client, pioneersai, is also available.

OPTIONS
       Pioneers accepts the standard GTK+/GNOME commandline options, and the following options:

       -s, --server server
              Hostname of the server

       -p, --port port
              Portname of the server

       -n, --name name
              Use this name for the player instead of the name in the settings file

       -v, --spectator
              Connect as spectator instead of as a player

       -m, --metaserver metaserver
              Connect to this metaserver instead of the metaserver in the settings file

       --debug
              Turn on debugging mode

       --version
              Show the version and quit

       When the server and port are both provided, the client automatically quits when the connection is broken.

ENVIRONMENT
       The default settings can be influenced with the following environment variable:

       PIONEERS_METASERVER
              The hostname of the metaserver.  If it is not set, the default metaserver will be used.
