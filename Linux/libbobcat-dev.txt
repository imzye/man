NAME
       Bobcat - Overview of classes in the Bobcat library

DESCRIPTION
       The classes of the Bobcat library may be used after including bobcat/classname in sources.

       Generally, programs using the Bobcat library must be at least linked against the Bobcat library. Refer to section LINKING for more informatin about linking programs to required libraries.

       All classes and other elements are defined in the FBB namespace. For some classes manipulators are available, which are defined in the FBB namespace. An overview of all manipulators defined in the
       FBB namespace is provided by man -e bobcat manipulators.

LINKING
       To link programs against the shared Bobcat library (e.g., libbobcat6.so) it is usually sufficient to merely specify -lbobcat. E.g.,

           g++ --std=c++2a main.cc -lbobcat

       Note: libraries that are indirectly required are no longer automatically linked to your program. With some classes (e.g., BigInt) the libcrypto library must also be specified, and  programs  using
       such classes must be linked against bobcat and crypto:

           g++ --std=c++2a main.cc -lbobcat -lcrypto

       Man-pages of classes requiring additional libraries mention these additional libraries in their SYNOPSIS sections.

       When using static linking, the situation is slightly more problematic, and no general rule can be provided here. To create a statically linked program the flag -static must be provided, but in ad‐
       dition  the -pthread flag must often be specified as well. If, when statically linking your program, undefined references to pthread_... identifiers are reported, then that is a sure sign that you
       need to provide the -pthread flag as well.

       When using static linking additional libraries, not specified at the man-pages, may also be required. E.g., when using the Xpointer class and using static linking, the command becomes:

           g++  main.cc -static -pthread -lbobcat -lX11 -lxcb  -lXdmcp -lXau

       When encountering undefined references when using static linking missing libraries may be suggested by the linker or by its error messages. Alternatively, the missing libraries  may  be  found  by
       searching the Internet.
