NAME
       farpd — ARP reply daemon

SYNOPSIS
       farpd [-d] [-i interface] [net ...]

DESCRIPTION
       farpd  replies  to any ARP request for an IP address matching the specified destination net with the hardware MAC address of the specified interface, but only after determining if another host al‐
       ready claims it.

       Any IP address claimed by farpd is eventually forgotten after a period of inactivity or after a hard timeout, and is relinquished if the real owner shows up.

       This enables a single host to claim all unassigned addresses on a LAN for network monitoring or simulation.

       farpd exits on an interrupt or termination signal.

       Note: The program name farpd has been changed in Debian GNU/Linux from the original name (arpd) to avoid name clash with other ARP daemons.

       The options are as follows:

       -d      Do not daemonize, and enable verbose debugging messages.

       -i interface
               Listen on interface.  If unspecified, farpd searches the system interface list for the lowest numbered, configured ``up'' interface (excluding loopback).

       net     The IP address or network (specified in CIDR notation) or IP address ranges to claim (e.g. ``10.0.0.3'', ``10.0.0.0/16'' or ``10.0.0.5-10.0.0.15''). If unspecified, farpd will  attempt  to
               claim any IP address it sees an ARP request for.  Mutiple addresses may be specified.

BUGS
       farpd  will  respond too slowly to ARP requests for some applications. In order to ensure that it does not claim existing IP addresses it will send two ARP request and wait for a reply. This slow‐
       ness affects the nmap network scanning tool, and possibly others, which uses by default ARP when scanning local networks. The answers from farpd will come after the tool has  timeout  waiting  for
       the ARP replies and, consequently, IP addresses claimed by farpd will not be discovered.
