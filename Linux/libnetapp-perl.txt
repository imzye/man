NAME
       NetApp::Snapshot -- OO class for creating and managing snapshots

SYNOPSIS
           use NetApp::Filer;
           use NetApp::Snapshot;

           my $filer   = NetApp::Filer->new( .... );

DESCRIPTION
       This class encapsulates a single NetApp snapshot, and provides methods for querying information about the snapshot, as well as methods for managing it.

METHODS
   get_parent
       Returns the NetApp::Aggregate or NetApp::Volume object for the aggregate or volume for which object is a snapshot.

   get_name
       Returns a string representing the name of the snapshot.

   get_date
       Returns the date the snapshot was created.

   get_used
       Returns the percentage of space used by snapshot.

   get_total
       Returns the percentage of total space used by the snapshot.

   get_snapshot_deltas
       Returns an array of NetApp::Snapshot:Delta objects, each representing a single delta for this snapshot.

   get_reclaimable
       Returns the amount of reclaimable space, if the snapshot is deleted.  Note that experimentally, this command has a lot of failure scenarios, most of which are reasonable (there are a lot of cases
       where you can't query this data).  Therefore, unlike most of the methods in this API, it doesn't raise a fatal exception if it can't query the information, it simply generates warnings.

   rename( $newname )
       Renames the snapshot to the specified name.

   restore( %args )
       This method is an interface to the "snap restore" command.  The argument syntax is:

           $snapshot->restore(
               type            => 'vol' | 'file', # Defaults to vol
               from_path       => $from_path,
               to_path         => $to_path,
           );

       The 'type' argument maps to the -t CLI argument, and the 'to_path' argument maps to the -r CLI argument.  Refer to the na_snap(1) man page, and the "snap restore" documentation for further
       information.
