NAME
       inetcat - Opens a read/write interface via STDIN/STDOUT to a TCP port on a usbmux device

SYNOPSIS
       inetcat [OPTIONS] <DEVICE_TCP_PORT>

DESCRIPTION
       inetcat is a simple netcat-like tool that allows opening a read/write interface to a TCP port on a usbmux device and exposing it via STDIN/STDOUT.

OPTIONS
       -u, --udid UDID
              Target specific device by UDID. Note that if this option is not specified, inetcat will connect to the first device found.

       -n, --network
              Connect  to  network device. The device needs to have WiFi sync enabled and needs to be paired with this computer for this to work. Please note that a device might close connections at any time
              to save power.  This option will make inetcat connect to network attched devices only, unless -l is passed too (see below).

       -l, --local
              Connect to USB device. This is the default if no option is passed. If used together with -n, inetcat will first attempt a connection to a device attached via USB, and if not  available  attempt
              to reach a device via network.

       -h, --help
              Prints usage information.

       -d, --debug
              Increase debug level.

EXAMPLE
       Use ssh ProxyCommand to connect to a jailbroken iOS device via SSH:

       $ ssh -oProxyCommand="inetcat 22" root@localhost

       Used in SSH config file to connect to iOS Device:

       $ cat ~/.ssh/config Host myiphone
         User root
         ProxyCommand "icat 22 UDID_of_my_iphone" $ ssh myiphone
