NAME
       jsonlint - A JSON syntax validator and formatter tool

SYNOPSIS
       jsonlint [-v][-s|-S][-f|-F][-ecodec]inputfile.json...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jsonlint commands.

OPTIONS
       The return status will be 0 if the file is legal JSON, or non-zero otherwise.  Use -v to see the warning details.

       Options are: -v, -s, -S, -f, -F, -e

       -v, --verbose
              Show details of lint checking

       -s, --strict
              Be strict in what is considered legal JSON (the default)

       -S, --nonstrict
              Be loose in what is considered legal JSON

       -f, --format
              Reformat the JSON (if legal) to stdout

       -F, --format-compactly
              Reformat the JSON similar to -f, but do so compactly by removing all unnecessary whitespace

       -e codec, --encoding=codec

       --input-encoding=codec --output-encoding=codec
              Set  the  input and output character encoding codec (e.g., ascii, utf8, utf-16).  The -e will set both the input and output encodings to the same thing.  If not supplied, the input encoding
              is guessed according to the JSON specification.  The output encoding defaults to UTF-8, and is used when reformatting (via the -f or -F options).

              When reformatting, all members of objects (associative arrays) are always output in lexigraphical sort order.  The default output codec is UTF-8, unless the -e option is provided.  Any Uni‐
              code characters will be output as literal characters if the encoding permits, otherwise they will be -escaped.  You can use "-e ascii" to force all Unicode characters to be escaped.
