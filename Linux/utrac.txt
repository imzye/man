NAME
       utrac - recognize and convert charset and end-of-line of text files

SYNOPSIS
       utrac [OPTION] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Utrac  is a tool (and a library) that recognize the charset and the end of line type used in a text file. It can also convert it. In case of 8bits charsets, recognition is not sure, so it can also as‐
       sist the user to choose the correct charset, for instance by filtering the text and displaying only lines that matter.

OPTIONS
       With no FILE, read standard input. With no OPTION, recognize and write converted text to standard output.

       -p, --print-charset
              Print the name of the charset that suits best the input file.

       -P, --print-all-charset
              Print ranked list of charsets.  The first column is the mark with locale bonus (language and system), the second is the mark brut, the third is the checksum of all extended character  (to  know
              which charsets produce the same results) and the fourth is the charset name (on the same line if their mark with bonus and their checksum are identical).
              If the recognition is sure (ASCII or UTF-8), print only one name.

       -f, --from
              Force input charset (disable recognition) and/or EOL. For instance, "UTF-8/CRLF".

       -t, --to
              Select output charset and/or EOL. See above.

       -L, --language
              Select language. All charsets that fit this language will get a bonus during recognition. If none specified, LC_* variables are used.

       -S, --system
              Select system. All charsets that fit this language will get a bonus during recognition.

       -x, --ext-chars
              Print lines with extended characters (try to print each extended character not more than once).

       -d, --distribution
              Print distribution, i.e. the count of each 8bits character.

       -a, --all-ext-chars
              Print each extended character of the file in each different charset (UTF-8 output is recommended).

       -c, --colors
              (with -x or -a) Use color.

       -b, --bar
              Display a progress bar.

       -i, --info
              Print default/chosen parameters.

       -l, --list
              List charsets/eol/languages/systems.

       -h, --help
              Print some help.

       -v, --version
              Print version.

FILES
       charset.dat
              This  file  should  be  located in /usr/local/share/utrac/ or /usr/share/utrac/. It contains informations about charsets and their related charmap. If you want to add new charsets (they must be
              8bits and ASCII compatible), check the script  merge.pl in Utrac source directory.

BUGS
       Utrac is still a beta version, so you can expect to find some bugs...  Please report them to <antoine@alliancemca.net>. If you have a text file that is not well recognize by Utrac, please send  it  to
       improve the recognition algorithm.
