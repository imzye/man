NAME
       ntpsweep - print various information about given NTP servers

SYNOPSIS
       ntpsweep [-V | --version] [-l host]... [-p] [-m number] [-s prefix] [-h string] [hostfile...]

DESCRIPTION
       ntpsweep prints per host the NTP stratum level, the clock offset in seconds, the daemon version, the operating system and the processor. Optionally recursing through all peers.

       If no hosts are specified, ntpsweep reports on localhost.

       ntpsweep relies on ntpq and Mode 6 queries to probe servers. This depends on the remote host’s restrict configuration allowing queries. Nowadays effectively all public hosts set noquery, so this
       script is unlikely to be useful unless you have multiple specially- configured timeservers on a LAN.

OPTIONS
       -l string, --host-list=string
           Host to execute actions on. This option may appear an unlimited number of times.

           Use this option to specify the host on which this script operates. May appear multiple times. Multiple hosts may be specified, delimited by commas.

       -p, --peers
           Recursively list all peers a host synchronizes to.

       -m number, --maxlevel=number
           Traverse peers up to this level (4 is a reasonable number). This option takes an integer number as its argument.

       -s string, --strip=string
           Strip this string from hostnames.

       -h string, --host=string
           Specify a single host. Deprecated option for backwards compatibility.

       -V, --version
           Print the version string and exit.

       If hostfiles are specified, they are treated as lists of hostnames to be swept, one per line.

EXIT STATUS
       One of the following exit values will be returned:

       0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
           Successful program execution.

       1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
           The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
