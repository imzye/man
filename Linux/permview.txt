NAME
       permview  -  Viewer  for  declarative  security  permission sets inside
       assemblies.

SYNOPSIS
       permview [options] assembly

DESCRIPTION
       This tools allow to list the declarative security attributes present in
       an  assembly.  The security attributes are either found on the assembly
       level, on the classes and the methods. This tool is useful to  diagnose
       why  an assembly won't load or why some class/method throws SecurityEx‐
       ception.

OPTIONS
       -output filename
              Output all declarative security attributes related  informations
              into the specified file.

       -xml | --xml | /XML
              Output all declarative security attributes in an XML format.

       -decl | --decl | /DECL
              Show declarative security attributes on classes and methods. The
              default, without the -decl option, is to show only the  assembly
              level permission sets.

       -? | /? | -h[elp] | /h[elp]
              Display help informations about the permview tool.

EXAMPLES
       permview mscorlib.dll
              This  will  show  the  minimum, optional and refused permissions
              sets (i.e. the assembly level security actions)  that  are  com‐
              piled inside the mscorlib assembly.

       permview -decl permview.exe
              This will show all (assembly, class or method level) declarative
              security attributes present in the permview.exe assembly.
