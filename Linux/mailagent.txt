NAME
       edusers - edit users list created by package

SYNOPSIS
       edusers [system [version]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command lets you safely edit the users list created by the package command. It locks the file before launching the editor, hence protecting against any concurrent update by some package com‐
       mand that could arrive at the same time (by e-mail). The level of protection this locking buys you depends on the locking policy you have configured in your ~/.mailagent.

       If you are within a package source tree, all you need to say is

            edusers

       to edit the users file for that package. In order for that particular feature to work properly, the package must have been placed under dist control, or at least the packinit command from the dist
       package must have been run.

       Otherwise, you may specify a system name, and optionally a version number if that is not enough to disambiguate. Using '-' will get you the lattest version available.

       In any case, there must be a proper setting of the distribs file to use this command. If that file is not accurate, the package command will not be able to produce a users file anyway.

ENVIRONMENT
       The editor is taken out of the EDITOR variable if defined, then from the VISUAL variable, defaulting to /usr/ae if none of the variables is set.

FILES
       ~/.mailagent        configuration file for mailagent.
       Spool/distribs      distribution list, same file as the one used for mailpatch.
       System/.package     file created by dist's packinit command to indicate the root of the source tree for that package.
       System/users        list of users of that system.
       Log/agentlog        mailagent's log file.
