NAME
       MooseX::Types::Path::Tiny - Path::Tiny types and coercions for Moose

VERSION
       version 0.012

SYNOPSIS
         ### specification of type constraint with coercion

         package Foo;

         use Moose;
         use MooseX::Types::Path::Tiny qw/Path Paths AbsPath/;

         has filename => (
           is => 'ro',
           isa => Path,
           coerce => 1,
         );

         has directory => (
           is => 'ro',
           isa => AbsPath,
           coerce => 1,
         );

         has filenames => (
           is => 'ro',
           isa => Paths,
           coerce => 1,
         );

         ### usage in code

         Foo->new( filename => 'foo.txt' ); # coerced to Path::Tiny
         Foo->new( directory => '.' ); # coerced to path('.')->absolute
         Foo->new( filenames => [qw/bar.txt baz.txt/] ); # coerced to ArrayRef[Path::Tiny]

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides Path::Tiny types for Moose.  It handles two important types of coercion:

       •   coercing objects with overloaded stringification

       •   coercing to absolute paths

       It also can check to ensure that files or directories exist.

SUBTYPES
       This module uses MooseX::Types to define the following subtypes.

   Path
       "Path" ensures an attribute is a Path::Tiny object.  Strings and objects with overloaded stringification may be coerced.

   AbsPath
       "AbsPath" is a subtype of "Path" (above), but coerces to an absolute path.

   File, AbsFile
       These are just like "Path" and "AbsPath", except they check "-f" to ensure the file actually exists on the filesystem.

   Dir, AbsDir
       These are just like "Path" and "AbsPath", except they check "-d" to ensure the directory actually exists on the filesystem.

   Paths, AbsPaths
       These are arrayrefs of "Path" and "AbsPath", and include coercions from arrayrefs of strings.

CAVEATS
   Path vs File vs Dir
       "Path" just ensures you have a Path::Tiny object.

       "File" and "Dir" check the filesystem.  Don't use them unless that's really what you want.

   Usage with File::Temp
       Be  careful  if you pass in a File::Temp object. Because the argument is stringified during coercion into a Path::Tiny object, no reference to the original File::Temp argument is held.  Be sure to
       hold an external reference to it to avoid immediate cleanup of the temporary file or directory at the end of the enclosing scope.

       A better approach is to use Path::Tiny's own "tempfile" or "tempdir" constructors, which hold the reference for you.

           Foo->new( filename => Path::Tiny->tempfile );
