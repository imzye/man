NAME
       djvuextract - Extract chunks from DjVu image files.

SYNOPSIS
       djvuextract [-page=pagenum] djvufile [chkid=filename]...

DESCRIPTION
       Program djvuextract extracts raw chunk data from a DjVu file djvufile.  These chunks can then be re-assembled into DjVu files using program djvumake.

       Option  -page  can be used to specify a particular page.  Otherwise the first page of the document is assumed.  Each remaining argument specifies that the raw data associated with all the chunks named
       chkid will be concatenated into the file named filename.  Chunks named BG44 and FG44 are handled slightly differently: the program generates legal IW44 files instead of simply saving the raw data.

       See the man page djvumake(1) for related information.

CREDITS
       This program was written by Léon Bottou <leonb@users.sourceforge.net> and was then improved by Andrei Erofeev <andrew_erofeev@yahoo.com>, Bill Riemers <docbill@sourceforge.net> and many others.
