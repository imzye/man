VERSION
       Version 0.135

SYNOPSIS
         use Array::Iterator::Circular;

         # create an instance with a
         # small array
         my $color_iterator = Array::Iterator::Circular->new(qw(red green blue orange));

         # this is a large list of
         # arbitrary items
         my @long_list_of_items = ( ... );

         # as we loop through the items ...
         foreach my $item (@long_list_of_items) {
             # we assign color from our color
             # iterator, which will keep dispensing
             # as it loops through its set
             $item->set_color($color_iterator->next());
         }

         # tell us how many times the set
         # was looped through
         print $color_iterator->get_loop_count();

DESCRIPTION
       This iterator will loop continuosly as long as "next" or "get_next" is called. The "has_next" method will always return true (1), since the list will always loop back. This is useful when you need
       a list to repeat itself, but don't want to (or care to) know that it is doing so.

METHODS
       This is a subclass of Array::Iterator, only those methods that have been added or altered are documented here, refer to the Array::Iterator documentation for more information.

       has_next
           Since we endlessly loop, this will always return true (1).

       next
           This will return the next item in the array, and when it reaches the end of the array, it will loop back to the beginning again.

       get_next
           This method is now defined in terms of "next", since neither will even stop dispensing items, there is no need to differentiate.

       is_start
           If at anytime during your looping, you want to know if you have arrived back at the start of you list, you can ask this method.

       is_end
           If at anytime during your looping, you want to know if you have gotten to the end of you list, you can ask this method.

       get_loop_count
           This method will tell you how many times the iterator has looped back to its start.
