NAME
       ttcn3_profmerge - TTCN-3 profiler and code coverage merge tool

SYNOPSIS
       ttcn3_profmerge [ -pc ] [ -o file ] [ -s file ] [ -f filter ] db_file1 [ db_file2 ... ]
       or
       ttcn3_profmerge -v

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page is a quick reference for the TTCN-3 profmerge utility of the TTCN-3 Test Executor. The ttcn3_profmerge utility, which can be found in $TTCN3_DIR/bin, merges all input files
       (profiler databases) given in the command argument into a single output file. It can also generate profiler statistics from the merged database.
       Since there are two possible outputs, neither of them are written to the standard output.
       It is useful for test suites that are run on multiple Host Controllers (in parallel mode).

OPTIONS
       Available command line switches are:

       -p        Discards profiler data from the merged database. All execution times will be set to zero in the output database file, and statistics related to execution times will not be generated
                 (both profiler and code coverage data cannot be discarded, since there would be no data left).

       -c        Discards code coverage data from the merged database. All execution counts will be set to zero in the output database file, and statistics related to execution counts  will  not  be
                 generated (both profiler and code coverage data cannot be discarded, since there would be no data left).

       -o file   Prints the output (merged) database to the specified file.  At least one output file (this or the statistics file) must be set.

       -s file   Prints statistics for the merged database into the specified file.  At least one output file (this or the output database file) must be set.

       -f filter Specifies  which  statistics entries are generated. The filter is a hexadecimal number, the last 25 bits each correspond to the 25 entries in the statistics file (the least signifi‐
                 cant bit corresponds to the first entry, and so on). The filter is ignored if the statistics file is not set.

       -v        Prints version and license key information and exits.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       TTCN3_DIR
              The installation directory where the uncompressed binary package of the TTCN-3 Test Executor can be found.

       TTCN3_LICENSE_FILE
              Points to the file (NB: not the directory) that contains the personalized license key for the current user or host.

BUGS
       None known at this time
