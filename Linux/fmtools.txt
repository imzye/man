NAME
       fmscan - scan FM band for radio stations

SYNOPSIS
       fm [ -h ] [ -d device ] [ -t tuner ] [ -s freq ] [ -e freq ] [ -i freq ] [ -q ]

DESCRIPTION
       fmscan  is  a program to scan a frequency band for radio stations, using the video4linux interface introduced in 2.1.x series Linux kernels.  It shows which ones have a accumulated signal strength
       of 50% or higher.

   OPTIONS
       -h     Print a usage message to standard output, and exit.

       -d device
              Sets device as the device to tune.  The default is /dev/radio0.

       -t tuner
              Sets tuner as the tuner on the selected device to adjust.  The default is tuner 0.  Most radio devices have only a single tuner.

       -s freq
              Starting frequency for scan, in MHz.  Default: 87.9.

       -e freq
              Ending frequency for scan, in MHz.  Default: 107.9.

       -i freq
              Increment between scanned channels, in MHz.  Default: 0.2.

       -t percent
              Signal strength threshold to consider a channel.  Default: 50%.

       -q     Quiet mode.  Suppresses progress output.

BUGS
       This process can take a while, and results vary greatly depending on the radio card in use.  If your card's hardware cannot report signal strength, it will not produce useful results.

       This program may not do much if your radio card's driver doesn't support fine tuning in 1/16000 MHz offsets.  By default, V4L2 assumes 1/16 MHz tuning units, which introduces evil rounding  errors
       on many frequencies.

       Supports only tuner 0 on any given device.
