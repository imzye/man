NAME
       gpr - a graphical frontend for lpr.

SYNOPSIS
       gpr [-h] [--help] [-P <printer>]  [-J <job name>] [-r] [-n] [-p <flag>]  [filename]...

DESCRIPTION
       gpr is a graphical interface to lpr that provides for easy configuration of printer-specific options. gpr interfaces with a PostScript printer's PPD file to create a user-interface of configurable op‐
       tions. Based upon user choice, the device-specific option code is then inserted into the PostScript job and sent to the printer.  This can be used to tell the printer to duplex  or  staple  the  print
       job,  or  tell  it what paper tray to draw paper from.  NOTE: gpr will detect if the file to be print is postscript, and, if not, it will call a2ps to preprocess it before sending it to ppdfilt and to
       lpr.

OPTIONS
       gpr accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -P     Specify a destination printer

       -d     Enable debugging output

       -J     lpr option: Job name to print on burst page

       -r     lpr option: Remove the files upon completion of spooling

       -n     gpr option: Print the command line rather than executing the command

       -p

              gpr option: Use ppdfilt: 0 = Never, 1 = Always, 2 = with non-default PPD
