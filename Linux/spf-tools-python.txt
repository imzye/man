NAME
       spfquery.pyspf - pure-Python spfquery script

VERSION
       2.0.9

DESCRIPTION
       The spfquery script is a Python reimplementination of Wayne Schlitt's spfquery command line tool.

USAGE
       The spfquery script is called with a number of possible options.  Options can either use standard '-' prefix or be PERL style long options, '--'.  Supported options are:

        "--file" or "-file" {filename}: Read the query (or queries) from the designated
           file.  If {filename} is '0', then query inputs are read from STDIN.

        "--ip" or "-ip" {address}: Client IP address to use for SPF check.

        "--sender" or "-sender" {Mail From address}: Envelope sender from which mail was
           received.

        "--helo" or "-helo" {client hostname}: HELO/EHLO name used by SMTP client.

        "--local" or "-local" {local policy SPF string}: Additional SPF mechanisms to be
           checked on the basis of local policy.  Note that local policy matches are
           not strictly SPF results.  Local policy processing is not defined in RFC
           4408.  Result may vary among SPF implementations.

        "--rcpt-to" or "rcpt-to" {rcpt-to address - if available}: Receipt to address is
           not used for actual SPF processing, but if available it can be useful for
           logging, spf-received header construction, and providing useful rejection
           messages when messages are rejected due to SPF.

        "--default-explanation" or "-default-explanation" {explanation string}: Default
           Fail explanation string to be used.

        "--sanitize" or "-sanitize" and "--debug" or "-debug": These options are no-op
           in the Python implementation, but are valid inputs to provide compatibliity
           with input files developed to work with the original PERL and C spfquery
           implementations.

EXAMPLE
        spfquery --sender scott@example.com --ip 192.0.2.0 [other options ...]
