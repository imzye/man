NAME
       dh_pidgin- depend on the appropriate version of pidgin

SYNOPSIS
       dh_pidgin [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_pidgin is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the ${misc:Depends} substitutions that depend on the correct versions of pidgin, and adding them to substvars files.

       To use this program, make sure it is executed in debian/rules at some point during the build process (normally during the install), and make sure that your Depends: field in debian/control
       contains ${misc:Depends}.
