DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the Cynthiune command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       Cynthiune  is a free software, romantic and extensible music player forB GNUstep and Mac OS X. Similar in look and feel to XMMS, it can read the most-known sound file formats: MP3, Ogg, FLAC, Mod,
       XM, AIFF, WAV and many more...

       Very easy to use, it integrates well with the GNUstep desktop environment and shows a nice example of a cross-platform OpenStep application.
