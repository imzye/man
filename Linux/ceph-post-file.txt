NAME
       ceph-post-file - post files for ceph developers

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-post-file [-d description] [-u *user] file or dir ...

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-post-file will upload files or directories to ceph.com for later analysis by Ceph developers.

       Each  invocation  uploads files or directories to a separate directory with a unique tag.  That tag can be passed to a developer or referenced in a bug report (http://tracker.ceph.com/).  Once the up‐
       load completes, the directory is marked non-readable and non-writeable to prevent access or modification by other users.

WARNING
       Basic measures are taken to make posted data be visible only to developers with access to ceph.com infrastructure. However, users should think twice and/or take appropriate precautions before  posting
       potentially sensitive data (for example, logs or data directories that contain Ceph secrets).

OPTIONS
       -d *description*, --description *description*
              Add a short description for the upload.  This is a good opportunity to reference a bug number.  There is no default value.

       -u *user*
              Set the user metadata for the upload.  This defaults to whoami`@`hostname -f.

EXAMPLES
       To upload a single log:

          ceph-post-file /var/log/ceph/ceph-mon.`hostname`.log

       To upload several directories:

          ceph-post-file -d 'mon data directories' /var/log/ceph/mon/*

AVAILABILITY
       ceph-post-file is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at http://ceph.com/docs for more information.
