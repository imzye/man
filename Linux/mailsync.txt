NAME
       mailsync - Synchronize IMAP mailboxes

SYNOPSIS
       mailsync [options] channel
       mailsync [options] store
       mailsync [options] channel store

DESCRIPTION
       mailsync is a command line tool to keep collections of mailboxes synchronized. Mailboxes can reside on the local filesystem or on an IMAP server.

       mailsync can be invoked in three ways:

       mailsync channel        Synchronizes two sets of mailboxes. In c-client taxonomy, a library on which mailsync relies to implement mailbox access, mailboxes are referred to as "stores".

       mailsync store          Lists  the contents of a store. It's recommended to execture this command before synchronizing two stores to check whether mailsync is seeing what you are expecting it
                               to see.

       mailsync channel store  Lists what has changed in a store since the last sync.

OPTIONS
       -f file  Use alternative config file.

       -n       Don't delete messages when synchronizing.

       -D       Delete any empty mailboxes after synchronizing..

       -m       Show from, subject, etc. of messages that are killed or moved when synchronzing.

       -M       Also show message-ids (turns on -m).

       -s       Says what would be done without doing it (turns on -n).  Attention: this will change the "Seen" flag of emails and will create new, empty mailboxes in order to  be  able  to  compare
                them.

       -v       Show IMAP chatter.

       -vb      Show warning about braindammaged message ids

       -vw      Show warnings

       -vp      Show RFC 822 mail parsing errors

       -h       Show help.

       -d       Show debug info.  -di Debug/log IMAP protocol telemetry.  -dc Debug config.

       -t mid_type
                Use  mailsync  with specified message-id algorithm. Currently you have the choice between md5 and msgid (default). msgid uses the Message-ID in the mail header to identify a message.
                md5 calculates a MD5 hash from the "From", "To", "Subject", "Date" and "Message-ID" headers and uses that as message identifier.

                If you use mailclients and servers that allow empty Message-IDs (f.ex. in mail drafts) then you should use the md5 algorithm.
