NAME
       rt-clean-sessions - clean old and duplicate RT sessions

SYNOPSIS
            rt-clean-sessions [--debug] [--older <NUM>[H|D|M|Y]]

            rt-clean-sessions
            rt-clean-sessions --debug
            rt-clean-sessions --older 10D
            rt-clean-sessions --debug --older 1M
            rt-clean-sessions --older 10D --skip-user

DESCRIPTION
       Script cleans RT sessions from DB or dir with sessions data.  Leaves in DB only one session per RT user and sessions that aren't older than specified(see options).

       Script is safe because data in the sessions is temporary and can be deleted.

OPTIONS
       older
           Date interval in the "<NUM>[<unit>]" format. Default unit is D(ays), H(our), M(onth) and Y(ear) are also supported.

           For example: "rt-clean-sessions --older 1M" would delete all sessions that are older than 1 month.

       skip-user
           By default only one session per user left in the DB, so users that have sessions on multiple computers or in different browsers will be logged out.  Use this option to avoid this.

       debug
           Turn on debug output.

NOTES
       Functionality similar to this is implemented in html/Elements/SetupSessionCookie ; however, that does not guarantee that a session will be removed from disk and database soon after the timeout
       expires.  This script, if run from a cron job, will ensure that the timed out sessions are actually removed from disk; the Mason component just ensures that the old sessions are not reusable before
       the cron job gets to them.
