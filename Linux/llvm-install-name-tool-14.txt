NAME
       llvm-install-name-tool - LLVM tool for manipulating install-names and rpaths

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-install-name-tool [options] input

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-install-name-tool is a tool to manipulate dynamic shared library install names and rpaths listed in a Mach-O binary.

       For most scenarios, it works as a drop-in replacement for Apple’s install_name_tool.

OPTIONS
       At least one of the following options are required, and some options can be combined with other options. Options -add_rpath, -delete_rpath, and -rpath can be
       combined in an invocation only if they do not share the same <rpath> value.

       -add_rpath <rpath>
              Add an rpath named <rpath> to the specified binary. Can be specified multiple times to add multiple rpaths. Throws an  error  if  <rpath>  is  already
              listed in the binary.

       -change <old_install_name> <new_install_name>
              Change  an install name <old_install_name> to <new_install_name> in the specified binary. Can be specified multiple times to change multiple dependent
              shared library install names. Option is ignored if <old_install_name> is not listed in the specified binary.

       -delete_rpath <rpath>
              Delete an rpath named <rpath> from the specified binary. Can be specified multiple times to delete multiple rpaths. Throws an error if <rpath> is  not
              listed in the binary.

       -delete_all_rpaths
              Deletes all rpaths from the binary.

       --help, -h
              Print a summary of command line options.

       -id <name>
              Change shared library’s identification name under LC_ID_DYLIB to <name> in the specified binary. If specified multiple times, only the last -id option
              is selected. Option is ignored if the specified Mach-O binary is not a dynamic shared library.

       -rpath <old_rpath> <new_rpath>
              Change an rpath named <old_rpath> to <new_rpath> in the specified binary. Can be specified multiple times to change multiple rpaths. Throws  an  error
              if <old_rpath> is not listed in the binary or <new_rpath> is already listed in the binary.

       --version, -V
              Display the version of the llvm-install-name-tool executable.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-install-name-tool exits with a non-zero exit code if there is an error.  Otherwise, it exits with code 0.
