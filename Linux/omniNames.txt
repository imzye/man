NAME
       omniNames - omniORB Naming Service

SYNOPSIS
       omniNames [-start <port>]

DESCRIPTION
       omniNames is omniORB's implementation of the OMG's COS Naming Service Specification.

       When  started for the first time, omniNames needs to be told which port it should listen on.  This is specified with the -start option.  Subsequently, omniNames will always determine its port from the
       log file which it writes.

       When omniNames starts up successfully it writes the stringified object reference for its root context on standard error.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       OMNINAMES_LOGDIR
              the directory in which log files are kept.

       OMNINAMES_ITBC
              the idle time between checkpoints in seconds.  It defaults to 15 minutes.
