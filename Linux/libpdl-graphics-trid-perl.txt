NAME
       PDL::Graphics::TriD::Objects - Simple Graph Objects for TriD

SYNOPSIS
         use PDL::Graphics::TriD::Objects;

       This provides the following class hierarchy:

         PDL::Graphics::TriD::GObject           (abstract) base class
         ├ PDL::Graphics::TriD::Points          individual points
         ├ PDL::Graphics::TriD::Spheres         fat 3D points :)
         ├ PDL::Graphics::TriD::Lines           separate lines
         ├ PDL::Graphics::TriD::LineStrip       continuous paths
         ├ PDL::Graphics::TriD::STrigrid        polygons
         │ └ PDL::Graphics::TriD::STrigrid_S    polygons with normals
         └ PDL::Graphics::TriD::GObject_Lattice (abstract) base class
           ├ PDL::Graphics::TriD::SCLattice     colored lattice
           ├ PDL::Graphics::TriD::SLattice      ...with color per vertex
           └ PDL::Graphics::TriD::SLattice_S    ...and with normals

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains a collection of classes which represent graph objects.  It is for internal use and not meant to be used by PDL users.  GObjects can be either stand-alone or in Graphs, scaled
       properly.  All the points used by the object must be in the member {Points}.  I guess we can afford to force data to be copied (X,Y,Z) -> (Points)...

OBJECTS
   PDL::Graphics::TriD::GObject
       Inherits from base PDL::Graphics::TriD::Object and adds fields Points, Colors and Options.
