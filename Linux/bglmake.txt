BGLMAKE(1)                  General Commands Manual                 BGLMAKE(1)

NAME
       bglmake - create or update Bigloo makefiles

SYNOPSIS
       bglmake [ options ] [ sourcefile ]

DESCRIPTION
       bglmake reads sourcefile, computes the transitive closure of the import
       relationship and generates a makefile file that  can  be  used  by  the
       glmake(1)  program  to  compile  the application or the library.  If no
       sourcefile is provided, then bglmake display the template file for gen‐
       erating Makefile.

OPTIONS
       -v              Verbose mode

       -q              Prevent  loading  the  ~/.bglmakerc  user configuration
                       file.

       -suffix <suf>   Adds suf to the bglmake source file suffixes list.  De‐
                       fault suffixes are "scm", "sch" and "bgl".

       file            is  the  name  of the "main" file for an application of
                       the name of the "heap" file for a library.

       -I<path>        Add path to  the  directory  list  read  for  searching
                       Bigloo source files.

       -X<path>        Exclude path from the directory list read for searching
                       Bigloo source files.

       -o <makefile>   The name of the makefile file to be updated

       -p <name>       The name of the project. This name is  used  in  backup
                       and versionning entries.

       -t <name>       The  name  of the target binary file or the name of the
                       library.

       -f<template>    Set an alternative template file.

       -object <obj>   Update the makefile for adding obj to the object list.

       -source <src>   Update the makefile for adding src to the  source  file
                       list.

       -main <file>    Set  the  initial  main file and tells bglmake that the
                       project is  an  "application"  (by  opposition  to  li‐
                       braries).  This File is the starting point of the tran‐
                       sitive closure of the imported modules.

       -heap <file>    Set the initial heap file and tells  bglmake  that  the
                       project  is  an  "library"  (by  opposition to applica‐
                       tions). This File is the starting point of the  transi‐
                       tive closure of the imported modules.

TEMPLATES
       When  bglmake generates a makefile, it uses templates. Theses templates
       may be specified with some option or they be printed out. For  that  it
       is  enough  to  call bglmake without any parameter. Template files uses
       some extra "macro". They are:

       $[PROJECT]
            this macro is replaced with the project name (option -p). If no -p
            option is used the default project name is the name of the current
            directory that contains the sourcefile.

       $[TARGET_NAME]
            this macro is replaced with the target name (option -t). If no  -t
            option  is used the default target name is the name of the current
            directory that contains the sourcefile.

       $[MAKEFILE]
            this macro is replaced with the makefile name (-o option).

EXAMPLE
       A Makefile is created by ``bglmake foo.scm -o Makefile''. Then  it  may
       be updated with ``make updatemakefile''.
