TEST
       The main use-case of `attest-tool` is testing whether attestation works on the local system.

       Once `attest-tool` has been built, you can run it in self-test mode like this:

       attest-tool self-test

       After a few seconds, it should print out a 'PASS' message, or a 'FAIL' message with a description of what went wrong.

       On Linux, `attest-tool` either needs to be run as root, or granted access to the TPM (`/dev/tpmrm0`) device & event log (`/sys/kernel/security/tpm0/binary_bios_measurements`)
