NAME
       gpano2pto - Insert a Google photosphere into a Hugin project

SYNOPSIS
       gpano2pto /path/to/PANO_20140225_134632.jpg /path/to/PANO_20140225_134812.jpg [...]

       Options: None.

DESCRIPTION
       gpano2pto is a simple tool that reads GPano XMP tags in JPEG panorama files, calculates the field of view and crop offsets, and creates Hugin .pto projects with the photograph inserted correctly.

       This allows further processing of panoramas such as levelling, changing projection, and cropping.

       Note that partial panoramas are supported.  So this tool does the right thing with panoramas less than 360 degrees, and with panoramas that have horizon lines above or below the middle of the image.
