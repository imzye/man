NAME
       abpoa, abpoa.avx2, abpoa.avx, abpoa.sse4.1, abpoa.ssse3, abpoa.sse3, abpoa.generic - adaptive banded Partial Order Alignment

SYNOPSIS
       abpoa [options] <in.fa/fq> > cons.fa/msa.fa/abpoa.gfa

DESCRIPTION
       abPOA  is  an  extended  version of Partial Order Alignment (POA) that performs adaptive banded dynamic programming (DP) with an SIMD implementation.  abPOA can perform multiple sequence alignment
       (MSA) on a set of input sequences and generate a consensus sequence by applying the heaviest bundling algorithm to the final alignment graph.

       abPOA can generate high-quality consensus sequences from error-prone long reads and offer significant speed improvement over existing tools.

       abPOA supports three alignment modes (global, local, extension) and flexible scoring schemes that allow linear, affine and convex gap penalties.  It right now supports SSE2/SSE4.1/AVX2  vectoriza‐
       tion.

OPTIONS
              Alignment:

       -X --mismatch
              INT    mismatch penalty [4]

       -t --matrix

       -E --gap-ext
              INT(,INT)  gap extension penalty (E1,E2) [2,1] abPOA provides three gap penalty modes, cost of a g-long gap: - convex (default): min{O1+g*E1, O2+g*E2} - affine (set O2 as 0): O1+g*E1 - lin‐
              ear (set O1 as 0): g*E1

       -s --amb-strand

              Adaptive banded DP:

       -b --extra-b
              INT    first adaptive banding parameter [10] set b as < 0 to disable adaptive banded DP

       -f --extra-f
              FLOAT    second adaptive banding parameter [0.01] the number of extra bases added on both sites of the band is b+f*L, where L is the length of the aligned sequence

              Minimizer-based seeding and partition (only effective in global alignment mode):

       -S --seeding

              Input/Output:

       -Q --use-qual-weight
              take base quality score from FASTQ input file as graph edge weight for consensus calling [False] effective only when input sequences are in FASTQ format and consensus calling with  heaviest
              bundling

       -c --amino-acid
              input sequences are amino acid (default is nucleotide) [False]

       -l --in-list
              input file is a list of sequence file names [False] each line is one sequence file containing a set of sequences which will be aligned by abPOA to generate a consensus sequence

       -i --incrmnt
              FILE    incrementally align sequences to an existing graph/MSA [Null] graph could be in GFA or MSA format generated by abPOA

       -o --output
              FILE    output to FILE [stdout]

       -r --result
              INT     output  result mode [0] - 0: consensus in FASTA format - 1: MSA in PIR format - 2: both 0 & 1 - 3: graph in GFA format - 4: graph with consensus path in GFA format - 5: consensus in
              FASTQ format

       -a --cons-algrm INT
