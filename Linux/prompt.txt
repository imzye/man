NAME
       prompt - give any program command-line editing facilities

SYNOPSIS
       prompt

DESCRIPTION
       prompt is a simple wrapper which provides command-line editing for programs that do not have it.

       Not all programs with a command line interface provide an input history or even the ability to use the cursor keys to change the input. The prompt program wraps any program, intercepting stdin, stdout
       and stderr and providing the user with such editing facilities.
