NAME
       RDF::Trine::Model - Model class

VERSION
       This document describes RDF::Trine::Model version 1.019

METHODS
       "new ( $store )"
           Returns a new model over the supplied rdf store or a new temporary model.  If you provide an unblessed value, it will be used to create a new rdf store.

       "temporary_model"
           Returns a new temporary (non-persistent) model.

       "dataset_model ( default => \@dgraphs, named => \@ngraphs )"
           Returns a new model object with the default graph mapped to the union of the graphs named in @dgraphs, and with available named graphs named in @ngraphs.

       "begin_bulk_ops"
           Provides a hint to the backend that many update operations are about to occur.  The backend may use this hint to, for example, aggregate many operations into a single operation, or delay index
           maintenence. After the update operations have been executed, "end_bulk_ops" should be called to ensure the updates are committed to the backend.

       "end_bulk_ops"
           Provides a hint to the backend that a set of bulk operations have been completed and may be committed to the backend.

       "logger ( [ $logger ] )"
           Returns the logging object responsible for recording data inserts and deletes.

           If $logger is passed as an argument, sets the logger to this object.

       "add_statement ( $statement [, $context] )"
           Adds the specified $statement to the rdf store.

       "add_hashref ( $hashref [, $context] )"
           Add triples represented in an RDF/JSON-like manner to the model.

           See "as_hashref" for full documentation of the hashref format.

       "add_iterator ( $iter )"
           Add triples from the statement iterator to the model.

       "add_list ( @elements )"
           Adds an rdf:List to the model with the given elements. Returns the node object that is the head of the list.

       "get_list ( $head )"
           Returns a list of nodes that are elements of the rdf:List represented by the supplied head node.

       "remove_list ( $head [, orphan_check => 1] )"
           Removes  the  nodes  of  type rdf:List that make up the list. Optionally checks each node before removal to make sure that it is not used in any other statements. Returns false if the list was
           removed completely; returns the first remaining node if the removal was abandoned because of an orphan check.

       "get_sequence ( $seq )"
           Returns a list of nodes that are elements of the rdf:Seq sequence.

       "remove_statement ( $statement [, $context])"
           Removes the specified $statement from the rdf store.

       "remove_statements ( $subject, $predicate, $object [, $context] )"
           Removes all statements matching the supplied $statement pattern from the rdf store.

       "size"
           Returns the number of statements in the model.

       "etag"
           If the model is based on a store that has the capability and knowledge to support caching, this method returns a persistent token that will remain  consistent  as  long  as  the  store's  data
           doesn't change. This token is acceptable for use as an HTTP ETag.

       "supports ( [ $feature ] )"
           If $feature is specified, returns true if the feature is supported by the underlying store, false otherwise. If $feature is not specified, returns a list of supported features.

       "count_statements ( $subject, $predicate, $object )"
           Returns a count of all the statements matching the specified subject, predicate and objects. Any of the arguments may be undef to match any value.

       "get_statements ($subject, $predicate, $object [, $context] )"
           Returns an iterator of all statements matching the specified subject, predicate and objects from the rdf store. Any of the arguments may be undef to match any value.

           If  three  or  fewer  arguments are given, the statements returned will be matched based on triple semantics (the graph union of triples from all the named graphs). If four arguments are given
           (even if $context is undef), statements will be matched based on quad semantics (the union of all quads in the underlying store).

       "get_pattern ( $bgp [, $context] [, %args ] )"
           Returns a stream object of all bindings matching the specified graph pattern.

           If $context is given, restricts BGP matching to only quads with the $context value.

           %args may contain an 'orderby' key-value pair to request a specific ordering based on variable name. The value for the 'orderby' key should be an ARRAY reference containing variable  name  and
           direction ('ASC' or 'DESC') tuples.  A valid %args hash, therefore, might look like "orderby => [qw(name ASC)]" (corresponding to a SPARQL-like request to 'ORDER BY ASC(?name)').

       "get_sparql ( $sparql )"
           Returns a stream object of all bindings matching the specified graph pattern.

       "get_graphs"
       "get_contexts"
           Returns an iterator containing the nodes representing the named graphs in the model.

       "as_stream"
           Returns an iterator containing every statement in the model.

       "as_hashref"
           Returns a hashref representing the model in an RDF/JSON-like manner.

           A graph like this (in Turtle):

             @prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .

             ex:subject1
               ex:predicate1
                 "Foo"@en ,
                 "Bar"^^ex:datatype1 .

             _:bnode1
               ex:predicate2
                 ex:object2 ;
               ex:predicate3 ;
                 _:bnode3 .

           Is represented like this as a hashref:

             {
               "http://example.com/subject1" => {
                 "http://example.com/predicate1" => [
                   { 'type'=>'literal', 'value'=>"Foo", 'lang'=>"en" },
                   { 'type'=>'literal', 'value'=>"Bar", 'datatype'=>"http://example.com/datatype1" },
                 ],
               },
               "_:bnode1" => {
                 "http://example.com/predicate2" => [
                   { 'type'=>'uri', 'value'=>"http://example.com/object2" },
                 ],
                 "http://example.com/predicate2" => [
                   { 'type'=>'bnode', 'value'=>"_:bnode3" },
                 ],
               },
             }

           Note that the type of subjects (resource or blank node) is indicated entirely by the convention of starting blank nodes with "_:".

           This hashref structure is compatible with RDF/JSON and with the ARC2 library for PHP.

       "as_graphviz"
           Returns a GraphViz object of the RDF graph of this model, ignoring graph names/contexts.

           This method will attempt to load the GraphViz module at runtime and will fail if the module is unavailable.

   Node-Centric Graph API
       "subjects ( $predicate, $object )"
           Returns a list of the nodes that appear as the subject of statements with the specified $predicate and $object. Either of the two arguments may be undef to signify a wildcard.

       "predicates ( $subject, $object )"
           Returns a list of the nodes that appear as the predicate of statements with the specified $subject and $object. Either of the two arguments may be undef to signify a wildcard.

       "objects ( $subject, $predicate [, $graph ] [, %options ] )"
           Returns  a list of the nodes that appear as the object of statements with the specified $subject and $predicate. Either of the two arguments may be undef to signify a wildcard. You can further
           filter objects using the %options argument. Keys in %options indicate the restriction type and may be 'type', 'language', or 'datatype'. The value of the 'type'  key  may  be  one  of  'node',
           'nil', 'blank', 'resource', 'literal', or 'variable'. The use of either 'language' or 'datatype' restrict objects to literal nodes with a specific language or datatype value, respectively.

       "objects_for_predicate_list ( $subject, @predicates )"
           Given  the  RDF::Trine::Node  objects $subject and @predicates, finds all matching triples in the model with the specified subject and any of the given predicates, and returns a list of object
           values (in the partial order given by the ordering of @predicates).

       "bounded_description ( $node )"
           Returns an RDF::Trine::Iterator::Graph object over the bounded description triples for $node (all triples resulting from a graph traversal  starting  with  "node"  and  stopping  at  non-blank
           nodes).

       "as_string"
