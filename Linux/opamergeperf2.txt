NAME
       opamergeperf2

       Merges  the  output  from two opaextactperf2 runs from the same fabric.
       Delta counters for matching links will be computed  (before  subtracted
       from after) and a CSV file equivalent to opaextractperf2 's output for‐
       mat will be generated suitable for  importing  into  a  spreadsheet  or
       parsing by other scripts.

       NOTE:  The  before.csv and after.csv input files must be generated from
       the  same  fabric,  with  before.csv  containing  counters   prior   to
       after.csv.  Both  files must have been generated to contain the running
       counters

       without any counter clears between before.csv and after.csv, and  with‐
       out  using  any  interval  options to opareport that might report delta
       counters, such as opareport -i or opareport with both --begin and --end
       options.
