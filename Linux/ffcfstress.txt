NAME
       ffcfstress - constant force stress test for force-feedback devices

SYNOPSIS
       ffcfstress [-d <device>] [-u <update rate>] [-f <frequency>] [-a <amplitude>] [-s <strength>] [-x <axis>] [-A] [-o]

DESCRIPTION
       ffcfstress stress tests constant non-enveloped forces on a force feedback device.  It simulates a moving spring force by applying a frequently updated constant force effect.

       Beware, the stress test may damage your device!

OPTIONS
       At least one option is required.

       -d <device>
              The device to test (by default /dev/input/event0).

       -u <update rate>
              The update rate in Hz (25 by default).

       -f <frequency>
              The spring center motion frequency in Hz (0.1 by default).

       -a <amplitude>
              The spring center motion amplitude, between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 by default).

       -s <strength>
              The spring strength factor (1.0 by default).

       -x <axis>
              absolute axis to test (default: 0)
              [0 = X, 1 = Y, 2 = Z, 3 = RX, 4 = RY, 5 = RZ, 6 = WHEEL]

       -A     switch off auto-centering

       -o     Dummy option, useful when all defaults should be used.
