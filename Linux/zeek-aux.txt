NAME
       zeek-cut - parse Zeek logs

SYNOPSIS
       zeek-cut [options] [columns]

DESCRIPTION
       Extracts  the  given columns from ASCII Zeek logs on standard input, and outputs them to standard output.  If no field names are given, all are selected. By default, zeek-cut does not include
       format header blocks in the output.

       Columns are specified as a list of space-separated field names.  The order of field names given to zeek-cut determines the output order, which means zeek-cut can be used to reorder columns.

       The ASCII Zeek logs read on standard input must have intact format header blocks because zeek-cut needs this information to correctly interpret the log file format.   In  fact,  zeek-cut  can
       process the concatenation of multiple ASCII log files that have different column layouts.

OPTIONS
       -c     Include the first format header block in the output.

       -C     Include all format header blocks in the output.

       -d     Convert time values into human-readable format.

       -D <fmt> Like -d, but specify format for time (see strftime(3) for syntax).

       -F <ofs> Sets a different output field separator character.

       -h     Show help.

       -n     Print all fields except those specified.

       -u     Like -d, but print timestamps in UTC instead of local time.

       -U <fmt> Like -D, but print timestamps in UTC instead of local time.

ENVIRONMENT
       ZEEK_CUT_TIMEFMT
              For time conversion option -d or -u, the format string can be specified by setting this environment variable.

EXAMPLES
       Output three columns and convert time values:
       cat conn.log | zeek-cut -d ts id.orig_h id.orig_p

       Output all columns and convert time values with a custom format string:
       cat conn.log | zeek-cut -D "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

       Compressed logs must be uncompressed with another utility:
       zcat conn.log.gz | zeek-cut
