NAME
       nauty-delptg - delete vertices

SYNOPSIS
       delptg [-lq] [-d#|d#:#] [-n#] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Delete some vertices from a file of graphs.

              The output file has a header if and only if the input file does.  No isomorph reduction is done.

       -l     Canonically label outputs

       -d# -d#:# Only remove vertices with original degree in the given range

              For digraphs, the out-degree is used.

       -n# The number of vertices to delete (default 1).

              Inputs that are too small are ignored; no empty graphs are output.

       -q     Suppress auxiliary information
