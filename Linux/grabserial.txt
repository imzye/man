NAME
       grabserial - Serial line reader

SYNOPSIS
       grabserial

DESCRIPTION
       Grabserial  is  a  small  program which reads a serial port and writes the data to standard output. The main purpose of this tool is to collect messages written to the serial console from a target
       board running Linux, and save the messages on a host machine.

USAGE
       grabserial [options] <config_file>

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               Print this message

       -d, --device=<devpath>
               Set the device to read (default '/dev/ttyS0')

       -b, --baudrate=<val>
               Set the baudrate (default 115200)

       -w, --width=<val>
               Set the data bit width (default 8)

       -p, --parity=<val>
               Set the parity (default N)

       -s, --stopbits=<val>
               Set the stopbits (default 1)

       -x, --xonxoff
               Enable software flow control (default off)

       -r, --rtscts
               Enable RTS/CTS flow control (default off)

       -f, --force-reset
               Force pyserial to reset device parameters

       --endtime=<secs>
               End the program after the specified seconds have elapsed.

       --command=<cmd>
               Send a command to the port before reading

       -t, --time
               Print time for each line received.  The time is
               when the first character of each line is
               received by grabserial

       --systime
               Print system time for each line received. The time
               is the absolute local time when the first character
               of each line is received by grabserial

       -m, --match=<pat>
               Specify a regular expression pattern to match to
               set a base time.  Time values for lines after the
               line matching the pattern will be relative to
               this base time.

       -i, --instantpat=<pat>
               Specify a regular expression pattern to have its time
               reported at end of run.  Works mid-line.

       -q, --quitpat=<pat>
               Specify a regular expression pattern to end the
               program. Works mid-line.

       -l, --launchtime
               Set base time from launch of program.

       -o, --output=<name>
               Output data to the named file.

       -v, --verbose
               Show verbose runtime messages

       -V, --version
               Show version number and exit

Example
       grabserial -e 30 -t -m ^Linux version.*
              This will grab serial input for 30 seconds, displaying the time for each line, and re-setting the base time when the line starting with "Linux version" is seen.
