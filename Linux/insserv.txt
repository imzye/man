DESCRIPTION
       insserv is a low level tool used by update-rc.d which enables an installed system init script (`boot script') by reading the comment header of the script, e.g.:

         ### BEGIN INIT INFO
         # Provides:          boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
         # Required-Start:    boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
         # Required-Stop:     boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
         # Should-Start:      boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
         # Should-Stop:       boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
         # X-Start-Before:    boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
         # X-Stop-After:      boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]
         # Default-Start:     run_level_1 [ run_level_2 ...]
         # Default-Stop:      run_level_1 [ run_level_2 ...]
         # X-Interactive:     true
         # Short-Description: single_line_description
         # Description:       multiline_description
         ### END INIT INFO

       and calculating the dependencies between all scripts.  It is not recommended to execute insserv directly unless you know exactly what you're doing, doing so may render your boot system inoperable.
       update-rc.d is the recommended interface for managing init scripts.

       The  Default-Start  keyword  declares on which runlevels the script must be started.  An empty value means the script will never be started.  The same applies for its counterpart Default-Stop with
       the only difference that the script will be stopped.

       Please be aware that the line

         # Required-Stop:  boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]

       declares facilities which must be available during shutdown of the service declared in the Provides tag.  Same holds true for

         # Should-Stop:    boot_facility_1 [ boot_facility_2 ...]

       which declares facilities which should be available during shutdown of the service declared in the Provides tag.  In both cases the script system should avoid stopping services which are  declared
       by these two Stop tags until the script including these tags is stopped.

       The optional X-Interactive keyword implies that the script using this keyword should be started alone in a concurrent boot configuration because it interact with the user at the console.  Only the
       value `true' is recognised.  All others are ignored.

       The  optional  X-Start-Before  keyword  implies that the script using this keyword should be started before the specified service names.  Whereas the optional X-Stop-After keyword implies that the
       script using this keyword should be stopped after the specified service names.  Both implies that those services now depend on the specifying script.  With known dependencies and  runlevel(s)  in‐
       sserv sets and reorders the corresponding symbolic links of the concerned runlevels directories.

       insserv  scans  for System Facilities in the configuration file /etc/insserv.conf and each file in the directory /etc/insserv.conf.d/.  Each line which begins with $ and a following name defines a
       system facility accordingly to the Linux Standard Base Specification (LSB).  All names followed by such a system facility will declare the required dependencies of the facility.  Here is an  exam‐
       ple for /etc/insserv.conf:

         # All local filesystems are mounted
         # (done during boot phase)
         $local_fs       boot

         # Low level networking
         $network        network route

         # Named is operational
         $named          named

         # All remote filesystems are mounted
         # (in some cases /usr may be remote).
         $remote_fs      $local_fs nfs

         # System logger is operational
         $syslog         syslog

         # All network daemons are running (This was removed in LSB 1.2)
         $netdaemons     portmap inetd

         # Services which need to be interactive
         <interactive>   boot.crypto

       Names  starting  with  a  `+' sign are marked as optional.  If the service with the name after the plus sign is available it will be used, if not available it is ignored silently.  Words beginning
       with < and ending with > are keywords.  Currently <interactive> is the only know keyword for marking a service as an interactive one, e.g., a service which requires a passphrase or password  input
       during boot or runlevel change.  The special facility $null is used to enforce an empty dependency in case of Should-Stop and Required-Stop.

       In  addition  to the defined System Facilities in the configuration file /etc/insserv.conf, insserv also knows the special facility $all.  This facility indicates that a service should be inserted
       at the end of all services at starting and at the very beginning at stopping.  Clearly all services using this facility will be grouped into one starting or stopping order.

OPTIONS
       Currently the following options are recognized by insserv:

       -v, --verbose
              Perform operation with more diagnostic messages printed on stderr.

       -q, --silent
              Perform operations silently.  This blocks warning messages from being printed to stderr.  Only fatal error messages are printed.

       -c <config>, --config <config>
              Specify path to the insserv.conf file (by default located at /etc/insserv.conf).  This is typically used for testing purposes.  insserv(8) will automatically check for the existence  of  an
              insserv configuration directory under this location.  For example, specifying /usr/local/etc/insserv.conf will cause insserv to also scan the directory /usr/local/etc/insserv.conf.d/

       -i, --insserv-dir
              The insserv program will try to place dependency information in the /etc/init.d directory.  When using the -i flag, the user can specify an alternative directory for dependency information.
              This is typically used when debugging insserv.

       -o <path>, --override <path>
              LSB comment headers found in this path will override existing LSB comment headers of scripts in the init.d directory (default path is /etc/insserv/overrides/).

       -p <path>, --path <path>
              Specify path to init.d directory.  Useful for testing.

       -n, --dryrun, --dry-run
              Do not update symlinks.  Does not create depend.boot, depend.start, and depend.stop files.

       -s, --showall, --show-all
              Output runlevel and sequence information.  Do not update symlinks.

       -r, --remove
              Remove the listed scripts from all runlevels.

       -d, --default
              Use default runlevels as defined in the scripts.  This may restore an edited runlevel link scheme.

       -f, --force
              Ignore if a required service is missed.  Beside this if start and or stop levels are specified on the command line the default levels of the script will be ignored.

       -u <path>, --upstart-job <path>
              Path to replace existing upstart job path.  (default path is /lib/init/upstart-job).

       -h, --help
              Print out short usage message.

       But you may use the argument syntax described in the following section.

ARGUMENTS
       [[/]path/to/init.d/]
              Relative  or absolute path to the init scripts base directory.  This defaults to /etc/init.d/ in compliance with the LSB specification.  In this case insserv does not add or remove a script
              to the runlevels declared in the script headers, but may re-order the runlevels if the order of the currently enabled scripts has changed (see option -d).  Note that if a relative  path  is
              used insserv has to be called from the root directory.

       [[/]path/to/init.d/]script ...
              List  of  scripts  which have to be added to the runlevels.  If a path is used it should point to the absolute or relative location of the boot scripts.  insserv checks for the existence of
              these scripts.  For the runlevels the information found in the script is used.

       [[/]path/to/init.d/]script[,start=<lvl1,lvl2,...>]
              List of scripts which have to be added to the specified runlevels to be started with.  You may use this extension to override the default values for start and stop runlevels of the  script.
              Note that lvl1, lvl2, ...  are the known runlevels explained above.  The extension ,stop=<lvl1,lvl2,...> is also possible.

       -r [[/]path/to/init.d/]script ...
              List of scripts which should be removed from the runlevels.  If a path is used it should point to the absolute or relative location of the boot scripts.  insserv checks for the existence of
              these scripts.

OVERRIDES
       Beside using the extensions ,start=<lvl1,lvl2,...> and ,stop=<lvl1,lvl2,...> it is possible to use override files replace a LSB comment header or simply provide a missing LSB comment header.  This
       can  be  done  by  placing a file with the new LSB comment header using the same name as the boot or init script in the directory /etc/insserv/overrides/.  For third party boot scripts without LSB
       header it is possible to add a file with the same name in the directory /usr/share/insserv/overrides/ to make them completely LSB compliant.

UPSTART JOB COMPATIBILITY
       To allow upstart jobs to work as init.d scripts, insserv will recognize a symlink from path/to/init.d/script to /lib/init/upstart-job as upstart jobs, and instead of reading the  header  from  the
       file will run the script with the argument lsb-header to get the script header.

EXIT CODES
       The exit codes have the following conditions:

              0    Service was successfully installed or removed

              1    Service was not installed or removed

NOTE
       Please be aware that the following patterns of boot script file names will be not accepted by insserv:

                *.dpkg*
                *.ucf*
                *.rpm*
                *.ba*
                *.old
                *.new
                *.org
                *.orig
                *.save
                *.swp
                *.core
                *~

       with the wildcard character *.  Beside this all boot script file names beginning with one of the following characters

                $.#%_+-\*[]^:()~

       will  be ignored.  Administrators can further filter files by extension in the /etc/init.d/ directory by creating a text file called /etc/insserv/file-filters.  The file-filters configuration file
       lists (one per line) extensions which should be ignored by insserv as it parses the /etc/init.d/ directory.  An example of /etc/insserv/file-filters might look like this:
            git
            svn
            html
