NAME
       revu-build - Debian packages reviewing tool

SYNOPSIS
       revu-build [ --help | -h ] [ dsc file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Debian packages reviewing tool.

       revu-build  is  a  reviewing tool from the revu-tools package, aimed to helping reviewers of Debian packages in their task. revu-build achieves a series of build tests using pbuilder, lintian
       and linda. It returns a series of reports in the current folder that can be used by revu-report to generate a full report.

       Among the informations revu-build gives are:

       • Whether the package fails to build from source in pbuilder ;

       • Whether lintian and linda are happy with this package ;

       • Whether running debuild -S -sa on this package generates files in the diff outside of debian/.

OPTIONS
       --help | -h
              Show informations about the program and the usage.

       dsc file
              Indicate what dsc file to use. This is optional since revu-build can detect the dsc file automatically in the folder.
