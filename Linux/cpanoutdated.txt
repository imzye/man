NAME
       cpan-outdated - detect outdated CPAN modules in your environment

SYNOPSIS
           # print a list of distributions that contain outdated modules
           % cpan-outdated

           # print a list of outdated modules in packages
           % cpan-outdated -p

           # verbose
           % cpan-outdated --verbose
           .
           # ignore core modules (do not update dual life modules)
           % cpan-outdated --exclude-core

           # alternate mirrors
           % cpan-outdated --mirror file:///home/user/minicpan/

           # additional module path(same as cpanminus)
           % cpan-outdated -l extlib/
           % cpan-outdated -L extlib/

           # install with cpan
           % cpan-outdated | xargs cpan -i

           # install with cpanm
           % cpan-outdated    | cpanm
           % cpan-outdated -p | cpanm

DESCRIPTION
       This script prints a list of outdated CPAN modules on your machine.

       This is the same feature as 'CPAN::Shell->r', but "cpan-outdated" is much faster and uses less memory.

       This script can be integrated with the cpanm command.

PRINTING PACKAGES VS DISTRIBUTIONS
       This script by default prints the outdated distribution as in the CPAN distro format, i.e: "A/AU/AUTHOR/Distribution-Name-0.10.tar.gz" so you can pipe it into CPAN installers, but with the "-p"
       option it can be tweaked to print the module's package names.

       If you wish to manage a set of modules separately from your system perl installation and not install newer versions of "dual life modules" that are distributed with perl, the "--exclude-core"
       option will make cpan-outdated ignore changes to core modules. Used with tools like cpanm and its "-L --local-lib-contained" and "--self-contained" options, this facilitates maintaining updates on
       standalone sets of modules.

       For some tools, such as cpanm, installing from packages could be a bit more useful since you can track to see the old version number which you upgrade from.
