NAME
       SiSU - Structured information, Serialized Units - a document publishing system, complete dependency package

DESCRIPTION
       SiSU is a lightweight markup based document structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.

       The sisu-sqlite package enables SiSU to populate an SQLite database. This is done at an object/paragraph level, making granular searches of documents possible.

       This  relational  database feature of SiSU is not required but provides interesting possibilities, including that of granular searches of documents for matching units of text, primarily paragraphs
       that can be displayed or identified by object citation number, from which an index of documents matched and each matched paragraph within them can be displayed.
