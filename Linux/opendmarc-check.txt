NAME
       opendmarc-check - DMARC record check tool

SYNOPSIS
       opendmarc-check domain [domain [...]]

DESCRIPTION
       opendmarc-check  queries  the  DNS  for  a  DMARC  record for the named
       domain(s) and then translates the content  found  to  a  human-readable
       form.  This can be used to ensure that the DMARC policy you have placed
       in the nameserver is what you intended for others to see.
