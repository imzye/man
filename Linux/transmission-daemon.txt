DESCRIPTION
       transmission-daemon is a daemon-based Transmission session that can be controlled via RPC commands from transmission's web interface or transmission-remote(1).

OPTIONS
       -a --allowed x.x.x.x,...
               Allow RPC access to a comma-delimited whitelist of IP addresses.  Wildcards can be specified in an address by using '*'.  Default: "127.0.0.1,::1" Example: "127.0.0.*,192.168.1.*"

       -b --blocklist
               Enable peer blocklists. Transmission understands the bluetack blocklist file format.  New blocklists can be added by copying them into the config-dir's "blocklists" subdirectory.

       -c directory
               Directory to watch for new .torrent files to be added. As they are added to this directory, the daemon will load them into Transmission.

       -C      Do not watch for new .torrent files.

       -B --no-blocklist
               Disable blocklists.

       -d      Dump transmission-daemon's settings to stderr.

       -f --foreground
               Run in the foreground and print errors to stderr.

       -g --config-dir directory
               Where to look for configuration files. This can be used to swap between using the cli, daemon, gtk, and qt clients.  See https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/Config‐
               uration-Files.md for more information.

       -er --encryption-required
               Encrypt all peer connections.

       -ep --encryption-preferred
               Prefer encrypted peer connections.

       -et --encryption-tolerated
               Prefer unencrypted peer connections.

       -gsr --global-seedratio ratio
               All torrents, unless overridden by a per-torrent setting, should seed until a specific ratio

       -GSR --no-global-seedratio
               All torrents, unless overridden by a per-torrent setting, should seed regardless of ratio

       -h --help
               Print command-line option descriptions.

       --incomplete-dir dir
               When adding new torrents, store their contents in directory until the torrent is done.

       --no-incomplete-dir
               Don't store incomplete torrents in a different directory.

       -i --bind-address-ipv4
               Listen for IPv4 BitTorrent connections on a specific address. Only one IPv4 listening address is allowed. Default: 0.0.0.0 (All addresses)

       -I --bind-address-ipv6
               Listen for IPv6 BitTorrent connections on a specific address. Only one IPv6 listening address is allowed. Default: :: (All addresses)

       -r --rpc-bind-address
               Listen for RPC connections on a specific address. This must be an IPv4 or IPv6 address. Only one RPC listening address is allowed. Default: 0.0.0.0 (All IPv4 addresses)

       --paused
               Pause all torrents on startup

       -L --peerlimit-global limit
               Overall peer limit. Useful on embedded systems where the default might be unsuitable. Default: 240

       -l --peerlimit-torrent limit
               Peer limit per torrent. Useful on embedded systems where the default might be unsuitable. Default: 60

       -m --portmap
               Enable portmapping via NAT-PMP or UPnP

       -M --no-portmap
               Disable portmapping

       -o --dht
               Enable distributed hash table (DHT).

       -O --no-dht
               Disable distributed hash table (DHT).

       -p --port port
               Port to open and listen for RPC requests on. Default: 9091

       -P --peerport port
               Port to listen for incoming peers on. Default: 51413

       -t --auth
               Require clients to authenticate themselves.  This doesn't do much good unless username and password are also set.

       -T --no-auth
               Don't require authentication from clients.

       -u --username username
               Used for client authentication.

       -v --password password
               Used for client authentication.

       -V --version
               Show version number and exit

       --utp   Enable uTP for peer connections.

       --no-utp
               Disable uTP for peer connections.

       -w --download-dir
               Where to store downloaded data.

       -e --logfile
               Where to store transmission's log messages.

       --log-level level
               Log level. Must be 'critical', 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug', or 'trace'.

       --log-error
               Deprecated. Use --log-level=error

       --log-info
               Deprecated. Use --log-level=info

               Deprecated. Use --log-level=debug

       -x --pid-file
               Name of PID file

FILES
       ~/.config/transmission-daemon
