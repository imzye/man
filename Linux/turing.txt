NAME
       turing - assistant to learn algorithms and programming languages

SYNOPSIS

       turing

DESCRIPTION
       turing is an assistant to learn algorithms and programming languages

       Turing is a free and cross-platform app whose main goal is to assist the learning of algorithms and programming languages by providing easy-to-use development tools to all.

       It provides a lighter alternative to the well-known Algobox, which is the currently de-facto widely used solution.

       It provides two work modes:

       •   Algorithm mode

           •   Uses a "natural" pseudocode language similar to the one used in Algobox and school books.

           •   Assisted development

       •   Program mode

           •   Uses Python, for the more experienced

       In both modes, the code can be debugged and executed step-by-step to facilitate the problem-solving side of development.
