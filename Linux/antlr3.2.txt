NAME
       ANTLR - ANother Tool for Language Recognition, version 3

SYNOPSIS
       java org.antlr.Tool or antlr3 [args] file.g [ file2.g file3.g ...]

DESCRIPTION
       ANTLR,  ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is a language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers, compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions con‐
       taining C++ or Java actions.

       -o outputDir
              specify output directory where all output generated.

       -fo outputDir
              same as -o but force even files with relative paths to dir.

       -lib dir
              specify location of token files.

       -depend
              generate file dependencies.

       -report
              print out a report about the grammar(s) processed.

       -print print out the grammar without actions.

       -debug generate a parser that emits debugging events.

       -profile
              generate a parser that computes profiling information.

       -nfa   generate an NFA for each rule.

       -dfa   generate a DFA for each decision point.

       -message-format name
              specify output style for messages.

       -verbose
              generate ANTLR version and other information.

       -make  only build if generated files older than grammar.

       -version
              print the version of ANTLR and exit.

       -X     display extended argument list.
