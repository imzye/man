NAME
       MooseX::Types::Email - Email address validation type constraints for Moose.

VERSION
       version 0.009

SYNOPSIS
           package MyClass;
           use Moose;
           use MooseX::Types::Email qw/EmailAddress EmailMessage EmailAddresses EmailMessages/;
           use namespace::autoclean;

           has email => ( isa => EmailAddress, required => 1, is => 'ro' );
           has message => ( isa => EmailMessage, required => 1, is => 'ro' );

           has emails => ( isa => EmailAddresses, required => 1, is => 'ro' );
           has messages => ( isa => EmailMessages, required => 1, is => 'ro' );

DESCRIPTION
       Moose type constraints which uses Email::Valid and Email::Abstract to check for valid email addresses and messages.  Types that support both single items and an arrayref of items are available.

       Note that "EmailMessage" must be an object that can be passed to Email::Abstract. Currently, constraining strings is not supported due to the leniency of Email::Abstract.
