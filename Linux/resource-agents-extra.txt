NAME
       ocf_heartbeat_azure-events-az - Microsoft Azure Scheduled Events monitoring agent

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       This resource agent implements a monitor for scheduled (maintenance) events for a Microsoft Azure VM.

       If any relevant events are found, it moves all Pacemaker resources away from the affected node to allow for a graceful shutdown.

       Deployment: crm configure primitive rsc_azure-events-az ocf:heartbeat:azure-events-az op monitor interval=10s crm configure clone cln_azure-events-az rsc_azure-events-az
