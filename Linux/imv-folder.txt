NAME
       imv-folder - Open 'imv' for all images in a folder

DESCRIPTION
       imv-folder is a wrapper for imv that auto-selects the folder where the image is located, so that the next and previous commands function in the same way as other image viewers.

       Note that this wrapper supports only a single image. For opening multiple images, use plain imv.

SYNOPSIS
