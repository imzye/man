NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Stash::PAUSE - a stash of your PAUSE credentials

VERSION
       version 6.033

OVERVIEW
       The PAUSE stash is a Login stash generally used for uploading to PAUSE.

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That
       is, if the most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
