HTCP(1)                         GridSite Manual                        HTCP(1)

NAME
       htcp,  htmv, htrm, htls, htll, htmkdir, htfind, htping - file transfers
       and queries via HTTP/HTTPS/SiteCast

SYNOPSIS
       htcp, htmv [options] Source-URL[s] Destination-URL

       htrm, htls, htll, htmkir, htfind [options] Target-URL[s]

       htping [options]

DESCRIPTION
       htcp is a client to fetch  files  or  directory  listings  from  remote
       servers  using  HTTP or HTTPS, or to put or delete files or directories
       onto remote servers using HTTPS. htcp is similar to  scp(1),  but  uses
       HTTP/HTTPS  rather than ssh as its transfer protocol. htcp can also use
       the HTCP protocol to query HTTP(S) fileservers via SiteCast.

       When talking to a fileserver with HTTPS, htcp  can  run  "anonymously",
       with  a  standard  X.509 user certificate and key, or with a GSI Proxy.
       This makes htcp very useful in Grid environments where many users  have
       certificates and where jobs and users have access to GSI proxies.

URLs
       htcp  supports  the  file:, http: and https: URL schemes as sources and
       destinations. If no scheme is given, the URL scheme is  assumed  to  be
       file: and relative to the current directory if not an absolute path.

       If  multiple sources are given during a copy, they will be used in turn
       and the destination must be a directory (directories are indicated by a
       trailing /) However, source and destination cannot both refer to remote
       servers.

OPTIONS
       -v/--verbose
              Turn on debugging  information.  Used  once,  this  option  will
              enable  htcp's  messages to stderr. Used twice, will also enable
              the underlying libcurl messages.

       --delete
              Instead of copying files, delete all the URLs given on the  com‐
              mand line.  Calling the program as htrm has the same effect.

       --list Instead  of  copying files, output lists of files located in the
              URL-directories given on the command line. Calling  the  program
              as htls has the same effect.

       --long-list
              Instead  of copying files, output long listings of files located
              in the URL-directories given on the command line. If  available,
              the  size  in bytes and modification time of each file is given.
              Calling the program as htll has the same effect.

       --mkdir
              Instead of copying files, attempt to create  a  directory  on  a
              remote server with HTTP PUT. The server must support the conven‐
              tion that PUT to a URL with a  trailing  slash  means  create  a
              directory.  No file body is sent. Calling the program as htmkdir
              has the same effect.

       --move Move/rename files on a single  remote  server,  given  the  two,
              absolute  URLs  of  the  remote  file names. Server must support
              HTTP/WebDAV MOVE. Calling the  program  as  htmv  has  the  same
              effect.

       --ping Query  specified  multicast groups with the HTCP NOP ("No Opera‐
              tion") code.  SiteCast enabled servers will respond  immediately
              with  a NOP reply, and all of the responses will be listed, with
              the round trip time in milliseconds.  Any waiting  times  speci‐
              fied in the --groups option will be ignored. Calling the program
              as htping has the same effect.  (--groups must be used for  this
              option to work.)

       --find Query  specified  multicast groups with the HTCP TST code. Site‐
              Cast enabled servers will respond with TST replies if they  have
              the files corresponding to the given SiteCast target URL(s). All
              of the transfer URLs returned  will  be  listed.  Waiting  times
              specified  in  the --groups option will be used to space out the
              multicast queries, but the program listens for responses contin‐
              uously.  Calling  the  program  as  htfind  has the same effect.
              (--groups must be used for this option to work.)

       --groups <IP Groups>
              IP multicast groups to use for SiteCast queries. IP Groups is  a
              comma    separated    list    of    groups,   in   the   format:
              nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn:port[:ttl[:seconds]] The IP number and port must
              be  specified.  The IP time-to-live, ttl, controls how many net‐
              works the multicast packets may pass through - the  default,  1,
              limits  packets  to  the  local  network. Multiple groups may be
              specified, separated by commas. If multiple  groups  are  speci‐
              fied,  then  seconds  is the time to wait before making the next
              multicast - 1 second is the default.

       --timeout <seconds>
              A request timeout used for multicast ping.

       --anon Do not attempt to use X.509 user certificates or GSI proxies  to
              authenticate  to  the  remote  HTTPS  server. This means you are
              "anonymous", but the server's identity may still be verified and
              the connection is still encrypted.

       --cert <X.509 cert path>  and  --key <X.509 key path>
              Path  to the PEM-encoded X.509 or GSI Proxy user certificate and
              key to use for HTTPS connections, instead of  "anonymous  mode."
              If only one of --key or --cert is given, then that will be tried
              for both. If neither is  given,  then  the  following  order  of
              precedence   is  used:  the  file  name  held  by  the  variable
              X509_USER_PROXY; the file /tmp/x509up_uID (with Unix  UID  equal
              to  ID);  the file names held by X509_USER_CERT / X509_USER_KEY;
              the  files  ~/.globus/usercert.pem   and   ~/.globus/userkey.pem
              (where ~/ is the home directory of the user.)

       --capath <X.509 CA root certs directory or file>
              Path to the PEM-encoded CA root certificates to use when verify‐
              ing remote servers' host certificates in HTTPS connections. Ide‐
              ally  this should be a directory of hash.0 files as described in
              the OpenSSL verify(1) man page, but a file may be used  instead.
              If  --capath is not given, the value of the environment variable
              X509_CERT_DIR will  be  tried.   If  this  is  not  valid,  then
              /etc/grid-security/certificates will be used.

       --no-verify
              Do  not  use CA root certificates to verify remote servers' host
              certificates.  This is useful for  testing  sites  before  their
              certificate  is  set  up  properly, but leaves you vulnerable to
              "man in the middle" attacks by hostile servers  masquerading  as
              your target.

       --grid-http
              Try  to  use  GridHTTP  redirection  for  HTTPS URLs. Compatible
              servers will perform authentication  and  authorization  on  the
              HTTPS  connection  and  then redirect to HTTP for the GET or PUT
              file  transfer.  htcp  makes  the   HTTP   request   using   the
              GRID_AUTH_PASSCODE  single-use  passcode obtained via HTTPS. The
              --grid-http option will be ignored for directory  operations  or
              HTTP  URLs.  If  a  redirected transfer isn't possible, a normal
              HTTPS data transfer will be attempted.

       --sitecast
              Try to use SiteCast to locate  remote  files  which  are  to  be
              copied  (currently only for the fetching of remote files.) If no
              location is found via SiteCast, then a direct  request  for  the
              given  URL  is  tried. (--groups must be used for this option to
              work.)

       --domain <SiteCast domain>
              Try to use SiteCast to locate  remote  files  which  are  to  be
              copied  (currently only for the fetching of remote files) if the
              domain component of the URL matches the SiteCast  domain  given.
              If  no location is found via SiteCast, then a direct request for
              the given URL is tried. (--groups must be used for  this  option
              to work.)

FILES
       /tmp/x509up_uID
              Default GSI Proxy file for Unix UID equal to ID.

       /etc/grid-security/certificates
              Default  location  for trusted Certification Authority root cer‐
              tificates to use when checking server certificates.

       /tmp/.ca-roots-XXXXXX
              Prior to 7.9.8, the underlying curl library did not support  the
              CA root certificates directory.  If built with an old version of
              libcurl, htcp will concatenate the certificates in the CA  roots
              directory into a unique temporary file and use that.

ENVIRONMENT
       X509_CERT_DIR
              Holds  directory to search for Certification Authority root cer‐
              tificates when verifying server certificates. (Tried if --capath
              is not given on the command line.)

       X509_USER_PROXY
              Holds  file  name  of  a  GSI  Proxy to use as user certificate.
              (Tried if --cert or --key are not given on the command line.)

       X509_USER_CERT and X509_USER_KEY
              Holds file name of X.509 user certificate  and  key.  (Tried  if
              X509_USER_PROXY is not valid.)

EXIT CODES
       0  is  returned on complete success. Curl error codes are returned when
       reported by the underlying curl library, and  CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR
       (22)  is  returned  when  the HTTP(S) server returns a code outside the
       range 200-299.  The manpage libcurl-errors(3) lists all the curl  error
       codes.

TO DO
       Recursive  copying.  Server-side  wildcards.  Parallel  streams. Better
       error recovery.
