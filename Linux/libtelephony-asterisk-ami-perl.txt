NAME
       Telephony::Asterisk::AMI - Simple Asterisk Manager Interface client

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.006 of Telephony::Asterisk::AMI, released December 26, 2015.

SYNOPSIS
         use Telephony::Asterisk::AMI ();

         my $ami = Telephony::Asterisk::AMI->new(
           Username => 'user',
           Secret => 'password',
         );

         $ami->connect or die $ami->error;

         my $response = $ami->action(Action => 'Ping');

         $ami->disconnect or die $ami->error;

DESCRIPTION
       Telephony::Asterisk::AMI is a simple client for the Asterisk Manager Interface.  It's better documented and less buggy than Asterisk::Manager, and has fewer prerequisites than Asterisk::AMI.  It
       uses IO::Socket::IP, so it should support either IPv4 or IPv6.

       If you need a more sophisticated client (especially for use in an event-driven program), try Asterisk::AMI.

METHODS
   Constructor
       new

         $ami = Telephony::Asterisk::AMI->new(%args);

       Constructs a new $ami object.  The %args may be passed as a hashref or a list of "key => value" pairs.

       This does not do any network communication; you must call "connect" to open the connection before doing anything else.

       The parameters are:

       "Username"
           The AMI username to use when logging in. (required)

       "Secret"
           The AMI secret (password) to use when logging in. (required)

       "Host"
           The hostname to connect to.  You can also specify "hostname:port" as a single string.  (default: localhost).

       "Port"
           The port number to connect to (if no port was specified with "Host").  (default: 5038)

       "ActionID"
           The  ActionID  to  start  at.   Each  call  to "action" increments the ActionID.  (Note: The "connect" & "disconnect" methods also consume an ActionID for the implicit Login & Logoff actions.)
           (default: 1)

       "Debug"
           If set to a true value, sets "Debug_FH" to "STDERR" (unless it was already set to a different value).  (default: false)

       "Debug_FH"
           A filehandle to write a transcript of the communications to.  Lines sent to Asterisk are prefixed with ">>", and lines received from Asterisk are prefixed with "<<".  (default: no transcript)

       "Event_Callback"
           A coderef that is called when an event is received from Asterisk while the "action" method is waiting for a response.  The event data is passed as a hashref, just like the return value of  the
           "action" method.  You MUST NOT call any methods on $ami from inside the callback.  (default: events are ignored)

       The constructor throws an exception if a required parameter is omitted.

   Main Methods
       connect

         $success = $ami->connect;

       Opens the connection to Asterisk and logs in.  $success is true if the login was successful, or "undef" on error.  On failure, you can get the error message with "$ami->error".

       disconnect

         $success = $ami->disconnect;

       Logs off of Asterisk and closes the connection.  $success is true if the logoff was successful, or "undef" on error.  On failure, you can get the error message with "$ami->error".

       After a successful call to "disconnect", you may call "connect" again to reestablish the connection.

       action

         $response = $ami->action(%args);

       Sends  an action request to Asterisk and returns the response.  The %args may be passed as a hashref or a list of "key => value" pairs, where the keys are the Asterisk field names.  To create more
       than one instance of a field, make the value an arrayref.

       The only required key is "Action".  (Asterisk may require other keys depending on the value of "Action", but that is not enforced by this module.)

       Do not pass an "ActionID" in %args.  The ActionID is provided automatically.

       The $response is a hashref formed from Asterisk's response in the same format as %args.  It will have a "Response" key whose value is either "Success" or "Error".  Unless it's an  error  response,
       it will also have an "ActionID" key whose value is the ActionID assigned to it.  (An error response might or might not have an ActionID.)

       Any events that are received while waiting for the response to the action are dispatched to the "Event_Callback" (if any).  If no callback was provided, events are discarded.

       If you have not called the "connect" method (or it failed), calling "action" will return a manufactured Error response with Message "Not connected to Asterisk!" and set "$ami->error".

       If communication with Asterisk fails, it will return a manufactured Error response with Message "Writing to socket failed: %s" or "Reading from socket failed: %s" and set "$ami->error".

       error

         $error_message = $ami->error;

       If communication with Asterisk fails, this method will return an error message describing the problem.

       If  Asterisk  returns  "Response:  Error"  for  some action, that does not set "$ami->error".  The exceptions are the automatic Login and Logoff actions performed by the "connect" and "disconnect"
       methods, which do set "error" on failure.

       It returns "undef" if there has been no communication error.

   Low-Level Methods
       You shouldn't normally need to use these methods, but sometimes you need more control over the communication with Asterisk.

       send_action

         $actionid = $ami->send_action(%args);

       Sends an action request to Asterisk and returns the ActionID.  The %args are the same as for "action".

       Do not pass an "ActionID" in %args.  The ActionID is provided automatically and returned.

       If you have not called the "connect" method (or it failed), calling "send_action" will return "undef" and set "$ami->error" to "Not connected to Asterisk!".

       If communication with Asterisk fails, it will return "undef" and set "$ami->error" to "Writing to socket failed: %s".

       read_response

         $response = $ami->read_response;

       Reads a single message from Asterisk.  Blocks until a message arrives.  The "action" method waits for the response, so "read_response" is only useful for reading events (or if you  used  the  low-
       level "send_action" method).

       It returns a hashref in the same format as the return value of the "action" method.  See that for details.

       Note  that  events  received  by  "read_response"  are  not delivered to the "Event_Callback" (if any).  The callback is used only for events that are received during the execution of the "action"
       method.

       If you have not called the "connect" method (or it failed), calling "read_response" will return a manufactured Error response with Message "Not connected to Asterisk!" and set "$ami->error".

       If communication with Asterisk fails, it will return a manufactured Error response with Message "Reading from socket failed: %s" and set "$ami->error".

       Asterisk::AMI is a more sophisticated AMI client better suited for event-driven programs.

       If you're using POE, you may want POE::Component::Client::Asterisk::Manager.

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Required parameter %s not defined"
           You omitted a required parameter from a method call.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       Telephony::Asterisk::AMI requires no configuration files or environment variables.
