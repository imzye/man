NAME
       dar_slave - disk archive slave for remote access to a dar archive

SYNOPSIS
       dar_slave [options] [<path>/]source

       dar_slave -h

       dar_slave -V

DESCRIPTION
       dar_slave reads an archive and listens for dar orders on standard input, sending asked parts of the archive on standard output.

       Source  is  the basename of the archive to read. By default, dar_slave uses standard input and output to communicate with a dar process, which may be running on the local host or on a remote host.
       It is possible to change the behavior of dar_slave to use named pipe instead of standard input and output

OPTIONS
       -h                  Displays help usage.

       -V                  Displays version information.

       -i <filename>       reads the orders from the named file instead of standard input. In most cases the filename will be a named pipe.

       -o <filename>       sends the data to the named file <filename> instead of standard output. In most cases the filename will be a named pipe.

       -E <string>         string is a command to be launched between slices. See dar(1) man page (same option) for more information.

       -Q                  Do not display any message on stderr when not launched from a terminal (for example when launched from an at job or crontab). Remains that any question to the user will be  as‐
                           sumed a 'no' answer, which most of the time will abort the program.

       -9 <num>            Defines the minimum number of digits to use for archive slice numbers. See the same option in dar man page for more details.

EXIT CODES
       dar_slaves exists with the same codes as dar does, see dar(1) man page.

SIGNALS
       Any signal sent to dar_slave will abort the program immediately, there is no way to have a proper termination before the end of the process
