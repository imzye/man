Module::Build::Tiny(3pm)                                                            User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                            Module::Build::Tiny(3pm)

NAME
       Module::Build::Tiny - A tiny replacement for Module::Build

VERSION
       version 0.052

SYNOPSIS
        use Module::Build::Tiny;
        Build_PL();

DESCRIPTION
       Many Perl distributions use a Build.PL file instead of a Makefile.PL file to drive distribution configuration, build, test and installation.  Traditionally, Build.PL uses Module::Build as the
       underlying build system.  This module provides a simple, lightweight, drop-in replacement.

       Whereas Module::Build has over 6,700 lines of code; this module has less than 200, yet supports the features needed by most distributions.

   Supported
       •   Pure Perl distributions

       •   Building XS or C

       •   Recursive test files

       •   MYMETA

       •   Man page generation

       •   Generated code from PL files

       •   Module sharedirs

       •   Dynamic prerequisites

   Not Supported
       •   HTML documentation generation

       •   Extending Module::Build::Tiny

   Directory structure
       Your  .pm,  .xs  and  .pod  files  must  be in lib/.  Any executables must be in script/.  Test files must be in t/. Dist sharedirs must be in share/, module sharedirs are under module-share (e.g.
       module-share/Foo-Bar for module "Foo::Bar").

       ".c" files in the src/ are compiled together with the .xs file matching the distribution name.

USAGE
       These all work pretty much like their Module::Build equivalents.

   perl Build.PL
   Build [ build ]
   Build test
   Build install
       This supports the following options:

       •   verbose

       •   install_base

       •   installdirs

       •   prefix

       •   install_path

       •   destdir

       •   uninst

       •   config

       •   pure-perl

       •   create_packlist

AUTHORING
       This module doesn't support authoring. To develop modules using Module::Build::Tiny, usage of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuildTiny or App::ModuleBuildTiny is recommended.

CONFIG FILE AND ENVIRONMENT
       Options can be provided in the "PERL_MB_OPT" environment variable the same way they can with Module::Build. This should be done during the configuration stage.

   Incompatibilities
       •   Argument parsing

           Module::Build has an extremely permissive way of argument handling, Module::Build::Tiny only supports a (sane) subset of that. In particular, "./Build destdir=/foo" does  not  work,  you  will
           need to pass it as "./Build --destdir=/foo".

       •   .modulebuildrc

           Module::Build::Tiny  does  not support .modulebuildrc files. In particular, this means that versions of local::lib older than 1.006008 may break with "ERROR: Can't create /usr/local/somepath".
           If the output of "perl -Mlocal::lib" contains "MODULEBUILDRC" but not "PERL_MB_OPT ", you will need to upgrade it to resolve this issue.
