NAME
       CGI::Uploader::Transform::ImageMagick - generate thumbnails with ImageMagick

METHODS
   gen_thumb()
         use CGI::Uploader::Transform::ImageMagick;

       As a class method:

        ($thumb_tmp_filename)  = CGI::Uploader::Transform::ImageMagick->gen_thumb({
           filename => $orig_filename,
                  w => $width,
                  h => $height
           });

       Within a CGI::Uploader "spec":

           gen_files => {
             my_thumb => gen_thumb({ w => $width, h => $height }),
           }

       Looking for a different syntax? See "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY"

       This function creates a copy of given image file and resizes the copy to the provided width and height.

       "gen_thumb" can be called as object or class method. As a class method, there there is no need to call "new()" before calling this method.

       Graphics::Magick is used as the first choice image service module.  Image::Magick is tried next.

       Input:

           filename - filename of source image
           w        - max width of thumbnail
           h        - max height of thumbnail

       One or both  of "w" or "h" is required.

       Output:
           - filename of generated tmp file for the thumbnail
           - the initialized image generation object. (You generally shouldn't need this)

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
       These older, more awkward syntaxes are still supported:

       As a class method:

        ($thumb_tmp_filename)  = CGI::Uploader::Transform::ImageMagick->gen_thumb(
           $orig_filename,
           [ w => $width, h => $height ]
           );

       In a "CGI::Uploader" "spec":

       'my_img_field_name' => {
           transform_method => \&gen_thumb,
           params => [ w => 100, h => 100 ],
         }

       1;
