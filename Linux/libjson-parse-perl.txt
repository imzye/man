NAME
       JSON::Tokenize - Tokenize JSON

SYNOPSIS
           use JSON::Tokenize ':all';

           my $input = '{"tuttie":["fruity", true, 100]}';
           my $token = tokenize_json ($input);
           print_tokens ($token, 0);

           sub print_tokens
           {
               my ($token, $depth) = @_;
               while ($token) {
                   my $start = tokenize_start ($token);
                   my $end = tokenize_end ($token);
                   my $type = tokenize_type ($token);
                   print "   " x $depth;
                   my $value = substr ($input, $start, $end - $start);
                   print "'$value' has type '$type'.\n";
                   my $child = tokenize_child ($token);
                   if ($child) {
                       print_tokens ($child, $depth+1);
                   }
                   my $next = tokenize_next ($token);
                   $token = $next;
               }
           }

       This outputs

           '{"tuttie":["fruity", true, 100]}' has type 'object'.
              '"tuttie"' has type 'string'.
              ':' has type 'colon'.
              '["fruity", true, 100]' has type 'array'.
                 '"fruity"' has type 'string'.
                 ',' has type 'comma'.
                 'true' has type 'literal'.
                 ',' has type 'comma'.
                 '100' has type 'number'.

VERSION
       This documents version 0.62 of JSON::Tokenize corresponding to git commit d04630086f6c92fea720cba4568faa0cbbdde5a6 <https://github.com/benkasminbullock/JSON-
       Parse/commit/d04630086f6c92fea720cba4568faa0cbbdde5a6> released on Sat Jul 16 08:23:13 2022 +0900.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a module for tokenizing a JSON string. "Tokenizing" means breaking the string into individual tokens, without creating any Perl structures. It uses the same underlying code as JSON::Parse.
       Tokenizing can be used for tasks such as picking out or searching through parts of a large JSON structure without storing each part of the entire structure in memory.

       This module is an experimental part of JSON::Parse and its interface is likely to change. The tokenizing functions are currently written in a very primitive way.

FUNCTIONS
   tokenize_child
           my $child = tokenize_child ($child);

       Walk the tree of tokens.

   tokenize_end
           my $end = tokenize_end ($token);

       Get the end of the token as a byte offset from the start of the string. Note this is a byte offset not a character offset.

   tokenize_json
           my $token = tokenize_json ($json);

   tokenize_next
           my $next = tokenize_next ($token);

       Walk the tree of tokens.

   tokenize_start
           my $start = tokenize_start ($token);

       Get the start of the token as a byte offset from the start of the string. Note this is a byte offset not a character offset.

   tokenize_text
           my $text = tokenize_text ($json, $token);

       Given a token $token from this parsing and the JSON in $json, return the text which corresponds to the token. This is a convenience function written in Perl which uses "tokenize_start" and
       "tokenize_end" and "substr" to get the string from $json.

   tokenize_type
           my $type = tokenize_type ($token);

       Get the type of the token as a string. The possible return values are

           "array",
           "initial state",
           "invalid",
           "literal",
           "number",
           "object",
           "string",
           "unicode escape"
