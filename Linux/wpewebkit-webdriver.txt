NAME
       WPEWebDriver - WebDriver service implementation for WPE WebKit

SYNOPSIS
       WPEWebDriver [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the WPEWebDriver command.

       WebDriver is an automation API to control a web browser. It allows the user to create automated tests for web applications independently of the browser and platform.

       The WPEWebDriver binary provides the WebDriver service implementation for WPE WebKit. It works as a server, processing client requests to spawn and control the web browser. This driver is not tied
       to any specific browser and can be used with any WPE WebKit-based browser, but it uses MiniBrowser as the default.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show summary of command-line options.

       -p <port>, --port=<port>
              Set the port number that the driver will use.
