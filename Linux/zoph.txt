NAME
       zoph.ini - Configuration file for Zoph

DESCRIPTION
       zoph.ini  is  a  configuration file, usually placed in /etc, that tells Zoph how to connect to the (MySQL) database. Besides zoph.ini, there is another configuration file, config.inc.php, which is
       placed inside the webroot. If you have no write access in /etc or have another reason to not put this file there, you should change the INI_FILE setting in config.inc.php and the 'zoph' CLI  util‐
       ity.

       IMPORTANT!  Never, ever, place it in the same directory as the Zoph PHP files. This will enable everyone to download it and read your passwords.

CONTENTS
       zoph.ini consists of one or more sections. A section starts with the name of the section between square brackets:

              [zoph]

       You should create a section for each Zoph installation on your system. The section name is a descriptive name that you can choose yourself. Each section must contain the following settings:

       db_host
              The hostname of the system that is running your MySQL server, usually "localhost".

       db_name
              The name of the database. If you have followed the installation instructions closely, this will be zoph, but of course you are free to use any other name.

       db_user
              The user to connect to your Zoph database. If you have followed the installation instructions closely, this will be zoph_rw, but of course you are free to use any other name.

       db_pass
              Password to connect to the database. This is what you have set while creating users for Zoph in MySQL.

       db_prefix
              Zoph  can  prefix all MySQL table names with a prefix string. This is especially useful for people who only have a single database to use and want to use multiple applications on, for exam‐
              ple, a shared hosting environment. By default, this is "zoph_".

       php_location
              With the php_location setting, you define where the PHP-files for your Zoph installation are located. This is necessary for the Zoph CLI scripts to locate the rest of  your  Zoph  installa‐
              tion.

EXAMPLES
   Single installation
       Most Zoph users will have only one Zoph installation on their system. This is how a zoph.ini for a single installation looks:

              [zoph]
              db_host = localhost
              db_name = zoph
              db_user = zoph_rw
              db_pass = pass
              db_prefix = zoph_
              php_location = /var/www/html/zoph

   Multiple installations
       You can have multiple Zoph installations on one system. For example, one for yourself and one for a family member or friend; or, if you are a Zoph developper, a development and a productions envi‐
       ronment. If you have more than one Zoph installation, simply create a section per installation. For example:

              [production]
              db_host = localhost
              db_name = zoph
              db_user = zoph_rw
              db_pass = pass
              db_prefix = zoph_
              php_location = /var/www/html/zoph

              [development]
              db_host = localhost
              db_name = zophdev
              db_user = zoph_rw
              db_pass = pass
              db_prefix = zoph_
              php_location = /var/www/html/zophdev

       The  webinterface  of  Zoph  will  be able to determine which settings it should use with the php_location setting. The CLI scripts need the --instance parameter to determine that. If you omit the
       --instance parameter, it will use the first one in zoph.ini.
