slurmdbd.conf(5)                                                      Slurm Configuration File                                                      slurmdbd.conf(5)

NAME
       slurmdbd.conf - Slurm Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       slurmdbd.conf  is  an ASCII file which describes Slurm Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration information.  The file will always be located in the same di‐
       rectory as the slurm.conf.

       The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of nodes and files. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file  is  treated  as  a
       comment  through  the end of that line.  Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of SlurmDBD or daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal unless
       otherwise noted.

       This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and should only be readable by the user which executes  SlurmDBD  (e.g.  "slurm").   If  the
       slurmdbd  daemon  is started as user root and changes to another user ID, the configuration file will initially be read as user root, but will be read as the
       other user ID in response to a SIGHUP signal.  This file should be protected from unauthorized access since it contains a  database  password.   The  overall
       configuration parameters available include:

       ArchiveDir
              If  ArchiveScript  is  not set the slurmdbd will generate a file that can be read in anytime with sacctmgr load filename.  This directory is where the
              file will be placed after a purge event has happened and archive for that element is set to true.  Default is /tmp.  The format for this files name is
              $ArchiveDir/$ClusterName_$ArchiveObject_archive_$BeginTimeStamp_$endTimeStamp  We  limit  archive  files to 50000 records per file. If more than 50000
              records exist during that time period, they will be written to a new file.  Subsequent archive files during the same time period will have ".<number>"
              appended to the file, for example .2, with the number increasing by one for each file in the same time period.

       ArchiveEvents
              When purging events also archive them.  Boolean, yes to archive event data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

       ArchiveJobs
              When purging jobs also archive them.  Boolean, yes to archive job data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

       ArchiveResvs
              When purging reservations also archive them.  Boolean, yes to archive reservation data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

       ArchiveScript
              This  script  can  be  executed every time a rollup happens (every hour, day and month), depending on the Purge*After options.  This script is used to
              transfer accounting records out of the database into an archive.  It is used in place of the internal process used to archive objects.  The script  is
              executed with no arguments, and the following environment variables are set.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_EVENTS
                     1 for archive events 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_LAST_EVENT
                     Time of last event start to archive.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_JOBS
                     1 for archive jobs 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_LAST_JOB
                     Time of last job submit to archive.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_STEPS
                     1 for archive steps 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_LAST_STEP
                     Time of last step start to archive.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_SUSPEND
                     1 for archive suspend data 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_TXN
                     1 for archive transaction data 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_USAGE
                     1 for archive usage data 0 otherwise.

              SLURM_ARCHIVE_LAST_SUSPEND
                     Time of last suspend start to archive.

       ArchiveSteps
              When purging steps also archive them.  Boolean, yes to archive step data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

       ArchiveSuspend
              When purging suspend data also archive it.  Boolean, yes to archive suspend data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

       ArchiveTXN
              When purging transaction data also archive it.  Boolean, yes to archive transaction data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

       ArchiveUsage
              When purging usage data (Cluster, Association and WCKey) also archive it.  Boolean, yes to archive transaction data, no otherwise.  Default is no.

       AuthInfo
              Additional  information to be used for authentication of communications with the Slurm control daemon (slurmctld) on each cluster.  The interpretation
              of this option is specific to the configured AuthType.  In the case of auth/munge, this can be configured to use a Munge daemon  specifically  config‐
              ured  to  provide  authentication  between  clusters while the default Munge daemon provides authentication within a cluster.  In that case, this will
              specify the pathname of the socket to use. Per default this value is left unspecified, which results in the  default  authentication  mechanism  being
              used.

       AuthAltTypes
              Command separated list of alternative authentication plugins that the slurmdbd will permit for communication.

       AuthAltParameters
              Used to define alternative authentication plugins options. Multiple options may be comma separated.

              jwks=  Absolute  path  to  JWKS  file. Only RS256 keys are supported, although other key types may be listed in the file. If set, no HS256 key will be
                     loaded by default (and token generation is disabled), although the jwt_key setting may be used to explicitly re-enable HS256 key use (and token
                     generation).

              jwt_key=
                     Absolute path to JWT key file. Key must be HS256, and should only be accessible by SlurmUser.

       AuthType
              Define  the  authentication  method  for communications between Slurm components.  Acceptable values at present include "auth/munge", which is the de‐
              fault.  "auth/munge"  indicates  that  LLNL's  MUNGE  system  is  to  be  used  (this  is  the  supported  authentication  mechanism  for  Slurm;  see
              "https://dun.github.io/munge/" for more information).  SlurmDBD must be terminated prior to changing the value of AuthType and later restarted.

       CommitDelay
              How  many seconds between commits on a connection from a Slurmctld.  This speeds up inserts into the database dramatically.  If you are running a very
              high throughput of jobs you should consider setting this.  In testing, 1 second improves the slurmdbd performance dramatically and  reduces  overhead.
              There  is  a  small probability of data loss though since this creates a window in which if the slurmdbd seg faults or exits abnormally for any reason
              the data not committed could be lost.  While this situation should be very rare, it does present an extremely small risk, but may be the only  way  to
              run in extremely heavy environments.  In all honesty, the risk is quite low, but still present.

       CommunicationParameters
              Comma separated options identifying communication options.

              DisableIPv4    Disable IPv4 only operation for the slurmdbd. This should also be set in your slurm.conf file.

              EnableIPv6     Enable  using  IPv6  addresses  for  the  slurmdbd.  When  using  both  IPv4 and IPv6, address family preferences will be based on your
                             /etc/gai.conf file. This should also be set in your slurm.conf file.

       DbdBackupHost
              The short, or long, name of the machine where the backup Slurm Database Daemon is executed (i.e. the name returned  by  the  command  "hostname  -s").
              This host must have access to the same underlying database specified by the 'Storage' options mentioned below.

       DbdAddr
              Name that DbdHost should be referred to in establishing a communications path. This name will be used as an argument to the getaddrinfo() function for
              identification. For example, "elx0000" might be used to designate the Ethernet address for node "lx0000".  By default the DbdAddr will be identical in
              value to DbdHost.

       DbdHost
              The short, or long, name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname -s").  This value
              must be specified.

       DbdPort
              The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) listens to for work. The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system build time.
              If no value is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.  This value must be equal to the AccountingStoragePort parameter in the slurm.conf file.

       DebugFlags
              Defines  specific  subsystems which should provide more detailed event logging.  Multiple subsystems can be specified with comma separators.  Most De‐
              bugFlags will result in verbose logging for the identified subsystems and could impact performance.  Valid subsystems available today  (with  more  to
              come) include:

              DB_ARCHIVE
                     SQL statements/queries when dealing with archiving and purging the database.

              DB_ASSOC
                     SQL statements/queries when dealing with associations in the database.

              DB_USAGE
                     SQL statements/queries when dealing with usage queries and inserts in the database.

              DB_WCKEY
                     SQL statements/queries when dealing with wckeys in the database.

              FEDERATION
                     SQL statements/queries when dealing with federations in the database.

       DebugLevel
              The level of detail to provide the Slurm Database Daemon's logs.  The default value is info.

              quiet     Log nothing

              fatal     Log only fatal errors

              error     Log only errors

              info      Log errors and general informational messages

              verbose   Log errors and verbose informational messages

              debug     Log errors and verbose informational messages and debugging messages

              debug2    Log errors and verbose informational messages and more debugging messages

              debug3    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              debug4    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              debug5    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

       DebugLevelSyslog
              The  slurmdbd  daemon will log events to the syslog file at the specified level of detail. If not set, the slurmdbd daemon will log to syslog at level
              fatal, unless there is no LogFile and it is running in the background, in which case it will log to syslog at the level specified  by  DebugLevel  (at
              fatal in the case that DebugLevel is set to quiet) or it is run in the foreground, when it will be set to quiet.

              quiet     Log nothing

              fatal     Log only fatal errors

              error     Log only errors

              info      Log errors and general informational messages

              verbose   Log errors and verbose informational messages

              debug     Log errors and verbose informational messages and debugging messages

              debug2    Log errors and verbose informational messages and more debugging messages

              debug3    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              debug4    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              debug5    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              NOTE: By default, Slurm's systemd service files start daemons in the foreground with the -D option. This means that systemd will capture stdout/stderr
              output and print that to syslog, independent of Slurm printing to syslog directly. To prevent systemd from doing this, add  "StandardOutput=null"  and
              "StandardError=null" to the respective service files or override files.

       DefaultQOS
              When adding a new cluster this will be used as the qos for the cluster unless something is explicitly set by the admin with the create.

       LogFile
              Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon's logs are written.  The default value is none (performs logging via syslog).
              See the section LOGGING in the slurm.conf man page if a pathname is specified.

       LogTimeFormat
              Format  of the timestamp in slurmdbd log files. Accepted values are "iso8601", "iso8601_ms", "rfc5424", "rfc5424_ms", "clock", and "short". The values
              ending in "_ms" differ from the ones without in that fractional seconds with millisecond precision are printed. The default value is "iso8601_ms". The
              "rfc5424"  formats  are  the  same  as the "iso8601" formats except that the timezone value is also shown. The "clock" format shows a timestamp in mi‐
              croseconds retrieved with the C standard clock() function. The "short" format is a short date and time format. The "thread_id" format shows the  time‐
              stamp in the C standard ctime() function form without the year but including the microseconds, the daemon's process ID and the current thread ID.

       MaxQueryTimeRange
              Return  an error if a query is against too large of a time span, to prevent ill-formed queries from causing performance problems within SlurmDBD.  De‐
              fault value is INFINITE which allows any queries to proceed.  Accepted time formats are the same as the MaxTime option in  slurm.conf.   Operator  and
              higher privileged users are exempt from this restriction.  Note that queries which attempt to return over 3GB of data will still fail to complete with
              ESLURM_RESULT_TOO_LARGE.

       MessageTimeout
              Time permitted for a round-trip communication to complete in seconds. Default value is 10 seconds.

       Parameters
              Contains arbitrary comma separated parameters used to alter the behavior of the slurmdbd.

              PreserveCaseUser
                     When defining users do not force lower case which is the default behavior.

       PidFile
              Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon may write its process ID. This may be used for  automated  signal  processing.
              The default value is "/var/run/slurmdbd.pid".

       PluginDir
              Identifies the places in which to look for Slurm plugins.  This is a colon-separated list of directories, like the PATH environment variable.  The de‐
              fault value is the prefix given at configure time + "/lib/slurm".

       PrivateData
              This controls what type of information is hidden from regular users.  By default, all information is visible to all users.  User SlurmUser, root,  and
              users with AdminLevel=Admin can always view all information.  Multiple values may be specified with a comma separator.  Acceptable values include:

              accounts
                     prevents users from viewing any account definitions unless they are coordinators of them.

              events prevents users from viewing event information unless they have operator status or above.

              jobs   prevents users from viewing job records belonging to other users unless they are coordinators of the account running the job when using sacct.

              reservations
                     restricts getting reservation information to users with operator status and above.

              usage  prevents users from viewing usage of any other user.  This applies to sreport.

              users  prevents  users  from  viewing  information  of any user other than themselves, this also makes it so users can only see associations they deal
                     with.  Coordinators can see associations of all users in the account they are coordinator of, but can only see themselves when listing users.

       PurgeEventAfter
              Events happening on the cluster over this age are purged from the database.  This includes node down times and such.  The time is a numeric value  and
              is  a number of months.  If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges
              (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For  example,
              if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then event records are never purged.

       PurgeJobAfter
              Individual  job records over this age are purged from the database.  Aggregated information will be preserved to "PurgeUsageAfter".  The time is a nu‐
              meric value and is a number of months.  If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those  more
              frequent  purges  (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge inter‐
              val.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then job  records  are
              never purged.

       PurgeResvAfter
              Individual  reservation  records over this age are purged from the database.  Aggregated information will be preserved to "PurgeUsageAfter".  The time
              is a numeric value and is a number of months.  If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind  the  numeric  value  to  get
              those  more  frequent  purges  (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each
              purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then reser‐
              vation records are never purged.

       PurgeStepAfter
              Individual job step records over this age are purged from the database.  Aggregated information will be preserved to "PurgeUsageAfter".  The time is a
              numeric value and is a number of months.  If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric  value  to  get  those
              more frequent purges (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge in‐
              terval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If  not  set  (default),  then  job  step
              records are never purged.

       PurgeSuspendAfter
              Records  of  individual  suspend  times  for  jobs  over  this  age  are  purged  from  the  database.   Aggregated  information  will be preserved to
              "PurgeUsageAfter".  The time is a numeric value and is a number of months.  If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days"  behind
              the  numeric value to get those more frequent purges (i.e. a value of "12hours" would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at
              the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If not  set
              (default), then suspend records are never purged.

       PurgeTXNAfter
              Records  of  individual transaction times for transactions over this age are purged from the database.  The time is a numeric value and is a number of
              months.  If you want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges (i.e.  a  value
              of  "12hours"  would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if the purge
              time is 2 months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then transaction records are never purged.

       PurgeUsageAfter
              Usage Records (Cluster, Association and WCKey) over this age are purged from the database.  The time is a numeric value and is a number of months.  If
              you  want to purge more often you can include "hours", or "days" behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges (i.e. a value of "12hours"
              would purge everything older than 12 hours).  The purge takes place at the start of the each purge interval.  For example, if  the  purge  time  is  2
              months, the purge would happen at the beginning of each month.  If not set (default), then usage records are never purged.

       SlurmUser
              The  name  of  the user that the slurmdbd daemon executes as.  This user should match the SlurmUser used for all instances of slurmctld that report to
              slurmdbd. It must exist on the machine executing the Slurm Database Daemon and have the same UID as the hosts on which slurmctld executes.  For  secu‐
              rity purposes, a user other than "root" is recommended.  The default value is "root".

              NOTE: If the SlurmUser defined for slurmctld is not root and is different than the SlurmUser defined for slurmdbd, the user used for slurmctld must be
              added to accounting with AdminLevel=Admin and slurmctld must be restarted.

       StorageHost
              Define the name of the host the database is running where we are going to store the data.  Ideally this should be the host on which slurmdbd executes.

       StorageBackupHost
              Define the name of the backup host the database is running where we are going to store the data.  This can be viewed as a  backup  solution  when  the
              StorageHost  is  not  responding.   It is up to the backup solution to enforce the coherency of the accounting information between the two hosts. With
              clustered database solutions (active/passive HA), you would not need to use this feature.  Default is none.

       StorageLoc
              Specify the name of the database as the location where accounting records are written. Defaults to "slurm_acct_db".

       StorageParameters
              Comma separated list of key-value pair parameters. Currently supported values include options to establish a secure connection to the database:

              SSL_CERT
                The path name of the client public key certificate file.

              SSL_CA
                The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file.

              SSL_CAPATH
                The path name of the directory that contains trusted SSL CA certificate files.

              SSL_KEY
                The path name of the client private key file.

              SSL_CIPHER
                The list of permissible ciphers for SSL encryption.

       StoragePass
              Define the password used to gain access to the database to store the job accounting data. The '#' character is not permitted in a password.

       StoragePort
              The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) communicates with the database. Default is 3306.

       StorageType
              Define the accounting storage mechanism type.  Acceptable values at present include "accounting_storage/mysql".  The value  "accounting_storage/mysql"
              indicates  that  accounting records should be written to a MySQL or MariaDB database specified by the StorageLoc parameter.  This value must be speci‐
              fied.

       StorageUser
              Define the name of the user we are going to connect to the database with to store the job accounting data.

       TCPTimeout
              Time permitted for TCP connection to be established. Default value is 2 seconds.

       TrackSlurmctldDown
              Boolean yes or no.  If set the slurmdbd will mark all idle resources on the cluster as down when a slurmctld disconnects or is  no  longer  reachable.
              The default is no.

       TrackWCKey
              Boolean  yes or no.  Used to set display and track of the Workload Characterization Key. Must be set to track wckey usage.  This must be set to gener‐
              ate rolled up usage tables from WCKeys.  NOTE: If TrackWCKey is set here and not in your various slurm.conf files all jobs will be attributed to their
              default WCKey.
