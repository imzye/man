NAME
       ethersrv-linux - Ethernet DOS Filesystem server

SYNOPSIS
       ethersrv-linux [-f] iface directory [directory...]

DESCRIPTION
       ethersrv-linux serves the named directories over the interface iface.

       The first exported directory will be mapped to C:, the second to D:, etc.

OPTIONS
       -f     stay in the foreground (do not daemonize the process).

NOTES
       ethersrv-linux needs the CAP_NEW_RAW system capability, which usually means that it needs to be run as root.

       The exported directories should reside on FAT filesystems; this ensures that FAT attributes and mixed-case filenames are handled correctly, and that '.' and '..'  appear in the expected order.
