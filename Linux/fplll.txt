NAME
       fplll - manual page for fplll 5.4.1

SYNOPSIS
       fplll [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
   List of options:
       -a [lll|bkz|hkz|svp|sdb|sld|cvp]

              lll  =  LLL-reduce  the input matrix (default) bkz = BKZ-reduce the input matrix hkz = HKZ-reduce the input matrix svp = compute a shortest non-zero vector of the lattice sdb = reduce the input
              matrix using the self dual BKZ variant sld = slide reduce the input matrix cvp = compute the vector in the input lattice closest to an input vector hlll = HLLL-reduce the input matrix

       -v

              Enable verbose mode

       -nolll

              Does not apply initial LLL-reduction (for bkz, hkz and svp)

       -c <c>

              An arbitrary double constant > 0 for HLLL (default=0.1)

       -r <size>

              Was the number of rows (ignored)

       -d <delta> (default=0.99; alias to -delta <delta>)

       -e <eta> (default=0.51; alias to -eta <eta>)

       -t <theta> (default=0.001; alias to -theta <theta>)

       -l <lovasz>

              If <lovasz> != 0, Lovasz's condition, otherwise, Siegel's condition

       -f [mpfr|dd|qd|dpe|double|longdouble]

              Floating-point type in LLL

       -p <precision>

              Floating-point precision (only with -f mpfr)

       -z [mpz|int|long|double]

              Integer type in LLL (default: mpz; long is an alias to int)

       -m [wrapper|fast|heuristic|proved]

              LLL version (default: wrapper)

       -y

              Enable early reduction

       -b <block_size>

              Size of BKZ blocks

       -bkzmaxloops <loops>

              Maximum number of full loop iterations

       -bkzmaxtime <time>

              Stops after <time> seconds

       -bkzautoabort

              Stops when the average slope does not decrease fast enough

       -s <filename.json>

              Load BKZ strategies from filename

       -bkzghbound <factor>

              Multiplies the Gaussian heuristic by <factor> (of float type)

       -bkzboundedlll

              Restricts the LLL call

       -bkzdumpgso <file_name>

              Dumps the log of the Gram-Schmidt vectors in specified file

       -of [b|c|s|t|u|v|bk|uk|vk]

              Output formats.
