NAME
       dh_perl_imager - add dependencies required for Imager modules

SYNOPSIS
       dh_perl_imager [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_perl_imager is a debhelper program that is responsible for adding a dependency on perl-imagerapi-* to the ${perl:Depends} substitution variable.  Such a dependency is required for packages that
       are compiled against Imager; do not use this for packages that only use the Imager module.

       A debhelper addon is also provided.  This makes it possible to just use

         #!/usr/bin/make -f
         %:
                 dh $@ --with perl_imager

       for debian/rules.

       Alternatively, since libimager-perl/1.007+dfsg-1 you can just build depend on dh-sequence-perl-imager and omit the "--with perl_imager" part.
