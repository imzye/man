NAME
       relational-cli — Implementation of Relational algebra.

SYNOPSIS
       relational-cli [OPTIONS] [ FILE ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This program provides a command line interface to execute relational algebra queries. It is meant to experiment with relational algebra queries.

SCRIPTING
       The tool always runs in interactive mode, but it is possible to write a sequence of queries in a script and run it.

       relational-cli < script.txt

       The result of all the lines that do not terminate with a `;' are printed.

       Comments are lines beginning with `;'.

       Whenever stdin or stdout are not a terminal, silent mode will be used, which prints less debug information, to avoid cluttering.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -v     Show version information and exit.

       -h     Shows help and exit.

       -q     Uses the Qt5 GUI.

       -r     Uses the readline UI (default).
