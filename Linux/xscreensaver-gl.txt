NAME
       mirrorblob - Draws a wobbly blob that distorts the image behind it.

SYNOPSIS
       mirrorblob  [--display  host:display.screen]  [--visual  visual]  [--window]  [--root]  [--window-id  number]  [--wire] [--delay number] [--fog] [--walls] [--colour] [--texture] [--offset-texture]
       [--blend] [--antialias] [--resolution number] [--bumps number] [--fade-time number] [--hold-time number] [--zoom number] [--fps]

DESCRIPTION
       Draws a wobbling blob, making use of alpha blending, fog, textures, and lighting, plus a ``frames per second'' meter so that you can tell how fast your graphics card is... Requires OpenGL.

OPTIONS
       --visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       --window
               Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       --root  Draw on the root window.

       --window-id number
               Draw on the specified window.  --wire Render in wireframe instead of solid.

       --delay number
               Per-frame delay, in microseconds.  Default: 10000 (0.01 seconds.).

       --fog | --no-fog
               Whether to enable fog.

       --walls | --no-walls
               Add walls for blob to hit.

       --colour | --no-colour
               Draw coloured blob.  If also textured, the texture will have color mixed in.

       --texture | --no-texture
               Whether to wrap a texture image on the blob.

       --offset_texture | --no-offset_texture
               Whether to ofset the texture calculations to only use a region of the image
                under the blob.  This works well with a semi-transparent blob.

       --blend | --no-blend
               Whether to draw a transparent blob. (see also offset_texture above)

       --antialias | --no-antialias
               Whether to antialias lines.

       --resolution number
               Resolution of the tessellation used to calculate and draw the blob.  Larger
                numbers give a smoother blob but increase calculation times exponentially.

       --bumps number
               Number of bumps used to distort the blob.

       --hold-time number
               Time until loading a new image.

       --fade-time number
               Time taken to transition between images.

       --zoom number
               Size multiplier for blob.

       --fps   Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW
               The window ID to use with --root.
