NAME
       cgps, gegps, gps, lcdgps - simple clients for gpsd

SYNOPSIS
       cgps [-?] [--debug LVL] [--help] [--llfmt [[d] | [m] | [s]]] [--magtrack] [--silent] [--units [[i] | [n] | [m]]] [--version] [-D LVL] [-h] [-l [[d] | [m] | [s]]] [-m] [-s] [-u [[i] | [n] | [m]]] [-V]
            [server [:port [:device]]]

       gegps [-?] [--debug LVL] [--device DEVICE] [--help] [--host HOST] [--initialize] [--kmldir DIRECTORY] [--port PORT] [--version] [-D DEBUG] [-d DIRECTORY] [-h] [-i] [-V] [server [:port [:device]]]

       lcdgps [-?] [--help] [--sleep] [--version] [-h] [-j] [-l [[d] | [m] | [s]]] [-s] [-u [[i] | [n] | [m]]] [-V] [server [:port [:device]]]

DESCRIPTION
       These are some simple clients shipped with gpsd. They have some common options:

       -?, -h, --help
           Print a summary of options and then exit.

       -V, --version
           Print the package version and exit.

       By default, clients collect data from all compatible devices on localhost, using the default GPSD port 2947. An optional argument to any client may specify a server to get data from. A colon-separated
       suffix is taken as a port number. If there is a second colon-separated suffix, that is taken as a specific device name to be watched. However, if the server specification contains square brackets, the
       part inside them is taken as an IPv6 address and port/device suffixes are only parsed after the trailing bracket. Possible cases look like this:

       localhost:/dev/ttyS1
           Look at the default port of localhost, trying both IPv4 and IPv6 and watching output from serial device 1.

       example.com:2317
           Look at port 2317 on example.com, trying both IPv4 and IPv6.

       71.162.241.5:2317:/dev/ttyS3
           Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv4 address, collecting data from attached serial device 3.

       [FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:2317:/dev/ttyS5
           Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv6 address, collecting data from attached serial device 5.

   cgps
       cgps is a client resembling xgps, but without the pictorial satellite display and able to run on a serial terminal or terminal emulator.

       -D LVL, --debug LVL
           Sets the debug level; it is primarily for use by GPSD developers. It enables various progress messages to standard error.

       -l FMT, --llfmt FMT
           Sets the format of latitude and longitude reports. The value 'd' produces decimal degrees and is the default. The value 'm' produces degrees and decimal minutes. The value 's' produces degrees,
           minutes, and decimal seconds.

       -s, --silent
           Prevents cgps from displaying the data coming from the daemon. This display can also be toggled with the s command.

       -m, --magtrack
           Display your magnetic track (as opposed to your true track). This is a calculated value, not a measured value. Magnetic variation is always potentially subject to large errors, but is usually
           better than two degrees.

       -u UNITS, --units UNITS
           Set the system units for display; follow the keyword with 'i' for 'imperial' for American units (International Feet in altitude and error estimates, miles per hour in speeds), 'n' for 'nautical'
           (feet in altitude and error estimates, knots in speed) or 'm' for 'metric' (meters in altitude and error estimates, kilometers per hour in speeds).

           Note: The USA Survey Foot is not supported.

       cgps terminates when you send it a SIGHUP or SIGINT; given default terminal settings this will happen when you type Ctrl-C at it. It will also terminate on 'q'

   gegps
       This program collects fixes from gpsd and feeds them to a running instance of Google Earth for live location tracking.

       -d DIR, --kmldir DIR
           Specify the location of the Google Earth installation directory. If not specified, it defaults to the current directory.

       -D LVL, --debug LVL
           Sets the debug level; it is primarily for use by GPSD developers. It enables various progress messages to standard error.

       --device DEVICE
           Connect to device DEVICE on gpsd host.

       --host HOST
           Connect to gpsd on host HOST.

       -i, --initialize
           If you have the free (non-subscription) version, start by running with the -i option to drop a clue in the Google Earth installation directory, as 'Open_in_Google_Earth_RT_GPS.kml', then open that
           file in Places (File > Open...). Run gegps in the normal way after that.

       --port PORT
           Connect to gpsd on port PORT.

   lcdgps
       A client that passes gpsd data to lcdproc, turning your car computer into a very expensive and nearly feature-free GPS receiver. Currently assumes a 4x40 LCD and writes data formatted to fit that size
       screen. Also displays 4- or 6-character Maidenhead grid square output.

       -s, --sleep
           Sleep for 10 seconds before starting.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable GPSD_UNITS is checked if no unit system is specified on the command line. It may be set to 'i'. 'imperial', 'm', 'metric', or 'n', 'nautical'.

       LC_MEASUREMENT and then LANG are checked if no unit system has been specified on the command line, or in GPSD_UNITS. If the value is 'C', 'POSIX', or begins with 'en_US' the unit system is set to
       imperial. The default if no system has been selected defaults to metric.
