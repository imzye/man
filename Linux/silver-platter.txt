NAME
       debian-svp - create and manage changes against Debian packaging branches

SYNOPSIS
       debian-svp [-h] [--version] {run,new-upstream,upload-pending,lintian-brush} ...

DESCRIPTION
       debian-svp  is  a  specialized version of svp(1) that automatically resolves Debian package names to the URLs of packaging branches. It also provides support for a couple of Debian-specific opera‐
       tions.

   COMMAND OVERVIEW
       debian-svp run [-h] [--refresh] [--label LABEL] [--name NAME] [--mode {push,attempt-push,propose}] [--dry-run] [--commit-pending {auto,yes,no}] package script
              Make a change by running a script. URL should be the URL of a repository to make changes to. Script will be run in a checkout of the URL, with the opportunity to make changes. Depending  on
              the specified mode, the changes will be committed and pushed back to the repository at the original URL or proposed as a change to the repository at the original URL.

       debian-svp new-upstream [-h] [--snapshot] [--no-build-verify] [--pre-check PRE_CHECK] [--dry-run] [--mode {push,attempt-push,propose}] packages [packages ...]
              Create  a  merge  proposal  merging a new upstream version. The location of the upstream repository is retrieved from the debian/upstream/metadata file, and the tarball is fetched using us‐
              can(1).

       debian-svp upload-pending
              Upload pending commits in a packaging branch.
