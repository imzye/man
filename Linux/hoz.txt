DESCRIPTION
       HOZ is a file splitter, which uses the same file format as the popular 'Hacha' program.

OPTIONS
       -c   --cut
              cut (file->pieces)

       -p   --paste
              paste (pieces->file)

       -v   --verbose
              verbose output

       -f   --force
              force overwrite of file when pasting

       -o   --outpath
              specify an output directory

       -h   --help
              print this help, then exit

       --version
              print hoz program version number, then exit

USAGE
       There  are  two basic operations: cut and paste. Cut will 'split' a file in pieces. The size of each piece is passed as an option. Each piece will have a numeric extension, starting with 0. So for
       instance if you 'cut' a file called 'foo.iso', the pieces will be named 'foo.iso.0', 'foo.iso.1' and so on.

       Paste will 'merge' these pieces and generate and exact copy of the original file.

       ghoz is the graphical version of hoz, which uses a GTK GUI interface.
