NAME
       sigma - Simple greedy multiple alignment of non-coding DNA sequences

SYNOPSIS

       sigma [options] [inputfile.fasta] [inputfile2.fasta ...]

       Each fasta file may contain a single sequence or multiple sequences; all sequences will be aligned together.

DESCRIPTION
       Sigma ("Simple greedy multiple alignment") is an alignment program with a new algorithm and scoring scheme designed specifically for non-coding DNA sequence. It uses a strategy of seeking the best
       possible gapless local alignments, at each step making the best possible alignment consistent with existing alignments, and scores the significance of the alignment based on the lengths of the
       aligned fragments and a background model which may be supplied or estimated from an auxiliary file of intergenic DNA. With real data, while "correctness" can't be directly quantified for the
       alignment, running the PhyloGibbs motif finder on pre-aligned sequence suggests that Sigma's alignments are superior.

OPTIONS
       -A --aligned_output
          Aligned, pretty-printed output (compare with -F option) (default: only this). See also -C.

       -b --bgprobfile filename
          Auxiliary file (in fasta format) from which to read background sequences (overridden by -B). Typically this is a file containing large quantities of similar non-coding sequence, from which
          background probabilities of single- and di-nucleotides may be estimated.

       -B --bgseqfile filename
          File containing background probabilities. The format is described further below.

       -C --caps_only
          Use only upper-case letters in output sequence, for compatibility with output of some other programs like ClustalW and MLagan. By default, output is mixed-case (as in Dialign), and lower-case
          bases are treated as not aligned.

       -F --fasta_output
          Multi-fasta output (can use both -A and -F in either order). See also -C.

       -n --ncorrel number
          Background correlation (default 2=dinucleotide; 1=single-site basecounts, 0=0.25 per base).

       -x, --significance number
          Set limit for how probable the match is by chance (default 0.002, smaller=more stringent).

       -h, --help
          Displays this list of options.

MORE HELP
       The "significance" parameter (-x) determines whether local alignments are accepted or rejected. The default at present is 0.002. Experiments on synthetic data (described in the paper) suggest that
       0.002 is about the threshold where sigma fails to align phylogenetically-unrelated data that has moderate (yeast-like) dinucleotide correlation.

       Using a “background model” appropriate to the sequences being aligned greatly reduces spurious alignments on synthetic data (and, one hopes, on real data too). The simplest way to ensure this is
       to supply, via the -b parameter, a FASTA-format file containing large quantities of similar sequence data (eg, if one is aligning yeast sequences, supply a file containing all intergenic yeast
       sequence).

       Instead of this, if the single-site and dinucleotide frequencies are known already, they may be supplied in a file via the -B option. The file format should be: one entry per line, with the
       mononucleotide or dinucleotide (case-insensitive) followed by the frequency. (eg, "A 0.3", "AT 0.16", etc on successive lines.) A sample file is in the "Background" subdirectory of the source
       distribution (on Debian systems, this file can be found in the /usr/share/doc/sigma-align/Background directory). A file like "yeast.nc.3.freq" in the "tests" subdirectory of the MEME source
       distribution works fine (trinucleotide counts are ignored).
