NAME
       syslogout - modular centralized shell logout mechanism

DESCRIPTION
       syslogout  is  a  generic approach to enable centralized shell logout actions for all users of a given system in a modular and centralized way mostly aimed at avoiding work for lazy sysadmins.  It
       has only been tested to work with the bash shell.

       It basically consists of the small /etc/syslogout shell script which invokes other small shell scripts having a .bash suffix which are contained in the /etc/syslogout.d/ directory.  The system ad‐
       ministrator can drop in any script he wants without any naming convention other than that the scripts need to have a .bash suffix to enable automagic sourcing by the /etc/syslogout script.

       For shell sessions, the contents of /etc/syslogout.d/" will be sourced by every user at logout if the following lines are present in his $HOME/.bash_logout:

           if [ -f /etc/syslogout ]; then
               . /etc/syslogout
           fi

       If used for X sessions it is advisable to include the former statement into the Xreset script of the X display manager instead to prevent that closing of an terminal emulator window  yields  unex‐
       pected  results  in  your  running  X  session  if  your  X11 terminal emulator is using a login shell.  Be sure then to run it under the user-id of the X session's user.  See the example files in
       /usr/share/doc/syslogout/ for illustration.

       Users not wanting /etc/syslogout to be sourced for their environment can easily disable it's automatic mechanism.  It can be disabled by simply creating an empty file called $HOME/.nosyslogout  in
       the user's home directory using e.g. the touch(1) command.

       Any single configuration file in /etc/syslogout.d/ can simply be overridden by any user by creating a private $HOME/.syslogout.d/ directory which may contain a user's own version of any configura‐
       tion  file  to be sourced instead of the system default.  It's names have just to match exactly the system's default /etc/syslogout.d/ configuration files.  Empty versions of these files contained
       in the $HOME/.syslogout.d/ directory automatically disable sourcing of the system wide version.

       Naturally, users can add and include their own private scripts to be automagically executed by /etc/syslogout at logout time.

OPTIONS
       There are no options other than those dictated by shell conventions.  Anything is defined within the configuration scripts themselves.

SEE ALSO
       The README files and configuration examples contained in /usr/share/doc/syslogout/ and the manual page for bash(1), xdm(1x), xdm.options(5), and wdm(1x).  Recommended further reading is everything
       related with shell programming.

       If you need a similar mechanism for executing code at login time check out the related package sysprofile(8) which is a very close companion to syslogout.

BUGS
       syslogout in its current form is mainly restricted to bash(1) syntax.  In fact it is actually  a rather embarrassing quick and dirty hack than anything else - but it works.  It  serves the practi‐
       cal need to enable a centralized bash configuration  until something better becomes available.  Your constructive criticism in making  this  into something better" is very welcome.  Before i  for‐
       get to mention it: we take patches... ;-)
