NAME
       grafx2 - Ultimate 256-color bitmap paint program

SYNOPSIS
       grafx2 [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the grafx2 command.

       grafx2  is  a bitmap paint program that allows you to draw in more than 60 video resolutions, including most of the standard Amiga resolutions : 320x200, 320x256, 320x512, 640x256, 640x512, etc...
       provided your videocard knows how to handle them.

       This program is dedicated to everybody who knows what a single pixel is. Its layout is not very different from the famous Deluxe Paint or Brilliance, so it will be quite easy to handle it  if  you
       know  at  least  one  of these programs.  If you aren't used to the art of drawing with up to 256 colors, it will be a little more difficult for you, but you should give it a try (or more, because
       most of the power of this program won't show up on the first try).

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.  They can be prefixed by either / - or --

       -?, -h, -help

       -wide  To emulate a video mode with wide pixels (2 x 1).

       -tall  To emulate a video mode with tall pixels (1 x 2).

       -double
              To emulate a video mode with double pixels (2 x 2).

       -wide2 To emulate a video mode with double wide pixels (4 x 2).

       -tall2 To emulate a video mode with double tall pixels (2 x 4).

       -triple
              To emulate a video mode with triple pixels (3 x 3).

       -quadruple
              To emulate a video mode with quadruple pixels (4 x 4).

       -rgb <n>
              To reduce RGB precision from 256 to n levels.

       -skin <filename>
              Use an alternate file for the menu graphics.

       -mode <videomode>
              To set a video mode listed with the -help parameter.

FILES
       User settings are stored in ~/.grafx2/gfx2.ini. This file is really meant to be edited by the user and allows you to tweak many aspects of the program.

ENVIRONMENT
       Since grafx2 uses the SDL library for graphics and user input you can use control some of that parts using the SDL environment variables described at http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/Environ‐
       ment_variables
