NAME
       greylistd-setup-exim4 - add/remove support for greylistd in Exim 4

SYNOPSIS
       greylistd-setup-exim4 {add|remove|test} [file acl_name] [-option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This utility configures, deconfigures, or tests for greylistd support in the given Exim 4 configuration file and Access Control List (ACL).

       If no file or ACL name is supplied, changes are made to the default configuration files and ACLs for your distribution.

USAGE
       The following commands are available:

       add    Adds greylistd statement(s).

       remove Removes existing greylistd statement(s).

       test   Tests for the presence of greylistd statement(s), without making any changes.  A zero exit status indicates that the statement(s) exist(s).

       The following options are available:

       -quiet Normally, the result of the operation is printed on standard error; this option inhibits output.

       -no-fail
              Always exit with a zero status, even on failure. If this option is given, only the result of successful operations are printed.

       -no-reload
              Normally,  if any changes were made to the Exim 4 configuration files, greylistd-setup-exim4 invokes the Exim 4 init script, telling Exim to reload its configuration files.  This option in‐
              hibits this behavior.

       -netmask=size
              In the statement that is inserted in the Exim 4 configuration file, the remote host address is one of the items that is passed on to greylistd.  This option causes the host  address  to  be
              filtered through a netmask of the given size first.  Useful values are between 16 and 31 for IPv4.

       -acltype={rcpt|data}
              Used  in  conjunction  with  the add command to insert a statement suitable for use in an ACL used to validate the SMTP RCPT TO: command or the message DATA, respectively.  This is implicit
              when the supplied ACL name contains either of the substrings "rcpt" or "data" (such as Debian's default "acl_check_rcpt" and "acl_check_data"  ACLs).   Otherwise,  this  option  has  to  be
              present for the add command.

EXAMPLES
       greylistd-setup-exim4 add -netmask=24
              Adds greylistd statements to any acl_check_rcpt and acl_check_data ACLs found in any of the following files:

                - /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template
                - /etc/exim4/conf.d/acl/30_exim4-config_check_rcpt
                - /etc/exim4/conf.d/acl/40_exim4-config_check_data

              In  these  statements,  the data passed to greylistd includes the host address filtered through a 24-bit netmask, rather than the host's unique IP address.  This allows for pools of several
              Mail Sending Agents (MSAs) within a given network to be treated as a single host.

              If successful, Exim 4 is told to reload its configuration files.  If a statement already exists, nothing happens - but the program exits unsuccessfully (non-zero return code).

       greylistd-setup-exim4 remove -quiet
              Remove greylisting support from the above configuration files and ACLs.  If greylistd statements exist in these files and ACLs, they are removed, and Exim 4 will  reload  its  configuration
              files.  The exit code indicates whether the statements were present and are now successfully removed; but no results are printed.

       greylistd-setup-exim4 add /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template acl_check_rcpt -no-reload
              If  no greylistd statements already exists in the acl_check_rcpt ACL in the file /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template, one is inserted.  In this case, the Exim 4 daemon is then NOT told to reload
              its configuration files.

BUGS
       The statement that is inserted by this utility presumes that the Exim 4 configuration comes from Debian's "exim4-config" package.  Specifically, it makes use of the  +relay_from_hosts  host  list,
       the +local_domains and +relay_to_domains domain lists, and the acl_local_deny_exceptions ACL.  A more generalized approach is on my, ahem, to-do list.
