NAME
       RTIMULibDrive11 - Command line demo for the Sense HAT IMU

SYNOPSIS
       RTIMULibDrive11

DESCRIPTION
       RTIMULibDrive11  is  a  command  line demonstration of querying the IMU (and some of the environmental sensors) on the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT. It has no command line options, and once started
       just continually prints the current orientation ("pose") determined by the IMU, along with the atmospheric pressure and humidity.

       The IMU should have valid calibration data (read from “RTIMULib.ini” if available), as generated by RTIMULibCal otherwise the "pose" is likely to be extremely unreliable.
