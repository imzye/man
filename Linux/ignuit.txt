NAME
       ignuit - a flashcard-based memorization aid

SYNOPSIS
       ignuit [FILENAME]

DESCRIPTION
       Ignuit is a memorization aid based on the Leitner flashcard system.  The program can be used for both long-term and short-term learning.  A complete user guide is available via the GNOME Help system.

OPTIONS
       If the name of a flashcard file is given when ignuit is invoked, the program will open that file.

       Besides the standard GTK and GNOME options such as --help and --version, ignuit has no commandline options of its own.

       If you find a bug in the most recent version of ignuit, please email the author.
