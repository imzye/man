NAME
     sndfile-resample — sample rate converter

SYNOPSIS
     sndfile-resample [-c number] -to rate input output
     sndfile-resample [-c number] -by ratio input output

DESCRIPTION
     sndfile-resample is a sample rate converter using libsndfile for file I/O and Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) for performing the conversion.  It works on any file format supported by libsndfile
     with any number of channels (limited only by host memory).

     The options are as follows:

     -c number  Choose the converter type from the following list:
                0  Best Sinc Interpolator
                1  Medium Sinc Interpolator (default)
                2  Fastest Sinc Interpolator
                3  ZOH Interpolator
                4  Linear Interpolator

     -to rate   Convert to the specified sample rate.

     -by ratio  Change the sample rate by the given ratio, which can be any positive real; the resulting rate is floored to an integer.  For instance, changing the rate of 44100 by a factor of 1.3333 results
                in a sample rate of 58798.

     --no-normalize
                Disable clipping check and normalization.
