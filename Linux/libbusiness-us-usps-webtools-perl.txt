                               qw(FirmName Address1 Address2 City State Zip5 Zip4);
                       }

DESCRIPTION
       *** THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE ***

       This module implements the Zip Code Lookup web service from the US Postal Service. It is a subclass of Business::US::USPS::WebTools.

       lookup_zipcode( KEY, VALUE, ... )
           The "lookup_zipcode" method takes the following keys, which come directly from the USPS web service interface:

                   Address2        The street address
                   City            The name of the city
                   State           The two letter state abbreviation
                   Zip5            The 5 digit zip code
                   Zip4            The 4 digit extension to the zip code

           It returns an anonymous hash with the same keys, but the values are the USPS's canonicalized address. If there is an error, the hash values will be the empty string, and the error flag is set.
           Check is with "is_error":

                   $verifier->is_error;

           See the "is_error" documentation in Business::US::USPS::WebTools for more details on error information.
