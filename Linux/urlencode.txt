URLENCODE(1)                    GridSite Manual                   URLENCODE(1)

NAME
       urlencode - convert strings to or from URL-encoded form

SYNOPSIS
       urlencode [-m|-d] string [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
       urlencode encodes strings according to RFC 1738.

       That  is,  characters  A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ and - are passed through unmodi‐
       fied, but all other characters are represented  as  %HH,  where  HH  is
       their two-digit upper-case hexadecimal ASCII representation.  For exam‐
       ple,       the       URL        http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/        becomes
       http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gridpp.ac.uk%2F

       urlencode  converts each character in all the strings given on the com‐
       mand line. If multiple strings are given, they  are  concatenated  with
       separating spaces before conversion.

OPTIONS
       -m     Instead  of  full conversion, do GridSite "mild URL encoding" in
              which A-Z a-z 0-9 . = - _ @ and / are passed through unmodified.
              This  results  in  slightly  more human-readable strings but the
              application must be prepared to create or simulate the  directo‐
              ries implied by any slashes.

       -d     Do URL-decoding rather than encoding, according to RFC 1738. %HH
              and %hh strings are converted and other  characters  are  passed
              through  unmodified,  with  the exception that + is converted to
              space.

EXIT CODES
       0 is always returned.
