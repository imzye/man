NAME
       kdumpctl - control interface for kdump

SYNOPSIS
       kdumpctl COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       kdumpctl is used to check or control the kdump service.  In most cases, you should use systemctl to start / stop / enable kdump service instead. However, kdumpctl provides more details for debug and a
       helper to setup ssh key authentication.

COMMANDS
       start  Start the service.

       stop   Stop the service.

       status Prints the current status of kdump service.  It returns non-zero value if kdump is not operational.

       restart
              Is equal to start; stop

       reload reload crash kernel image and initramfs without triggering a rebuild.

       rebuild
              rebuild the crash kernel initramfs.

       propagate
              Helps to setup key authentication for ssh storage since it's impossible to use password authentication during kdump.

       showmem
              Prints the size of reserved memory for crash kernel in megabytes.

       estimate
              Estimate a suitable crashkernel value for current machine. This is a best-effort estimate. It will print a recommanded crashkernel value based on current kdump setup, and list some  details  of
              memory usage.
