PUBLIC-INBOX-PURGE(1)                                                                       public-inbox user manual                                                                      PUBLIC-INBOX-PURGE(1)

NAME
       public-inbox-purge - erase messages from a public inbox and its history

SYNOPSIS
               # requires ~/.public-inbox/config
               public-inbox-purge --all </path/to/message-to-purge

               # for testing with unconfigured inboxes:
               public-inbox-purge $INBOX_DIR </path/to/message-to-purge

DESCRIPTION
       public-inbox-purge allows removing entire messages in a given inbox from history.  It is only intended as a last resort, as it will cause discontiguous git history and draw more attention to the
       sensitive data in mirrors.

       For removing spam, public-inbox-learn(1) is preferable as it preserves contiguous git history.

       For editing sensitive information out of messages, consider public-inbox-edit(1), instead, but keep in mind it still leads to discontiguous git history.

OPTIONS
       --all
           Purge the message in all inboxes configured in ~/.public-inbox/config.  This is an alternative to specifying individual inboxes directories on the command-line.

ENVIRONMENT
       PI_CONFIG
               The default config file, normally "~/.public-inbox/config".  See public-inbox-config(5)

LIMITATIONS
       Only public-inbox-v2-format(5) inboxes are supported.

       This is safe to run while normal inbox writing tools (public-inbox-mda(1), public-inbox-watch(1), public-inbox-learn(1)) are active.

       Running this in parallel with public-inbox-xcpdb(1) or "public-inbox-index --reindex" can lead to errors or purged data remaining indexed.

       Incremental public-inbox-index(1) (without "--reindex") is fine.

       Keep in mind this is a last resort, as it will be disruptive to anyone using git(1) to mirror the inbox being purged.
