MPI_Bsend_init(3)                                                                                 LAM/MPI                                                                                 MPI_Bsend_init(3)

NAME
       MPI_Bsend_init -  Builds a handle for a buffered send

SYNOPSIS
       #include <mpi.h>
       int MPI_Bsend_init(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype dtype,
                         int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm,
                         MPI_Request *req)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       buf    - initial address of send buffer (choice)
       count  - number of elements sent (integer)
       dtype  - type of each element (handle)
       dest   - rank of destination (integer)
       tag    - message tag (integer)
       comm   - communicator (handle)

OUTPUT PARAMETER
       req    - communication request (handle)

NOTES
       It  is  generally a bad idea to use the MPI_Bsend_init function, as it guarantees that the entire message will suffer the overhead of an additional memory copy.  For large messages, or when shared
       memory message transports are being used, this overhead can be quite expensive.

       The communication initialized by this function will not be started until req is given to MPI_Start or MPI_Startall .

       The communication is then not guaranteed to progress or complete until req has been given to one of the test or wait functions ( MPI_Test , MPI_Testall , MPI_Testany , MPI_Testsome  ,  MPI_Wait  ,
       MPI_Waitall , MPI_Waitany , MPI_Waitsome ).

       Once any of the test or wait functions indicate that the communication has finished, the communication cycle can be started again with MPI_Start or MPI_Startall .

       However, once the communication has finished and it is no longer going to be used, req should be freed with MPI_Request_free .

NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.  ierr is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value
       of the routine in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in Fortran.

ERRORS
       If  an error occurs in an MPI function, the current MPI error handler is called to handle it.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler may be changed with MPI_Errhan‐
       dler_set ; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be returned (in C and Fortran; this error handler is less useful in with the C++ MPI  bindings.   The
       predefined  error  handler  MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS should be used in C++ if the error value needs to be recovered).  Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an
       error.

       All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick ) return an error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.  The C++ bindings for MPI do not return
       error values; instead, error values are communicated by throwing exceptions of type MPI::Exception (but not by default).  Exceptions are only thrown if the error value is not MPI::SUCCESS .

       Note that if the MPI::ERRORS_RETURN handler is set in C++, while MPI functions will return upon an error, there will be no way to recover what the actual error value was.
       MPI_SUCCESS
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       MPI_ERR_COMM
              - Invalid communicator.  A common error is to use a null communicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank ).
       MPI_ERR_COUNT
              - Invalid count argument.  Count arguments must be non-negative; a count of zero is often valid.
       MPI_ERR_TYPE
              - Invalid datatype argument.  May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype (see MPI_Type_commit ).
       MPI_ERR_RANK
              - Invalid source or destination rank.  Ranks must be between zero and the size of the communicator minus one; ranks in a receive ( MPI_Recv , MPI_Irecv , MPI_Sendrecv , etc.)  may  also  be
              MPI_ANY_SOURCE .

       MPI_ERR_TAG
              -  Invalid  tag  argument.  Tags must be non-negative; tags in a receive ( MPI_Recv , MPI_Irecv , MPI_Sendrecv , etc.)  may also be MPI_ANY_TAG .  The largest tag value is available through
              the the attribute MPI_TAG_UB .

       The LAM Team would like the thank the MPICH Team for the handy program to generate man pages ("doctext" from ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/sowing/sowing.tar.gz ), the initial formatting, and some ini‐
       tial text for most of the MPI-1 man pages.
