DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the aafire, aainfo, aasavefont, and aatest programs.

       All of these programs exist to demonstrate the capabilities of the aalib library, an ASCII art library.

       aafire displays burning ASCII art flames.

       aainfo displays information about what drivers aalib will use for the display, keyboard, and mouse, and what parameters, such as screen size those drivers will use.

       aasavefont saves a font to a file.

       aatest tests the capabilities of aalib.
