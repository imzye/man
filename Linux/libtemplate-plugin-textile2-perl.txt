         [% FILTER textile2 %]This *bold* and this is _italic_.[% END %]

         <p>this is <strong>bold</strong> and this is <em>italic</em>.

         [% USE Textile2 ( disable_html => 1 ) -%]

DESCRIPTION
       This module wraps Text::Textile into a plugin Template Toolkit.  It provides a filter named "textile2".  This aims to be a more feature-full version Template::Plugin::Textile, by allowing you to
       pass parameters to Text::Textile.

       Use this way:

           [% FILTER textile2 %]
           Reasons to use the Template Toolkit:

           * Seperation of concerns.
           * It's written in Perl.
           * Badgers are Still Cool.
           [% END %]

       or:

           [% mytext | textile2 %]

       You can pass the same options you would pass to Text::Textile, directly when using the template. For instance to disable processing of HTML tags you can do:

           [% USE Textile2 ( disable_html => 1 ) %]

       To avoid your text to be wrapped into "&lt;p&gt...&lt;/p&gt" you can use:

           [% USE Textile2 ( format_mode => 'inline' ) %]

       See Text::Textile for details.
