DESCRIPTION
       This script will unflatten a genbank or genbank-style file of SeqFeatures into a nested hierarchy.

       See Bio::SeqFeature::Tools::Unflattener

       In a GenBank/EMBL representation, features are 'flat' - for example, there is no link between an mRNA and a CDS, other than implicit links (eg via tags or via splice site coordinates) which may be
       hard to code for.

       This is most easily illustrated with the default output format, asciitree

       An unflattened genbank feature set may look like this (AB077698)

       The unflattening will also 'normalize' the containment hierarchy (in the sense of standardising it - e.g. making sure there is always a transcript record, even if genbank just specifies CDS and gene)

       By default, the GenBank types will be mapped to SO types

       See Bio::SeqFeature::Tools::TypeMapper

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       -i|input FILE
           input file (can also be specified as last argument)

       -from FORMAT
           input format (defaults to genbank)

           probably doesn't make so much sense to use this for non-flat formats; ie other than embl/genbank

       -to FORMAT
           output format (defaults to asciitree)

           should really be a format that is nested SeqFeature aware; I think this is only asciitree, chadoxml and gff3

       -gff
           with export to GFF3 format (pre-3 GFFs make no sense with unflattened sequences, as they have no set way of representing feature graphs)

       -o|output FILE
           outfile defaults to STDOUT

       -detail
           show extra detail on features (asciitree mode only)

       -e|ethresh INT
           sets the error threshold on unflattening

           by default this script will throw a wobbly if it encounters weird stuff in the genbank file - raise the error threshold to signal these to be ignored (and reported on STDERR)

       -nomagic
           suppress use_magic in unflattening (see Bio::SeqFeature::Tools::Unflattener

       -notypemap
           suppress type mapping (see Bio::SeqFeature::Tools::TypeMapper

TODO
       Bio::SeqFeature::Tools::Unflattener allows fine-grained control over the unflattening process - need to add more options to allow this control at the command line
