NAME
       armagetronad-dedicated - an Armagetron Advanced dedicated game server

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/init.d/armagetronad-dedicated start|stop|restart|force-reload|status

       armagetronad-dedicated [-h, --help] [-v, --version] [--doc] [--fastforward] [--benchmark] [--record] [--playback]

DESCRIPTION
       The Armagetron Advanced dedicated server runs from an initscript -- to enable running it on boot, edit /etc/default/armagetronad-dedicated.

       The  server  program  will  read  default  settings from /etc/armagetronad/settings_dedicated.cfg. Modifications and custom server settings should be implemented in the file /etc/armagetronad/set‐
       tings_custom.cfg.

       To edit configuration on-the-fly or make time-sensitive temporary changes, it's best to log onto the server from the armagetronad client and log on as an administrator (using the password  set  in
       the server configuration). Console input is not available when running the server as a daemon.

       Before each round is started, the file /etc/armagetronad/everytime.cfg is read; it may be useful to use this for things like randomly changing maps or other quickly changing settings.
