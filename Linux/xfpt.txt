NAME
       xfpt - make XML from plain text

SYNOPSIS
       xfpt [options] [source file]

DESCRIPTION

       xfpt  converts  a marked up text file to XML. The markup is simple and consists of lines that begin with a dot ("directive lines") and sequences in the text that begin with an ampersand ("flags").
       The flag sequences are not built-in, but are defined by directives. As well as the in-built directives, macros can be used to implement higher level concepts. A standard set of  macros  and  flags
       that generate DocBook XML is provided. There is a full description in the xfpt specification, which is distributed as a PDF file, an HTML file, and as xfpt source.

OPTIONS

       -help or --help
                 This causes xfpt to output its "usage" information and then exit.

       -o file   This specifies the output file. The default is the standard output if no source file is given, and the source file name with a .xml extension otherwise.

       -S directory
                 This specifies an alternative "share" directory in which to find standard configuration files.

       -v or --version
                 Output the xfpt version and exit.
