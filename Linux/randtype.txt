NAME
       randtype - Output characters or lines at random intervals

SYNOPSIS
       randtype [ -l ] [ -d ,|.<string> [ -k ] ] [ -t <ms,mult> ] [ -w <string> [ -c ms,mult ] ] [ -r s1,s2[:...]  ] [ -n <string> ] [ -q <int> ] [ -m <int> ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       randtype reads input from either standard input or from a file and outputs each character or line at random intervals. If multiple files are specified, each is read in sequence.

OPTIONS
       randtype recognizes the following command line options:

       -c ms,mult
              For optional use with the -w option, this has the same microsecond and multiplier value format as the -t option. The default for this option is specified at compile time.

       -d string
              Output everything before (left) or after (right) the specified string immediately. The string must begin with either ',' or '.' which specifies the direction, left or right, respectively.

       -h     Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       -k     Suppress output of the string specified by the dump string option.

       -l     Output lines rather than characters. Only the -t and -q options are valid when using this option, all other options are ignored.

       -m int Generate random mistakes. The int value is how many times to compare and match the next character and a randomly generated character.

       -n chars
              Output the specified characters immediately with no random waiting.

       -r s1,s2[:...]
              Replace the string s1 with string s2. You can specify multiple replacements by separating them with a ':'.

       -q int Quit the program after this many seconds.

       -t ms,mult
              This  option  refines the random delay of output. The value of the argument is separated by a comma with the first argument being a microsecond and the second being a multiplier of a random
              number between 0 and the microsecond. A character-per-second effect can, for example, be made by setting the microsecond to 0 and the multiplier to 1000000. The default for this  option  is
              specified at compile time.

       -v     Display version information and exit.

       -w chars
              The inverse of the -n option; this option waits on the specified characters. Use the -c option to refine the random delay of output.

EXAMPLE
       randtype -t 13,16000 -d ",*MAGIC*" -k -n '0ou' filename
