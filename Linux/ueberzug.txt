NAME
       ueberzug - command line utility which draws images on terminals

SYNOPSIS
       ueberzug layer [OPTIONS]

       ueberzug library

       ueberzug version

DESCRIPTION
       ueberzug  is a command line utility which can draw images on terminals using child windows.  It possesses many advantages over w3mimgdisplay, including: the use of chars as the size unit for posi‐
       tion/size, tmux support, processing of expose events, and support for terminals that do not support WINDOWID.

       ueberzug takes the following arguments:

              layer [OPTIONS]
                  Display image

              library
                  Print the path to the bash library

              version
                  Print version information and exit

OPTIONS
       The layer argument supports the following options:

       -p, --parser [ json | simple | bash ]

              json: JSON object per line (default)

              simple: Key-values separated by a tab character

              bash: associative array dumped via `declare -p`

       -l, --loader [ thread | process | synchronous ]

              thread: load image in thread (default)

              process: load image in additional process

              synchronous: load image right away

       -s, --silent

              Print STDERR to /dev/null
