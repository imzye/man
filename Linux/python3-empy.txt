NAME
       empy -  A powerful and robust templating system for Python

SYNOPSIS
       empy [options] [<filename, or  '-' for stdin>  [<argument>]]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the empy command.

       EmPy  is  a system for embedding Python expressions and statements in template text; it takes an EmPy source file, processes it, and produces output. This is accomplished via expansions, which are
       special signals to the EmPy system and are set off by a special prefix (by default the at sign, @).

       EmPy can expand arbitrary Python expressions and statements in this way, as well as a variety of special forms. Textual data not explicitly delimited in this way is sent unaffected to the output,
       allowing Python to be used in effect as a markup language. Also supported are callbacks via hooks, recording and playback via diversions, and dynamic, chainable filters. The system is highly con‐
       figurable via command line options and embedded commands.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the Info files.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.
