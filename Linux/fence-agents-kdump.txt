NAME
       fence_kdump_send - send kdump acknowlegement message to cluster nodes

SYNOPSIS
       fence_kdump_send [OPTIONS]... [NODE]...

DESCRIPTION
       fence_kdump_send  is a utility used to send messages that acknowledge that the node has entered the kdump crash recovery service. This utility is intended to be used the the fence_kdump agent as a
       means detect that a failed node has entered the kdump crash recovery service.  The fence_kdump_send utility is typically run from within the kdump kernel after a cluster  node  has  encountered  a
       kernel panic. Once the cluster node has entered the kdump crash recovery service, fence_kdump_send will periodically send messages to all cluster nodes. When the fence_kdump agent receives a valid
       message from the failed node, fencing is complete.

OPTIONS
       -p, --ipport=PORT
              IP port number that the fence_kdump agent is using to listen for messages. (default: 7410)

       -f, --family=FAMILY
              IP network family. Force the fence_kdump_send utility to use a particular network family. Value for FAMILY can be "auto", "ipv4", or "ipv6". (default: auto)

       -c, --count=COUNT
              Number of messages to send. If COUNT is zero, fence_kdump_send will send messages indefinitely. (default: 0)

       -i, --interval=INTERVAL
              Time to wait between sending a message. The value for INTERVAL must be greater than zero. (default: 10)

       -v, --verbose
              Print verbose output.

       -V, --version
              Print version and exit.
