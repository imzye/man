NAME
       Raptor-upgrade - A fast and space-efficient pre-filter for querying very large collections of nucleotide sequences.

SYNOPSIS
       raptor upgrade --input <file> --output <file> [--fpr <number>|--bins <file>]

DESCRIPTION
       Upgrades a Raptor index created with Raptor 2.0 to be compatible with Raptor 3.0.

       The only new parameter need is the false positive rate. The false positive rate affects the search results. This can be done in three different ways:

       1) Pass the false positive rate via --fpr.

       2) The false positive rate can be automatically determined if the paths of the files used to build the index are still available.

       3) Pass a file containing the path to the original files, one line per file. The false positive rate can then be automatically determined. The order of the files does not matter. The file with the
       most k-mers will determine the false positive rate.

OPTIONS
       --fpr (double)
              The false positive rate. Mutually exclusive with --bins. Default: None. Value must be in range [0.000000,1.000000].

       --bins (std::filesystem::path)
              File containing one file per line per bin. Mutually exclusive with --fpr. Default: None. The input file must exist and read permissions must be granted.

       --input (std::filesystem::path)
              The index to upgrade. Parts: Without suffix _0

       --output (std::filesystem::path)
              Path to new index.

   Common options
       -h, --help
              Prints the help page.

       -hh, --advanced-help
              Prints the help page including advanced options.

       --version
              Prints the version information.

       --copyright
              Prints the copyright/license information.

       --export-help (std::string)
              Export the help page information. Value must be one of [html, man, ctd, cwl].

EXAMPLES
       raptor upgrade --input old.index --output new.index

       raptor upgrade --input old.index --output new.index --fpr 0.05

       raptor upgrade --input old.index --output new.index --bins bins.list
