NAME
       lcmaps_voms_localgroup.mod - LCMAPS plugin to switch user identity based on VOMS credentials by local groups

SYNOPSIS
       lcmaps_voms_localgroup.mod [-groupmapfile group-mapfile] [--map-to-secondary-groups] [-mapall] [-mapmin number of minimal mappings]

DESCRIPTION
       The  VOMS  localgroup  acquisition  plugin is a 'VOMS-aware' plugin similar to the lcmaps_voms_localaccount.mod.8 plugin, but for groups instead of accounts.  The plugin tries to find local groups
       (more specifically GroupIDs) based on the VOMS information that is available from LCMAPS, in particular the Fully Qualified Attribute Names (FQANs).  It tries to find FQAN  to  localgroup  mapping
       using  the  so-called  group-mapfile  (similar to a grid-mapfile).  The resulting list of groups will be looked up in the /etc/groups and/or LDAP directories to determine which Group IDs should be
       added as a mapping result.

OPTIONS
       -groupmapfile group-mapfile
              This file must contain FQAN to local group name mappings, similar to the grid-mapfile. The same formatting rules of the grid-mapfile apply to the group-mapfile.  It is strongly  advised  to
              set it to an absolute path to avoid usage of the wrong file(path).  In a (setuid-)root application, relative paths are taken with respect to /etc/grid-security/.  It is important to not mix
              the grid-mapfile and group-mapfile.

       --map-to-secondary-groups
              When  enabled,  the  plug-in will map also the first FQAN of the user to secondary Group IDs, hence there will be no primary Group ID set by this plug-in when enabled. Note that also if the
              first FQAN does not give a mapping, there will be no primary Group ID set by this plug-in.

       -mapall
              When enabled, a failure will be triggered if not all of the FQANs were successfully mapped to primary or secondary Group IDs.

       -mapmin minimum number of mappings
              This option will set a minimum amount of FQANs that have to be mapped for the plugin to succeed. Default is '0'.  Note: if the minimum is unset or set to 0 the plugin will  succeed  (if  no
              other errors occur) even if no pool-groups were found.

RETURN VALUES
       LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS
              Success.

       LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL
              Failure.
