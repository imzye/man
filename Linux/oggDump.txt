NAME
       oggDump - prints out information of ogg video files (.ogv, .ogg or oga)

SYNOPSIS
       oggDump [options] file.ogv

DESCRIPTION
       OggDump gives detailed information about an ogg video file and prints these information with a given detail level.

       Ogg  files  consist  of  a  number of streams (video and audio). From the Ogg-container perspective, the streams are divided into pages. These pages usually have nearly the same size. The pages can be
       printed out with the -g option.

       From the stream perspective, every stream consists of packets. These packets carry a bunch of compressed audio samples in case of a vorbis stream or one video frame in case of a theora  video  stream.
       These packets could be of variable length and are places into the ogg pages. To toString the packets, use the -p option.

OPTIONS
       -g     Dumps the stream pages of the file.

       -p     Dumps the stream packets.

       -l     <level>.  Set the dump level (1-5). Default is 5, which means all information are printed.

       -s     Prompt for the stream that should be dumped. All other streams are ignored and will not be printed.

       -o     <file> Write the dump information to a file.
