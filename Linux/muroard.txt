NAME
       muroard - minimalist sound server for the RoarAudio protocol

SYNOPSIS
       muroard [OPTIONS]...

DESCRIPTION
       muRoarD is a sound server supporting the RoarAudio protocol.  It is designed to mix the audio data of multiple applications together to send it as a single stream to the soundcard.

       muRoarD is a minimalist version of such a sound server.  It does only implement the very minimum part the the protocol but is very much smaller than the original roard.

MISC OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Print a short help and exit.

       --version
              Print version information of the daemon and exit.

       --daemon
              Bring the server into background after init.

              On win32 this hides the console window. This only works if used within a Shortcut.

       --autostandby
              Start in autostandby mode.

       --no-autostandby
              Do not start in autostandby mode.

       --standby
              Start in standby mode.

       --no-standby
              Do not start in standby mode.

AUDIO OPTIONS
       -R  --rate   RATE
              Set server sample rate.

       -C  --chans  CHANNELS
              Set server number of channels channels.

DRIVER OPTIONS
       -O  --odevice DEV
              Set output device (sound card).  The possible values of this depend on the used driver.

SOURCES OPTIONS
       -S DEV Set the file or device for the new source.

       -sC CHANS
              Sets the number of channels for the source. This is the same as '-sO channels=XXX' for roard.

       -sB BITS
              Sets the number of bits for the source. This is the same as '-sO bits=XXX' for roard.

       -sE CODEC
              Sets codec for the source. This is the same as '-sO codec=XXX' for roard.

       -sD DIR
              Sets direction of the source: in (source) or out (dump).

NETWORK OPTIONS
       --no-listen
              Disable listen socket.  This may be used for example to implement the server type '+fork' but is absolutely useless for normal users.

       --client-fh FH
              Add a client via FH.  See --no-listen.

       --bind ADDR
              Set path/hostname of listen socket.  This may be a /path/to/sock for UNIX Sockets or a hostname or address for TCP/IP.

              Please do not use IP Addresses directly if not needed.  Use hostnames.

              On win32 there is no support for UNIX sockets. Only IP is supported.

       --port PORT
              Set port of listen socket.  This only applys for TCP/IP sockets and is ignored for UNIX Sockets.

       -u  --unix
              Use UNIX Domain listen socket.

              This is not supported on win32.

       -t  --tcp
              Use TCP/IP listen socket.

       -n  --decnet
              Use DECnet listen socket.
