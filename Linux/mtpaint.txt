NAME
       mtpaint - A pixel based painting program

SYNOPSIS
       mtpaint [option] [imagefile ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       mtPaint is a GTK+1/2/3 based painting program designed for creating icons and pixel based artwork. It can edit indexed palette or 24 bit RGB images and offers painting and palette manipulation
       tools. Its main file format is PNG, although it can also handle JPEG, GIF, TIFF, JPEG2000, WEBP, BMP, PCX, TGA, LBM, PBM, PGM, PPM, PAM, LSS16, XPM, and XBM files. Due to its simplicity and lack
       of dependencies it runs well on GNU/Linux, Windows and older PC hardware.  There is full documentation of mtPaint's features contained in a handbook.  If you don't already have this, you can
       download it from the mtPaint website.
