NOTES ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE CODE
       Parts of the code are very loosely based on the outer framework of fdpowermon by Wouter Verhelst under Poul-Henning Kamp's "Beer-ware" license, and the mdstat check from Debian's hobbit-plugins
       package written by Christoph Berg under the MIT license. (Both stated that the amount of code I copied is too small to make their copyright apply, hence I'm not bound to the licenses they used for
       their code.)
