NAME
       sredird - RFC 2217 serial port server

SYNOPSIS
       sredird [-i] log-level serial-device lock-file [poll-interval]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the sredird, program.

       This program when run through inetd will use the RFC 2217 extensions to TELNET to implement serial commands over the TCP connection and interface to a specified serial port.

OPTIONS
       An optional first parameter is '-i' to enable compatability with Cisco IOS.

       The  first  mandatory  parameter is the log level for use in syslog.  The next mandatory parameter is the device node for the serial device, it must be a fully qualified path.  The final mandatory
       parameter is the file name for the lock file to be used to prevent multiple instances of sredird from talking to the serial port at the same time, or to allow sharing  a  port  between  modem  and
       sredird.

EXAMPLE
       Here is a configuration line for running it from inetd: sredir          stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/sredird 5 /dev/modem /var/lock/LCK..modem
