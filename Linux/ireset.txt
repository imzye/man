NAME
       ipmiutil_reset - perform a hardware reset on the system

SYNOPSIS
       ipmiutil reset [-bcdDefhijmnoprsuwxy -N node -U user -P/-R pswd -EFJTVY]

DESCRIPTION
       ipmiutil  reset  is  a  program  that uses IPMI commands to perform a hardware reset of the chassis, or boot to a specific device.  This utility can use either the /dev/ipmi0 driver from OpenIPMI, the
       /dev/imb driver from Intel, the /dev/ipmikcs driver from valinux, direct user-space IOs, or the IPMI LAN interface if -N.

OPTIONS
       Command line options are described below.

       -c     Power Cycle the system chassis

       -d     Power Down the system chassis

       -n     Send NMI to the system

       -u     Power Up the system chassis

       -r     Hard Reset the system chassis

       -D     Do a soft shutdown of the OS, and then power down.  Note that remote soft shutdown (-D -N) for Intel S5000 baseboard requires ipmiutil getevt -a running on the target server.

       -o     Do a soft shutdown of the OS, and then reset.  Note that remote soft shutdown (-o -N) for Intel S5000 baseboard requires ipmiutil getevt -a running on the target server.

       -k     Do a cold reset to restart the BMC firmware.

       -m 002000s
              Perform these function for a specific MC (e.g. bus 00, sa 20, lun 00).  The trailing character, if present, indicates SMI addressing if 's', or IPMB addressing if 'i' or not present.

       -b     Do a hard reset and reboot to the BIOS Setup menu, for this reboot only.

       -e     Do a hard reset to EFI, if IPMI EFI boot is enabled, for this reboot only.

       -f     Do a hard reset to Floppy/Removable, for this reboot only.

       -h     Do a hard reset to a Hard Disk, for this reboot only.

       -i     Set the boot Initiator mailbox string, usually for PXE use.  The string must be less than 78 characters.

       -j     Set the IANA number used for the boot Initiator mailbox string.

       -p     Do a hard reset and network boot to PXE server, for this reboot only.

       -s     Do a hard reset and reboot to the Service/Diagnostic Partition, for this reboot only.  Reboots to the default if no service partition is configured.

       -v     Do a hard reset to DVD/CDROM Media, for this reboot only.

       -w     Wait for BMC ready after a reset before exiting the utility.

       -x     Causes extra debug messages to be displayed.

       -y     Yes, try to persist any boot options used [-befhprsv].  This requires the IPMI firmware to ask the BIOS to change boot order settings, so it may not be supported by all BMC firmware vendors.

       -N nodename
              Nodename or IP address of the remote target system.  If a nodename is specified, IPMI LAN interface is used.  Otherwise the local system management interface is used.

       -P/-R rmt_pswd
              Remote password for the nodename given.  The default is a null password.

       -U rmt_user
              Remote username for the nodename given.  The default is a null username.

       -E     Use the remote password from Environment variable IPMI_PASSWORD.

       -F drv_t
              Force the driver type to one of the followng: imb, va, open, gnu, landesk, lan, lan2, lan2i, kcs, smb.  Note that lan2i means lan2 with intelplus.  The default is to detect any available driver
              type and use it.

       -J     Use  the  specified  LanPlus  cipher suite (0 thru 17): 0=none/none/none, 1=sha1/none/none, 2=sha1/sha1/none, 3=sha1/sha1/cbc128, 4=sha1/sha1/xrc4_128, 5=sha1/sha1/xrc4_40, 6=md5/none/none, ...
              14=md5/md5/xrc4_40.  Default is 3.

       -T     Use a specified IPMI LAN Authentication Type: 0=None, 1=MD2, 2=MD5, 4=Straight Password, 5=OEM.

       -V     Use a specified IPMI LAN privilege level. 1=Callback level, 2=User level, 3=Operator level, 4=Administrator level (default), 5=OEM level.

       -Y     Yes, do prompt the user for the IPMI LAN remote password.  Alternatives for the password are -E or -P.
