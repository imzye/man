NAME
       wmforkplop - Monitors forking activity and displays top CPU consuming processes.

SYNOPSIS
       wmforkplop [options]

DESCRIPTION
       wmforkplop  is  a  program  that monitors the forking activity of the kernel and displays a list of the most CPU-consuming processes. Although primarily aimed at Windowmaker, it will run on any window
       manager, either as a dockapp or as a standard X11 application.

   Option list:
       -h, --help
              print this.

       -v, --verbose
              increase verbosity

       -V, --version
              print version

       --fontpath path add a new directory to the font search directory list

              default: --fontpath=/usr/share/fonts/truetype (and subdirectories)

       --fontpath=/usr/share/fonts/ttf
              (and subdirectories)

       --fontpath=$HOME/.fonts
              (and subdirectories)

       --font fontname/size Set the 'small font' name/size in pixel (default: --smallfont=Vera/6 The font name are case-sensitive, and must correspound to the name of a .ttf file which can be found in one of
              the fontpaths By default, wmforkplop tries to load the following fonts:

              * Vera/6, DejaVuSansMono/6, Andale_Mono/6, Verdana/6, Trebuchet_MS/7

       -c n, --colormap=n

              select colormap number n (0 <= n <= 5)

       -g[=WxH+x+y], --geometry[=WxH+x+y]

              start in window (i.e. undocked) mode with specified geometry (i.e -g 96x32 or -g 64x64+0+0)

       --32,  --48,  --56

              start in a reduced dockapp, for people whose dock is too small too contain 64x64 dockapps

       --no-top

              disable the wmtop feature, you will only see the fork animation.

       --no-fork

              disable the fork animation, you will only see the list of top processes.

       --threshold=n

              minimum CPU consumption (%) of a process listed in the top-list (default 3%)

       -u n, --proc-update-delay=n

              set the delay between two reads of /proc, the default is 150 (milliseconds).  Setting a small value gives accurate results, but consumes more CPU as reading /proc is quite expensive.

       See /usr/share/doc/wmforkplop/README.gz for more details.
