NAME
       dskdump - Sector-level copy from one floppy or image file to another

SYNOPSIS
       dskdump [-itype TYPE] [-otype TYPE] [-iside SIDE] [-oside SIDE] [-icomp COMP] [-ocomp COMP] [-idstep] [-odstep] [-retry COUNT] [-format FMT] [-first CYLINDER] [-last CYLINDER] INPUT-IMAGE OUTPUT-IMAGE
DESCRIPTION
       Dskdump copies floppy discs or images, optionally converting image types.  Unlike dsktrans(1), dskdump can handle discs with different numbers or sizes of sector on different tracks.

OPTIONS
       -itype TYPE
              Determines which driver is to be used to read from the source disc.

              auto    Select according to the disc image file. This is the default.

              dsk     Use the DSK (CPCEmu format) image driver.

              edsk    Use the extended version of the DSK format.

              floppy  Use the floppy driver.

              myz80   Use the hard disk (MYZ80 format) image driver.  (This format cannot be autodetected.)

              cfi     Use the CFI (DOS fdcopy format) image driver.  (This format cannot be autodetected.)

              apridisk
                      Use the ApriDisk image driver (from the utility of the same name).  (This format cannot be autodetected.)

              raw     Use the raw driver.

       -otype TYPE
              Determines which driver is to be used to write to the destination disc. The drivers are as for -itype.

       -icomp COMP
              Select the compression method used on the source disc image file (has no effect when reading a floppy disc). Use 'none' to disable transparent decompression of gzipped disc images (for example,
              the Slackware installer rootdisks).

              auto    Detect from the first few bytes of the file. This is the default.

              sq      Huffman coded (SQ / USQ).

              gz      Gzipped (gzip / gunzip).

              bz2     Burrows-Wheeler compressed (bzip2 / bunzip2).

       -ocomp COMP
              Select the compression to be used on output. Compression methods are as for -icomp, except that bz2 cannot be used.

       -iside SIDE
              Determines which side (0 or 1) of the source disc is to be read from.

       -oside SIDE
              Determines which side (0 or 1) of the destination disc is to be written to.

       -idstep
              Double-step the source drive (used to read 360k discs in 1.2Mb drives). Only supported by the Linux floppy driver.

       -odstep
              Double-step the destination drive (used to write 360k discs in 1.2Mb drives).  Only supported by the Linux floppy driver.

       -retry COUNT
              Set the number of times to attempt a read/write/format in case of error.

       -format FMT
              Do not autodetect the disc format; use the named format.  dskdump does not make extensive use of the disc format; it is chiefly used to provide a guess at the number of tracks to dump.

       -first CYL
              Start copying at the specified cylinder. Cylinders prior to this will not be formatted or written.

       -last CYL
              Copy up to and including the specified cylinder.

       -odstep
              Double-step the destination drive (used to write 360k discs in 1.2Mb drives).  Only supported by the Linux floppy driver.
