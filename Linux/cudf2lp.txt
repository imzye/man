NAME
       cudf2lp - a preprocessor for CUDF documents

SYNOPSIS
       cudf2lp [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       cudf2lp  simplifies a given CUDF specification and converts it into a set of facts suitable to be processed with an ASP grounder and solver - e.g., gringo(1) and clasp(1).  It is intended to be called
       by aspcud(1), but may also be used independently.

       It reads from the given FILE or from standard input if ommited.

OPTIONS
       cudf2lp supports the following options:

       -h, --help
              print help text

       -v, --version
              print version and license information

       -V, --verbose[=N]
              set the verbosity level to N or the maximum if omitted

       -c CRITS, --criterion=CRITS
              preprocess for specific optimization criteria (defaults to none):
                CRITS: none | paranoid | trendy | CRIT\(','CRIT\)*
                CRIT : SIGN count(SET) |
                     | SIGN sum(SET,ATTR)
                     | SIGN unsat_recommends(SET)
                     | SIGN aligned(SET,ATTR,ATTR)
                     | SIGN notuptodate(SET)
                SIGN : '+' | '-'
                ATTR : CUDF attribute name
                SET  : solution | changed | new | removed | up | down
                     | installrequest | upgraderequest | request

              for backwards compatibility, the following aliases can be used:
                new              = count(new)
                removed          = count(removed)
                changed          = count(changed)
                notuptodate      = notuptodate(solution)
                unsat_recommends = unsat_recommends(solution)
                sum(name)        = sum(name,solution)

       --addall
              disable preprocessing and add all packages
