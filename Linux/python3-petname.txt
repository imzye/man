NAME
       python-petname - utility to generate "pet names", consisting of a random combination of adverbs, an adjective, and a proper name

SYNOPSIS
       python-petname [-w|--words INT] [-s|--separator STR] [-l|--letters INT]

OPTIONS
           -w|--words            number of words in the name, default is 2
           -l|--letters          maximum number of letters in each word, default is 6
           -s|--separator        string used to separate name words, default is '-'

DESCRIPTION
       This utility will generate "pet names", consisting of a random combination of an adverb, adjective, and proper name.  These are useful for unique hostnames, for instance.

       The default packaging contains about 2000 names, 1300 adjectives, and 4000 adverbs, yielding nearly 10 billion unique combinations, covering over 32 bits of unique namespace.

       As such, PetName tries to follow the tenets of Zooko's triangle.  Names are:

        - human meaningful
        - decentralized
        - secure

EXAMPLES
           $ python-petname
           wiggly-anna

           $ python-petname --words 1
           marco

           $ python-petname --words 3
           evenly-silly-john

           $ python-petname --words 4 --letters 10
           dolorously-leisurely-wee-Susan

           $ python-petname --separator ":" --letters 7
