NAME
       garli - phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequence data using maximum-likelihood (MPI version)

SYNOPSIS
       mpirun [MPI OPTIONS] garli-mpi -[# of times to execute config file] [config filename]

DESCRIPTION
       GARLI,  Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference is a program for inferring phylogenetic trees. Using an approach similar to a classical genetic algorithm, it rapidly searches the space of
       evolutionary trees and model parameters to find the solution maximizing the likelihood score. It implements nucleotide, amino acid and codon-based models of sequence evolution,  and  runs  on  all
       platforms. The latest version adds support for partitioned models and morphology-like datatypes.  This is the MPI version of Garli.

OPTIONS
       -i, --interactive
              interactive mode (allow and/or expect user feedback)

       -b, --batch
              batch mode (do not expect user input) (batch is the default for the version you are running)

       -v, --version
              print version information and exit

       -h, --help
              print this help and exit

       -t     run internal tests (requires dataset and config file)

       -V     validate: load config file and data, validate config file, data, starting trees and constraint files, print required memory and selected model, then exit

       NOTE: If no config filename is passed on the command line the program will look in the current directory for a file named "garli.conf"
