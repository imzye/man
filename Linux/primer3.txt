NAME
       ntdpal - Provides Primer3's alignment functionality

SYNOPSIS

       ntdpal [-g gval] [-l lval] [-m mval] [-f1, f2, f3] [-p] [-s] [-e] {seq1} {seq2} {mode}

DESCRIPTION
       Ntdpal (NucleoTide Dynamic Programming ALignment) is a stand-alone program that provides Primer3's alignment functionality (local, a.k.a. Smith-Waterman, global, a.k.a. Needleman-Wunsch, plus
       "half global").

OPTIONS
       -g gval
           gval is a (positive) float (.01 precision) specifying penalty for creating a gap respectively (the penalties are subtracted from the output score)

       -l val
           lval is a (positive) float (.01 precision) specifying penalty for lengthening a gap respectively (the penalties are subtracted from the output score)

       -a
           Causes the scoring matrix to be modified by dpal_set_ambiguity_codes.

       -e
           Causes the end position of the alignment in both sequences to be printed. Do not confuse with the 'e' mode.

       -f1, -f2, -f3
           Force specific implementations. -f2 forces use an implementation that might provide more informative error messages, possibly at the expense of some speed.

       -h
           Use a different scoring matrix: G and C matches = 3, A and T = 2, and mismatches = -0.5. (The default scoring matrix assigns 1 to a match, and -1 to a mismatch.)

       -p
           Causes the alignment to be displayed on stderr.

       -s
           causes only the score to printed.

       -m mval
           is the maximum allowed gap (default is 3).

       seq1 and seq2
           are the sequences to be aligned.

       mode
           is one of g, G, l, or L specifying a global, global end-anchored, local, or local end-anchored alignment respectively. For backward compatibility e is equivalent to G.
