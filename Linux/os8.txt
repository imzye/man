NAME
       os8 - boots os8 images via simh pdp8 emulator

SYNOPSIS
       os8

DESCRIPTION
       The  os8  script  prepares  a  bootable OS8 system in the directory it is run in, and then boots the OS8 system using the SIMH pdp8 emulator.  If the "system disks" or pdp config file are not
       present, it copies them from /usr/share/os8 into the current directory.  Then it starts the pdp8 emulator using the os8 config file.
