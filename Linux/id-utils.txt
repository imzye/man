NAME
       defid - [DESCRIPTION]

SYNOPSIS
       gid [OPTION]... PATTERN...

DESCRIPTION
       Query ID database and report results.  By default, output consists of multiple lines, each line containing the matched identifier followed by the list of file names in which it occurs.

       -f, --file=FILE
              file name of ID database

       -i, --ignore-case
              match PATTERN case insensitively

       -l, --literal
              match PATTERN as a literal string

       -r, --regexp
              match PATTERN as a regular expression

       -w, --word
              match PATTERN as a delimited word

       -s, --substring
              match PATTERN as a substring

              Note: If PATTERN contains extended regular expression metacharacters, it is interpreted as a regular expression substring.  Otherwise, PATTERN is interpreted as a literal word.

       -k, --key=STYLE
              STYLE is one of `token', `pattern' or `none'

       -R, --result=STYLE
              STYLE is one of `filenames', `grep', `edit' or `none'

       -S, --separator=STYLE
              STYLE is one of `braces', `space' or `newline' and only applies to file names when `--result=filenames'

              The above STYLE options control how query results are presented.  Defaults are --key=token --result=filenames --separator=space

       -F, --frequency=FREQ
              find tokens that occur FREQ times, where FREQ is a range expressed as `N..M'.  If N is omitted, it defaults to 1, if M is omitted it defaults to MAX_USHRT

       -a, --ambiguous=LEN
              find tokens whose names are ambiguous for LEN chars

       -x, --hex
              only find numbers expressed as hexadecimal

       -d, --decimal
              only find numbers expressed as decimal

       -o, --octal
              only find numbers expressed as octal

              By default, searches match numbers of any radix.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
