NAME
       x2gobroker-authservice - PAM authentication service for X2Go Session Broker

SYNOPSIS
       x2gobroker-authservice [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       x2gobroker-authservice is a PAM authentication service for X2Go Session Broker. Whereas the X2Go Session Broker runs as a non-privileged user (standalone daemon mode) or as the also non-privileged
       httpd server's system user (WSGI mode), an authentication against PAM requires root privileges in most cases (esp. for pam_unix.so).

       Thus,  the  PAM  authentication  has  been  moved into a separate service. The communication between X2Go Session Broker and PAM Authentication Service is handled through a unix domain socket file
       (<RUNDIR>/x2gobroker/x2gobroker-authservice.socket).

       This command is normally started through the host's init system.

COMMON OPTIONS
       x2gobroker-authservice accepts the following common options:

       -h, --help
              Display a help with all available command line options and exit.

       -D, --daemonize
              Fork this application to background and detach from the running terminal.

       -P, --pidfile
              Custom PID file location when daemonizing (default: <RUNDIR>/x2gobroker/x2gobroker-authservice.pid).

       -L, --logdir
              Directory where stdout/stderr will be redirected after having daemonized (default: /var/log/x2gobroker/).

       -s <AUTHSOCKET>, --socket <AUTHSOCKET>
              File name of the unix domain socket file used for communication between broker and authentication service.

       -o <OWNER>, --owner <OWNER>
              User ownership of the <AUTHSOCKET> file.

       -g <GROUP>, --group <GROUP>
