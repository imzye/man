NAME
       fcasplit - tool to split source code into separate per-routine files

SYNOPSIS
       fcasplit [ -f  nmft ] [ -c  nmcc ] [ -a  nmas ] [-noh] [-log]
                [ +fo incf ] [ +co incc ] [ +ao incs ]
                [ -fo optf ] [ -co optc ] [ -ao opts ] file.ext

       fcasplit file.ext [ fca_n ] [ optf [ optc [ opts
                                   [ nmft [ nmcc [ nmas ]]]]]]

DESCRIPTION
       fcasplit,  used  with  a command line of either form shown above, splits file file.ext having a mixture of FORTRAN / C / assembler routines into separate files n.f or n.c or n.s, "n" being the name of
       each routine, creating at the same time a shell script file.shfca and a Make file file.mkfca  either of which can be used to compile all routines individually.  All new files are generated in the cur‐
       rent directory, even if the original file.ext is in a different location.

       NOTE  that  the program does not work on source code written without having it in mind, since fcasplit looks for special identifying lines in comments of the source code in the original file, as noted
       below.  It is able to operate, for instance, on source code output by nypatchy.

       Defaults are defined in fcasplit for the names by which the compilers are called in the generated shell script and Makefile; with the -f, -c, -a options they could be changed.   In  Debian  GNU/Linux,
       these defaults are gcc for the C compiler, gfortran for the FORTRAN compiler, and as for the assembler.

       Defaults  are  also  defined  for  the  options  with  which  they are called; with the -fo, -co, -ao options they can be re-defined; with the +fo, +co, +ao options they can be incremented.  In Debian
       GNU/Linux, these defaults are "-c -g -O2" for the C compiler, "-c -g -O2 -fno-automatic" for the FORTRAN compiler, and "" (i.e., no flags) for the assembler.

       To be backward compatible these options can also be specified by the positional parameters after the file-name (as in the second form of the command shown above).

       If the  -noh  option is given (or if the first parameter after the file-name is "fca_n") the identifying header line of each routine is not written out. If the -log option is given the  name  of  each
       routine is printed on standard output.

FILE FORMAT
       Each routine in the original file file.ext must start with an identifying line:
         "CDECK  ID>, "      in cols.  1-12  for FORTRAN
         "/*DECK ID>, "      in cols.  1-12  for C
         ";DECK  ID>, "      in cols.  1-12  for assembler
          "DECK  ID>, "      in cols.  2-12  or
           "DECK ID>, "      in cols.  3-12  for anything else
                     "name"  in cols. 13-40  gives the name

       In the last two cases, or if "name" contains an extension,  the file created will be "name" without extension .f, .c or .s added to it and without an entry into the script.

       A trailing blank terminates the name, symbol . followed by blank also terminates, symbols  ; < # !   all terminate, symbol   */        also  terminates.
