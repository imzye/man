NAME
       ssh-askpass-fullscreen - A simple replacement for ssh-askpass written with gtk2

SYNOPSIS
       ssh-askpass-fullscreen

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       gnome-ssh-askpass  is  a  GTK-based  passphrase  dialog  for  use  with  OpenSSH.  It is intended to be called by the ssh-add(1) program and not invoked directly.  It allows ssh-add(1) to obtain a
       passphrase from a user, even if not connected to a terminal (assuming that an X display is available).  This happens auto-matically in the case where ssh-add is invoked from one's  ~/.xsession  or
       as one of the GUI startup programs, for example.

       In order to be called automatically by ssh-add, ssh-askpass-fullscreen should be installed as /usr/bin/ssh-askpass

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables are recognized:

       GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_GRAB_SERVER
                            Causes ssh-askpass-fullscreen to grab the X server before asking for a passphrase.

       GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_GRAB_POINTER
                            Causes ssh-askpass-fullscreen to grab the mouse pointer will be grabbed too.

       These  may have some benefit to security if you don't trust your X server. Keyboard is always grabbed.

       SEE ALSO
