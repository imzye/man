NAME
       perl-reversion - Manipulate project version numbers

SYNOPSIS
       perl-reversion [options] [file ...]

        Options:

           -help               see this summary
           -man                view man page for perl-reversion
           -bump               make the smallest possible increment

           -bump-revision      increment the specified version component
           -bump-version
           -bump-subversion
           -bump-alpha

           -set <version>      set the project version number
           -current <version>  specify the current version

           -normal             print current version in a specific format OR
           -numify             force versions to be a specific format,
           -stringify          with -set or -bump

           -dryrun             just go through the motions, but don't
                               actually save files

DESCRIPTION
       A typical distribution of a Perl module has embedded version numbers is a number of places. Typically the version will be mentioned in the README file and in each module's source. For a module the
       version may appear twice: once in the code and once in the pod.

       This script makes it possible to update all of these version numbers with a simple command.

       To update the version numbers of specific files name them on the command line. Any directories will be recursively expanded.

       If used with no filename arguments perl-reversion will attempt to update README and any files below lib/ in the current project.

OPTIONS
       "-bump"
           Attempt to make the smallest possible increment to the version. The least significant part of the version string is incremented.

               1       =>  2
               1.1     =>  1.2
               1.1.1   =>  1.1.2
               1.1.1_1 =>  1.1.1_2

       "-bump-revision"
       "-bump-version"
       "-bump-subversion"
       "-bump-alpha"
           Increment the specified version component.  Like the "inc_*" methods of Perl::Version, incrementing a component sets all components to the right of it to zero.

       "-set <version>"
           Set the version to the specified value. Unless the "-normal" option is also specified the format of each individual version string will be preserved.

       "-current <version>"
           Specify the current version. Only matching version strings will be updated.

       "-normal"
       "-numify"
       "-stringify"
           Use a specific formatting, as in "Formatting" in Perl::Version.

           Alone, these options control how the current (found) version is displayed.

           With "-bump" or "-set", also update version strings to have the given formatting, regardless of the version format passed to "-set" or the current version (for "-bump").

           If none of these options are specified, perl-reversion will preserve the formatting of each individual version string (the same as "-stringify").

       "-dryrun"
           If set, perl-reversion will not save files. Use this to see what gets changed before it actually happens.
