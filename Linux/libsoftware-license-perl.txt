VERSION
       version 0.104007

PERL VERSION
       This module is part of CPAN toolchain, or is treated as such.  As such, it follows the agreement of the Perl Toolchain Gang to require no newer version of perl than one released in the last ten
       years.  This version may change by agreement of the Toolchain Gang, but for now is governed by the Lancaster Consensus <https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-
       consensus.md> of 2013 and the Lyon Amendment of 2023 (described at the linked-to document).

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
