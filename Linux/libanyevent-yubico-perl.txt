AnyEvent::Yubico(3pm)                                                               User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                               AnyEvent::Yubico(3pm)

NAME
       AnyEvent::Yubico - AnyEvent based Perl extension for validating YubiKey OTPs.  Though AnyEvent is used internally, the module does not impose any particular coding style on the caller. Provides
       both blocking and non-blocking methods of OTP verification.

SYNOPSIS
         use AnyEvent::Yubico;

         $yk = AnyEvent::Yubico->new({ client_id => 4711, api_key => '<your API key here>' });

         $result = $yk->verify('<YubiKey OTP here>');
         if($result) ...

       For more details about the response, instead call verify_sync($otp), which returns a hash containing all the parameters that were in the response.

         $result_details = $yk->verify_sync('<YubiKey OTP here>');
         if($result_details->{status} == 'OK') ...

       As an alternative, you can call verify_async, which will return a condition variable immediately. This can be used if your application already uses an asynchronous model. You can also pass a
       callback as a second parameter to verify as well as verify_async, which will be invoked once validation has completed, with the result.

         $result_cv = $yk->verify_async('<YubiKey OTP here>', sub {
             #Callback invoked when verification is done
             $result_details = shift;
             if($result_details->{status} eq 'OK') ...
         });

         #Wait for the result (blocking, same as calling verify directly).
         $result_details = $result_cv->recv;

DESCRIPTION
       Validates a YubiKey OTP (One Time Password) using the YKVAL 2.0 protocol as defined here: https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-val/wiki/ValidationProtocolV20

       To use this module, an API key is required, which can be requested here: https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/

       When creating the AnyEvent::Yubico instance, the following arguments can be passed:

       client_id = $id_int
           Required. The client ID corresponding to the API key.

       api_key => $api_key_string
           Optional. The API key used to sign requests and verify responses. Without this response signatures won't be verified.

       urls => $array_of_urls
           Optional. Defines which validation server URLs to query. The default uses the public YubiCloud validation servers. Must support version 2.0 of the validation protocol.

           Example:

             $yk = AnyEvent::Yubico->new({
                 client_id => ...,
                 api_key => ...,
                 urls => [
                     "http://example.com/wsapi/2.0/verify",
                     "http://127.0.0.1/wsapi/2.0/verify"
                 ]
             });

       sign_requests => $enable
           Optional. When enabled (enabled by default) requests will be signed, as long as api_key is also provided.

       timeout => $seconds
           Optional. Timeout parameter sent to the server, see the protocol details for more information.

       sl => $level
           Optional. Security level parameter sent to the server, see the protocol details for more information.

       timestamp => $enable
           Optional. When enabled, sends the timestamp parameter to the server, causing YubiKey counter and timestamp information to be returned in the response.

       local_timeout => $seconds
           Optional. Sets the local timeout for how long the verify method will wait until failing. The default is 30 seconds.
