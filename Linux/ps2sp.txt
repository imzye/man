NAME
       ps2sp - manual page for ps2sp version 4.14

SYNOPSIS
       ps2sp [OPTION] infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       This utility is a SPICE netlist preprocessor.

       It converts netlists in PSPICE syntax to an equivalent SPICE3/XSPICE netlist syntax.

       Recognized are nearly all PSPICE features like:

       *   local and global parameter (expression) definition (.PARAM)

       *   parameter (expression) passing to subcircuits (PARAMS:)

       *   local and global function definition (.FUNC)

       *   E and G-device VALUE=f(V,I), TABLE and POLY lines

       *   E and G-device functions like IDT(), DDT(), LIMIT(), PWRS(), PWR(), IF(), MAX(), MIN(), relational ops, ...

       *   R-device VALUE=f(V,I), L-device FLUX=f(V,I) and C-device Q=f(V,I)

       *   spice2 like C and L-device POLY expressions

       *   pspice VSWITCH and ISWITCH models

       *   pspice .PROBE lines (also with expressions)

       *   R-device lines with temperature coefficients like TC=tc1,tc2

       *   pspice .STEP PARAM lines (not yet tested on GNU/Linux)

       *   pspice .LIB and .INC(lude) lines (not yet tested on GNU/Linux)

OPTIONS
       -h, --help displays the help screen

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit

       -sp3   switch means conversion of pspice table to spice 3 b-source instead of xspice core model (default)

       -ltspice
              switch means conversion of ^ spice 3 power to ** ltspice power and addition of tripdv=1 tripdt=1 in b-lines

       -debug for debugging all .param .func and .pfunc definitions (default is nodebug)

       -tosub only output subckt expansions

       -fromsub
              inputfile is a sub.tmp file

       -tolib only output lib expansions

       -fromlib
              inputfile is a lib.tmp file

       -check determine the same count of open and closed paranthesis in b-lines (default is nocheck)

       -notinylines
              produces longer b-lines for some functions (default is tinylines = shorter b-lines)

       -xornot
              allows ^ and ~ operators in the netfile (don't mix with ^ as power operator) use the ** operator as power instead
