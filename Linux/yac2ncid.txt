NAME
       yac2ncid - YAC server to NCID server gateway

SYNOPSIS
       yac2ncid [-v] [-p <PIDFILE>]
       yac2ncid [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       YAC2NCID acts as a YAC client, listens to the CID information from a YAC server and sends it to the NCID server.  The server then sends the CID information to the  NCID clients.

       It is important to understand that to run YAC server with NCID clients you must run YAC2NCID gateway as well as NCID server.

       The  configuration file for yac2ncid is /etc/ncid/yac2ncid.conf.  It may be located in same directory as the script, or in the etc directory, or in NCID default configuration directory.  Read the com‐
       ments in the config file for more details.

       YAC2NCID can run on any system, but normally it is run on same box as the NCID server.  If it is not run on the same box as the NCID server, you must configure the server IP address in the  configura‐
       tion file.

       Configure the YAC server with IP address of the box running YAC2NCID .

       YAC2NCID  relies on netcat binary (nc). As there are multiple implementations of this binary in existence, the script will try to auto detect the options to use. If script is unable to properly detect
       the version of nc, set NETCAT_TYPE to CUSTOM in the config file and set custom parameters to match your version.

       There is also a client output module called ncid-yac.  It sends the NCID CID information to YAC clients.

OPTIONS
       -p <PIDFILE> Sets the PID file name.
                    Default: /var/run/yac2ncid.pid
       -v           Verbose mode.
       -V           Display version.

REQUIREMENTS
