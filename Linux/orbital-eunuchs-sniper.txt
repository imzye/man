NAME
       snipe2d — Orbital Eunuchs Sniper is an overhead shooting game

SYNOPSIS
       snipe2d

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the snipe2d game.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       Orbital  Eunuchs  Sniper  is  an  overhead shooting game. You (the Eunuch on the orbital laser platform) are tasked with protecting the VIPs (blue) from the terrorists (red)!  You view a city from
       overhead, from the point of a view of an orbiting satellite.  Your laser takes some time to recharge.
