DESCRIPTION
       ncra averages record variables across an arbitrary number of input files.  The record dimension is retained as a degenerate (size 1) dimension in the output variables.

       Input files may vary in size, but each must have a record dimension.  The record coordinate, if any, should be monotonic for (or else non-fatal warnings may be generated).  Hyperslabs  of  the  record
       dimension  which  include  more than one file are handled correctly.  ncra supports the stride argument to the -d hyperslab option for the record dimension only, stride is not supported for non-record
       dimensions.

       ncra weights each record (e.g., time slice) in the input-files equally.  ncra does not attempt to see if, say, the time coordinate is irregularly spaced and thus would require a  weighted  average  in
       order to be a true time average.

EXAMPLES
       Average files 85.nc, 86.nc,  ...  89.nc along the record dimension, and store the results in 8589.nc:
              ncra 85.nc 86.nc 87.nc 88.nc 89.nc 8589.nc
              ncra 8[56789].nc 8589.nc
              ncra -n 5,2,1 85.nc 8589.nc
       These three methods produce identical answers.

       Assume  the  files 85.nc, 86.nc,  ...  89.nc each contain a record coordinate time of length 12 defined such that the third record in 86.nc contains data from March 1986, etc.  NCO knows how to hyper‐
       slab the record dimension across files.  Thus, to average data from December, 1985 through February, 1986:
              ncra -d time,11,13 85.nc 86.nc 87.nc 8512_8602.nc
              ncra -F -d time,12,14 85.nc 86.nc 87.nc 8512_8602.nc
       The file 87.nc is superfluous, but does not cause an error.  The -F turns on the Fortran (1-based) indexing convention.  The following uses the stride option to average all the March temperature  data
       from multiple input files into a single output file
              ncra -F -d time,3,,12 -v temperature 85.nc 86.nc 87.nc 858687_03.nc

       Assume the time coordinate is incrementally numbered such that January, 1985 = 1 and December, 1989 = 60.  Assuming ??  only expands to the five desired files, the following averages June, 1985--June,
       1989:
              ncra -d time,6.,54. ??.nc 8506_8906.nc
