HWLOC-INFO(1)                        hwloc                       HWLOC-INFO(1)

NAME
       hwloc-info - Show some information about some objects or about a topol‐
       ogy or about support features

SYNOPSIS
       hwloc-info [ options ]...  <object>...

       hwloc-info [ options ]...

       Note that hwloc(7) provides a detailed explanation of the hwloc  system
       and  of  valid  <object> formats; it should be read before reading this
       man page.

OPTIONS
       --objects
              Report information specific objects.  This  is  the  default  if
              some objects are given on the command-line.

       --topology
              Report  a summary of the topology instead of about some specific
              objects.  This is the default if no object is given on the  com‐
              mand-line.

       --support
              Report the features that are supported by hwloc on the topology.
              The  features  are  those  available  through  the  hwloc_topol‐
              ogy_get_support()  function.  This is useful for verifying which
              CPU or memory binding options are supported by the current hwloc
              installation.

       -i <file>, --input <file>
              Read  topology  from XML file <file> (instead of discovering the
              topology on the local machine).  If <file> is "-", the  standard
              input  is used.  XML support must have been compiled in to hwloc
              for this option to be usable.

       -i <directory>, --input <directory>
              Read topology from <directory> instead of discovering the topol‐
              ogy  of  the local machine.  On Linux, the directory may contain
              the topology files gathered from another machine  topology  with
              hwloc-gather-topology.   On  x86,  the  directory  may contain a
              cpuid dump gathered with hwloc-gather-cpuid.

       -i <specification>, --input <specification>
              Simulate a fake hierarchy (instead of discovering  the  topology
              on  the local machine). If <specification> is "node:2 pu:3", the
              topology will contain two NUMA nodes with 3 processing units  in
              each of them.  The <specification> string must end with a number
              of PUs.

       --if <format>, --input-format <format>
              Enforce the input in the given format, among xml, fsroot,  cpuid
              and synthetic.

       -v --verbose
              Include additional detail.

       -s --silent
              Reduce the amount of details to show.  A single summary line per
              object is displayed.

       --ancestors
              Display information about the object as well as  about  all  its
              ancestors up to the root of the topology.

       --ancestor <type>
              Only display the object ancestors that match the given type.

       --children
              Display information about the object children.

       --descendants <type>
              Display  information about the object descendants that match the
              given type.

       -n     When outputting object information, prefix each  line  with  the
              index  of the considered object within the input.  For instance,
              if three cores were given in input, the  output  lines  will  be
              prefixed  with  "0:  ",  "1:  " or "2: ".  If --ancestor is also
              used, the prefix will be "X.Y: " where X is  the  index  of  the
              considered object within the input, and Y is the parent index (0
              for the object itself, increasing towards the root of the topol‐
              ogy).

       --disallowed
              Include objects disallowed by administrative limitations.

       --restrict <cpuset>
              Restrict the topology to the given cpuset.

       --restrict binding
              Restrict  the  topology  to  the  current process binding.  This
              option requires the use of the actual current  machine  topology
              (or  any other topology with --thissystem or with HWLOC_THISSYS‐
              TEM set to 1 in the environment).

       --filter <type>:<kind>, --filter <type>
              Filter objects of type <type>, or  of  any  type  if  <type>  is
              "all".  "io", "cache" and "icache" are also supported.

              <kind> specifies the filtering behavior.  If "none" or not spec‐
              ified, all objects of the given type are removed.  If "all", all
              objects  are  kept  as  usual.  If "structure", objects are kept
              when they bring structure to the topology.  If "important" (only
              applicable  to  I/O  and Misc), only important objects are kept.
              See hwloc_topology_set_type_filter() for more details.

       --no-icaches
              Do not show Instruction caches, only Data and Unified caches are
              considered.  This is identical to --filter icache:none.

       --no-io
              Do  not  show  any  I/O  device or bridge.  This is identical to
              --filter io:none.  By default, common devices (GPUs, NICs, block
              devices, ...) and interesting bridges are shown.

       --no-bridges
              Do  not show any I/O bridge except hostbridges.  This is identi‐
              cal to --filter bridge:none.  By default, common devices  (GPUs,
              NICs, block devices, ...) and interesting bridges are shown.

       --whole-io
              Show all I/O devices and bridges.  This is identical to --filter
              io:all.  By default, only  common  devices  (GPUs,  NICs,  block
              devices, ...) and interesting bridges are shown.

       --thissystem
              Assume  that  the selected backend provides the topology for the
              system on which we are  running.   This  is  useful  when  using
              --restrict  binding and loading a custom topology such as an XML
              file.

       --pid <pid>
              Detect topology as seen by process <pid>,  i.e.  as  if  process
              <pid> did the discovery itself.  Note that this can for instance
              change the set of allowed processors.  Also  show  this  process
              current  CPU  binding by marking the corresponding PUs (in Green
              in the graphical output, see the COLORS  section  below,  or  by
              appending  (binding) to the verbose text output).  If 0 is given
              as pid, the current binding  for  the  lstopo  process  will  be
              shown.

       -p --physical
              Use OS/physical indexes instead of logical indexes for input.

       -l --logical
              Use  logical  indexes  instead  of physical/OS indexes for input
              (default).

       --version
              Report version and exit.

       -h --help
              Display help message and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       hwloc-info displays information about  the  specified  object.   It  is
       intended  to  be  used  with  tools  such as grep for filtering certain
       attribute lines.  When no object is specified, or  when  --topology  is
       passed, hwloc-info prints a summary of the topology.  When --support is
       passed, hwloc-info lists the supported features for the topology.

       Objects may be specified as location tuples, as explained in  hwloc(7).
       However hexadecimal bitmasks are not accepted since they may correspond
       to multiple objects.

       NOTE: It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page
       before  reading  this  man  page.   Most  of  the concepts described in
       hwloc(7) directly apply to the hwloc-calc utility.

EXAMPLES
       To display information about each package:

           $ hwloc-info package:all
           Package L#0
            logical index = 0
           ...

       To display information about the core whose physical index is 2:

           $ utils/hwloc-info -p core:2
           Core L#1
            logical index = 1
            os index = 2
          ...
