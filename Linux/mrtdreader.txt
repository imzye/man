NAME
       mrtdreader - Reader for machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs / passports)

SYNOPSIS
       mrtdreader [options] <MRZ>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mrtdreader command.

       mrtdreader  is a program which takes as input the content of the Machine-readable zone (MRZ) of Machine-readable travel documents (MRTD) and then reads out some data from the MRTD via RFID/NFC and
       dumps the facial image to a file.

       MRTDs such as passports nowadays usually contain an RFID chip for storing various data. The Basic Access Control (BAC) scheme is supported via the library libmrtd and  mrtdreader  is  the  example
       program delivered together with libmrtd. It uses several cryptographic functions in order to do the necessary decryption of the content of the MRTDs. The key for the BAC-scheme is derived from the
       Machine-readable zone (MRZ) which is printed on the MRTD.

       Content of MRTDs:

         EF.DG1  - 0101 - MRZ
         EF.DG2  - 0102 - Facial image
         EF.DG3  - 0103 - Fingerprint
