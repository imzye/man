NAME
       mheardd - collect information about packet activity

SYNOPSIS
       mheardd [-f] [-l] [-n number] [-p [!]port1[,port2,..]] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Mheardd  is a daemon that collects the statistics about the activity on
       all the AX.25 channels that  are  configured.  The  list  generated  is
       available  for  viewing  by the mheard(1) program. The information col‐
       lected is a superset of the information normally collected  by  similar
       mheard  programs and this is reflected in the options available for the
       viewing program. Logging to the system log file may  be  enabled  which
       will  enable monitoring of pathalogical conditions, for example invalid
       frame types and invalid/unknown protocol IDs.

OPTIONS
       -f        Deletes the existing mheard logging file at program  startup,
                 this is not the default.

       -l        Enables logging to the system log file. The default is off.

       -n number Sets the number of entries in the activity list file, the de‐
                 fault is 100. The minimum value allowed is 10 and the maximum
                 is 1000.

       -p [!]port1[,port2,..]
                 With  -p,  you  instruct  mheardd to only listen on specified
                 ax25 ports.  You may give more ports, seperated by  ','.   If
                 you introduce the port(s) by a leading '!', then mheardd will
                 listen on all ports except those you specified.

       -v        Display the version.
