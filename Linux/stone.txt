NAME
       stone - a simple TCP/IP packet repeater

SYNOPSYS
       stone [-d] [-n] [-u max] [-f n] [-l] [-z SSL] st [-- st] ...

OPTIONS
       -d     Increase the debug level.

       -z     SSL encryption.

       -n     IP addresses and service port numbers are shown instead of host names and service names.

       -u max max is integer. The program will memorize max sources simultaneously where UDP packets are sent.

       -f n   n is integer. The program will spawn n child processes.

       -l     Sends error messages to the syslog instead of stderr.

       st     is one of the followings; Multiple st can be designated, separated by --.
              (1)    host:port sport [xhost ...]
              (2)    host:port shost:sport [xhost ...]
              (3)    display [xhost ...]
              (4)    proxy sport [xhost ...]
              (5)    host:port/http request [hosts ...]
              (6)    host:port/proxy header [hosts...]

       The  program  repeats  the  connection on port sport to the other machine host port port.  If the machine, on which the program runs, has two or more interfaces, type (2) can be used to repeat the
       connection on the specified interface shost.

       display [xhost ...]
              Abbreviating notation.  The program repeats the connection on display number display to the X server designated by the environment variable DISPLAY.

       proxy sport [xhost ...]
              Http Proxy.  Specify the machine, on which the program runs, and port sport in the http proxy settings of your WWW browser.

       host:port/http request [hosts ...]
              Repeats packets over http request.  request is the request specified in HTTP 1.0.  host:port/proxy header [hosts...]

       host:port/proxy header [hosts...]
              Type (6) repeats http request with header in the top of request headers.

       xhost  Only machines xhost can connect to the program.

       xhost/mask
              Only machines on specified networks are permitted to connect to the program.  In the case of class C network 192.168.1.0, for example, use 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0.

       sport/udp
              Repeats UDP packets instead of TCP packets.

       port/ssl
              Repeats packets with encryption.

       sport/ssl
              Repeats packets with decryption.

       sport/http
              Repeats packets over http.

DESCRIPTION
       Stone is a TCP/IP packet repeater in the application layer.  It repeats TCP and UDP packets from inside to outside of a firewall, or from outside to inside.

       Stone has following features:

       1. Stone supports Win32.
              Formerly, UNIX machines are used as firewalls, but recently WindowsNT machines are used, too.  You can easily run Stone on WindowsNT and Windows95.  Of course, available on Linux,  FreeBSD,
              BSD/OS, SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX and so on.

       2.  Simple.
              Stone's source code is only 2000 lines long (written in C language), so you can minimize the risk of security holes.

       3.  Stone supports SSLeay.
              Using SSLeay developed by Eric Young, Stone can encrypt/decrypt packets.

       4.  Stone is a http proxy.
              Stone can also be a tiny http proxy.

EXAMPLES
       outer:    a machine in the outside of the firewall
       inner:    a machine in the inside of the firewall
       fwall:    the firewall on which the stone is executed

       stone 7 outer
            Repeats the X protocol to the machine designated by the environmental variable DISPLAY.  Run X clients under DISPLAY=inner:7 on outer.

       stone outer:telnet 10023
            Repeats the telnet protocol to outer.
            Run telnet fwall 10023 on inner.

       stone outer:domain/udp domain/udp
            Repeats the DNS query to outer.
            Run nslookup - fwall on inner.

       stone outer:ntp/udp ntp/udp
            Repeats the NTP to outer.
            Run ntpdate fwall on inner.

       stone localhost:http 443/ssl
            Make WWW server that supports https.
            Access https://fwall/ using a WWW browser.

       stone localhost:telnet 10023/ssl
            Make telnet server that supports SSL.
            Run SSLtelnet -z ssl fwall 10023 on inner.

       stone proxy 8080
            http proxy.

       Where fwall is a http proxy (port 8080):

       stone fwall:8080/http 10023 'POST http://outer:8023 HTTP/1.0'
       stone localhost:telnet 8023/http
              Run stones on inner and outer respectively.
              Repeats packets over http.

       stone fwall:8080/proxy 9080 ´Proxy-Authorization: Basic c2VuZ29rdTpoaXJvYWtp´
              for browser that does not support proxy authorization.
