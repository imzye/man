NAME
       sing - Send ICMP Nasty Garbage packets to network hosts

SYNOPSIS
       sing [-hVRnvqGQOBU] [-c count] [-T wait] [-p pattern] [-s datasize] [-F bytes] [-i interface] [-S spoof] [-t ttl] [-TOS tos] [-l preload] [-M os] [-L logfile] [-MAC hw_addr] [-x code] [type]  host

DESCRIPTION
       sing  is  a  tool  that sends ICMP packets fully customized from command line. The main purpose is to replace the niceful ping command with certain enhancenments as the ability to send/read IP spoofed
       packets, send MAC spoofed packets, send in addition to the ECHO REQUEST type sent by default, many other ICMP types as Echo Reply, Address Mask Request, Timestamp, Information Request,Router Solicita‐
       tion and Router Advertisement.

       It supports also the following ICMP error types: Redirect, Source Quench, Time Exceeded, Destination Unreachable and Parameter Problem.

       It can do a little fingerprinting, see the FINGERPRINTING TECHNIQUES section to read more details about.

       It can emulate certain OOSS sending Echo Request or Echo Reply packets. See the MIMIC TECHNIQUES section for a more accurate information.

       The  host  destination  can  also  be  specified  as  a  list  of  gateways  (including  destination)  breaked  by  the  '%'  symbol  meaning  the  use  of  a  Strict  Source  Routing  IP Option (v.g.
       router1%router2%router3%host) or the '@' symbol meaning the use of a Loose Source Routing IP Option (v.g. router1@router2@router3@host).

       A long number of examples is given at the EXAMPLES section of this page that shows a real use of this program.

MOST COMMON OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help screen.

       -V, --Version
              Program version.

       -v     Verbose mode.

       -B     Send a Bad ICMP Checksum on Information types.

       -c count
              Stop after sending (and receiving) count packets. Information types only.

       -F bytes
              Fragment the entire ICMP packet with bytes size by fragment. Not used on Solaris systems.

       -G     Set the IP header Don't Fragment flag. Not used on Solaris systems.

       -i interface
              Interface (name or IP address) where listen on for replies.

       -l preload
              If preload is specified, sing sends that many packets as fast as possible before falling into its normal mode of behavior.  Only the super-user may use this option. Information types only.

       -L logfile
              Save the current session to the file logfile. If logfile exists the data will be appended at end.

       -M os  Do mimic of the os specified when sending an Echo Request or Echo Reply. os can be win, unix,  linux, cisco, solaris or shiva.

       -MAC hw_address
              Do MAC spoofing using the MAC hw_address (maybe to surpass filtered switches). Be aware of using on an interface with a datalink type different of Ethernet. The MAC address must be on hexadeci‐
              mal form and must be delimited by ':' (Example: 00:FF:AC:33:1:B). This option made use of the libnet library to acces the network link layer. Only the super-user can use this option.

       -n     Don't use name resolution.

       -O     Do fingerprinting to discover the target OS.

       -p pattern
              You may specify a pattern of bytes to fill out the packet you send.  This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network.  For example, `-p INPACK'' will cause the sent packet to
              be filled with the word INPACK.

       -q     Quiet output.  Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and when finished.

       -Q     Totally quiet output. Absolutly nothing is displayed. Useful to use within shell scripts.

       -R     Use Record Route IP Header Option on the ICMP packet.

       -s bytes|max
              Number of garbage bytes that will be sent on any ICMP packet. With max the maximum possible will be sent.

       -S address
              IP address to be used as the source of the ICMP packet. This force the use of the libpcap routines that puts your network interface into promiscuous mode to be able to read  the  replies.  Only
              the super-user may use this option.

       -t ttl Set the IP Time To Live field to ttl value.

       -T wait
              Wait wait seconds between sending each packet. The default is to wait for one second between each packet.

       -TOS tos
              Set the IP Type Of Service field to tos value.

       -U     Set  the  IP  header  Unused bit flag. Be aware on *BSD systems because the kernel set to 0 the IP header flags when using the Reserved Bit so SING must revert to promiscuous mode to be able to
              read the response with libpcap. Not used on Solaris systems.

       -x, --xcode code|num|max
              ICMP code to send. Code code valid for Destination Unreachable (-du), Redirect (-red) and Time Exceeded (-tx) types. Numerical code can be specified for the ICMP types that doesn't  have  (Echo
              Request,  Information  Request, Address Mask Request, Router Solicitation, Router Advertisement, Source Quench, Parameter Problem and Timestamp). Using max an ICMP code greater than the admited
              ones will be sent. See the ICMP CODES section for a long list of code types.

       -ptr, --pointer byte
              Pointer to erroneus byte byte on an ICMP packet showing a parameter problem.  Valid only on Parameter Problem type (-param).

ICMP CODES
       Valid codes used with Destination Unreach, Redirect and Time Exceeded types are,

       - Used with Destination Unreach type (-du):

       net-unreach (Net Unreachable) The destination net is unreachable.

       host-unreach (Host Unreachable) The destination host is unreachable.

       prot-unreach (Protocol Unreachable) desired protocol is unreachable to destination host.

       port-unreach (Port Unreachable) desired port is unreachable to destination host.

       frag-needed  (Fragmentation  Needed and Don't Fragment was Set) Shows that IP packet had to be fragmented because of its size but the sender did not allowed it because the DF (DON'T FRAGMENT) flag was
       set.

       sroute-fail (Source Route Failed) could'nt follow the route indicated on IP packet.

       net-unknown (Destination Network Unknown) Destination network is unknown.

       host-unknown (Destination Host Unknown) Destination host unknown but network is.

       host-isolated (Source Host Isolated) Can't reach destination host.

       net-ano (Communication with Destination Network is Administratively Prohibited) access network is denied through firewall or similar on receiver side.

       host-ano (Communication with Destination Host is Administratively Prohibited) access host is denied through firewall or similar on receiver side.

       net-unr-tos (Destination Network Unreachable for Type of Service) indicates on destination network that the Type Of Service (TOS) applied for is not allowed.

       host-unr-tos (Destination Host Unreachable for Type of Service) shows that destination host is unreachable with applied TOS.

       com-admin-prohib (Communication Administratively Prohibited) a router can't forward a packet because of administrative filter.

       host-precedence-viol (Host Precedence Violation) IP packet precedence is not allowed.

       precedence-cutoff (Precedence cutoff in effect) a smaller IP packet precedence has tried to be sent over the minimal impossed by network manager.

       - To be used with Redirect type (-red):

       net (Redirect Datagram for the Network) shows that destination is a network.

       host (Redirect Datagram for the Host) shows that destination is a host.

       serv-net (Redirect Datagram for the Type Of Service and Network) destination is a type of service and network.

       serv-host (Redirect Datagram for the Type Of Service and Host) destination is a type of service and host.

       and

       - to be used with Time Exceeded type (-tx):

       ttl (Time to Live exceeded in Transit) time is over on an IP packet header packet.

       frag (Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded) could not reassembly all the IP packet fragments.

FINGERPRINTING TECHNIQUES
       With the -O option SING can use little techniques of remote OS fingerprinting.  To distinguish between Window$ boxes and the rest of the world Ofir Arkin has discovered a  simple  method:  Sending  an
       ICMP code that is not 0 within an ICMP Echo Request, a Window$ box respond with a 0 code while the rest of the boxes would leave the code field unchanged. See the SEE ALSO section.

       With  Solaris systems SING use a method discovered by me: Sending a fragmented Addres Mask Request any Solaris system (tested from 2.5.1 to Solaris8 Intel & SPARC) respond with an Address Mask of 0's.
       Last update!: Some people have noticed that HP-UX v11.0 respond the same way.

       See the EXAMPLES section for examples.

MIMIC TECHNIQUES
       With the -M option SING can try to emulate certain OS. At the moment Window$98/Window$NT4 (win value), UNIX (unix value), Linux (linux value), Cisco (cisco value), Solaris  (solaris  value)  or  Shiva
       (shiva  value)  are the only accepted values. To emulate them SING changes its normal behaviour about the IP header flags, the TTL, the initial ICMP sequence number, the ICMP id and the ICMP data that
       each OS send. These techniques are aplied only when using Echo Request or Echo Reply types.

RETURN VALUES
       sing can be easily used within shell scripts.  Program returns the following values to the shell:

       Value  Meaning
       -----  -----------
       0      Received at least 1 response from destination host.
       1      General Error.
       2      Packet sent OK but received no response.
       3      Out of memory.

       way router.comx:

       sing -du -S router.comx -x host-unreach -prot tcp -psrc 666 -pdst 69 -orig inferno.hell 10.2.3.4

       - We want to send a packet ICMP Source Quench to host ldg02.hell in response to a packet destinated to host ldg00 with UDP protocol, source port 100 and destination port  200.  We  mask  ourselves  as
       gateway 10.10.10.1:

       sing -tx -S ldg04.hell -x frag -prot udp -psrc 100 -pdst 200 -orig ldg00 ldg02.hell

       - We want to send an ICMP packet Address Mask Request and wait 10 seconds between sending each packet. We mask the packet with source address of 10.2.3.4 and we send it to the address 10.0.1.255:

       sing -mask -S 10.2.3.4 -T 10 10.0.1.255

       13. We will also add all garbage bytes as possible:

       sing -S dump.xorg -param -ptr 13 -prot udp -psrc 13 -pdest 53 -s max misery.es

       - We want to send an ICMP packet Timestamp to host www.danz.hell with code 38 instead of code (0) as usual:

       sing -tstamp -x 38 www.danz.hell

       - Same as above without code 38 and using Loose Source Routing between the routers cisco, 10.13.1.1 and wakeup.man:
