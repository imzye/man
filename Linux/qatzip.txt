NAME
       qzip - compress or decompress with qat acceleration

SYNOPSIS
       qzip [ -AdfhHkLCro ] [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       QATzip  is a user space library which builds on top of the Intel QuickAssist Technology user space library, to provide extended accelerated compression and decompression services by offloading the
       actual compression and decompression request(s) to the Intel Chipset Series. QATzip produces data using the standard gzip format (RFC1952) with extended headers. The data can be decompressed  with
       a compliant gzip implementation. QATzip is design to take full advantage of the performance provided by Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology.
