NAME
       CubicSDR - Software Defined Radio Application

DESCRIPTION
       CubicSDR is a cross-platform Software Defined Radio application which allows you to navigate the radio spectrum and demodulate any signals you might discover.  It currently includes several common
       analog demodulation schemes such as AM and FM and will support digital modes in the future.  SDR hardware is accessed through SoapySDR and therefore any hardware for which a SoapySDR module exists
       can be used as a receiver with CubicSDR.

OPTIONS
       -c, --config=NAME
           Use configuration NAME instead of the default.

       -m, --modpath=PATH
           Instruct SoapySDR to load modules from PATH instead of the default system location.

       --help
           Display command line parameter help and exit.
