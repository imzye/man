Test::Deep::NoTest(3pm)                                                             User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                             Test::Deep::NoTest(3pm)

NAME
       Test::Deep::NoTest - Use Test::Deep outside of the testing framework

VERSION
       version 1.205

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::Deep::NoTest;

         if (eq_deeply($a, $b)) {
           print "they were deeply equal\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This exports all the same things as Test::Deep but it does not load Test::Builder so it can be used in ordinary non-test situations.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
