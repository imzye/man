NAME
     pslist — control processes and their descendants

SYNOPSIS
     pslist [pid/name...]
     pslist -h | --help
     pslist -v | --version

     rkill [-SIG] pid/name...

     rrenice [+/-]pri pid/name...

DESCRIPTION
     The pslist utility examines the list of current processes to find a specified process and all its descendants.  A process may be specified either by name or by
     process ID.  If no arguments are given, pslist displays a list of the whole process tree.  For each process specified on the command line, pslist outputs a
     line containing the process ID, the command name, and the PIDs of all the descendants (and their descendants, etc.).

     When invoked as rkill, this utility does not display information about the processes, but sends them all a signal instead.  If not specified on the command
     line, a terminate (SIGTERM) signal is sent.

     When invoked as rrenice, this utility does not display information about the processes, but attempts to set their nice value instead.

RETURN VALUES
     The pslist utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     pgrep(1), pkill(1)

HISTORY
     The pslist utility was written by Peter Pentchev in 2000.
