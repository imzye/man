NAME
       psrecord - A small utility that records the CPU and memory activity of a process. Can also output results to a plot.

DESCRIPTION
       usage: psrecord [-h] [--log LOG] [--log-format LOG_FORMAT] [--plot PLOT]

              [--duration DURATION] [--interval INTERVAL] [--include-children] [--include-io] process_id_or_command

       Record CPU and memory usage for a process

   positional arguments:
       process_id_or_command
              the process id or command.

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --log LOG
              output the statistics to a file. If neither --log nor --plot are specified, print to print to standard output.

       --log-format LOG_FORMAT
              the format of the log file, can be one of "plain" or "csv"

       --plot PLOT
              output the statistics to a plot.

       --duration DURATION
              how long to record for (in seconds). If not specified, the recording is continuous until the job exits.

       --interval INTERVAL
              how long to wait between each sample (in seconds). By default the process is sampled as often as possible.

       --include-children
              include sub-processes in statistics (results in a slower maximum sampling rate).

       --include-io
              include include_io I/O stats
