NAME
       concordance - for programming your Logitech Harmony remote control

SYNOPSIS
       concordance

       For automatic mode:
              concordance <file>

       For manual mode:
              concordance <options>

DESCRIPTION
       This  software  supports  programming Logitech Harmony remote controls.  This software uses libconcord, which in turn uses libusb, which requires the RAWIO capability. That means you probably need
       root to use it.

       This software can be run in one of two modes. If you run it in automatic mode, the software will analyze the file to determine what sort of file it is and what to do with it. In some cases, con‐
       cordance may not be able to deteremine the filetype; if this happens, you should use manual mode.

       In manual mode, you specify what you want to do. For any command-line option that requires updating the remote, a filename is required. In manual mode, you must first choose a mode (and only one):

MODE-SETTING OPTIONS
       -c, --dump-config [<filename>]
              Read the config from the remote and write it to a file.  If no filename is specified, config.EZHex is used.

       -C, --write-config <filename>
              Read a config from <filename> and write it to the remote.

       -f, --dump-firmware [<filename>]
              Read firmware from the remote and write it to a file.  If no filename is specified firmware.EZUp is used.

       -F, --write-firmware <filename>
              Read firmware from <filename> and write it to the remote

       -h, --help
              Print this help message and exit.

       -i, --print-remote-info
              Print information about the remote. Additional information will be printed if -v is also used.

       -k, --get-time
              Get time from the remote

       -K, --set-time
              Set the time on the remote

       -l, --learn-ir <filename>
              Learn IR commands from other remotes. Use <filename>. When you selected multiple commands to learn on the Logitech website, you can move through this command list and let the Harmony  learn
              the IR code for each command.

       -r, --reset
              Reset (power-cycle) the remote control

       -s, --dump-safemode [<filename>]
              Read the safemode firmware from the remote and write it to a file.  If no filename is specified, safe.bin is used.

       -t, --connectivity-test <filename>
              Do a connectivity test using <filename>

       -V, --version
              Print the version and exit

       NOTE: If using the short options (e.g. -c), then *optional* arguments must be adjacent: -c/path/to/file. Required arguments don't have this limitation, and can be specified -C /path/to/file or
       -C/path/to/file.

       Additionally, you can specify options to adjust the behavior of the software:

OTHER OPTIONS
       -b, --binary-only
              When  dumping a config or firmware, this specifies to dump only the binary portion. When use without a specific filename, the default filename's extension is changed to .bin. When writing a
              config or firmware, this specifies the filename passed in has just the binary blob, not the XML.

       --force
              Force. This forces concordance to use the file the way you specified, even if it doesn't think that's the kind of file it is. This is necessary for files dumped by concordance.

       -R, --no-reset
              For config or firmware updates, do not reboot the device when done. This is generally only for debugging.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output.

       -w, --no-web
              Do not attempt to talk to the website. This is useful for re-programming the remote from a saved file, or for debugging.

       BUGS   None known at time of release, but check the website.
