DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the phpsysinfo webpage.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a man page.

       phpsysinfo  works  via  your web browser, and so has no command line options, simply point your browser to http://<server_name>/phpsysinfo and gaze in wonder! The actual location of the phpsysinfo
       files is /usr/share/phpsysinfo. You will find a configuration file at /etc/phpsysinfo/phpsysinfo.ini

AUTHORS
       This manual page was written by Hereward Cooper <zadok@phreaker.net> and improved by William Desportes <williamdes@wdes.fr>, for the Debian system (but may be used by others).
