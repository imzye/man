NAME
       libIDL-config-2 - helper script for building with libIDL-2

SYNOPSIS

       libIDL-config-2 [ --libs ] [ --cflags ] [ --prefix=dir ] [ --exec-prefix=dir ]

       libIDL-config-2 [ --version ] [ --help ]

DESCRIPTION
       libIDL-config-2  is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the libIDL-2 library.  This script seems to be semi-ob‐
       solete, and may not work correctly on non-Debian systems; you should probably use "pkg-config libIDL-2.0" instead.

       In most cases, you will use one (or both) of the options --cflags or --libs (depending on whether you are compiling or linking.

OPTIONS
       libIDL-config-2 accepts the following options:

       --version
              Print the currently installed version of library on the standard output.

       --help Print a usage summary.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link with the specified library.

       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program using the specified library.

       --prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that library was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the  exec
              prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
              If  specified,  use  PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that library was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified
              before any --libs or --cflags options.
