NAME
       gpgv-static - Verify OpenPGP signatures (static build)

SYNOPSIS
       gpgv-static [options] signed_files

DESCRIPTION
       gpgv is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

       gpgv-static is gpgv built statically so that it can be directly used on any platform that is running on the Linux kernel, such as Android, ChromeOS, or many embedded Linux systems.

       This version of gpgv in combination with debootstrap and the Debian archive keyring allows the secure creation of chroot installs on these platforms by using the full Debian signature verification
       that is present in all official Debian mirrors.

       You may wish to re-name the binary to plain gpgv when transferring it into such a platform to create a chroot.

       Please read the documentation for gpgv for more details.
