NAME
       rdm_responder_test.py - Test RDM responders for adherence to the standards

SYNOPSIS
       rdm_responder_test.py [options] <uid>

DESCRIPTION
       Run  a series of tests on a RDM responder to check the behaviour. This requires the OLA server to be running, and the RDM device to have been detected. You can confirm this by running ola_rdm_dis‐
       cover -u UNIVERSE.  This will send SET commands to the broadcast UIDs which means the start address, device label etc. will be changed for all devices connected to the responder. Think twice about
       running this on your production lighting rig.
