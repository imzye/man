NAME
       whitedune - graphical vrml97 editor and animation tool

SYNOPSIS
       whitedune [ variantoptions ] [ stereoviewoptions ] [ inputdeviceoptions [ axisoptions ] [ miscoptions ] [ file.wrl file.x3dv file.xml ...  ]

       whitedune [ conversionoption ] filename

       whitedune -illegal2vrml [ -prefix prefix ] protofile.wrl file.wrl ...

DESCRIPTION
       whitedune / white_whitedune is a graphical editor for the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML97), ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997.
       Additionally it has support for the NurbsSurface Node described in VRML97 Amendment 1.
       white_whitedune can also load and store VRML encoded X3DV files
       It can also load X3D files with XML encoding, if configured to use a commandline vrml97/x3d translator.
       A filename of - means standart input.
       Dune has some basic support for stereographic view usually with shutterglases in OpenGL "quadbuffer" mode.
       When used with the conversionoptions or the  -illegal2vrml  commandline argument, white_whitedune is a non graphical commandline program.
       The  conversionoptions are used to convert the VRML/X3DV file into sourcecode or a other 3D graphics format. This options are used in the commandline, but some options require a graphics con‐
       text (e.g. in the simplest case a usage within a xterm command), cause some of the conversion options require the usage of OpenGL commands. To create a OpenGL context, there are  3  different
       ways.
       First open a temporay graphics window, do the conversion and close the graphics window and exit. This is currently used under M$Windows.
       Second  is  to use Mesa off screen rendering (the program was compiled with the --with-osmesa configure option). With Mesa off screen rendering it is possible to use OpenGL commands in a pure
       commandline program.
       Third is to use glx based off screen rendering under Linux/UNIX/MacOSX.  In this case, no the program do not open a graphics window, but requires a working X11 display anyway. On a text  con‐
       sole the Xvfb X11 server program can be used to get a working X11 display.
       The  -illegal2vrml  option is used to repair VRML97 files with illegal extensions.
       See the illegal2vrml(1) manpage for more information.

CONVERSIONOPTIONS
       -vrml97
              Convert file to VRML97 ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997, write it to standart output and exit.

       -vrml97levelx3dv
              Convert file to VRML97 ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997 compatible parts of X3D classic VRML encoding ISO/IEC ISO/IEC 19776-2:2005, write it to standart output and exit.

       -x3d   Convert file to XML encoded X3D, write it to standard output and exit.

       -kanim filenamepattern
              Convert file to the kanim fileformat and write it to standard output.
              The  kanim  fileformat is a XML file with references to different VRML files. The VRML files are generated too, their name is generated based on filenamepattern: The filenamepattern is
              shortend from the fileextension and then extended with a underscore, a increasing number and the .wrl extension.
              All VRML files describe the same VRML scene with same the nodes, but some numeric fields are animated.
              This type of file is used by the open source VRML based Kambi gameengine.  It makes no sense to export a kanim file, if the exported VRML file do  not  contain  timesensor/interpolator
              based animation.

       -wonderland moduleDirectory
              Convert file to a java source file included in a directory structure needed to build a SUN wonderland version 0.5 module and exit.
              If the root directory of the module is build from the input filename (without extension) as moduleDirectory/exportX3dv/filename
              If this directory and the other needed files do not exists, this files are also created. If the other files exist, they are not overwritten, only the target java source itself is over‐
              written.   The name of the target java source file is moduleDirectory/exportX3dv/filename/src/classes/org/jdesktop/wonderland/modules/filename/client/jme/cellrenderer/filename.java The
              first character of the target java source file is uppercase.
              To get a wonderland module from the moduleDirectory/exportX3dv/filename directory, chance into this directory and run the ant command. A usual jar file of  the  wonderland  module  can
              then be found in the moduleDirectory/exportX3dv/filename/dist directory.
              When compiling the output of the wonderland java source export with the command ant, the java compiler may get out of memory resources.
              To fix the problem, you can set the memory limits by extending the javac tag in the file wonderland/build-tools/build-scripts/build-setup.xml e.g.
              <javac ...
                     ...
                     fork="true"
                     memoryinitialsize="256m"
                     memorymaximumsize="1024m"
              >
              Currently, the -wonderland option only support static 3D modeller output without animation or interaction.
              These features are work in progress and are still to be done.
              This option uses OpenGL commands.

       -x3d4wonderland
              Convert file to XML encoded X3D for import in SUN wonderland 0.4, write it to standard output and exit.
              SUN  wonderland  0.4  only support IndexedFaceSets with colorPerVertex and fullsize Color nodes. This exporter tries to convert other nodes to this IndexedFaceSets, but can (currently)
              not correctly convert nodes with colorPerVertex false and fullsize Color nodes.
              This option uses OpenGL commands.

       -ac3d  Convert file to the AC3D format (Version AC3Db), write it to standart output and exit. This option uses OpenGL commands.
              The AC3D file format is the input/output file format of the 3D modeller ac3d.
              The ac3d 3d modeller do not support several features of VRML/X3D (e.g. the ac3d 3d modeller do not support animation or interaction).  Therefore the AC3D file format can not  keep  the
              complete information of a VRML/X3D file in general.

       -catt8geo outputdir_with_material_geo
              Convert file to the catt geo format (Version 8), write it to several .geo formats to the directory outputdir_with_material_geo and exit.
              The catt geo file format is the input geometry file format of the catt acustic simulation program.
              The master.geo file in this directory outputdir_with_material_geo will hold include commands for the other produced .geo files.
              In  the  directory,  a  file  material.geo with the needed ABS commands must exist before conversion.  The material names for the ABS names are generated from the DEF names of the VRML
              nodes.
              If the material.geo file do not exist in the outputdir_with_material_geo directory, white_whitedune fails with a errormessage.
              Despite the catt programm can export VRML97 files, it do not support several features of VRML/X3D.
              Therefore the catt geo file format can not keep the information of a VRML/X3D file in general.
              This option uses OpenGL commands.

       -ldraw Convert file to the major part of the ldraw fileformat and write it to standard output.
              The header of the ldraw file is not generated. The header is a important part of a ldraw file and should have been written to standard output earlier (typically this  is  done  from  a
              batch script).
              The ldraw fileformat is a ASCII fileformat which is used to exchange 3D data between several open source plastic brick description programs. A example for such a program is LeoCAD.

       -prefix prefix
              The  -prefix  option  in  conjunction  with  conversion is only used for the following options to create source code. It can be used to define a leading prefix for the name of the data
              structures in the source code output.
              For example, the source code creates data types named "Node", "Scenegraph" and "Callback". To avoid problems with other libraries, adding options like for example "-prefix  X3d"  would
              change the names to "X3dNode", "X3dSceneGraph" and "X3dCallback".

       -c     Converts file to a C header/source file, write it to standard output and exit.
              Currently, information about routes are not exported.
              See section C/C++/JAVA SOURCE EXPORT for more information.

       +c prefix
              This option is very similar to the -c option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -c option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -3c    This option is similar to the -c option, but surfaces are first triangulated and then exported as TriangleSet nodes.
              This option uses OpenGL commands.

       +3c prefix
              This option is very similar to the -3c option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -3c option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -meshc This option is similar to the -c option, but surfaces are first converted to a polygon mesh and then exported as IndexedFaceSet nodes.

       +meshc prefix
              This option is very similar to the -meshc option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -meshc option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -c++   Converts file to a C++ header/source file, write it to standard output and exit.
              Currently, information about routes are not exported.
              See section C/C++/JAVA SOURCE EXPORT for more information.

       +c++ prefix
              This option is very similar to the -c++ option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -c++ option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -3c++  This option is similar to the -c++ option, but surfaces are first triangulated and then exported as TriangleSet nodes.
              This option uses OpenGL commands.

       +3c++ prefix
              This option is very similar to the -3c++ option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -3c++ option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -meshc++
              This option is similar to the -c++ option, but surfaces are first converted to a polygon mesh and then exported as IndexedFaceSet nodes.

       +meshc++ prefix
              This option is very similar to the -meshc++ option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -meshc++ option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -java  Converts file to a java source file, write it to standard output and exit.
              Currently, information about routes are not exported.
              See section C/C++/JAVA SOURCE EXPORT for more information.

       +java prefix
              This option is very similar to the -java option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -java option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -3java This option is similar to the -java option, but surfaces are first triangulated and then exported as TriangleSet nodes.
              This option uses OpenGL commands.

       +3java prefix
              This option is very similar to the -3java option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -3java option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -meshjava
              This option is similar to the -java option, but surfaces are first converted to a polygon mesh and then exported as IndexedFaceSet nodes.

       +meshjava prefix
              This option is very similar to the -meshjava option, but writes a incomplete source file, which can be concatinated to a sourcefile written by the -meshjava option.
              The names of the new defined datatypes in the sourcefile start with the prefix argument.

       -manyclasses
              Only valid after the -java, -3java, -meshjava or -wonderland options.
              This  option  is  a brute force attempt to fight against the "too much constants" problem in java. It may be impossible to compile the output of a normal java based source code export,
              cause the current format of java class files are limited to 64K so called "constants". Not only real constants like 1, 2 or 3 are counted, but also things like member variable  defini‐
              tions in classes etc.
              With the -manyclasses option, all data is distributed into many seperated classes.
              The -manyclasses option should help, if you run into the "too much constants" problem. In case of a large number of DEF commands in the vrml/x3dv file, you can still run into "too much
              constants"  problem,  cause each DEF commands leads to extra member variable in the main scenegraph class. In this case, you should reduce the number of DEF commands with the menupoint
              actions ... rest of scenegraph branch ... remove ... DEF name
              Beside the need to increase the memory limits of the javac compiler (-Xms/-Xmx) options, you may also need to increase the PermSize memory  limits  (-XX:PermSize=/-XX:MaxPermSize=)  of
              the java interpreter.

STEREOVIEWOPTIONS
       -nostereo
              force non stereoview mode on Linux/UNIX (e.g. if you do not own shutterglases)

       -stereo
              force stereoview mode.
              Stereo is only supported for hardware/software combinations, that allow quadbuffer stereo ("stereo in a window"), NOT splitscreen stereo (eg. "OpenGlVR").
              Examples for hardware/software combinations with support for quadbuffer stereo are graphicscards with support for shutterglasses or "stereo cloneview" to connect beamers of a onewall.

       -anaglyph glassestype
              force expermential stereoview mode for use with colored anaglyph glasses.
              glassestype can be red_green, green_red, red_blue or blue_red.
              This option uses the OpenGL accumulation buffer. This is not hardware-supported by a lot of graphics cards/graphics drivers and can result in miserable performance.

       -eyedist eyedistinmeter
              Distance between the two eyes of the viewer.
              Default eyedistinmeter is 0.06, it can be negative to swap eyes (no need to reconfigure your hardware if eye swapping problems occure).

       -screendist screendistinmeter
              Distance between the eyes of the viewer and the mid of the monitor screen.
              Default screendistinmeter is 0.8.

       -fieldofview fieldofviewindegree
              Overwrite Field of View field in VRML viewpoints and set to fieldofviewindegree in degree.
              Good stereoviewing may want need to ignore the fieldOfView field of viewpoints. The fieldOfView of the human eye is about 18 degrees, the VRML default is 45 degrees.

INPUTDEVICEOPTIONS
       The following options are only valid, if whitedune was compiled with matching inputdevice driver support (e.g. there is not support for a Linux joystick under IRIX).

       -joystick joystickdevice
              Only valid under Linux or M$Windows.
              Under Linux, joystickdevice is the device of a Linux joystick (usually something like /dev/input/js0 or /dev/js0).
              Under M$Windows, the joystickdevice is a number. Depending from the M$Windows version, this number is either 0, 1 or a number from 0 to 15.

       -SDLjoystick joystickdevice
              Currently only valid under MacOSX.  The joystickdevice is a number (e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...).

       -spaceball spaceballdevice
              spaceballdevice is the serial device connected to the spaceball (usually something like /dev/ttyd2 or /dev/ttyS0).
              Only valid if binary was compiled with libsball support.

       -nxtdials usbdevice
              This  option  support  a  dials like inputdevice made of mindstorms nxt motors.  Just attach a wheel or gear to each of 3 motors, connect them to the brick and connect the brick to the
              computer via USB.
              This option is only valid, if white_whitedune was compiled with support of the libusb library e.g. available under Linux.
              usbdevice is the number of the mindstorms nxt brick connected via USB (0 for the first nxt brick, 1 for the second nxt brick, etc).
              The -nxtdials option automatically set the wheel axisoption.

       -xinput xinputname
              xinputname is the devicename supported by the Xinput Protocol (usually something like magellan or dialbox).
              Valid on most Unix/X11 implementations.

       -xinputlist
              Print a list of Xinput devicenames that can be possibly used as xinputname for the -xinput option and exit.
              Valid on most Unix/X11 implementations.

       -xinputlistlong
              Print a list of Xinput devicenames with axis information and exit.
              Valid on most Unix/X11 implementations.

       -aflock aflockdevice  [ aflockoptions ]  -tracker birdaddr -wand birdaddr
              aflockdevice is the serial device connected to the Ascension Flock of Birds master transmitter (usually something like /dev/ttyd2 or /dev/ttyS0).
              Dune assumes the following configuration:
              Multiple FOBs with single RS232 Interface to Host Computer (see "The flock of Birds, Installation and Operation Guide, Standalone and Multiple Transmitter/Multiple  Sensors  Configura‐
              tions", Page 3 (chapter "Introduction"), Figure 2).
              birdaddr  is  the adress of the Bird Unit of the magnetic head tracker (-tracker) or "3D Mouse" (-wand) in the Fast Bird Bus (FBB adress) as configured with the dipswitches on the Bird
              Unit.
              This program need to have the Flock of Birds configured in the Normal Address Mode only (see Page 12, Figure 4 of the manual decribed above).

       -headnavigation
              Use current transformmode (including rotations) when using a headtracker.
              Default without -headnavigation is using only the translation mode.  This default gives you a very natural reaction, when your head moves, the virtual world moves,  but  if  your  head
              only  rotates,  the virtual world stand still. With the headnavigation option, the virtual world reacts to head rotations, depending of the current transform mode. Be carefull when you
              use this feature while talking to a audience. Talking cause small and fast head rotations and will cause small and fast rotations of the virtual world.  Your audience may get a impres‐
              sion like in a earthquake and is more in danger to get motion sickness.

       -sendalways
              Tell whitedune that the device sends (almost) always values. This values will then not be interpreted automatically as transform commands.
              Automatically used for Ascension Flock of Birds device (-aflock).

       -dontcarefocus
              Inputdevice actions dont care about the window focus.
              This can be useful in situations, when you only work with one whitedune window, e.g. when using a onewall.

AXISOPTIONS
       -x|-y|-z|-xrot|-yrot|-zrot=[-][integer_axisnumber]
              [,[factor][,[accel][,[wheel][,ignore]]]]

       -all|-allxyz|-allrot=[factor][,[accel][,[wheel][,ignore]]]

       -none=integer_axisnumber

       -axes=max_number_axes

AXISLEGEND
       -      used to swap sign of value from axis

       integer_axisnumber
              Integer with the number of the axis, that should be used for the x y z xrot yrot zrot directions.
              This number may not be greater than the number of axes of the inputdevice.
              The integer_axisnumber in the none option is used to disable this axis.

       factor Float with a multiplicator for the axes
              The factors of the all, allrot and allxyz options are independend of the factors of the single axes.

       accel  Float with a expotential accelerator for the axes

       wheel  The string "wheel" means this axis of the inputdevice will not deliver zero if released

       ignore Float with the value (relative to the maximal value from the device) which will be ignored (insensitivity)

       max_number_axes
              Number of used axes, one of (2,3,4,5).
              This must be equal or less to the physical available axes of a device. Main usage of this option is to disable bad designed or mechanical defect axes e.g. when you wish, this axis on a
              joystick would not exist

AFLOCKOPTIONS
       This options are only valid for the Ascension flock of birds magnetic tracking system.

       -baud baudrate
              Baudrate of the serial line communicating with the transmitter.
              According to the flock of bird manual, the following baudrates are valid for serial line communication: 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200.
              Default: 38400

       -numbirds numberbirds
              Number of "data delivering" birds attached to the transmitter (e.g. not counting the transmitter itself, if it is a Extended Range Controller (ERC)).
              Default: 2 (tracker and wand).

       -master birdaddr
              Adress of the master transmitter in the Fast Bird Bus (FBB adress) as configured with the dipswitches on the transmitter unit.
              Default: 1

       -masterIsErc
              Used to differ between configurations, where the master is a ERC (Extended Range Controller) or not. If the master is not a ERC, the FBB adress is the same as the  FBB  adress  of  the
              tracker or the wand.
              Default: not set

       -hemisphere FRONT_HEM|AFT_HEM|UPPER_HEM|LOWER_HEM|LEFT_HEM|RIGHT_HEM
              Hemisphere used. Sit on the antenna block (with the legs near on the side of the text) to see, what is left or right 8-)
              Default: RIGHT_HEM

       -sync 0|1
              Synchronise (1) or not (0) data output to a CRT (Monitor) or your host computer.
              Synchronisation is used to elimiate magnetic effects of a Monitor using the CRT sync cable.
              Default: 0

       -block 0|1
              Set (1) or do not set (0) the FNDELAY flag to the filedescriptor of the serial port.
              Default: 0

       -filter AC_NARROW | AC_WIDE | DC_FILTER
              Enable different filters. Read the Flock of Birds manuals for more information.
              This option can be repeated to use multiple filters.
              Default: no filter set, using filter set by Flock autoconfiguration.

       -suddenchangelock 0|1
              Allow (0) or disallow (1) setting of messured position and orientation when a sudden large messurement occure.
              Default: 1

       -calfile calibrationfile
              Use a VR Juggler style file to calibrate position messurement.

       -ignoresize delta
              Ignore position jumps from flock bigger than delta.  This is much like suddenchangelock, but pure software based.
              Default: 0

MISCOPTIONS
       -tessellation integer
              Set the default tessellation of NURBS and superformula based parametric shapes to integer.
              The meaning of tessellation decide how many edges are generated in one direction.
              A  low default tessellation result in faster rendering of related shapes with tessellation set to 0 inside the white_whitedune application, but can give a reduced view, so details of a
              shape may be hidden.
              If no -tessellation option is used, the default tessellation is 32.

       -indirect
              Forces indirect OpenGL rendering, even when 3D hardware rendering accelleration is available. In case of possible 3D hardware rendering accelleration this option can  drastically  slow
              down the program.
              This option is most usefull on machines with problematic graphic drivers or halfbaken 3D desktop features like compiz.

       -uninstall
              Output information (if available) on the commandline, how the white_whitedune application can be uninstalled and exit.
              Under Micro$oft Windows it additionally clears all information activly set by white_whitedune (under HKEY_CURRENT_USER) in the Windows registry.

       -psn_???
              Only valid under MacOSX.
              Options starting with the string "-psn_" are generated by the Aqua desktop under on some versions of MacOSX and are silently ignored.

       -fn font
              Only valid under Linux/UNIX/MacOSX.
              Set the unix font. Check for valid fonts with the xlsfonts(1) command.

       -demomode timeout
              This options is intended for running the program as eyecatcher eg. on a fair.
              The  option  is only usefull, if a viewpoint animation is running.  In case of input from the mouse (mouseclick), keyboard or a 3D inputdevice, the animation is stopped an the user can
              navigate through the 3D world.
              timeout seconds after the last input, the viewpoint animation is not supressed anymore.

       -filedialogdir directory
              Change to a specific directory before opening a filedialog.

       -proto category protofile
              Adds the VRML PROTO in the file protofile to the list of available PROTOs in the create => proto menu in the category submenu and exit.

       -renderslower
              This option uses a slower render mode.

       --version
              Print out version information and exit.

       --copyrightdetails
              Print out detailed copyright informations and exit.

C/C++/JAVA SOURCE EXPORT
       The export to source code is a export of the information (numbers and strings) of the VRML/X3D scenegraph tree.
       White_whitedune do not export something like C source with OpenGL commands.  The exported code is independend of any rendering engine, but can be used with any 3D API.
       Additional code is needed to render the scenegraph with a 3D API.  Currently white_whitedune comes with only one set of such additinal code for the Java Monkey Engine (JME). This code can  be
       used as a model for writing code for additional renderengines.
       The  information  of  the scenegraph is written into a class/struct with a name concatinated from the string of the prefix argument (default "X3d") and the string "SceneGraph". The scenegraph
       class/struct is filled with references to the different VRML/X3D commands ("nodes"). The name of the type of such a node is concatinated from the string of the prefix argument (default "X3d")
       and "Node". Each node type contains the data of the VRML/X3D node in variables named in the same way as the VRML/X3D fields.
       The following table shows the mapping from the VRML/X3D field type to the C, C++ and java datatypes:

       (***) The "X3d" part of the name is the default, it can be replaced by the string of the prefix argument.
       For any MF* type field (and a SFImage type field)│the number of int, float etc. values in the array is stored in a variable of the X3dNode struct/class composed from "m_",  the  name  of  the
       field and "_length"│in case of a C/C++ export.  Java do not need such a variable, cause the length of a array is always available as with the .length component of the array.
                          │              │              │
       The scenegraph is a│tree of nodes.│The root of the scenegraph is (similar to the white_whitedune internals) a VRML/X3D Group node named "root".
       In a Group node, the contained nodes are attached│via a field named "children" of type MFNode.
       For example imagine│the following VRML file:     │
                          │              │              │
       #VRML V2.0 utf8    │              │              │
                          │              │              │

           [              │              │              │
           Group          │              │              │
             {            │              │              │
             }            │              │              │
           Group          │              │              │
             {            │              │              │
             }            │              │              │
           DEF NAME_OF_FOGNODE Fog       │              │
             {            │              │              │
             color 1 0.50000000 1        │              │
             }            │              │              │
           ]              │              │              │
         }                │              │              │
                          │              │              │
       If no prefix argument is used, the│first node in a VRML/X3D file is represended in the exported C source as "root->children[0]" in the "X3dSceneGraph" struct.
       If  the  first  node in the VRML/X3D file is also│a Group node and contain three other nodes, the third of this nodes is represended as "root->children[0]->children[2]" in the "X3dSceneGraph"
       struct.            │              │              │
       If the third of this nodes is a Fog node, the "color" field of the Fog node is represended in the exported C source as "root->children[0]->children[2]->color" in the "X3dSceneGraph" struct.
       The type of the "color" field of the Fog node is SFColor. The SFColor type is represented as a array of 3 floating point values in the C source, used to store the red, green and blue part  of
       the color.         │              │              │
       So the green part of the fog color│is represended│in the exported C source as "root->children[0]->children[2]->color[1]" in the "X3dSceneGraph" struct.
       A C++ export would also use "root->children[0]->children[2]->color[1]" in the  "X3dSceneGraph" class.
       A java export would│similarly use "root.children[0].children[2].color[1]" in the "X3dSceneGraph" class.
                          │              │              │
       There is a second way to access the fields of the│Fog node.
       In  VRML/X3D  it is possible to name nodes with a "DEF" command. The string behind the DEF command ("NAME_OF_FOGNODE" in the example) also occures in the in the "X3dSceneGraph" struct and can
       be directly used to access the matching VRML/X3D data.
       So the green part of the fog color is represended in the exported C source as "NAME_OF_FOGNODE->color[1]" in the "X3dSceneGraph" struct.
       A C++ export would also use "NAME_OF_FOGNODE->color[1]" in the "X3dSceneGraph" class.
       A java export would use similarly "NAME_OF_FOGNODE.color[1]" in the "X3dSceneGraph" class.
       A problem can occure, if the string behind the DEF command is a reserved keyword in the target language. For example, the 3D modeller wings3d often uses the DEF name "default" when  exporting
       VRML97 files.
       In this case, the DEF name will be renamed (e.g. to "default1") and a warning would be written to standard error during the export.

       Beside  the  access  of  node  data  directly, there are also 2 sets of callbacks to handle the data of a whole scenegraph (or a branch of it): a set of callbacks to render the content of the
       scenegraph branch ("*RenderCallback") and a additional set of callbacks for other tasks ("*DoWithDataCallback").
       There are also callbacks to replace the functions, which per default alltogether traverse the Scenegraph ("*TreeRenderCallback" and "*TreeDoWithDataCallback").
       The callback mechanism and the scenegraph initialization differs from programming language to programming language.

       C:
       The scenegraph (default argument "X3d" for prefix) can be declarated with
          struct X3dSceneGraph sceneGraph;
       and initialized with
          X3dSceneGraphInit(&sceneGraph);
       A callback function for any X3D node type (like Fog, Text, IndexedFaceSet etc.)  has the declaration
          void mycallbackFunction(X3dNode *self, void *data)
       To access the fields of the X3D node, you usually cast the X3dNode pointer to a pointer to the type build from the string of the prefix argument (default "X3d") and the name of the  X3D  node
       type you access with this callback (e.g. X3dFog, X3dText, X3dIndexedFaceSet etc.).
          X3dFog *node = (X3dFog *)self;
          X3dText *node = (X3dText *)self;
          X3dIndexedFaceSet *node = (X3dIndexedFaceSet *)self;
          etc.
       With this variable "node" the fields the X3D node can be accessed.
       To install the callback, simply assign you function pointer to "callbackFunction" to a variable  build from the string of the prefix argument (default "X3d"), the the name of the X3D node and
       the string "RenderCallback" or "DoWithDataCallback". E.g.
          X3dFogRenderCallback = mycallbackFunction;
          X3dTextDoWithDataCallback = mycallbackFunction;
          X3dIndexedFaceSetRenderCallback = mycallbackFunction;
       To run the Render or DoWithData functions with the scenegraph tree, just use
          X3dGroupTreeDoWithData(&sceneGraph.root, NULL);
       Instead of using NULL, other data can be passed to the "data" argument of the callback functions.

       C++:
       The callback mechanism is very similar to the C mechanism.
       The  main  difference  is  the  storage  of the callback functions. While the callbackfunctions in C are stored in global space, the C++ callbackfunctions are stored in the static part of the
       matching node type.
       Instead of using
          X3dFogRenderCallback = mycallbackFunction; // C
       a C++ program would use
          X3dFog dummy;
          dummy.renderCallback = &mycallbackFunction; // C++
       In C++ there is no need to call a initialization function. A constructor is called when the
          X3dSceneGraph sceneGraph;
       declaration is used.
       To run the Render or DoWithData functions with the scenegraph tree "sceneGraph.render(NULL);" or "sceneGraph.doWithData(NULL);" is used.
       NULL can be replaced by other data, that will be passed to the "data" argument of the callback function.

       java:
       The java callback mechanism is a bit different, it is based on inheritance.
       The callback function is part of a class, that extends a matching class:
          class  MyCallbackClass extends X3dFogRenderCallback {
             public void render(X3dNode node) {
       The new class is used in the following example:
          MyCallbackClass myCallback = new MyCallbackClass();
          X3dSceneGraph sceneGraph = new X3dSceneGraph();
          X3dText.setX3dTextRenderCallback(myCallback);
          sceneGraph.render();

       With the the -manyclasses option, the last line changes to "X3dSceneGraph.render();". The access to a node with a DEF command in the x3dv/vrml file changes also to a static variable in a sim‐
       ilar way.
       See the directories docs/export_example_c, docs/export_example_c++ and docs/export_example_java of the source archive for examples.

              rotation around y axis = 3. axis
              rotation around y axis = 5. axis
              all axes use factor 1000 and all to not deliver zero if released

       whitedune -joystick /dev/input/js0 -z=,3 -axes=3
              starts whitedune with a linux joystick, set acceleration of the z axis to 3 and disables the 4. (5., 6., ...) axis.

       whitedune -xinput magellan -z=3 -xrot=2 -none=2
              starts whitedune with a xinput/magellan device, swapping axis number 2 and axis number 3, with axis number 2 disabled.

       whitedune -nxtdials
              starts whitedune with a mindstorms nxt usb device, all axes are automatic handled as wheels.

       whitedune -aflock /dev/ttyS1 -numbirds 2 -master 1 -wand 2 -tracker 3
              starts whitedune with a Ascension Flock of Birds.  Master transmitter (a Extended Range Controller (ERC)) at FBB adress 1 is connected to the serial device /dev/ttyS1, use 2 Birds, one
              attached to a "3D Mouse" device at FBB adress 2 and one attached to a head tracking device at FBB adress 3.

       whitedune -wonderland wonderland/modules -manyclasses Test.x3dv
              Exports the content of Test.x3dv as java source for wonderland 0.5 to the directory wonderland/modules/exportX3dv/test.
              To compile the java source to a wonderland module wonderland/modules/exportX3dv/test/dist/test.jar change the directory to wonderland/modules/exportX3dv/test and use ant.

FILES
       $HOME/.whitedunerc
       default file to load/store settings
       (see WHITEDUNERC environment variable for more information)

       $HOME/.whitedune_crash_*_*.wrl
              stores the vrml file in case of a crash

ENVIRONMENT
       WHITEDUNERC filename to load/store details of whitedunes screen layout and
              settings of the "options" menupoint.
              If this filename is not writable, settings are only loaded, not stored.
              If WHITEDUNERC is not set, the file $HOME/.whitedunerc is used under Linux/UNIX/MacOSX or the registry under Micro$oft Windows.

       WHITEDUNEDOCS  path to documentation directory

       LANG  the first two characters of then environment variable LANG
              are compared to the ISO 3166 country shortcut of the supported languages.  For example, if LANG is set to de_DE, german menu, dialogs and errormessages are used.

BUGS
       Dune need valid vrml97/x3dv code to work, it can not load a invalid VRML97/X3DV file.
       White_whitedune can load XML encoded X3D files via a translator.
       Use the menupoint Options -> Input Settings... to configure a X3D/XML to X3DV translator.
       whitedune is software in development, it is not 100% free of bugs.  Unsucessful crashes should be rare, lucky crashes allow to get back the data. (see "EXIT STATUS").
       Currently not all VRML97/X3D nodes are displayed (e.g. MovieTexture, NurbsSweptSurface or NurbsSwungSurface) or displayed correctly (e.g. Text or Viewpoint).
       Please send bugmessages to the old whitedune bugtracker sourceforge page ⟨http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3356&atid=103356⟩

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 for sucessfull operation.
       Exit status is 1 if inputfile can not be sucessfully read or other initialisation error.
       Exit status is 2 in case of a X11 server crash.
       Exit status is 11 in case of a X11 initialisation error.
       Exit status is 97 in case one of the inputfiles is a VRML 1 file (the VRML 1 format is not supported).
       In case of a coredump/crash, the exit status can be undefined.

EXIT STATUS
       In case of a crash (e.g. X11 server crash or signal (coredump) in case of a internal error), whitedune tries to write it's contence to the file $HOME/.whitedune_crash_*_*.wrl
