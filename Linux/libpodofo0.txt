POE::Filter::Ident(3pm)                                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                                         POE::Filter::Ident(3pm)

NAME
       POE::Filter::Ident -- A POE-based parser for the Ident protocol.

SYNOPSIS
           my $filter = POE::Filter::Ident->new();
           my @events = @{$filter->get( [ @lines ] )};

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Filter::Ident takes lines of raw Ident input and turns them into weird little data structures, suitable for feeding to
       POE::Component::Client::Ident::Agent. They look like this:

           { name => 'event name', args => [ some info about the event ] }

CONSTRUCTOR
       "new"
           Creates a new POE::Filter::Ident object. Takes no arguments.

METHODS
       "get"
           Takes an array reference full of lines of raw Ident text. Returns an array reference of processed, pasteurized events.

       "put"
           There is no "put" method. That would be kinda silly for this filter, don't you think?

       "debug"
           Pass true/false value to enable/disable debugging information.
