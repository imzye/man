NAME
       sublist3r - tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT

SYNOPSIS
       sublist3r [ARGS] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  package  contains  a  Python security tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT. It helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains for the domain
       they are targeting over the network.  Sublist3r enumerates subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, and Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates  subdomains  using  Netcraft,
       Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster, and ReverseDNS.

       Subbrute was integrated with Sublist3r to increase the possibility of finding more subdomains using bruteforce with an improved wordlist.
