       Input is the .delta output of either the "nucmer" or the "promer" program passed on the command line.

       Output is to stdout, and consists of all the alignments between the query and reference sequences identified on the command line.

       NOTE: No sorting is done by default, therefore the alignments will be ordered as found in the <deltafile> input.

DESCRIPTION
OPTIONS
       All tools (except for gaps) obey to the -h, --help, -V and --version options as one would expect. This help is excellent and makes these man pages basically obsolete.
       combineMUMs  Combines  MUMs  in  <GapsFile> by extending matches off ends and between MUMs.  <RefSequence> is a fasta file of the reference sequence.  <MatchSequences> is a multi-fasta file of the se‐
       quences matched against the reference

         -D      Only output to stdout the difference positions
                 and characters
         -n      Allow matches only between nucleotides, i.e., ACGTs
         -N num  Break matches at <num> or more consecutive non-ACGTs
         -q tag  Used to label query match
         -r tag  Used to label reference match
         -S      Output all differences in strings
         -t      Label query matches with query fasta header
         -v num  Set verbose level for extra output
         -W file Reset the default output filename witherrors.gaps
         -x      Don't output .cover files
         -e      Set error-rate cutoff to e (e.g. 0.02 is two percent)
       dnadiff Run comparative analysis of two sequence sets using nucmer and its associated utilities with recommended parameters. See MUMmer documentation for a more detailed  description  of  the  output.
       Produces the following output files:

           files. Two output files are generated. The .cluster output file lists
           clusters of matches between each sequence. The .delta file lists the
           distance between insertions and deletions that produce maximal scoring
           alignments between each sequence.

                         but not necessarily unique in the query (default behavior)

         -b|breaklen     Set the distance an alignment extension will attempt to
                         extend poor scoring regions before giving up (default 200)

                         extension reaches the end of a sequence, it will backtrack
                         to optimize the alignment score instead of terminating the
                         alignment at the end of the sequence (default --optimize)
         -p|prefix       Set the prefix of the output files (default "out")

         --coords        Automatically generate the original PROmer1.1 ".coords"
                         output file using the "show-coords" program
         --[no]optimize  Toggle alignment score optimization, i.e. if an alignment
                         extension reaches the end of a sequence, it will backtrack
                         to optimize the alignment score instead of terminating the
                         alignment at the end of the sequence (default --optimize)

                     or are less than 75% of the size of the other alignment
                     (promer only)
         -l          Include the sequence length information in the output
         -L long     Set minimum alignment length to display
         -o          Annotate maximal alignments between two sequences, i.e.

         -T          Switch output to tab-delimited format

         Input is the .delta output of either the "nucmer" or the "promer" program passed on the command line.

         Output is to stdout, and consists of a list of coordinates, percent identity, and other useful information regarding the alignment data contained in the .delta file used as input.

         NOTE: No sorting is done by default, therefore the alignments will be ordered as found in the <deltafile> input.
       show-snps
         -C            Do not report SNPs from alignments with an ambiguous
                       mapping, i.e. only report SNPs where the [R] and [Q]
                       columns equal 0 and do not output these columns
         -h            Display help information
         -H            Do not print the output header
         -I            Do not report indels

         -x int        Include x characters of surrounding SNP context in the
                       output, default 0

         Input is the .delta output of either the nucmer or promer program passed on the command line.

         Output  is  to  stdout,  and consists of a list of SNPs (or amino acid substitutions for promer) with positions and other useful info.  Output will be sorted with -r by default and the [BUFF] column
       will always refer to the sequence whose positions have been sorted. This value specifies the distance from this SNP to the nearest mismatch (end of alignment, indel, SNP, etc) in the  same  alignment,
       while  the  [DIST] column specifies the distance from this SNP to the nearest sequence end. SNPs for which the [R] and [Q] columns are greater than 0 should be evaluated with caution, as these columns
       specify the number of other alignments which overlap this position. Use -C to assure SNPs are only reported from unique alignment regions.

         Input is the .delta output of the nucmer program, run on very similar sequence data, or the .delta output of the promer program, run on divergent sequence data.

         Output is to stdout, and consists of the predicted location of each aligning query contig as mapped to the reference sequences.  These coordinates reference the extent of the  entire  query  contig,
       even  when only a certain percentage of the contig was actually aligned (unless the -a option is used). Columns are, start in ref, end in ref, distance to next contig, length of this contig, alignment
       coverage, identity, orientation, and ID respectively.
