NAME

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-pgpmime package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-pgpmime is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin allows decrypting mails, verifying signatures and sign or encrypt your own mails using PGP/MIME.

       It requires GnuPG and GPGME.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named pgpmime.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

FILES
       ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
           Configuration file for GnuPG, read gpg and gpgconf manual pages for details.
