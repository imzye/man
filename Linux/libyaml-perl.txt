YAML::Any(3pm)                                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                      YAML::Any(3pm)

NAME
       YAML::Any - Pick a YAML implementation and use it.

STATUS
       WARNING: This module will soon be deprecated. The plan is that YAML.pm itself will act like an Any module.

SYNOPSIS
           use YAML::Any;
           $YAML::Indent = 3;
           my $yaml = Dump(@objects);

DESCRIPTION
       There are several YAML implementations that support the Dump/Load API. This module selects the best one available and uses it.

ORDER
       Currently, YAML::Any will choose the first one of these YAML implementations that is installed on your system:

       •   YAML::XS

       •   YAML::Syck

       •   YAML::Old

       •   YAML

       •   YAML::Tiny

OPTIONS
       If you specify an option like:

           $YAML::Indent = 4;

       And YAML::Any is using YAML::XS, it will use the proper variable: $YAML::XS::Indent.

SUBROUTINES
       Like all the YAML modules that YAML::Any uses, the following subroutines are exported by default:

       •   Dump

       •   Load

       and the following subroutines are exportable by request:

       •   DumpFile

       •   LoadFile

METHODS
       YAML::Any provides the following class methods.

       "YAML::Any->order"
           This method returns a list of the current possible implementations that YAML::Any will search for.

       "YAML::Any->implementation"
           This  method  returns  the  implementation  the YAML::Any will use. This result is obtained by finding the first member of YAML::Any->order that is either already loaded in %INC or that can be
           loaded using "require". If no implementation is found, an error will be thrown.

EXAMPLES
   DumpFile and LoadFile
       Here is an example for "DumpFile":

           #!/usr/bin/perl

           use strict;
           use warnings;

           use YAML::Any qw(DumpFile);

           my $ds =
           {
               array => [5,6,100],
               string => "Hello",
           };

           DumpFile("hello.yml", $ds);

       When run, this creates a file called "hello.yml" in the current working directory, with the following contents.

           ---
           array:
           - 5
           - 6
           - 100
           string: Hello

       In turn, the following "LoadFile" example, loads the contents from there and accesses them:

           #!/usr/bin/perl

           use strict;
           use warnings;

           use YAML::Any qw(LoadFile);

           my ($ds) = LoadFile("hello.yml");

           print "String == '", $ds->{string}, "'\n";

       Assuming "hello.yml" exists, and is as created by the "DumpFile" example, it prints:

           $ perl load.pl
           String == 'Hello'
           $
