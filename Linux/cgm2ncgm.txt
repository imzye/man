NAME
       cgm2ncgm - filter NCAR CGM to/from vanilla CGM ncgm2cgm - filter NCAR CGM to/from vanilla CGM

SYNOPSIS
       ncgm2cgm [ -s output block size ] [ -V ]

       cgm2ncgm [ -s input block size ] [ -V ]

DESCRIPTION
       ncgm2cgm  and  cgm2ncgm  are  filters for converting back and forth between NCAR Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) and vanilla CGM.  ncgm2cgm strips the wrapper from NCAR CGM records while cgm2ncgm re‐
       stores it. I/O is done from standard in/out respectively.

OPTIONS
       -s size
              Set block size in bytes for reads/writes of vanilla CGM. The default blocking factor is 1024.

       -V     Print the version number and then exit.

BUGS
       Some vanilla metafile interpretors take advantage of shortcuts provided by their CGM generators. In effect, they are not true CGM interpretors. Although it will still  be  possible  to  convert  these
       metafiles  to  NCAR  format  that may be interpreted by NCAR Graphics translators. It may not be the case that the aforementioned interpreters will be able to translate true vanilla metafiles, such as
       produced by ncgm2cgm.
