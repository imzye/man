NAME
       papersway - PaperWM-like scrollable tiling window management for Sway/i3wm

VERSION
       version 2.002

SYNOPSIS
       papersway [--i3status] [--cols=N] [--debug]

DESCRIPTION
       This is an implementation of PaperWM-like scrollable tiling window management for Sway/i3wm.  If you like Sway/i3wm's commitments to stability, avoiding scope creep etc. but dislike the window
       management model, papersway is an alternative.

OPTIONS
       --i3status
           Start a background instance of i3status, filter and print its output.

       --cols=N
           Set the number of columns on a new workspace.  The default, and minimum, is 2.

       --debug
           Enable some debug printing and don't hide Sway's workspace buttons.

USAGE
       Here we discuss how to integrate papersway into your existing Sway/i3wm configuration file, usually found at ~/.config/sway/config or ~/.config/i3/config, as appropriate.

   Activation
       The recommended way to activate papersway is by using it as your bar command:

           bar {
               status_command papersway --i3status

               # [ .. further bar options .. ]
           }

       This ensures that you can see a visual representation of your paper workspaces, which will be useful while getting the hang of papersway.

   Binding keys
       Here are some sample bindings to get you started.

           set $mod Mod4

           bindsym $mod+Left exec papersway-msg focus left
           bindsym $mod+Down focus down
           bindsym $mod+Up focus up
           bindsym $mod+Right exec papersway-msg focus right

           bindsym $mod+Shift+Left exec papersway-msg move left
           bindsym $mod+Shift+Down move down
           bindsym $mod+Shift+Up move up
           bindsym $mod+Shift+Right move exec papersway-msg move right

           bindsym $mod+f exec papersway-msg width toggle
           bindsym $mod+o exec papersway-msg other-column

           bindsym $mod+a exec papersway-msg fresh-workspace
           bindsym $mod+n exec papersway-msg fresh-workspace send
           bindsym $mod+t exec papersway-msg fresh-workspace take
           bindsym $mod+b exec papersway-msg bury-workspace

           bindsym $mod+e exec papersway-msg absorb-expel left
           bindsym $mod+r exec papersway-msg absorb-expel right

           bindsym $mod+minus exec papersway-msg cols decr
           bindsym $mod+equal exec papersway-msg cols incr

           bindsym $mod+u exec papersway-msg workspace prev
           bindsym $mod+i exec papersway-msg workspace next
           bindsym $mod+Shift+u exec papersway-msg move-to-workspace prev
           bindsym $mod+Shift+i exec papersway-msg move-to-workspace next

           bindsym $mod+c [con_mark=caffeinated] inhibit_idle none; \
               inhibit_idle open, mark caffeinated
           bindsym $mod+Shift+c [con_mark=caffeinated] inhibit_idle none, \
               mark --toggle caffeinated
           for_window [con_mark=caffeinated] inhibit_idle open

       Delete any bindings you have for the split, splith, splitv, splitt, layout, focus parent and focus child commands, to avoid confusion (on the parts of both yourself and of papersway).

   Other configuration
       •   Set focus_wrapping to no.

       •   Leave workspace_layout with its default value, default.
