NAME
       dxcc - ham radio callsign DXCC lookup utility

SYNOPSIS
       dxcc [-g] [-m MYPREFIX] [CALLSIGN]

DESCRIPTION
       dxcc  determines the ARRL DXCC entity of a ham radio callsign, based on
       the  cty.dat  country  file  by  Jim  Reisert,  AD1C   (http://country-
       files.com/).

       If  a  matching country or entity is found, the entity name, continent,
       latitude/longitude and other information are printed.

       When invoked with the command line option -g , a Perl/Tk  GUI  with  an
       additional world map showing the location of the DXCC is shown.

       If  the  line option -m [MYPREFIX] is used, the distance and bearing to
       CALLSIGN is calculated and displayed.

FILES
       /usr/(local/)share/dxcc/cty.dat
              Optional country file. A current version of AD1C's country  file
              is already included in dxcc.
       /usr/(local/)share/dxcc/earth.gif
              Earth picture for the GUI.
