NAME
       HTTP::Daemon::SSL - a simple http server class with SSL support

SYNOPSIS
         use HTTP::Daemon::SSL;
         use HTTP::Status;

         # Make sure you have a certs/ directory with "server-cert.pem"
         # and "server-key.pem" in it before running this!
         my $d = HTTP::Daemon::SSL->new || die;
         print "Please contact me at: <URL:", $d->url, ">\n";
         while (my $c = $d->accept) {
             while (my $r = $c->get_request) {
                 if ($r->method eq 'GET' and $r->url->path eq "/xyzzy") {
                     # remember, this is *not* recommened practice :-)
                     $c->send_file_response("/etc/passwd");
                 } else {
                     $c->send_error(RC_FORBIDDEN)
                 }
             }
             $c->close;
             undef($c);
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Instances of the HTTP::Daemon::SSL class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon::SSL is a sub-class of IO::Socket::SSL, so you can perform socket
       operations directly on it too.

       The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.  In a scalar context the returned value will be a reference to a object of the HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn::SSL class
       which is another IO::Socket::SSL subclass.  In a list context a two-element array is returned containing the new HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn::SSL reference and the peer address; the list will be
       empty upon failure. (Note that version
        1.02 erroneously did not honour list context). Calling the get_request() method on the HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn::SSL object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object
       reference.

       This HTTPS daemon does not fork(2) for you.  Your application, i.e. the user of the HTTP::Daemon::SSL is reponsible for forking if that is desirable.  Also note that the user is responsible for
       generating responses that conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.  The HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn class provides some methods that make this easier.

METHODS
       The following methods are the only differences from the HTTP::Daemon base class:

       $d = new HTTP::Daemon::SSL
           The  constructor  takes  the  same  parameters as the IO::Socket::SSL constructor.  It can also be called without specifying any parameters, but you will have to make sure that you have an SSL
           certificate and key for the server in certs/server-cert.pem and certs/server-key.pem.  See the IO::Socket::SSL documentation for how to change these default locations and  specify  many  other
           aspects of SSL behavior. The daemon will then set up a listen queue of 5 connections and allocate some random port number.  A server that wants to bind to some specific address on the standard
           HTTPS port will be constructed like this:

             $d = new HTTP::Daemon::SSL
                   LocalAddr => 'www.someplace.com',
                   LocalPort => 443;

BUGS
       There is a problem with the interaction between the HTTP::Daemon base class and IO::Socket::SSL buffering which causes large post or put actions (>66k or so, depending on your OS) to hang.
