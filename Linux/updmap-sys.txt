NAME
       updmap - manage TeX font maps
       updmap-sys - manage TeX font maps, system-wide
       updmap-user - manage TeX font maps, per-user

SYNOPSIS
       updmap [-user|-sys] [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]
       updmap-user [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]
       updmap-sys [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       updmap version r59152 (2021-05-09 23:49:52 +0200)

       Update  the  default font map files used by pdftex and dvipdfm(x) (pdftex.map), dvips (psfonts.map), and optionally pxdvi, as determined by all configuration
       files updmap.cfg (usually the ones returned by running "kpsewhich --all updmap.cfg", but see below).

       Among other things, these map files are used to determine which fonts should be used as bitmaps and which as outlines, and to determine which font files  are
       included, typically subsetted, in the PDF or PostScript output.

       updmap-sys  (or  updmap  -sys)  is intended to affect the system-wide configuration, while updmap-user (or updmap -user) affects personal configuration files
       only, overriding the system files.

       As a consequence, once updmap-user has been run, even a single time, running updmap-sys no longer has any effect.  updmap-sys issues a  warning  about  this,
       since it is rarely desirable.  See https://tug.org/texlive/scripts-sys-user.html for details.

       By default, the TeX filename database (ls-R) is also updated.

       The updmap system is regrettably complicated, for both inherent and historical reasons.  A general overview:

       - updmap.cfg files are mainly about listing other files, namely the

              font-specific .maps, in which each line gives information about a different TeX (.tfm) font.

       - updmap reads the updmap.cfg files and then concatenates the

              contents of those .map files into the main output files: psfonts.map for dvips and pdftex.map for pdftex and dvipdfmx.

       - The updmap.cfg files themselves are created and updated at package

              installation time, by the system installer or the package manager or by hand, and not (by default) by updmap.

              add "MAPTYPE MAPFILE" to updmap.cfg, where MAPTYPE is Map, MixedMap, or KanjiMap

       --enable Map=MAPFILE
              add "Map MAPFILE" to updmap.cfg

       --enable MixedMap=MAPFILE
              add "MixedMap MAPFILE" to updmap.cfg

       --enable KanjiMap=MAPFILE
              add "KanjiMap MAPFILE" to updmap.cfg

       --disable MAPFILE
              disable MAPFILE, of whatever type

       --listmaps
              list all maps (details below)

       --listavailablemaps
              list available maps (details below)

       --syncwithtrees
              disable unavailable map files in updmap.cfg

       The main output:

              The main output of updmap is the files containing the individual font map lines which the drivers (dvips, pdftex, etc.) read to handle fonts.

              The map files for dvips (psfonts.map) and pdftex and dvipdfmx (pdftex.map) are written to TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/updmap/{dvips,pdftex}/.

              In  addition,  information  about  Kanji  fonts  is written to TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/updmap/dvipdfmx/kanjix.map, and optionally to TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/up‐
              dmap/pxdvi/xdvi-ptex.map.  These are for Kanji only and are not like other map files.  dvipdfmx reads pdftex.map for the  map  entries  for  non-Kanji
              fonts.

              If no option is given, so the invocation is just "updmap-user" or "updmap-sys", these output files are always recreated.

              Otherwise,  if an option such as --enable or --disable is given, the output files are recreated if the list of enabled map files (from updmap.cfg) has
              changed.  The --force option overrides this, always recreating the output files.

       Explanation of the map types:

              The normal type is Map.

              The only difference between Map and MixedMap is that MixedMap entries are not added to psfonts_pk.map.  The purpose is to help users with devices that
              render Type 1 outline fonts worse than mode-tuned Type 3 bitmap fonts.  So, MixedMap is used for fonts that are available as both Type 1 and Metafont.

              KanjiMap entries are added to psfonts_t1.map and kanjix.map.

       Explanation of the OPTION names for --showoptions, --showoption, --setoption:

       dvipsPreferOutline
              true,false  (default true)

              Whether dvips uses bitmaps or outlines, when both are available.

       dvipsDownloadBase35
              true,false  (default true)

              Whether dvips includes the standard 35 PostScript fonts in its output.

       pdftexDownloadBase14
              true,false   (default true)

              Whether pdftex includes the standard 14 PDF fonts in its output.

       pxdviUse
              true,false  (default false)

              Whether maps for pxdvi (Japanese-patched xdvi) are under updmap's control.

       jaEmbed
              (any string)

       jaVariant
              (any string)

       scEmbed
              (any string)

       tcEmbed
              (any string)

       koEmbed
              (any string)

              See below.

       LW35   URWkb,URW,ADOBEkb,ADOBE  (default URWkb)

              Adapt the font and file names of the standard 35 PostScript fonts.

       URWkb  URW fonts with "berry" filenames    (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)

       URW    URW fonts with "vendor" filenames   (e.g. n019064l.pfb)

       ADOBEkb
              Adobe fonts with "berry" filenames  (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)

       ADOBE  Adobe fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. hvnbo___.pfb)

              These  options are only read and acted on by updmap; dvips, pdftex, etc., do not know anything about them.  They work by changing the default map file
              which the programs read, so they can be overridden by specifying command-line options or configuration files to the programs, as explained at the  be‐
              ginning of updmap.cfg.

              The  options jaEmbed and jaVariant (formerly kanjiEmbed and kanjiVariant) specify special replacements in the map lines.  If a map contains the string
              @jaEmbed@, then this will be replaced by the value of that option; similarly for jaVariant.  In this way, users of Japanese TeX can  select  different
              fonts to be included in the final output.  The counterpart for Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Korean fonts are scEmbed, tcEmbed and koEm‐
              bed respectively.

ENVIRONMENT
       Explanation of trees and files normally used:

              If --cnffile is specified on the command line (can be given multiple times), its value(s) is(are) used.  Otherwise, updmap reads  all  the  updmap.cfg
              files found by running `kpsewhich -all updmap.cfg', in the order returned by kpsewhich (which is the order of trees defined in texmf.cnf).

              In either case, if multiple updmap.cfg files are found, all the maps mentioned in all the updmap.cfg files are merged.

              Thus,  if  updmap.cfg files are present in all trees, and the default layout is used as shipped with TeX Live on Debian, the following files are read,
              in the given order.

              For updmap-sys:
              TEXMFSYSCONFIG /etc/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFSYSVAR    /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFLOCAL     /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFDEBIAN    /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFDIST      /usr/share/texlive/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg

              For updmap-user:
              TEXMFCONFIG    $HOME/.texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFVAR       $HOME/.texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFHOME      $HOME/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFSYSCONFIG /etc/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFSYSVAR    /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFLOCAL     /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFDEBIAN    /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFDIST      /usr/share/texlive/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg

              According to the actions, updmap might write to one of the given files or create a new updmap.cfg, described further below.

       Where and which updmap.cfg changes are saved:

              When no options are given, the updmap.cfg file(s) are only read, not written.  It's when an option --setoption, --enable  or  --disable  is  specified
              that an updmap.cfg needs to be updated.  In this case:

              1) If config files are given on the command line, then the first one given is used to save any such changes.

              2) If the config files are taken from kpsewhich output, then the algorithm is more complex:

              2a)  If  $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg  or $TEXMFHOME/web2c/updmap.cfg appears in the list of used files, then the one listed first by kpsewhich --all
              (equivalently, the one returned by kpsewhich updmap.cfg), is used.

              2b) If neither of the above two are present and changes are made, a new config file is created in $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg.

              In general, the idea is that if the user cannot write to a given config file, a higher-level one can be used.  That way, the  distribution's  settings
              can be overridden system-wide using TEXMFLOCAL, and system settings can be overridden again in a particular user's TEXMFHOME or TEXMFCONFIG.

       Resolving multiple definitions of a font:

              If  a  font  is defined in more than one map file, then the definition coming from the first-listed updmap.cfg is used.  If a font is defined multiple
              times within the same map file, one is chosen arbitrarily.  In both cases a warning is issued.

       Disabling maps:

              updmap.cfg files with higher priority (listed earlier) can disable maps mentioned in lower priority (listed later) updmap.cfg files by writing, e.g.,

              #! Map mapname.map

              or

              #! MixedMap mapname.map

       in the higher-priority updmap.cfg file.
              (The #! must be at the

              beginning of the line, with at least one space or tab afterward, and whitespace between each word on the list.)

              As an example, suppose you have a copy of MathTime Pro fonts and want to disable  the  Belleek  version  of  the  fonts;  that  is,  disable  the  map
              belleek.map.  You can create the file $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg with the content

              #! Map belleek.map Map mt-plus.map Map mt-yy.map

              and call updmap.

       Listing of maps:

              The  two  options  --listmaps  and  --listavailablemaps list all maps defined in any of the updmap.cfg files (for --listmaps), and only those actually
              found on the system (for --listavailablemaps).  The output format is one line per font map, with the following fields separated  by  tabs:  map,  type
              (Map, MixedMap, KanjiMap), status (enabled, disabled), origin (the updmap.cfg file where it is mentioned, or 'builtin' for the three basic maps).

              In  the case of --listmaps there can be one additional fields (again separated by tab) containing '(not available)' for those map files that cannot be
              found.

       updmap-user vs. updmap-sys:

              When updmap-sys is run, TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR are used instead of TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR, respectively.  This is the primary difference be‐
              tween updmap-sys and updmap-user.

              Other locations may be used if you give them on the command line, or these trees don't exist, or you are not using the original TeX Live.

       To see the precise locations of the various files that will be read and written, give the -n option (or read the source).

EXAMPLES
       The log file is written to TEXMFVAR/web2c/updmap.log.

       For  step-by-step instructions on making new fonts known to TeX, read https://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html.  For even more terse instructions, read the be‐
       ginning of the main updmap.cfg file.

FILES
       Configuration and input files:

       updmap.cfg
              Main configuration file.  In texmf-dist/web2c by default, but may be located elsewhere depending on your distribution.  Each texmf  tree  read  should
              have its own updmap.cfg.

       dvips35.map
              Map file for standard 35 PostScript fonts for use with dvips(1).

       pdftex35.map
              Map file for standard 35 PostScript fonts for use with pdftex(1).

       ps2pk35.map
              Map file for standard 35 PostScript fonts for use with ps2pk(1).

       Output files:

       psfonts.map
              For dvips(1).  Same as psfonts_t1.map if option dvipsPreferOutline active, else as psfonts_pk.map.

       psfonts_pk.map
              For dvips(1).  Without information from MixedMap files.  (Setting of dvipsPreferOutline ignored.)

       psfonts_t1.map
              For dvips(1).  With information from MixedMap files.  (Setting of dvipsPreferOutline ignored.)

       download35.map
              For dvips(1).  Always downloads the standard 35 fonts.  (Setting of dvipsDownloadBase35 ignored.)

       builtin35.map
              For dvips(1).  Never downloads the standard 35 fonts.  (Setting of dvipsDownloadBase35 ignored.)

       pdftex.map
              For pdftex(1).  Same as pdftex_dl14.map if option pdftexDownloadBase14 active, else as pdftex_ndl14.map.

       pdftex_dl14.map
              For pdftex(1).  Always downloads the standard 14 fonts.

       pdftex_ndl14.map
              For pdftex(1).  Never downloads the standard 14 fonts.

       ps2pk.map
              Similar to psfonts.map file, but forces all fonts to be downloaded, so this map file can be used with xdvi(1) and ps2pk(1).

       Configuration files for dvips(1):

       config.builtin35
              Loads builtin35.map instead of psfonts.map.

       config.download35
              Loads download35.map instead of psfonts.map.

       config.outline
              Loads psfonts_t1.map instead of psfonts.map.

       config.pdf
              Loads psfonts_t1.map instead of psfonts.map and has additional settings for PDF generation.

       config.pk
              Loads psfonts_pk.map instead of psfonts.map.

       config.www
              Loads psfonts_t1.map instead of psfonts.map.  (For compatibility with old versions.)

       config.gstopk
