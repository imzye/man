NAME
       fastDNAml - DNA Maximum Likelihood program

SYNOPSIS
       fastDNAml < infile > outfile

       fastDNAml-util  utility

DESCRIPTION
       fastDNAml is derived from Joseph Felsenstein's version 3.3 DNAML.

       This  manual page documents briefly the fastDNAml and fastDNAml-util commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a man‐
       ual page.  Instead, it has documentation in text format. See below.

OPTIONS
       No options on the command line. They are supplied in the input file.  Some of the utilities scripts may help you to add options. Type fastDNAml-util alone to get the list of  utilities.   For  in‐
       stance, fastDNAml-util global will add the 'G' (for global) option to its standard input and will send it to standard output. See examples in /usr/share/doc/fastdnaml/examples/tests/Makefile.

SEE ALSO
       The programs are documented fully in /usr/share/doc/fastdnaml.  Since fastDNAml is based on Phylip's DNAML, reading the documentation of Phylip is recommended, too.
