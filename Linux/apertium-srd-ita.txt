NAME
       apfsck - check an APFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       apfsck [-cuvw] device

DESCRIPTION
       apfsck  is  an experimental tool that checks an APFS filesystem for corruption.  When an issue is found it is reported, but no repair is attempted.  For that
       purpose, you should use the official tools provided by Apple.

OPTIONS
       -c     Report if the filesystem shows signs of a recent crash.

       -u     Report the presence of unknown/unsupported features.

       -v     Print the version number of apfsck and exit.

       -w     Report unexplained inconsistencies that may or may not be corruption.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is 0 if there was nothing to report, 1 otherwise.

REPORTING BUGS
       Please submit any issues that you find to the project's mailing list at <linux-apfs@googlegroups.com>.
