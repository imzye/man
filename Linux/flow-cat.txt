NAME
       flow-cat - Concatenate flow files

SYNOPSIS
       flow-cat [ -aghmp ]  [ -b big|little ]  [ -C comment ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -o filename ]  [ -t start_time ]  [ -T start_time ]  [ -z z_level ]  [ file|directory... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  flow-cat  utility processes files and/or directories of files in the flow-tools format. The resulting concatenated data set is written to the standard output or file specified by -o. If file is a
       single dash (`-') or absent, flow-cat will read from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       -a     Do not ignore filenames that begin with tmp.

       -b big|little
              Byte order of output.

       -C Comment
              Add a comment.

       -d debug_level
              Enable debugging.

       -g     Sort file list by capture start time before processing.

       -h     Display help.

       -m     Disable the use of mmap().

       -p     Preload headers. Use to preserve meta information such as lost flows.

       -o file
              Write to file instead of the standard out.

       -t start_time
              Select flow files up to start_time. If used with -T select files between start_time and end_time.

       -T end_time
              Select flow files after end_time. If used with -t select files between start_time and end_time.

       -z z_level
              Configure compression level to  z_level. 0 is disabled (no compression), 9 is highest compression.

       file|directory...
              Process the files and/or directory.

TIME/DATE PARSING
       start_time and end_time parsing is implemented with getdate.y, a commonly used function to process free-form time date specifications. Example usage borrowed from cvs: 1 month ago 2 hours  ago  400000
       seconds ago last year last Monday yesterday a fortnight ago 3/31/92 10:00:07 PST January 23, 1987 10:05pm 22:00 GMT

EXAMPLES
       Concatenate all flow files begining with ft-v05.2001-05.01, use flow-print to display the results.

       flow-cat ft-v05.2001-05-01.* | flow-print

       Concatenate  flow files in /flows/krc4, store store the output in compressed.flows at compression level 9 (best). The headers are preloaded so various metadata such as the flow count is correct in the
       result. Filenames begining with tmp which are typically in-progress flow files from flow-capture are not processed.

       flow-cat -p -z9 /flows/krc4 > compressed.flows

BUGS
       None known.
