NAME
       ESIL - Evaluable Strings Intermediate Language

DESCRIPTION
       ESIL aims to describe a Forth-like representation for every target CPU opcode semantics. ESIL representations can be evaluated (interpreted) in order to emulate individual instructions.

SYNTAX
       Each command of an ESIL expression is separated by a comma

       <source0>,<source1>,<operation>

       <source>,<destination>,<operation>

       <source_destination>,<operation>

BASIC OPERATIONS
       These operations should be enough to emulate most instructions of any architecture

       =      Set the value of the destination to the value of the source

       +      Add the values of source0 and source1 and push the result on the esil stack

       -      Subtract the value of source0 from the value of source1 and push the result on the esil stack

       *      Multiply the values of source0 and source1 and push the result on the esil stack

       /      Divide the value of source1 by the value of source0

BASIC OPERATIONS EXAMPLES (x86)
       jmp eax -> eax,eip,=
