NAME
       sanlk-resetd - host reset daemon

SYNOPSIS
       sanlk-resetd [OPTIONS] lockspace_name ...

DESCRIPTION
       The sanlk-resetd daemon gets events from specified sanlock lockspaces.  Events are defined to cause sanlk-resetd to:
       - use wdmd/watchdog to reset the host
       - use /proc/sysrq-trigger to reboot the host

       The sanlk-reset program can be run on another host to request that sanlk-resetd reset the host it is running on.  Both hosts must be operational and have continued access to a common lockspace for the
       reset request to succeed.  After setting the event, the sanlk-reset program monitors the host status in the sanlock lockspace until the target host is dead.

       The sanlk-reset program can also be run on the same host as sanlk-resetd to update which lockspaces the local sanlk-resetd is watching for events.
