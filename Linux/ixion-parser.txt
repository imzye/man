NAME
       unrecognised - parser

SYNOPSIS
       ixion-parser [options] FILE1 FILE2 ...

DESCRIPTION
       The FILE must contain the definitions of cells according to the cell definition rule.

   Allowed options:
       -h [ --help ]
              Print this help.

       -t [ --thread ] arg
              Specify  the  number  of threads to use for calculation.  Note that the number specified by this option corresponds with the number of calculation threads i.e.  those child threads that perform
              cell interpretations.  The main thread does not perform any calculations; instead, it creates a new child thread to manage the calculation threads, the number of which is specified by the  arg.
              Therefore, the total number of threads used by this program will be arg + 1.

   Allowed options:
       -h [ --help ]

       -t [ --thread ] arg
