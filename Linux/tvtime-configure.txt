NAME
       tvtime-configure - change settings in the tvtime configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       tvtime-configure [ OPTION ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       tvtime-configure allows a user to set configuration settings for tvtime without starting the application.  This is useful for installation programs such as debconf to let them configure tvtime without
       having to write a parser for the configuration file.  The command line options are a subset of those for tvtime itself.

OPTIONS
       -a, --widescreen
              This option starts tvtime in 16:9 aspect ratio mode.

       -A, --nowidescreen
              This option starts tvtime in 4:3 aspect ratio mode.

       -h, --help
              Show usage information.

       -m, --fullscreen
              Start tvtime in fullscreen mode.

       -M, --window
              Start tvtime in windowed mode.

       -p, --fspos=POS
              Set the fullscreen window position.  Use this if you have a projector to help tvtime fit properly onto your screen.

              •   top
              •   bottom
              •   centre (default)

       -F, --configfile=FILE
              Additional config file to load settings from.

       -H, --height=HEIGHT
              Sets the height of the output window to start up at in scanlines.  The default output window size is 576 scanlines.

       -I, --inputwidth=SAMPLING
              V4L input scanline sampling (defaults to 720.  This sets how many pixels per scanline to request from the capture card.  A higher setting gives better quality, while a lower setting means we do
              less  work,  and so tvtime will run faster.  If you have a slower CPU (like, less than 500Mhz or so), maybe values of 480 or 400 might suit you best.  For best quality, choose a high value like
              720 or 768.  Many capture cards cannot sample higher than 768 pixels per scanline.

       -d, --device=NAME
              video4linux device to use (defaults to /dev/video0).

       -b, --vbidevice=DEVICE
              VBI device to use (defaults to /dev/vbi0).

       -i, --input=INPUTNUM
              video4linux input number (defaults to 0).  Cards commonly have a bunch of sources, for example, on my WinTV card, source 0 is my tuner and source 1 is the composite input.

       -c, --channel=CHANNEL
              On startup, tvtime will tune to the given channel.  Otherwise, the channels from the config file will be used.

       -n, --norm=NORM
              The mode to set the tuner to (defaults to NTSC).  Valid modes are:

              •   NTSC
              •   PAL
              •   SECAM

              •   PAL-M
              •   PAL-N
              •   NTSC-JP

       -f, --frequencies=NAME
              The channels you are receiving with the tuner (defaults to us-cable).  Valid values are:

              •   russia

       -R, --priority=PRI
              Sets the process priority (see nice(1)) that tvtime should be run at.

       -t, --xmltv=FILE
              Reads XMLTV listings from the given file to display on the OSD.  Channels are looked up based on their name, and tvtime will display the show title, sub-title and show description on the OSD.

       -l, --xmltvlanguage=LANG
              Use XMLTV data in given language, if available.  Languages are represented by their two-letter language code (for example, "de" for German).  The default language used in the file will be  used
              if this is unset or set to "none"
