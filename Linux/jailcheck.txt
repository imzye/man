NAME
       jailcheck - Simple utility program to test running sandboxes

SYNOPSIS
       sudo jailcheck [OPTIONS] [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       jailcheck attaches itself to all sandboxes started by the user and per‐
       forms some basic tests on the sandbox filesystem:

       1. Virtual directories
              jailcheck extracts a list with the main virtual directories  in‐
              stalled by the sandbox.  These directories are build by firejail
              at startup using --private* and --whitelist commands.

       2. Noexec test
              jailcheck inserts executable programs in  /home/username,  /tmp,
              and  /var/tmp  directories and tries to run them from inside the
              sandbox, thus testing if the directory is executable or not.

       3. Read access test
              jailcheck creates test files in the directories specified by the
              user and tries to read them from inside the sandbox.

       4. AppArmor test

       5. Seccomp test

       6. Networking test

       The program is started as root using sudo.

OPTIONS
       --debug
              Print debug messages.

       -?, --help
              Print options and exit.

       --version
              Print program version and exit.

       [directory]
              One  or  more  directories in user home to test for read access.
              ~/.ssh and ~/.gnupg are tested by default.

OUTPUT
       For each sandbox detected we print the following line:

            PID:USER:Sandbox Name:Command

       It is followed by relevant sandbox information, such as the virtual di‐
       rectories and various warnings.
