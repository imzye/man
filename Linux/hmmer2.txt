NAME
       hmm2align - align sequences to an HMM profile

SYNOPSIS
       hmm2align [options] hmm2file seqfile

DESCRIPTION
       hmm2align reads an HMM file from hmmfile and a set of sequences from seqfile, aligns the sequences to the profile HMM, and outputs a multiple sequence alignment.

       seqfile  may  be in any unaligned or aligned file format accepted by HMMER. If it is in a multiple alignment format (e.g. Stockholm, MSF, SELEX, ClustalW), the existing alignment is ignored (i.e.,
       the sequences are read as if they were unaligned - hmm2align will align them the way it wants).

OPTIONS
       -h     Print brief help; includes version number and summary of all options, including expert options.

       -m     Include in the alignment only those symbols aligned to match states.  Do not show symbols assigned to insert states.

       -o <f> Save alignment to file <f> instead of to standard output.

       -q     quiet; suppress all output except the alignment itself.  Useful for piping or redirecting the output.

EXPERT OPTIONS
       --informat <s>
              Assert that the input seqfile is in format <s>; do not run Babelfish format autodection. This increases the reliability of the program somewhat, because the  Babelfish  can  make  mistakes;
              particularly  recommended  for  unattended,  high-throughput  runs of HMMER. Valid format strings include FASTA, GENBANK, EMBL, GCG, PIR, STOCKHOLM, SELEX, MSF, CLUSTAL, and PHYLIP. See the
              User's Guide for a complete list.

       --mapali <f>
              Reads an alignment from file <f> and aligns it as a single object to the HMM; e.g. the alignment in <f> is held fixed.  This allows you to align sequences to a model with hmm2align and view
              them in the context of an existing trusted multiple alignment.  The alignment to the alignment is defined by a "map" kept in the HMM, and so is fast and guaranteed to be consistent with the
              way the HMM was constructed from the alignment.  The alignment in the file <f> must be exactly the alignment that the HMM was built from.  Compare the --withali option.

       --oneline
              Output the alignment with one line per sequence, rather than interleaving the sequence alignment blocks. Only affects Stockholm format output.

       --outformat <s>
              Output the alignment in format <s>.  The default is Stockholm format. Valid formats include Stockholm, SELEX, MSF, Clustal, Phylip, and A2M.

       --withali <f>
              Reads an alignment from file <f> and aligns it as a single object to the HMM; e.g. the alignment in <f> is held fixed.  This allows you to align sequences to a model with hmm2align and view
              them in the context of an existing trusted multiple alignment. The alignment to the alignment is done with a heuristic (nonoptimal) dynamic programming procedure, which may be somewhat slow
              and is not guaranteed to be completely consistent with the way the HMM was constructed (though it should be quite close).  However, any alignment can be used, not just  the  alignment  that
              the HMM was built from. Compare the --mapali option.
