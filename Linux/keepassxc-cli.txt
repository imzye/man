NAME
       keepassxc-cli - command line interface for the KeePassXC password manager

SYNOPSIS
       keepassxc-cli command [options]

DESCRIPTION
       keepassxc-cli is the command line interface for the KeePassXC password manager. It provides the ability to query and modify the entries of a KeePass database, directly from the command line.

COMMANDS
       add [options] <database> <entry>
           Adds a new entry to a database. A password can be generated (-g option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (-p option). The same password generation options as documented for the
           generate command can be used when the -g option is set.

       analyze [options] <database>
           Analyzes passwords in a database for weaknesses.

       clip [options] <database> <entry> [timeout]
           Copies an attribute or the current TOTP (if the -t option is specified) of a database entry to the clipboard. If no attribute name is specified using the -a option, the password is copied. If
           multiple entries with the same name exist in different groups, only the attribute for the first one is copied. For copying the attribute of an entry in a specific group, the group path to the
           entry should be specified as well, instead of just the name. Optionally, a timeout in seconds can be specified to automatically clear the clipboard.

       close
           In interactive mode, closes the currently opened database (see open).

       db-create [options] <database>
           Creates a new database with a password and/or a key file. The key file will be created if the file that is referred to does not exist. If both the key file and password are empty, no database will
           be created.

       db-info [options] <database>
           Show a database’s information.

       diceware [options]
           Generates a random diceware passphrase.

       edit [options] <database> <entry>
           Edits a database entry. A password can be generated (-g option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (-p option). The same password generation options as documented for the generate
           command can be used when the -g option is set.

       estimate [options] [password]
           Estimates the entropy of a password. The password to estimate can be provided as a positional argument, or using the standard input.

       exit
           Exits interactive mode. Synonymous with quit.

       export [options] <database>
           Exports the content of a database to standard output in the specified format (defaults to XML).

       generate [options]
           Generates a random password.

       help [command]
           Displays a list of available commands, or detailed information about the specified command.

       import [options] <xml> <database>
           Imports the contents of an XML database to the target database.

       locate [options] <database> <term>
           Locates all the entries that match a specific search term in a database.

       ls [options] <database> [group]
           Lists the contents of a group in a database. If no group is specified, it will default to the root group.

       merge [options] <database1> <database2>
           Merges two databases together. The first database file is going to be replaced by the result of the merge, for that reason it is advisable to keep a backup of the two database files before
           attempting a merge. In the case that both databases make use of the same credentials, the --same-credentials or -s option can be used.

       mkdir [options] <database> <group>
           Adds a new group to a database.

       mv [options] <database> <entry> <group>
           Moves an entry to a new group.

       open [options] <database>
           Opens the given database in a shell-style interactive mode. This is useful for performing multiple operations on a single database (e.g. ls followed by show).

       quit
           Exits interactive mode. Synonymous with exit.

       rm [options] <database> <entry>
           Removes an entry from a database. If the database has a recycle bin, the entry will be moved there. If the entry is already in the recycle bin, it will be removed permanently.

       rmdir [options] <database> <group>
           Removes a group from a database. If the database has a recycle bin, the group will be moved there. If the group is already in the recycle bin, it will be removed permanently.

       show [options] <database> <entry>
           Shows the title, username, password, URL and notes of a database entry. Can also show the current TOTP. Regarding the occurrence of multiple entries with the same name in different groups,
           everything stated in the clip command section also applies here.

       --debug-info
           Displays debugging information.

       -k, --key-file <path>

           Deactivates the password key for the database.

       -y, --yubikey <slot>

       -q, --quiet <path>
           Silences password prompt and other secondary outputs.

       -h, --help
           Displays help information.

       -v, --version

   Add and edit options
       The same password generation options as documented for the generate command can be used with those 2 commands when the -g option is set.

       -u, --username <username>
           Specifies the username of the entry.

       --url <url>
           Specifies the URL of the entry.

       -p, --password-prompt
           Uses a password prompt for the entry’s password.

   Analyze options
       -H, --hibp <filename>
           Checks if any passwords have been publicly leaked, by comparing against the given list of password SHA-1 hashes, which must be in "Have I Been Pwned" format. Such files are available from
           https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords; note that they are large, and so this operation typically takes some time (minutes up to an hour or so).

   Clip options
       -a, --attribute
           Copies the specified attribute to the clipboard. If no attribute is specified, the password attribute is the default. For example, "-a username" would copy the username to the clipboard. [Default:
           password]

       -t, --totp
           Copies the current TOTP instead of the specified attribute to the clipboard. Will report an error if no TOTP is configured for the entry.

           Shows the protected attributes in clear text.

       -t, --totp
           Also shows the current TOTP, reporting an error if no TOTP is configured for the entry.

           Sets the desired number of words for the generated passphrase. [Default: 7]

       -w, --word-list <path>
