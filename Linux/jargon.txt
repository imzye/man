NAME
       jargon - find an entry in the jargon file

SYNOPSIS
       jargon [-s] [entryname]

DESCRIPTION
       The  jargon command looks for an entry containing the specified name in the jargon file and, if found, starts infobrowser at that location. If no name is specified, then it just starts infobrowser
       on the jargon file.  If the specified entry cannot be found, infobrowser is started pointing at the appropriate index page.

OPTIONS
       -s
              Dump entry to standard output, using info.  The specified entry is displayed in a noninteractive manner. If the entry cannot be found, nothing is output. If this option is given, then it is
              an error if entryname is not specified.
