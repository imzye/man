NAME
       xtitle - set window title and icon name for an X11 terminal window

SYNOPSIS
       xtitle [ -tiq ] [ -- ] string ...  | [ -V ] [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       Xtitle  will  set the window title and/or the icon name of the terminal window in which it is run to be its command line arguments.  It does this by outputting the appropriate xterm(1) control se‐
       quence characters.  Unless suppressed, xtitle will also report the settings it has made.

OPTIONS
       -t, --title
                 Only set the window title.  Default sets both.

       -i, --icon
                 Only set the icon name.  Default sets both.

       -q, --quiet
                 Quiet mode.  Doesn't report the settings performed.

       -V, --version
                 Only prints the program version.

       -h, --help
                 Prints a helpful usage message.

       --        Interprets all following arguments as strings instead of options.

CAVEATS
       Xtitle is known to work with xterm(1) and dtterm(1).  The effect of the control sequences in other terminals is not known, though I wouldn't expect any problems.

VERSION
       1.0.4
