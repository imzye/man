NAME
       pvm_gsize - Returns the number of members presently in the named group.

SYNOPSIS
       C    int size = pvm_gsize( char *group )

       Fortran   call pvmfgsize( group, size )

PARAMETERS
       group   Character string group name of an existing group.

       size    Integer returning the number of members presently in the group.  Values less than zero indicate an error.

DESCRIPTION
       The routine pvm_gsize returns the size of the group named group.  If there is an error size will be negative.

       Since groups can change dynamically in PVM 3.0, this routine can only guarantee to return the instantaneous size of a given group.

EXAMPLES
       C:
            size = pvm_gsize( "worker" );

       Fortran:
            CALL PVMFGSIZE( 'group2', SIZE )

ERRORS
       These error conditions can be returned by pvm_gsize

       PvmSysErr
              pvmd was not started or has crashed.

       PvmBadParam
              giving an invalid group name.
