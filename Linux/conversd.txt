NAME
       conversd - Hessu's Tampa Ping-Pong conversd URO modified

SYNOPSIS
       conversd [-f] [-t]

DESCRIPTION
       This is the Ping-Pong conversd, derived from WAMPES' conversd by Dieter Deyke <deyke@mdddhd.fc.hp.com>. It is also used in the Internet for ham radio conversation groups.

       The "standard" TCP port to be used with conversd is 3600. You can change this using the Port directive in the configuration file.

OPTIONS
       -f              By  default,  conversd makes itself a daemon by forking itself to the background automatically. The -f parameter disables this behaviour, which can be useful if you need to run it from
                       inittab (respawn) or a looping shell script to restart it after it dies in bugs.

       -t              Runs conversd in try-only mode. Reads configuration file, does all initialization, and dies immediately after that. Does not bind the port, accept connections or start linking.  Useful
                       for verifying if your configuration is valid after changes, before killing off the running copy and starting a new one.
