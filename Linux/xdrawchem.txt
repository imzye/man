NAME
       xdrawchem - open-source chemical structures editor similar to ChemDraw

SYNOPSIS

       xdrawchem [INPUT-FILE] [OPTION(S)...] [OUTPUT-FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       xdrawchem is a program that attempts to duplicate the functionality of ChemDraw, a molecule structure drawing application. It operates in much the same fashion, and should be highly familiar to
       users of ChemDraw.

       The currently packaged version is a fork of the original package; it is maintained by Yaman Qalieh <https://gitlab.com/yamanq>, see the copyright file.

       xdrawchem has file compatibility with Chemdraw and MDL files. It can also create images in popular formats like PNG and EPS.

OPTIONS
       xdrawchem accepts the following options:

       -png OUTPUT-FILE
          Create a PNG image of an input file and exit.

       -t -png OUTPUT-FILE
          Create a transparent PNG image of an input file and exit.

       -3d OUTPUT-FILE
          Create a Make 3D model of input file and output a MDL mofile.

       -h, --help
          Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
          Show version of program.
