APTITUDE-ROBOT-SESSION(8)                                                                      User Commands                                                                      APTITUDE-ROBOT-SESSION(8)

NAME
       aptitude-robot-session - call aptitude-robot non-interactively

SYNOPSIS
       aptitude-robot-session

DESCRIPTION
       aptitude-robot-session is a helper script meant to be run from cron or init scripts.  It will call aptitude-robot with some options suitable for non-interactive use.  It will also redirect all
       output (STDERR and STDOUT) to LOGFILE defined in "/etc/default/aptitude-robot".

CONFIGURATION
       There are a few configuration options that can be defined in "/etc/default/aptitude-robot".

       LOGFILE
           the name of the file where all the output of aptitude-robot is collected.  Defaults to "/var/log/aptitude-robot.log"

       LOG_SESSION
           the  name  of  the  file  where  the  session log is accumulated.  aptitude-robot-session will append its PID to this file in order not to overwrite a log file left over from a crashed earlier
           invocation.  If aptitude-robot-session finishes properly it will append the session log to LOGFILE and delete the session log.

       SESSION_REPORT_COMMAND
           optional command invoked with the session log as the only argument at the end of an aptitude-robot-session run.  This can be used  to  file  reports  to  monitoring  systems  or  support  mail
           addresses.

       MAX_LOGFILES_SIZE_BLOCKS
           file  size  limit  in  blocks  for  the  session log.  This prevents endless loops if a package installation continues to ask the same question for which no terminal is available to provide an
           answer.

           But be aware that this limit also affects _all_ daemons started or restarted during the aptitude-robot-session run, including e.g. the OpenSSH daemon which again will propagate  the  limit  to
           its remote login sessions. Use with care.

       POST_SESSION_HOOK
           a command that is run at the end of a successful aptitude-robot-session.  E.g., use it for apt-get clean.

EXIT STATUS
       aptitude-robot-session exits with 0 on success, 1 if dpkg is locked, 2 if apt failed to fetch some APT repositories.

BUGS
       The non-interactive nature of aptitude-robot-session may trigger the condition reported in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/aptitude/+bug/257279
