NAME
       html2textrc - formatting properties file for html2text(1)

SYNOPSIS
       Key [ = | : ] Value

DESCRIPTION
       The html2textrc(5) file defines a set of formatting properties used by the html2text(1) utility, that overrides the program's built-in formatting defaults.  Each line of the html2textrc(5) file is
       either a formatting property or a comment.

       Lines  with  a  leading  "#" or "!" (i.e. the first non-space character is a "#" or a "!")  and blank lines (i.e. a line consisting only of white-space characters), are considered comments and ig‐
       nored.  Everything else is literary interpreted by the parser as a formatting property, where a string-type property value may also be empty (unsets default value).  Both, the property key and the
       property value, may contain C-style escape sequences to mask meta characters.

       A property definition line consists of:

       (1)    Optional leading space,

       (2)    the property key (a sequence of non-space characters except "=" and ":") as described below,

       (3)    an optional space,

       (4)    an optional "=" or ":",

       (5)    optional space,

       (6)    the property value as described below.
              Everything up to the next newline is interpreted literary as the value of the specified element. Literary meant leading white-space must be quoted with backslashes (i.e. "\ "). Be aware not
              to include unwanted trailing white-space characters.

OPTIONS
       The following is the list of valid formatting properties, together with their default values. If the -style command line option of html2text(1) is used, different default values apply.

       Curly braces indicate alternatives, e.g.  {A B}C stands for AC or BC.

       DOCUMENT.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after, and how many blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right of the formatted document.  (Numeric.)

       BODY.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Same for the document body. (Since the document body is currently the only document part that is rendered, it is virtually the same whether you specify DOCUMENT or BODY).  (Numeric.)

       {OL UL DIR MENU DL}.vspace.{before between after} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before a list, between the individual list items, and after the list.  (Numeric.)

       {OL UL DIR MENU}.indents = 6
              Specifies by how deep list items are indented. If an item bullet would not fit into the space created by the indentation, then the indentation is automatically increased such that the  bul‐
              let  fits in (relevant for relatively wide bullets, e.g. roman numbers).  If N blank-separated integers are specified instead of one, then the first N-1 integers specify indentation for the
              first N-1 list nesting levels, while the last integer specifies the indentation for nesting levels N and higher.  (Numeric.)

       {UL DIR}.default_types = DISC CIRCLE SQUARE
              Specifies the default list type (i.e. the bullet style), if the HTML list tag does not specify an explicit type. Legal values are NO_BULLET, DISC, SQUARE, CIRCLE, CUSTOM1, CUSTOM2 and  CUS‐
              TOM3.  If more than one value is specified, then the values apply for the respective list nesting levels (see indents).  (Option.)

       MENU.default_types = NO_BULLET
              Same for <MENU>, but here the default is NO_BULLET.  (Option.)

       LI.{disc square circle custom1 custom2 custom3}_bullet = {* # o + - ~}
              Specifies the strings used as list item bullets.  (String.)

       {DT DD}.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after, and how many blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right of each <DT> or <DD> element.  (Numeric.)

       HR.marker = =
              Specifies the character to use for horizontal rules.  (String.)

       HR.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after, and how many blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right of the horizontal rule.  (Numeric.)

       {H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6}.prefix = {****** ***** **** *** ** *}
              Specifies how headings are decorated with a prefix. (The default values have a trailing blank, e.g. "****** ".)  (String.)

       {H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6}.suffix = {****** ***** **** *** ** *}
              Specifies how headings are decorated with a suffix. (The default values have a leading blank, e.g. "\ ******".)  (String.)

       {H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6}.vspace.{before after} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after headings.  (Numeric.)

       {PRE P}.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after, and how many blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right of these items.  (Numeric.)

       {BLOCKQUOTE ADDRESS}.{vspace.{before after} indent.{left right}} = {0 0 5 5}
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after, and how many blank columns are inserted to the left and to the right of these items.  (Numeric.)

       BLOCKQUOTE.prefix =
              Specifies a prefix to use for each nested level of BLOCKQUOTEs.  This can be used as e.g. "> " to emulate email replies.  Works best with indent.left set to 0.

       TABLE.vspace.{before after} = 0
              Specifies how many blank lines are inserted before and after tables.  (Numeric.)

       {H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6}.attributes = BOLD
              Specifies the cell attributes for headings. The value is a sequence of NONE, BOLD, UNDERLINE and STRIKETHROUGH.  (Option.)

       {TT I BIG SMALL SUB SUP DFN CODE SAMP KBD CITE}.attributes = NONE
              Specifies the cell attributes for these text items.  Legal values are: NONE, BOLD, UNDERLINE or STRIKETHROUGH.  (Option.)

       U.attributes = UNDERLINE
              Same for <U> elements, but with a different default value.  (Option.)

       {B EM STRONG}.attributes = BOLD
              Same for these elements, but with a different default value.  (Option.)

       STRIKE.attributes = STRIKETHROUGH
              Same for <STRIKE> elements, but with a different default value.  (Option.)

       A.attributes.{internal_link external_link} = UNDERLINE
              Specifies  the  cell  attributes  for links. A link is an <A> element that has an "HREF" attribute. An internal link is a link whose "HREF" attribute starts with a hash character (e.g.  "<A
              href="#42">").  Legal values are again NONE, BOLD, UNDERLINE and STRIKETHROUGH.  (Option.)

       IMG.replace.{all noalt} = unset
              Specifies the string used to replace all <IMG> elements, or those without an "ALT" attribute set.  (String.)

       IMG.alt.{prefix suffix} = {[ ]}
              Specifies how the values (if any) of IMG elements' "ALT" attributes are marked.  (String.)
