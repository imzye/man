X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry(3pm)                                                 User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                 X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry(3pm)

NAME
       X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry - an interface to Freedesktop.org .desktop files.

SYNOPSIS
               use X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry;

               my $entry = X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry->new_from_data($data);

               print $entry->get_value('Name');

               print $entry->Exec;

               $entry->set_value('Name', 'Example Program');

               print $entry->as_string;

               $entry->reset;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an object-oriented interface to files that comply with the Freedesktop.org desktop entry specification. You can query the file for available values, modify them, and also get
       locale information as well.

CONSTRUCTOR
       X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry doesn't have the standard "new()" constructor.  This allows subclasses to implement their own backend-specific constructor without needing to re-implement the
       constructor, which can be a pain (for an example subclass that uses Gnome2::VFS as a backend, see the "PerlPanel::DesktopEntry" module in the PerlPanel distribution).

               my $entry = X11::FreeDesktop::DesktopEntry->new_from_data($data);

       If there is an error reading or parsing the data, the constructor will "carp()" and return an undefined value.

METHODS
               $entry->is_valid($locale);

       Returns a true or false valid depending on whether the required keys exist for the given $locale. A list of the required keys can be found in the Freedesktop.org specification. If $locale is
       omitted, it will default to '"C"'.

               my @groups = $entry->groups;

       This returns an array of scalars containing the group names included in the file. Groups are defined by a line like the following in the file itself:

               [Desktop Entry]

       A valid desktop entry file will always have one of these, at the top.

               $entry->has_group($group);

       Returns true or false depending on whether the file has a section with the name of $group.

               my @keys = $entry->keys($group, $locale);

       Returns an array of the available keys in $group and the $locale locale.  Both these values revert to defaults if they're undefined. When $locale is defined, the array will be folded in with the
       keys from '"C"', since locales inherit keys from the default locale. See the "get_value()" method for another example of this inheritance.

               $entry->has_key($key, $group);

       Returns true or false depending on whether the file has a key with the name of $key in the $group section. If $group is omitted, then the default group ('Desktop Entry') will be used.

               my @locales = $entry->locales($key, $group);

       Returns an array of strings naming all the available locales for the given $key. If $key or $group don't exist in the file, this method will "carp()" and return undef. There should always be at
       least one locale in the returned array - the default locale, '"C"'.

               my $string = $entry->get_value($key, $group, $locale);

       Returns the value of the key named by $key. $group is optional, and will be set to the default if omitted (see above). $locale is also optional, and defines the locale for the string (defaults to
       '"C"' if omitted). If the requested key does not exist for a non-default $locale of the form "xx_YY", then the module will search for a value for the "xx" locale. If nothing is found, this method
       will attempt to return the value for the '"C"' locale. If this value does not exist, this method will return undef.

               $entry->set_value($key, $value, $locale, $group);

       This method sets the value of the $key key in the $locale locale and $group group to be $value. If $locale and $group are omitted, the defaults are used. $value is always interpreted as a string.
       This method always returns true.

               my $data = $entry->as_string;

       This method returns a scalar containing the full entry in .desktop format. This data can then be used to write the entry to disk.

               $entry->reset;

       This method restores the entry to its initial state - it undoes any changes made to the values stored in the entry.

CONVENIENCE METHODS
               my $name                = $entry->Name($locale);
               my $generic_name        = $entry->GenericName($locale);
               my $comment             = $entry->Comment($locale);
               my $type                = $entry->Type($locale);
               my $icon                = $entry->Icon($locale);
               my $exec                = $entry->Exec($locale);
               my $url                 = $entry->URL($locale);
               my $startup_notify      = $entry->StartupNotify($locale);

       These methods are shortcuts for the mostly commonly accessed fields from a desktop entry file. If undefined, $locale reverts to the default.

NOTES
       Please note that according to the Freedesktop.org spec, key names are case-sensitive.
