NAME
       rebar - Sophisticated build-tool for Erlang projects that follows OTP principles

SYNOPSIS
       rebar [-h] [-c] [-v <verbose>] [-V] [-f] [-D <defines>] [-j <jobs>] [-C <config>] [-p] [var=value,...] <command,...>

DESCRIPTION
       rebar is an Erlang build tool that makes it easy to compile and test Erlang applications, port drivers and releases.

       rebar  is  a  self-contained  Erlang script, so it's easy to distribute or even embed directly in a project. Where possible, rebar uses standard Erlang/OTP conventions for project structures, thus
       minimizing the amount of build configuration work. rebar also provides dependency management, enabling application writers to easily re-use common libraries from a variety of locations  (git,  hg,
       etc).
