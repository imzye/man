NAME
       arcls - list files or directories

DESCRIPTION
       The arcls command is used for listing files in grid storage elements and file index catalogues.

SYNOPSIS
       arcls [options] url

OPTIONS
       -l, --long
              long  format (like ls -l). The name of the object is followed by these elements: filetype of object, size in bytes, modification time, checksum and access latency (ONLINE or NEARLINE). The ele‐
              ments for which information is available is protocol-dependent.

       -L, --locations
              show URLs of file locations (replicas) registered in index services.

       -m, --metadata
              list all available metadata.

       -r, --recursive
              operate recursively

       -D, --depth=level
              operate recursively up to specified level

       -n, --nolist
              show only description of requested object, do not list content of directories (like ls -d).

       -f, --forcelist
              treat requested object as directory and always try to list content

       -c, --checkaccess
              check readability of object. Retrieving and showing information about object is suppressed.

       -P, --listplugins
              list the available plugins (protocols supported)

       -t, --timeout=seconds
              timeout in seconds (default 20)

       -z, --conffile=filename
              configuration file (default ~/.arc/client.conf)

       -d, --debug=debuglevel
              FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE or DEBUG

       -v, --version
              print version information

       -?, --help
              print help

ARGUMENTS
       url    the location to list

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The arcls command lists files and directories on grid storage elements and in file index catalogues. Depending on the installed libraries (check with -P ), the following protocols may  be  used:  file
       (file://  prefix  may  be omitted), http, https, httpg, ftp, gsiftp, srm, root.

       In the case of a directory/fileset, attributes of objects belonging to it will be retrieved, unless --nolist is specified.

       If  url  starts from '@', the remainder should be a path to a local file containing list of URLs, one per line. Then arcls acts as if it was called multiple times, once for each URL. For more informa‐
       tion on ARC URL syntax please read "Protocols, Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and Extensions Supported in ARC" [NORDUGRID-TECH-7]

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       X509_USER_PROXY
              The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard location.

       ARC_LOCATION
              The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not specified the install location will be determined from the path to the command being executed, and if this fails  a
              WARNING will be given stating the location which will be used.

       ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
              The  location  of  ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The default location is $ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc (\ in
              Windows).

EXAMPLE
       arcls -l gsiftp://example.com/grid/file.dat
