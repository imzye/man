Getopt::Complete::Options(3pm)                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                      Getopt::Complete::Options(3pm)

NAME
       Getopt::Complete::Options - a command-line options specification

VERSION
       This document describes Getopt::Complete 0.26

SYNOPSIS
       This is used internally by Getopt::Complete during compile.

        my $opts = Getopt::Complete::Options->new(
           'myfile=s' => 'f',
           'mydir=s@'  => 'd',
           '<>' => ['one','two','three']
        );

        $opts->option_names;
        # myfile mydir

        $opts->option_spec("mydir")
        # '=s@'

        $opts->option_handler("myfile")
        # 'f'

        $opts->option_handler("<>")
        # ['one','two','three'];

        $opts->handle_shell_completion;
        # if it detects it is talking to the shell completer, it will respond and then exit

        # this method is used by the above, then makes a Getopt::Complete::Args.
        ($text_typed,$option_name,$remainder_of_argv) = $self->parse_completion_request($comp_words,$comp_cword);

DESCRIPTION
       Objects of this class are used to construct a Getop::Complete::Args from a list of command-line arguments.  It specifies what options are available to the command line, helping to direct the
       parser.

       It also specifies what values are valid for those options, and provides an API for access by the shell to do tab-completion.

       The valid values list is also used by Getopt::Complete::Args to validate its option values, and produce the error list it generates.
