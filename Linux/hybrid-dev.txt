NAME
       mbuild-hybrid — easily build ircd-hybrid v7 modules from source

SYNOPSIS
       mbuild-hybrid [-s sourcefile]  [-p installpath]  [-o buildopts]

DESCRIPTION
       mbuild-hybrid  is a program that simplifies compiling ircd-hybrid modules from source. One may specify output path and CFLAGS to use when building a module; the defaults for each are described be‐
       low.

       It goes without saying that mbuild-hybrid won't run without something in the -s option.

OPTIONS
       -s sourcefile
                 Source file to build the module with. The output filename will be this name, s/.c/.so/.

       -p installpath
                 Install path for the module. This defauls to /usr/lib/ircd-hybrid/modules, the module search path for Debian's ircd-hybrid.

       -o buildopts
                 This should be quoted if more than one argument; this will be appended to the default CFLAGS, which are simply '-g -Wall '.
