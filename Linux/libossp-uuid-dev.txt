NAME
       uuid-config — OSSP uuid API build utility

SYNOPSIS
       uuid-config [--help] [--version] [--prefix] [--exec-prefix] [--bindir] [--libdir] [--includedir] [--mandir] [--datadir] [--acdir] [--cflags] [--ldflags] [--libs]

DESCRIPTION
       The  uuid-config  program  is a little helper utility for easy configuring and building of applications based on the uuid(3) library.  It can be used to query the C compiler and linker flags which
       are required to correctly compile and link the application against the uuid(3) library.

       OSSP uuid also ships pkg-config(1) definition (as ossp-uuid.pc).  Use that instead.

OPTIONS
       --help         Prints the short usage information.
       --version      Prints the version number and date of the installed uuid(3) library.
       --prefix       Prints the installation prefix of architecture independent files
       --exec-prefix  Prints the installation prefix of architecture dependent files.
       --bindir       Prints the installation directory of binaries.
       --libdir       Prints the installation directory of libraries.
       --includedir   Prints the installation directory of include headers.
       --mandir       Prints the installation directory of manual pages.
       --datadir      Prints the installation directory of shared data.
       --acdir        Prints the installation directory of autoconf data.
       --cflags       Prints the C compiler flags which are needed to compile the uuid(3)-based application.  The output is usually added to the CFLAGS uuidiable of the applications Makefile.
       -ldflags       Prints the linker flags (-L) which are needed to link the application with the uuid(3) library.  The output is usually added to the LDFLAGS uuidiable of the applications Makefile.
       -libs          Prints the library flags (-l) which are needed to link the application with the C uuid(3) library.  The output is usually added to the LIBS uuidiable of the applications Makefile.

EXAMPLES
       CC      = cc
       CFLAGS  = -O `uuid-config --cflags`
       LDFLAGS = `uuid-config --ldflags`
       LIBS    = -lm `uuid-config --libs`

       all: foo
       foo: foo.o
               $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
       foo.o: foo.c
               $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
