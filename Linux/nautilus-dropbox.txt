DESCRIPTION
       The dropbox command provides a command line interface to the Dropbox, the easiest online file storage, synchronization and sharing service.

COMMANDS
       dropbox update
              Downloads the latest version of dropbox.

       dropbox filestatus [-l] [-a] [FILE]...
              Prints the current status of each FILE.

              options:
                -l --list  Prints out information in a format similar to ls. Works best when your console supports color :)
                -a --all   Do not ignore entries starting with "."

              Aliases: stat

       dropbox ls [FILE]...
              This is an alias for filestatus -l

       dropbox puburl FILE
              Prints out a public url for FILE (which must be in your public folder).

       dropbox sharelink FILE
              Prints out a shared link for FILE.

       dropbox proxy MODE [TYPE] [HOST] [PORT] [USERNAME] [PASSWORD]
              Set proxy settings for Dropbox.

              MODE - one of "none", "auto", "manual"
              TYPE - one of "http", "socks4", "socks5" (only valid with "manual" mode)
              HOST - proxy hostname (only valid with "manual" mode)
              PORT - proxy port (only valid with "manual" mode)
              USERNAME - (optional) proxy username (only valid with "manual" mode)
              PASSWORD - (optional) proxy password (only valid with "manual" mode)

       dropbox throttle DOWNLOAD UPLOAD
              Set bandwidth limits for file sync.

              DOWNLOAD - either "unlimited" or a manual limit in KB/s
              UPLOAD - one of "unlimited", "auto", or a manual limit in KB/s

       dropbox status
              Prints out the current status of the Dropbox daemon.

       dropbox running
              Returns 1 if running, and 0 if not running.

       dropbox stop
              Stops the Dropbox daemon.

       dropbox lansync [y/n]
              options:
                y  Dropbox will use LAN sync (default)
                n  Dropbox will not use LAN sync

       dropbox exclude [list]dropbox exclude add [DIRECTORY] [DIRECTORY] ...
              dropbox exclude remove [DIRECTORY] [DIRECTORY] ...

              "list" prints a list of directories currently excluded from syncing.
              "add" adds one or more directories to the exclusion list, then
              resynchronizes Dropbox.
              "remove" removes one or more directories from the exclusion list, then
              resynchronizes Dropbox.

              With no arguments, executes "list".

              Any specified path must be within Dropbox.

       dropbox start [-i]
              Starts the Dropbox daemon, dropboxd. If dropboxd is already running,
              this will do nothing.

              options:
                -i --install  auto install dropboxd if not available on the system

       dropbox autostart [y/n]
              options:
                n  Dropbox will not start automatically at login
                y  Dropbox will start automatically at login (default)

              Note: May only work on current Ubuntu distributions.

       dropbox version
              Prints the version information for the Dropbox proprietary daemon, if
              it's installed, and the Dropbox command-line interface.

       dropbox help [COMMAND]
              With no arguments, print a list of commands and a short description of
              each. With a command, print descriptive help on how to use the
              command.

BUGS
       There are currently no known bugs. If you think you have found a bug or have a feature request, post in the forums, or send us an e-mail (see the RESOURCES section below).
