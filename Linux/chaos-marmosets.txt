NAME
       seg-fault - try to write to address zero and crash

SYNOPSIS
       seg-fault

DESCRIPTION
       seg-fault  tries  write  to  address  zero  and  will trigger a segmentation fault (signal 11).  It is useful to test the process core dump configuration.  See the Linux kernel sysctl setting ker‐
       nel.core_pattern and fs.suid_dumpable for more information.  In case of using a bug reporting system like apport, this program allows testing reporting the crash and retracing it.

OPTIONS
       This program takes no options.
