NAME
       dose-ceve - parse package metadata

SYNOPSIS
       dose-ceve [-h] [-v] [-c pkgspec] [-r pkgspec] [--depth=n] [-T format] [-G graph type] [-o filename] input-spec [input-spec...]

DESCRIPTION
       Dose-ceve is a generalized metadata parser. It reads package specifications, extracts package metadata from them, performs some manipulations, and outputs the package metadata in one of several
       formats.

       input-spec is a url specifying the input format and the file to get the input from. For a possible list of schemes, see the -t parameter.

       Some examples of URLs:

       .   deb://Packages.gz (the Debian file packages.gz in the current directory)

       .   cudf:///home/examples/cudf/test.cudf (the CUDF file /home/examples/cudf/test.cudf)

OPTIONS
   MISC OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               This option displays the help message.

       -v, --verbose
               Be verbose. This option can be repeated for more verbosity.

       --version
               Show program's version and exit.

       --progress
               Print progress bars.

       --timers
               Print timing information.

       --quiet Do no print any messages.

   INPUT OPTIONS
       Dose3 accepts files compressed with gzip(1) or bzip2(1), depending on compile-time options.

       -t input-spec
               Select the input type. Possible values are:

       .       cudf Cudf file format

       .       pef PEF file format. The PEF format (Package Exchange Format) is a generic 822 file format used to encode package dependencies. deb, opam, debsrc and edsp are all based on the pef format

       .       csw OpenCSW Solaris packages binary format

       .       opam Opam Package universe in Opam/PEF format. This format is a 822 textual format encoding the opam universe.

       .       deb for Debian binary package files, also known as Packages files.

       .       debsrc for Debian source package files, also knows as Sources files.

       .       edsp apt-get External Dependency Solver Protocol

       .       hdlist RPM hdlists. Binary file format.

       .       synthesis urpmi synthesis hdlists. XML Based format

       --trim  Consider only installable packages.

       --latest n
               Consider only the latest -n most recent versions of each package, older versions of packages are ignored.

       -c, --cone=vpkglist
               The match of an atomic dependency (a package name p possibly together with a version constraint c) is the set of all packages in the repository with name p, and a version that satisfies the
               constraint c.  The dependency cone of a package p is the set of all matches of all atomic dependencies of p, together with their respective dependency cones. The package specification pkgspec
               is a list of packages (separated by a semicolon), where each package is specified as follows: (name,version).

               This option extracts the union of the dependency cones of all packages selected by vpkglist.

               Example: =over 12

       -c 'golang-golang-x-tools (= 1:0.0~git20150716.0.87156cb+dfsg1-4),golang-golang-x-tools-dev'
       -r, --rcone=vpkglist
               Using the same syntax as in -c, this option use the reverse dependency relation to make the transitive closure.

       --depth n
               In combination with the -c or -r options, this specifies the maximum depth for the transitive closure.

       --request installation-request
               Specifies an installation request of the form "install: vpkglist" or "remove: vpkglist" or "upgrade: vpkglist" where vpkglist is a list of (real) packages possibly associated with a
               constraint. Ex.: bash (< 2.0), exim (= 3.1-debian1). This option can be repeated to specify install, remove and upgrade actions.

               Examples:

               --request "install: bash (< 2.0), exim (= 3.1-debian1)" --request "upgrade: apt-cudf"

   OUTPUT OPTIONS
       -o, --outfile=filename
               Instead of stdout, send output to the file filename.

       -d, --outdir=directory
               Set the output directory (default current directory)

       --dot   Save the explanation graph (one for each package) in dot format.

       -G graph type
               Specifies the graph type format to compute. This option must be used together with the option -T dot|gml|grml. Default is syn. Possible values are:

       .       syn for the syntactic graph where disjunctions nodes and conflicts are explicitly added to the graph.

       .       pkg for the package graph where all dependencies are threated uniformely and conflicts are not added to the graph.

       .       strdeps the strong dependency graph. A package p strong depends on q iff p cannot be installed if q is not installed.

       .       strcnf

       .       conj the conjunctive graph where only conjunctive dependencies are considered.

       .       dom

       -T format
               Specifies the output format to use. Default is cnf. Possible values are:

       .       cnf output in CNF format.

       .       dimacs output in DIMACS format for CNF formulae.

       .       cudf pretty-printed output in an RFC 822-like format

       .       deb binary packages in deb822 format.

       .       debsrc source packages in deb822 format.

       .       dot a graph in Dot/GraphViz format.

       .       gml a graph in GML format.

       .       grml a graph in GraphML format.

       .       table plain text output of three integer values: the universe size, the number of edges in the dependency graph, the number of conflicts in the universe.

   DEBIAN SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Multi-arch annotations are handled by dose-ceve. Packages whose's architecture is neither the native architecture nor in the list of foreign architectures (see below) are ignored.

       --deb-native-arch=name
               Specify the native architecture. The default behavior is to deduce the native architecture from the first package stanza in the input that has an architecture different from all.

       --deb-foreign-archs=name [,name] ...
               Specify a comma-separated list of foreign architectures. The default is an empty list of foreign architectures.

       --deb-ignore-essential
               By default all essential package are considered as a dependency of all packages in the universe. This option allows the user to ignore essential packages.

       --deb-host-arch=name
               Native/cross compile host architecture, defaults to native architecture.

       --deb-builds-from
               Add builds-from relationship of binary packages on source packages as dependency. This allows one to create graphs for bootstrapping purposes.

       -P, --deb-profiles=name[,name...]
               Comma separated list of activated build profiles.

       --deb-drop-b-d-indep
               Drop Build-Depends-Indep dependencies from Debian source packages.

       --deb-drop-b-d-arch
               Drop Build-Depends-Arch dependencies from Debian source packages.

EXAMPLES
       Find all the reverse binary dependencies of the package patchutils:

               dose-ceve --deb-native-arch amd64 -r patchutils -T deb \
                       deb:///var/lib/apt/lists/*_dists_sid_main_binary-amd64_Packages \
                       | grep-dctrl -n -s Package '' | sort -u

       Find all the source packages that (directly or indirectly) build depend on patchutils:

               dose-ceve -T debsrc --deb-native-arch=amd64 -r patchutils \
                       debsrc:///var/lib/apt/lists/*_dists_sid_main_source_Sources \
                       deb:///var/lib/apt/lists/*_dists_sid_main_binary-amd64_Packages \
                       | grep-dctrl -n -s Package '' | sort -u

       Find the source packages (-T debsrc) that have in a relation builds-from with all the binary package in the reverse dependency cone of libssl-dev (a specific version constraint).

         dose-ceve --deb-builds-from --deb-native-arch=amd64 -T debsrc \
         -r 'libssl-dev (>= 0.9.8)' deb://Sid-amd64-Packages-050812.bz2 \
         debsrc://Sid-Sources-050812.bz2
