NAME
       Statistics::R::Legacy - Legacy methods for Statistics::R

DESCRIPTION
       Do not use this module directly. Use Statistics::R instead.

       This module contains legacy methods for Statistics::R. They are provided solely so that code that uses older versions of Statistics::R does not crash with recent version. Do not use these methods
       in new code!

       Some of these legacy methods simply had their name changed, but some others were changed to do nothing and return only single value because it did not make sense to keep these methods as
       originally intended anymore.

METHODS
       startR()
           This is the same thing as start().

       stopR()
           This is the same thing as stop().

       restartR()
           This is the same thing as restart().

       Rbin()
           This is the same thing as bin().

       start_sharedR() / start_shared()
           Use the shared option of new() instead.

       send / read() / receive()
           Use run() instead.

       lock()
           Does nothing anymore.

       unlock()
           Does nothing anymore.

       is_blocked() / is_locked()
           Return 0.

       error()
           Return the empty string.

       clean_up()
