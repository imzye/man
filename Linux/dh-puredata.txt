NAME
       dh_puredata_substvar - generate substitution variables for a Pd external package

SYNOPSIS
       dh_puredata_substvar [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_puredata_substvar generates the substitution variables "${puredata:Depends}", "${puredata:Recommends}" and "${puredata:Suggests}", as well as "${puredata:Provides}".  Useful for creating Debian
       packages for Pd-externals.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7), dh(1)

       This program is meant to be used together with debhelper for Debian packages derived from Pd externals packages.  It is recommended to enable it by adding the dh-sequence-puredata virtual package
       to Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Arch or Build-Depends-Indep.  This is equivalent to adding dh-puredata to the same field and adding --with=puredata to the dh sequencer in debian/rules, except that
       only -arch/-indep/profiled builds are affected.  This is also slightly more simple in the most common case.
