CONFIGURATION FILE
       Options presented above can be set inside a configuration file named .ruby-beautify. It can be placed anywhere up in the directory tree. Options need to be separated by a new line and options that

HISTORY
       The original analyzer that ruby-beautify was based on is available at: http://www.arachnoid.com/ruby/rubyBeautifier.html.

       Original work is based on sublime-text2 plugin: https://github.com/CraigWilliams/BeautifyRuby which was cleaned up and made suitable for use directly in a shell.

       Ruby-beautify was recently re-written to use the stdlib ripper gem to do the lexical analyzing. Consequently all of the old legacy code was dropped.
