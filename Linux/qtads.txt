NAME
       QTads - Multimedia interpreter for TADS games

SYNOPSIS
       qtads [ game-file ]

DESCRIPTION
       QTads  is an interpreter that can run games written in TADS. TADS is a programming language written by Michael J. Roberts, designed to implement text-adventure games (Interactive Fiction), similar
       to those developed by Infocom in 1980-1990, as well as other companies (like Legend Entertainment, Level 9, etc). If you liked games like "Zork", "Adventure", "Trinity",  or  "Eric  the  Unready",
       you'll feel right at home.

       This version of QTads supports both TADS versions in use today; traditional TADS 2 as well as the new TADS 3 format. It runs on a variety of systems, including MS Windows and every Unix system for
       which the Qt library is available, including Linux and Mac OSX.

OPTIONS
       With no arguments, QTads will by default ask you for a filename, unless this prompting has been disabled in the configuration dialog.

       The optional filename can be used to start a game immediately.
