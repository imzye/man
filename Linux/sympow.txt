NAME
       sympow - SYMPOW program

SYNOPSIS
       sympow [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Mathematical package to compute special values of SYMmetric POWer elliptic curve L-functions (up to about 64 digits of precision).

OPTIONS
       -bound #
              an upper BOUND for how many ap to compute

       -info [] []
              only report local information for primes/sympows 1st argument is prime range, 2nd is sympow range

       -local only report local information (bad primes)

       -curve []
              input a curve in [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6] form

       -label []
              get a label to the given curve

       -quiet turn off some messages

       -terse turn on some messages: default

       -verbose
              turn on extra messages

       -rootno #
              compute the root number of the #th symmetric power

       -moddeg
              compute the modular degree

       -analrank
              compute the analytic rank

       -sloppy []
              for use with -analrank; have X sloppy digits

       -nocm  abort if curve has complex multiplication

       -noqt  ignore even powers of non-minimal quad twists

       -noqdcheck
              don't check if quad-double stuff works

       -mdspeed []
              speed for moddeg; 2.0 is default, 0.0 is proof

       -hecke compute Hecke symmetric powers for a CM curve

       -maxtable
              set the max size of factor tables: 2^27 default

       -sp [] argument to specify which powers this is a comma separated list in each entry, the 1st datum is the sympow then could come b which turns Bloch-Kato on then could come w# which specifies how
              many  tests  then could come s# which says # sloppy digits then must come p# which specifices the precision or P# which says ignore BOUND for this power then must come d# which says the de‐
              rivative bound or D# which says do only this derivative (neither need be indicated for even powers) default is 2w3s1p32,3bp16d1,4p8

       -new_data []
              will compute inverse Mellin transform mesh for the given data: the format is [sp]d[dv]{h,c} sp is the symmetric power, dv is the derivative, h indicates Hecke powers,  and  c  indicates  CM
              case d[dv] is given only for odd or Hecke powers Examples: 1d3 2 2d1h 3d2 4 4c 5d0 6 7d0h 11d1 12c NOTE: new_data runs a shell script that uses GP

       -dump-endiantuple
              display the endian-tuple, used as a component in the binary data paths, and exit

       -dump-versiontuple display the version-tuple (Major.minor.micro) and exit

       -version
              print program version and exit

       -help  display this help and exit

       Other options are used internally/recursively by -new_data
