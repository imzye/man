NAME
       flblocks - the fltk block attack! game

SYNOPSIS
       Blocks  is a FLTK-based block elimination game. Stacks of colored blocks move from right to left as you try to eliminate groups of adjacent blocks by clicking on them. As the game progresses, more
       colors are added (up to a maximum of 7) and the blocks move faster and faster.

GAME PLAY
       Press the spacebar to start a game. As the blocks move across the window, click on groups of two or more blocks to clear them - the larger the number of adjacent blocks,  the  greater  the  score.
       Clicking  on  a block containing a dark ball will clear all blocks of that color, however you will score much fewer points than a normal click. The game is over when the blocks reach the left side
       of the window.

       Press the spacebar to pause the game.
