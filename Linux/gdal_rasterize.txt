DESCRIPTION
       This program burns vector geometries (points, lines, and polygons) into
       the raster band(s) of a raster image.  Vectors are read from  OGR  sup‐
       ported vector formats.

       Note that on the fly reprojection of vector data to the coordinate sys‐
       tem of the raster data is only supported since GDAL 2.1.0.

       -b <band>
              The band(s) to burn values into.  Multiple -b arguments  may  be
              used  to burn into a list of bands.  The default is to burn into
              band 1.  Not used when creating a new raster.

       -i     Invert rasterization.  Burn the fixed burn value,  or  the  burn
              value  associated  with  the first feature into all parts of the
              image not inside the provided polygon.

       -at    Enables the ALL_TOUCHED rasterization option so that all  pixels
              touched  by lines or polygons will be updated, not just those on
              the line render path, or whose center point is within the  poly‐
              gon.  Defaults to disabled for normal rendering rules.

       -burn <value>
              A  fixed  value  to burn into a band for all objects.  A list of
              -burn options can be supplied, one per band being written to.

       -a <attribute_name>
              Identifies an attribute field on the features to be used  for  a
              burn-in value.  The value will be burned into all output bands.

       -3d    Indicates  that  a  burn  value should be extracted from the "Z"
              values of the feature. Works with points and lines  (linear  in‐
              terpolation  along  each segment).  For polygons, works properly
              only if the are flat (same Z value for all vertices).

       -add   Instead of burning a new value, this adds the new value  to  the
              existing raster.  Suitable for heatmaps for instance.

       -l <layername>
              Indicates the layer(s) from the datasource that will be used for
              input features.  May be specified multiple times, but  at  least
              one layer name or a -sql option must be specified.

       -where <expression>
              An  optional  SQL  WHERE style query expression to be applied to
              select features to burn in from the input layer(s).

       -sql <select_statement>
              An SQL statement to be evaluated against the datasource to  pro‐
              duce a virtual layer of features to be burned in.

       -dialect <dialect>
              SQL  dialect. In some cases can be used to use (unoptimized) OGR
              SQL instead of the native SQL of an RDBMS by passing OGRSQL. The
              "SQLITE" dialect can also be used with any datasource.

              New in version 2.1.

       -of <format>
              Select  the output format. Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not speci‐
              fied, the format is guessed from the extension  (previously  was
              GTiff). Use the short format name.

       -a_nodata <value>
              Assign a specified nodata value to output bands.

       -init <value>
              Pre-initialize  the  output image bands with these values.  How‐
              ever, it is not marked as the nodata value in the  output  file.
              If  only  one  value is given, the same value is used in all the
              bands.

       -a_srs <srs_def>
              Override the projection for the output file. If  not  specified,
              the  projection  of the input vector file will be used if avail‐
              able. When using this option, no reprojection of  features  from
              the  SRS  of the input vector to the specified SRS of the output
              raster, so use only this option to  correct  an  invalid  source
              SRS.  The <srs_def> may be any of the usual GDAL/OGR forms, com‐
              plete WKT, PROJ.4, EPSG:n or a file containing the WKT.

       -to NAME=VALUE
              set a transformer option suitable to pass  to  GDALCreateGenImg‐
              ProjTransformer2().  This is used when converting geometries co‐
              ordinates to target raster pixel space. For example this can  be
              used to specify RPC related transformer options.

              New in version 2.3.

       -co <NAME=VALUE>
              Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can
              be used to control particulars about the file created.  For  in‐
              stance,  the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control
              compression, and whether the file should be tiled.

              The creation options available vary by format driver,  and  some
              simple  formats  have  no creation options at all. A list of op‐
              tions supported for a format can be listed  with  the  --formats
              command  line option but the documentation for the format is the
              definitive source of information  on  driver  creation  options.
              See  raster_drivers format specific documentation for legal cre‐
              ation options for each format.

       -te <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
              Set georeferenced extents. The values must be expressed in  geo‐
              referenced  units.   If  not specified, the extent of the output
              file will be the extent of the vector layers.

       -tr <xres> <yres>
              Set target resolution. The values must be expressed in georefer‐
              enced units.  Both must be positive values.

       -tap   (target  aligned  pixels) Align the coordinates of the extent of
              the output file to the values of the -tr, such that the  aligned
              extent includes the minimum extent.

       -ts <width> <height>
              Set  output  file size in pixels and lines. Note that -ts cannot
              be used with -tr

       -ot <type>
              Force the output bands to be of the  indicated  data  type.  De‐
              faults to Float64

       -optim {[AUTO]/VECTOR/RASTER}}
              Force  the  algorithm  used  (results are identical). The raster
              mode is used in most cases and optimise  read/write  operations.
              The vector mode is useful with a decent amount of input features
              and optimise the CPU use. That mode have to be used  with  tiled
              images  to  be efficient. The auto mode (the default) will chose
              the algorithm based on input and output properties.

              New in version 2.3.

       -q     Suppress progress monitor and other non-error output.

       <src_datasource>
              Any OGR supported readable datasource.

       <dst_filename>
              The GDAL supported output file.  Must support  update  mode  ac‐
              cess.   This  file will be created (or overwritten if it already
              exists):option:-of, -a_nodata, -init,  -a_srs,  -co,  -te,  -tr,
              -tap, -ts, or -ot options are used.

       The  program  create  a  new  target  raster image when any of the -of,
       -a_nodata, -init, -a_srs, -co, -te, -tr, -tap, -ts, or -ot options  are
       used.   The  resolution  or size must be specified using the -tr or -ts
       option for all new rasters.  The target raster will be  overwritten  if
       it already exists and any of these creation-related options are used.

C API
       This utility is also callable from C with GDALRasterize().

       New in version 2.1.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  would burn all polygons from mask.shp into the RGB TIFF
       file work.tif with the color red (RGB = 255,0,0).

          gdal_rasterize -b 1 -b 2 -b 3 -burn 255 -burn 0 -burn 0 -l mask mask.shp work.tif

       The following would burn all "class A" buildings into the output eleva‐
       tion file, pulling the top elevation from the ROOF_H attribute.

          gdal_rasterize -a ROOF_H -where 'class="A"' -l footprints footprints.shp city_dem.tif

       The  following  would  burn  all polygons from footprint.shp into a new
       1000x1000 rgb TIFF as the color red.  Note that -b is not used; the or‐
       der of the -burn options determines the bands of the output raster.

          gdal_rasterize -burn 255 -burn 0 -burn 0 -ot Byte -ts 1000 1000 -l footprints footprints.shp mask.tif
