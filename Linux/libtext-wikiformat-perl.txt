NAME
       Text::WikiFormat::Blocks - blocktypes for Text::WikiFormat

SYNOPSIS
       None.  Use Text::WikiFormat as the public interface, unless you want to create your own block type.

DESCRIPTION
       This module merely creates subclasses of Text::WikiFormat::Block, which is the interesting code.  A block is a collection of related lines, such as a code block (text to display verbatim in a
       monospaced font), a header, an unordered list, an ordered list, and a paragraph (text to display in a proportional font).

       Every block extends "Text::WikiFormat::Block".

METHODS
       The following methods exist:

       •   new( %args )

           Creates and returns a new block.  The valid arguments are:

           •   "text"

               The text of the line found in the block.

           •   "args"

               The arguments captured by the block-identifying regular expression.

           •   "level"

               The level of indentation for the block (usually only useful for list blocks).

           •   "tags"

               The tags in effect for the current type of wiki formatting.

           •   "opts"

               The options in effect for the current type of wiki formatting.

           Use the accessors of the same names to retrieve the values of the attributes.

       •   add_text( @lines_of_text )

           Adds a list of lines of text to the current text for the block.  This is very useful when you encounter a block and want to merge it with the previous block of the same type

       •   add_args( @arguments )

           Adds further arguments to the block; useful when merging blocks.

       •   formatted_text()

           Returns text formatted appropriately for this block.  Blocks don't have to have formatters, but they may.

       •   formatter( $line_of_text )

           Formats the $line using Text::WikiFormat::format_line().  You can add your own formatter here; this is worth overriding.

       •   merge( $next_block )

           Merges  the current block with $next_block (the next block encountered) if they're of the same type and are at the same level.  This adds the text and args of $next_block to the current block.
           It's your responsibility to remove $next_block from whatever your code iterates over.

       •   nests()

           Returns true if this block should nest (as in lists and unordered lists) for the active wiki formatting.

       •   nest( $next_block )

           Nests $next_block under this block if the both nest and if $next_block has a level greater than the current block.  This actually adds $next_block as a text  item  within  the  current  block.
           Beware.
