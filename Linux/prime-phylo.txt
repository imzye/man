NAME
       reconcile - This program outputs the reconciliation that minimizes the number of duplications

SYNOPSIS
       reconcile [OPTIONS] gene-tree species-tree [gene-species-map]

DESCRIPTION
       This program outputs the reconciliation that minimizes the number of duplications

OPTIONS
       --help Display help (this text).

       -V, --version
              Print version and exit

       -r, --reroot any|random|no
              Reroot the tree to minimize the number of implied duplications/losses if the most parsimonious reconciliation is chosen. Default is "no".

       -w --weights FLOAT FLOAT
              Determine  the  relative importance of duplications vs losses. First weight is for duplications and the second for losses. The default is 1.0,0.0 which counts duplications only. Weights are
              required to be positive.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.
