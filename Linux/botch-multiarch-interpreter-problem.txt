NAME
       botch-multiarch-interpreter-problem - find all arch:all packages that allow switching architectures

SYNOPSIS
       botch-multiarch-interpreter-problem [-h] [-v] graph.xml

DESCRIPTION
       Given a package graph, this program outputs a page in plain text format listing all Architecture:all and not Multi-Arch:foreign packages that are on a dependency path between two Architecture:any
       packages.

       More precisely, dose-ceve creates a graph with binary packages and source packages being the nodes and their dependency and provides relationship being the edges. This program prints all nodes (or
       packages) that fulfill the following criteria:

       the package is not Multi-Arch:foreign
       the package is Architecture:all
       the package has a (possibly transitive) predecessor in the dependency graph that is either an Architecture:any binary package or a source package that builds Architecture:any packages
       the package has a (possibly transitive) successor in the dependency graph that is Architecture:any and not Multi-Arch:foreign. Traversal of the successors stops at Multi-Arch:foreign packages.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       -h, --help
           Print help message.

       --packages
           Packages file to retrieve binary package size

       -H, --html
           Output HTML document with additional statistics

EXAMPLE
       The graph created by dose-ceve must not contains Build-Depends-Indep dependencies because source packages do not have to be cross-built to create their Architecture:all packages. These can always be
       retrieved by native compilation. The graph does not have to include builds-from relationships because the Architecture field of source packages is used to determine whether a source package builds
       Architecture:any binary packages.
