NAME
       pmw - a program for typesetting music

SYNOPSIS
       pmw [options] [input file]

DESCRIPTION

       PMW  (Philip's  Music Writer) is a program for typesetting music. It is not an interactive program; instead, it reads a description of the music from a textual input file, which can be prepared by
       any text editor. The output from PMW is a PostScript file of page images of typeset music. This output uses the PMW-Music PostScript font, which must therefore be available for viewing,  printing,
       or converting to PDF by an application such as GhostScript. A secondary output in the form of a MIDI file can be requested.

       A full description of PMW and its markup language is given in the reference manual. This man page just summarizes the command line options.

OPTIONS

       -a4ona3   The pages are A4-sized; print them 2-up, assuming A3 paper.

       -a5ona4   The pages are A5-sized; print them 2-up, assuming A4 paper.

       -a4sideways
                 The paper is A4, but the printer feeds it sideways, so rotate the page images before printing.

       -C <arg>  Show a compile-time option; exit with its value (0 or 1). Possible arguments are:

                   b2pf      suport for B2PF processing
                   musicxml  support for MusicXML input

       -c <number>
                 Arrange to print <number> copies. This number is honoured by PostScript printers. It may not be honoured by other programs that interpret PostScript.

       -d<options>
                 Write general debugging information to stderr. This option is of use only to the program maintainer.

       -dbd [[<movement>,]<stave>,]<bar>
                 Write debugging data for the bar to stderr. This option is of use only to the program maintainer.

       -drawbarlines
                 Instead  of  using  characters  from the music font to print bar lines, generate PostScript drawing instructions. Some PostScript interpreters do not display the font bar line characters
                 correctly on the screen when several of them are used to generate a long vertical line; drawing them instead may give a better result. -dbl is an abbreviation for -drawbarlines.

       -drawstavelines [<thickness>]
                 Instead of using characters from the music font to print stave lines, generate PostScript drawing instructions. Some PostScript interpreters do not display the font stave characters cor‐
                 rectly on the screen; drawing them instead may give a better result. The default thickness of drawn stave lines is 0.3 points, scaled according to relative stave size and overall  magni‐
                 fication. An integer number given with this option specifies the thickness in tenths of a point.  -dsl is an abbreviation for -drawstavelines.

       -dtp <bar>
                 Write  debugging  positioning  data  for the bar to stderr. If there is more than one movement (not likely while debugging at this level), the data is output for every bar with the given
                 number. If the number is -1, data is output for all bars. This option is of use only to the program maintainer.

       -duplex   This option sets the PostScript option for duplex printing (see also -tumble).

       -eps      Write the output as encapsulated PostScript (useful if this is an illustration that is going to be included in some other document).

       -errormaximum <number>
                 Set the maximum number of errors before the program gives up. The default is 40. This option is provided mainly so that an error test can generate a large number of errors. -em is an ab‐
                 breviation for -errormaximum.

       -F <directory-list>
                 Search the given colon-separated list of directories for fontmetrics files, before searching the default directory that was set up  when  PMW  was  built.   These  directories  are  also
                 searched for optional Unicode translation (.utr) files for fonts that do not use Adobe standard encoding, and for any special text fonts (.pfa files) that are requested to be included in
                 the output.

       -f <name> Specifies a format name, used when the input file is set up to output in several different formats.

       -H <file> Use the given file as the PostScript header file, instead of the default that was set up when PMW was built.

       -help or --help
                 Output a list of options, then stop. No file is read.

       -incPMWfont or -incpmwfont or -ipf
                 This  option causes PMW to include the music font within the PostScript output that it generates. (If the PMW-Alpha font is used, that is also included.) If you use this option, there is
                 no need to install the PMW music font(s) for GhostScript (or any other display program) to find.

       -MF <directory>
                 Search the given colon-separated list of directories for PMW's music fonts, before searching the default directory that was set up when PMW was built.

       -MP <file>
                 Use the given file as the MIDIperc file, instead of the default that was set up when PMW was built. This file translates between names and "pitches" for untuned percussion voices.

       -MV <file>
                 Use the given file as the MIDIvoices file, instead of the default that was set up when PMW was built. This file translates voice names to MIDI voice numbers.

       -manualfeed
                 Set the `manualfeed' option in the generated PostScript. Most PostScript printers interpret this to mean that the paper should be taken from an alternate input tray or  slot.  Some  also
                 require the user to push a button before each page is printed.

       -midi <file>
                 Write MIDI output to the given file (in addition to the normal PostScript output). The stave selection (see -s below) also applies to MIDI output.

       -midibars <range>
                 If -midi is given, write only the given bars to the MIDI output. The range can be two numbers separated by a hyphen or a single number for just one bar. A single number followed by a hy‐
                 phen plays from that bar to the end of the movement. -mb is an abbreviation for -midibars.

       -midimovement <number>
                 For  a  multi-movement input file, this specifies the movement that is to be output as MIDI when -midi is given. The default is the first movement.  -mm is an abbreviation for -midimove‐
                 ment.

       -noid     Do not show version number for error output. This is useful to a maintainer when comparing output from different versions.

       -norc or -nopmwrc
                 Do not read the caller's .pmwrc file. This must be the first option given.

       -norepeats
                 When generating a MIDI output file, do not repeat repeated sections of the music. -nr is an abbreviation for -norepeats.

       -nowidechars
                 This option stops PMW from using the 100-point wide stave characters when printing staves. Instead, staves are constructed entirely from the 10-point wide characters. This option is pro‐
                 vided because it seems that some PostScript interpreters cannot deal correctly with the very wide characters. -nw is an abbreviation for -nowidechars. The  -drawstavelines  option  over‐
                 rides this option.

       -o <file> Send  the  output  to the given file, or, if "-" is given, to stdout. The default file name is the input file with the extension ".ps" replacing any existing extension, or being added if
                 there is no extension. If there is no input file (input from stdin) the default output is to stdout.

       -p <list> Output only the specified pages. These can be individual page numbers, or pairs of numbers separated by a hyphen, to specify a range. Use commas to separate items in the list.

       -pamphlet Output pages in pamphlet order. This is usually used in conjunction with -a5ona4 or -a4ona3.

       -printadjust <x> <y>
                 Move the image on the page by (x,y) points.

       -printgutter <x>
                 This option specifies a distance by which righthand (recto) page images are moved to the right, and lefthand (verso) page images are moved to the left, thus creating a "gutter" for bind‐
                 ing when the images are printed doublesided.  The -printgutter setting applies only when pages are being printed 1-up.  It is ignored for any of the 2-up printing styles.

       -printscale <n>
                 Scale the output image by <n>.

       -printside <n>
                 Output only odd or only even pages; <n> must either be 1 or 2.

       -reverse  Output the pages in reverse order.

       -SM <directory>
                 Search the given directory for "standard macro" files instead of searching the default directory that was set up when PMW was built.

       -s <list> Output only the specified staves. These can be individual stave numbers, or pair of numbers separated by a hyphen, to specify a range. Use commas to separate items in the list.

       -t <number>
                 Specify a transposition, in semitones.

       -tumble   When -duplex is set, -tumble causes the PostScript option for "tumbled" duplex printing.

       -V or --version
                 Output the PMW version number to stdout, then stop. No file is read.

       -v        Output verification information about the typesetting to stderr.

DIAGNOSTICS AND RETURN CODES

       Error messages are written to the standard error stream. The return code is the C return code EXIT_SUCCESS (usually 0) for success, even if there were some warnings, and EXIT_FAILURE  (usually  1)
       otherwise.

EXAMPLES

         pmw myscore
         pmw -format A5 -a5ona4 -pamphlet myscore
         pmw -s 3 -o quartet-viola.ps quartet.pmw
