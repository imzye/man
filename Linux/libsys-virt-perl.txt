NAME
       Sys::Virt::Interface - Represent & manage a libvirt host network interface

DESCRIPTION
       The "Sys::Virt::Interface" module represents a host network interface allowing configuration of IP addresses, bonding, vlans and bridges.

METHODS
       my $name = $iface->get_name()
           Returns a string with a locally unique name of the network

       $iface->is_active()
           Returns a true value if the interface is currently running

       my $name = $iface->get_mac()
           Returns a string with the hardware MAC address of the interface

       my $xml = $iface->get_xml_description()
           Returns an XML document containing a complete description of the network's configuration

       $iface->create()
           Start a network whose configuration was previously defined using the "define_network" method in Sys::Virt.

       $iface->undefine()
           Remove  the  configuration  associated  with  a  network previously defined with the "define_network" method in Sys::Virt. If the network is running, you probably want to use the "shutdown" or
           "destroy" methods instead.

       $iface->destroy()
           Immediately terminate the machine, and remove it from the virtual machine monitor. The $iface handle is invalid after this call completes and should not be used again.

CONSTANTS
       This section documents constants that are used with various APIs described above

   LIST FILTERING
       The following constants are used to filter object lists

       Sys::Virt::Interface::LIST_ACTIVE
           Include interfaces that are active

       Sys::Virt::Interface::LIST_INACTIVE
           Include interfaces that are not active

   INTERFACE DEFINE
       The following constants can be used to control the behaviour of interface define operations

       Sys::Virt::Interface::DEFINE_VALIDATE
           Validate the XML document against the XML schema

   XML CONSTANTS
       The following constants are used when querying XML

       Sys::Virt::Interface::XML_INACTIVE
           Request the inactive XML, instead of the current possibly live config.
