NAME
       cdbdiff - program to operate cookie (fortune) database

SYNOPSIS
       cdbdiff [options] <database1> <database2> <resultfile>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cdbdiff command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has some plaintext documentation, see below.

       cdbdiff  is  a  program that compares two cookie databases and builds a list of those cookies that are only present in second, but not in the first of them. The input files are not modified in any
       way.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below. For a complete description, see the documentation in /usr/share/doc/cookietool directory

       [nothing]
              Shows summary of options.

       -c     case sensitive comparisons.

       -d[0-3]
              how fussy about word delimiters? (default: 2)

       -f[0-3]
              input file format - -f3: cookies are separated by '%%' lines; -f2: cookies are separated by '%' lines (DEFAULT); -f1: each line is a cookie; -f0: each word is a cookie.

       -a     append if <resultfile> exists (instead of failing).

       None known.
