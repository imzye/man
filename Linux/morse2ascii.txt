NAME
       morse2ascii - tool for decoding the morse codes from a PCM WAV file

SYNOPSIS
       morse2ascii [options] <file.WAV/TXT>

DESCRIPTION
       This tool employs a volume/peak based method to decode the morse codes from a PCM WAV file as well as from text and RAW PCM files.

       It contains some options for parsing abbreviations, prosigns and qcodes.

OPTIONS
       -a   abbreviations and prosigns parsing

       -q   q-codes parsing

       -r F C B  consider the file as raw headerless PCM data, you must specify the Frequency, Channels and Bits like -r 44100 2 16

       -o   disable the automatic optimizations: DC bias adjust and normalize.  Use this option only if your file is already clean and normalized

       -m   morse notation output (like ...___... instead of SOS), debug

       -w FILE   debug option for dumping the handled samples from the memory to FILE

       -d   debug info (WAV input only)

       Note: the input file can be a PCM WAV audio file or also a text file which uses the dotlinespace notation (._ or .-), dit-dah, binary and others use - as file for reading a text stream from stdin
