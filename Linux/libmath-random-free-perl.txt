NAME
       Math::Random::Free - free drop-in replacement for Math::Random

DESCRIPTION
       This is free (see below) implementation of Math::Random 0.72, serving as drop-in replacement for this module.

MOTIVATION
       Math::Random is a great and widely-used module for the generation of random numbers and permutations. Despite being open-source, Math::Random does not fulfill free open-source software definitions
       as established by the Open Source Initiative (<https://opensource.org/osd>) and the Debian Project (<https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines>, a.k.a. DFSG). This is mostly because
       "randlib" code cannot be copied nor distributed for direct commercial advantage. Math::Random::Free is created to free the code depending on Math::Random from these limitations.

SUPPORT
           our @EXPORT = qw(
               random_normal
               random_permutation
               random_permuted_index
               random_set_seed_from_phrase
           );
           our @EXPORT_OK = qw(
               random_exponential
               random_normal
               random_permutation
               random_permuted_index
               random_set_seed_from_phrase
               random_uniform
               random_uniform_integer
           );

CAVEATS
       This module has only a subset of Math::Random subroutines (contributions welcome), implemented using either Perl core subroutines or other well-known modules. Thus Math::Random::Free is neither as
       complete, nor as fast, nor as random as Math::Random.  Also Math::Random::Free does not aim for cryptographic security.

       While Math::Random::Free supports seed setting, it does that differently from Math::Random. It means that one should not expect the same seed producing identical random sequences in both modules.

       As Math::Random::Free employs List::Util for producing random permutations, these are influenced by $List::Util::RAND variable.
