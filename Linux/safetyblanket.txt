       Creepy blanket simulator

DESCRIPTION
       Safety  Blanket  was  developed  in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 29 game jam.  It’s bed time, the monsters are out to get you, and your blanket is just too small to cover your body!  Cover your exposed
       limbs to fend off the approaching tentacles.  The tentacles will only go for your feet, hands and head.  If the tentacles reach you it’s game over!  This game is made with  LOVE.  You  can  find  more
