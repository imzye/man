NAME
       gen_keymap — generate a keyboard map decision tree

SYNOPSIS
       gen_keymap list ...

DESCRIPTION
       gen_keymap  generates a decision tree from a set of keyboard maps which can be used to help a user decide which keyboard map to use.  The program using the decision tree typically asks the user to
       press some keys; at each step, it examines the returned keycode and uses it to prune the list of possible keyboard maps until there is only one left.

OPTIONS
       --version
             Show program's version number and exit.

       -?, --help
             Show help text.

       -v, --verbose
             Be more verbose.

       -mMINLEN, --minlen=MINLEN
             Too-short keymaps are skipped (default: 30 entries).

       -g, --graph
             Generate a hopefully-nice-looking .dot file.

       --maps
             Print the to-be-processed keymaps

       -i, --installer
             Input files are in d-i map form.

       -IDIRS, --inc=DIRS, --include=DIRS
             Add a directory to the search path.

       -oFILENAME, --output=FILENAME
             Set output file (default: stdout).

       -fFILTER, --filter=FILTER
             Include only the branches leading to these keymaps.

       -uUSEONLY, --useonly=USEONLY
             Start generating the tree based only on these keymaps.  (The difference between --filter and --useonly is that the former generates the whole tree and then prunes it, while the  latter  only
             generates a reduced tree to begin with.  This may have implications for performance on large trees.)

       -sSKIP, --skip=SKIP
             Keymaps to skip.

       -t, --test
             Test the generated maps.

       --interactive
             Ask user to choose among indistinguishable keymaps.
