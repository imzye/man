NAME
       rootsign - cryptographically sign standard input with a private/public keypair unique to the local root user

DESCRIPTION
       rootsign  is  a  program  that operates on standard input, cryptographically signing it with a private/public keypair only accessible by the local root user, and outputting the result on standard out,
       suitable for piping to mail(1).

       A new key will be generated on first use, and is written to /var/lib/rootsign/$KEYID.rsa.pub for import by other users into their keyring, in order to verify signatures.

       This tool is used by bootmail(8) to sign messages, but could easily be used by others.

       rootsign can optionally encrypt the message as well, by setting the recipient's gpg(1) key id in the RECIPIENT_KEYID variable in I/etc/bootmail/gpg.conf.

FILES
       /etc/bootmail/gpg.conf, /var/lib/rootsign/*.rsa.pub

SEE ALSO
