NAME
       pyprinttags - print tags of audio files to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       pyprinttags [-b|--batch] file1 [file2] ...

DESCRIPTION
       pyprinttags is a small script that comes with the pytaglib python tag reading library. It prints all tags found in the audio files given as command line
       parameters.

       those pieces from the file. That behavior can be disabled by the -b option.

OPTIONS
       -b, --batch
              disable user interaction in case of unsupported metadata
