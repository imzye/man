NAME
       xpdfrc - configuration file for xpdf (xpopple)

DESCRIPTION
       The  xpdf  program  reads  a  single  configuration  file.   If  you  have  a  .xpdfrc  file in your home directory, it will be read.  Otherwise, a system-wide configuration file will be read from
       /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc, if it exists.  (This is its default location; depending on build options, it may be placed elsewhere.)

       The xpdfrc file consists of a series of configuration options, one per line.  Blank lines and lines starting with a '#' (comments) are ignored.

       Arguments may be quoted, using "double-quote" characters, e.g., for file names that contain spaces.

       The following sections list all of the configuration options, sorted into functional groups.  There is an examples section at the end.

       Note that all settings are case-sensitive; in particular, boolean options are "yes" and "no" (rather than "Yes" or "No").

INCLUDE FILES
       include config-file
              Includes the specified config file.  The effect of this is equivalent to inserting the contents of config-file directly into the parent config file in place of the include command.   Config
              files can be nested arbitrarily deeply.

GENERAL FONT CONFIGURATION
       fontFile PDF-font-name font-file
              Maps  a  PDF font, PDF-font-name, to a font for display or PostScript output.  The font file, font-file, can be any type allowed in a PDF file.  This command can be used for 8-bit or 16-bit
              (CID) fonts.

POSTSCRIPT CONTROL
       psPaperSize width(pts) height(pts)
              Sets the paper size for PostScript output.  The width and height parameters give the paper size in PostScript points (1 point = 1/72 inch).

       psPaperSize letter | legal | A4 | A3 | match
              Sets the paper size for PostScript output to a standard size.  The default paper size is set when xpdf and pdftops are built, typically to "letter"  or  "A4".   This  can  also  be  set  to
              "match", which will set the paper size to match the size specified in the PDF file.

       psImageableArea llx lly urx ury
              Sets the imageable area for PostScript output.  The four integers are the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right corners of the imageable region, specified in points (with the origin
              being the lower-left corner of the paper).  This defaults to the full paper size; the psPaperSize option will reset the imageable area coordinates.

       psCrop yes | no
              If set to "yes", PostScript output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the PDF file; otherwise no cropping is done.  This defaults to "yes".

       psExpandSmaller yes | no
              If set to "yes", PDF pages smaller than the PostScript imageable area are expanded to fill the imageable area.  Otherwise, no scalling is done on smaller pages.  This defaults to "no".

       psShrinkLarger yes | no
              If set to yes, PDF pages larger than the PostScript imageable area are shrunk to fit the imageable area.  Otherwise, no scaling is done on larger pages.  This defaults to "yes".

       psDuplex yes | no
              If set to "yes", the generated PostScript will set the "Duplex" pagedevice entry.  This tells duplex-capable printers to enable duplexing.  This defaults to "no".

       psLevel level1 | level1sep | level2 | level2sep | level3 | level3Sep
              Sets the PostScript level to generate.  This defaults to "level2".

       psFile file-or-command
              Sets  the  default  PostScript file or print command for xpdf.  Commands start with a '|' character; anything else is a file.  If the file name or command contains spaces it must be quoted.
              This defaults to unset, which tells xpdf to generate a name of the form <file>.ps for a PDF file <file>.pdf.

TEXT CONTROL
       textEncoding encoding-name
              Sets the encoding to use for text output.  (This can be overridden with the "-enc" switch on the command line.)  The encoding-name must be defined with the unicodeMap command  (see  above).
              This defaults to "Latin1".

MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS
       initialZoom percentage | page | width | height
              Sets the initial zoom factor.  A number specifies a zoom percentage, where 100 means 72 dpi.  You may also specify 'page', to fit the page to the window size, 'width', to fit the page width
              to the window width, or 'height', to fit the page height to the window height.

       continuousView yes | no
              If set to "yes", xpdf will start in continuous view mode, i.e., with one vertical screoll bar for the whole document.  This defaults to "no".

       overprintPreview yes | no
              If set to "yes", generate overprint preview output, honoring the OP/op/OPM settings in the PDF file.  Ignored for non-CMYK output.  The default value is "no".

       launchCommand command
              Sets  the command executed when you click on a "launch"-type link.  The intent is for the command to be a program/script which determines the file type and runs the appropriate viewer.  The
              command line will consist of the file to be launched, followed by any parameters specified with the link.  Do not use "%s" in "command".  By default, this is unset, and Xpdf will simply try
              to execute the file (after prompting the user).

       urlCommand command
              Sets the command executed when you click on a URL link.  The string "%s" will be replaced with the URL.  (See the example below.)  This has no default value.

       movieCommand command
              Sets the command executed when you click on a movie annotation.  The string "%s" will be replaced with the movie file name.  This has no default value.

       bind modifiers-key context command ...
              Add a key or mouse button binding.  Modifiers can be zero or more of:

                  shift-
                  ctrl-
                  alt-

              Key can be a regular ASCII character, or any one of:

                  space
                  tab
                  return
                  enter
                  backspace
                  insert
                  delete
                  home
                  end
                  pgup
                  pgdn
                  left / right / up / down        (arrow keys)
                  f1 .. f35                       (function keys)
                  mousePress1 .. mousePress7      (mouse buttons)
                  mouseRelease1 .. mouseRelease7  (mouse buttons)

              Context is either "any" or a comma-separated combination of:

                  fullScreen / window       (full screen mode on/off)
                  continuous / singlePage   (continuous mode on/off)
                  overLink / offLink        (mouse over link or not)
                  scrLockOn / scrLockOff    (scroll lock on/off)

              The context string can include only one of each pair in the above list.

              Command is an Xpdf command (see the COMMANDS section of the xpdf(1) man page for details).  Multiple commands are separated by whitespace.

              The bind command replaces any existing binding, but only if it was defined for the exact same modifiers, key, and context.  All tokens (modifiers, key, context,  commands)  are  case-sensi‐
              tive.

              Example key bindings:

                  # bind ctrl-a in any context to the nextPage
                  # command
                  bind ctrl-a any nextPage

                  # bind uppercase B, when in continuous mode
                  # with scroll lock on, to the reload command
                  # followed by the prevPage command
                  bind B continuous,scrLockOn reload prevPage

              See the xpdf(1) man page for more examples.

       unbind modifiers-key context
              Removes  a  key  binding  established  with the bind command.  This is most useful to remove default key bindings before establishing new ones (e.g., if the default key binding is given for
              "any" context, and you want to create new key bindings for multiple contexts).

       printCommands yes | no
              If set to "yes", drawing commands are printed as they're executed (useful for debugging).  This defaults to "no".

       errQuiet yes | no
              If set to "yes", this suppresses all error and warning messages from all of the Xpdf tools.  This defaults to "no".

OBSOLETE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       The following options were accepted by earlier versions of Xpdf but are no longer allowed.  In most cases, this is because they control rendering options that Poppler does  not  support,  or  they

FILES
       /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc
              This is the default location for the system-wide configuration file.  Depending on build options, it may be placed elsewhere.

       $HOME/.xpdfrc
              This is the user's configuration file.  If it exists, it will be read in place of the system-wide file.
