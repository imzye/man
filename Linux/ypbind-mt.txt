NAME
       yp.conf - NIS binding configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/yp.conf is read from ypbind(8) at startup or when receiving signal SIGHUP. The entries are used for the initial binding. Valid entries are

       domain nisdomain server hostname
           Use server hostname for the domain nisdomain. You could have more then one entry of this type for a single domain.

       domain nisdomain broadcast
           Use broadcast on the local net for domain nisdomain.

       ypserver hostname
           Use server hostname for the local domain.

       broadcast
           If no other server is given or all of them are not reachable, try a broadcast call for the default domain to find a server.

       hostname can either be an IP address or the system's DNS name. If it is the system's DNS name, this name needs to be resolveable without the help of NIS, before NIS is used.

       If for a specific domain the broadcast option and fixed server are given, ypbind-mt tries at first the given servers before falling back to broadcasting for a running server.
