NAME
       genwqe_mt_perf - IBM Hardware Accelerator Tool.

DESCRIPTION
   Usage of :
              [-A] <accelerator> use either GENWQE for the PCIe and CAPI for

              CAPI  based  solution  available  only on System p Use SW to use
              software compress/decompression

              [-C] <card> set the compression card to use (0, 1, ... ).

              RED (or -1) drive work to all available cards.

              [-P] Use polling to detect  work-request  completion/only  CAPI.
              [-t] <test_data.bin> [-l] Enable system load logging

              sadc  -  System  activity data collector and gnuplot must be in‐
              stalled

              [-M] <threads> Maximum number of threads to be used.  [-v] Print
              status  and  informational  output.   [-V] Print program version
              (https://github.com/ibm-genwqe/genwqe-user) [-h] Print this help
              message.

       Input  data  is to be placed in /tmp/test_data.bin.  If it does not ex‐
       ist, the script will generate random example data.  Using  random  data
       will cause performance to suffer, since it will not compress nicely. So
       using something more realistic is certainly a good idea.

       Note that the path needs to be setup to find the zlib_mt_perf tool.

   E.g. run as follows:
              Use GenWQE accelerator card 0:

              PATH=tools:$PATH tools/zlib_mt_perf.sh -A GENWQE -C0

              Use CAPI accelerator card 0:

              PATH=tools:$PATH tools/zlib_mt_perf.sh -A CAPI -C0

              Use software zlib:

              PATH=tools:$PATH tools/zlib_mt_perf.sh -A SW
