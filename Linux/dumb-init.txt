NAME
       dumb-init - a minimal init system for Linux containers

SYNOPSIS
       dumb-init [option] command [[arg] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dumb-init v1.2.5

       dumb-init is a simple process supervisor that forwards signals to children.  It is designed to run as PID1 in minimal container environments.

   Optional arguments:
       -c, --single-child
              Run in single-child mode.  In this mode, signals are only proxied to the direct child and not any of its descendants.

       -r, --rewrite s:r
              Rewrite received signal s to new signal r before proxying.  To ignore (not proxy) a signal, rewrite it to 0.  This option can be specified multiple times.

       -v, --verbose
              Print debugging information to stderr.

       -h, --help
              Print this help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the current version and exit.
