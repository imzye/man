NAME
       gpg-key2latex - Generate a LaTeX file for fingerprint slips.

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-key2latex [-p papersize] [-s] [--show-photo] [--show-qrcode] keyid [keyid...]

DESCRIPTION
       gpg-key2latex generates a LaTeX file with an OpenPGP key fingerprint and User IDs, repeated as often as it fits on a single page.  The LaTeX data is written to STDOUT.  Note: In most cases the
       generated file can be compiled to PDF using pdflatex(1), but xelatex(1) is required if some UID contains CJK characters.

OPTIONS
       -p paper-size, --paper-size=paper-size
           Select the output paper size. The default is the output of paperconf(1), or a4 if libpaper-utils isn't installed.

       -s, --show-subkeys
           Show subkey information.

       --show-photo
           Show the first valid user attribute, if any.  Note: This writes JPG files to the current directory.

       --show-qrcode
           Show a QR code of the string specified by --qrcode-data.  Note: This writes PDF files to the current directory.  Requires qrencode(1) and epstopdf(1).

       --qrcode-data=string
           The data to encode in a QR code (implies --show-qrcode).  The string "%f" is expanded to the OpenPGP key fingerprint (40 hexadecimal digits, without spaces); "%k" is expanded to the long (16
           hexadecimal digits) key ID; "%%" is replaced by a single "%".

           The default data to encode, if --qrcode-data is not specified, is the string "OPENPGP4FPR:%f".

       --attr-height
           The height, in number of lines, of the photo and QR code.  The default is the number of User ID, with a maximum of 5.

       -?, --help
           Print a brief help and exit.

       --version
           Print the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME
           The default home directory.

       GNUPGBIN
           The gpg binary.  Default: "gpg".

       GNUPGHOME
           The default working directory for gpg.  Default: "$HOME/.gnupg".
