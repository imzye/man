Mono(MozRoots)                                                  Mono(MozRoots)

NAME
       mozroots - Download and import trusted root certificates from Mozilla's
       LXR into Mono's certificate store

SYNOPSIS
       mozroots [--import [--machine] [--sync | --ask  |  --ask-add  |  --ask-
       remove]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  downloads the trusted root certificates from the Mozilla
       LXR web site into the Mono certificate store.

       Mono by default does not ship with any default certificates and  allows
       the  user  to pick its trusted certificates.  The mozroots command will
       bring the Mozilla certificates into your local machine.

OPTIONS
       --import
              Import the certificates into the trust store.

       --sync Synchronize (add/remove) the trust store with the  certificates.
              Synchronize  is useful for new Mono installations (no roots) and
              for automated updates (no  user  confirmation  for  addition  or
              removal).

       --ask  Always  confirm  before adding or removing trusted certificates.
              Note: The initial import will likely add about 100  new  trusted
              root  certificates into your store. You'll have to answer yes to
              every one of them if this option is specified.

       --ask-add
              Always confirm before adding a new trusted  certificate.   Note:
              The  initial  import  will likely add about 100 new trusted root
              certificates into your store. You'll have to answer yes to every
              one of them if this option is specified.

       --ask-remove
              Always confirm before removing an existing trusted certificate.

ADVANCED OPTIONS
       --url url
              Specify  an alternative URL for downloading the trusted certifi‐
              cates (LXR source format). This should only be useful for  test‐
              ing  or if the Mozilla's LXR web site address is changed. It can
              also be used to cache a local copy of the  LXR  file  into  your
              local intranet.

       --file name
              Do  not  download  from  LXR but use the specified file. This is
              useful if many computers have to download the same file from the
              Internet.   This  way you can keep a local copy on a file server
              (and minimize network traffic).

       --pkcs7 name
              Export the certificates into a PKCS#7 file. This is  useful  for
              debugging  purpose  or for re-importing the same list into other
              software.

       --machine
              Import the certificate in the machine trust store.  The  default
              is to import all trusted root certificates into the current user
              store.

       --quiet
              Limit console output to errors and confirmations messages.  This
              is useful when scripting.

EXAMPLES
       After  the  initial Mono installation you'll have no trusted roots cer‐
       tificates pre-installed.  Neither will you have some root test certifi‐
       cates  installed  (your  own or the ones provided by using setreg ). In
       this case the simplest thing to do, if you want to trust all those cer‐
       tificates, is to import and synchronize.

       If you created some test certificates (e.g. for using SSL/TLS with XSP)
       and/or if your enterprise requires some  additional  root  certificates
       (e.g.  intranet)  then  you  may  want  to skip the removal part of the
       process. You can do this by asking for a removal  confirmation  (--ask-
       remove option) and answer no when prompted.

       You can still use the synchronize option (--sync) if you have activated
       the default test roots certificate on your system. They will be removed
       at the end of the synchronization process but you can quickly add them
       back with the
       setreg
       tool.
            $ setreg 1 true

       Another  option  to  ease  updates is to synchronize your machine trust
       store (using the --machine option) and keep your customized (test) cer‐
       tificates  in your personal store (or vice versa). Note that every user
       on this computer will be trusting all the newly imported certificates.

       Once the initial import is complete the number of changes (additions or
       removals)  is  generally  very low. In this case it makes sense to know
       about any changes (i.e. ask for confirmation). No confirmation will  be
       required if no changes are made to your trust store.
