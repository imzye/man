   Basic options:
       -in <filename>
              Sequence file to analyze (FASTA format).

       -out <filename>
              Report file name (plain text).

       -seq <filename>
              Save consensus sequences to this FASTA file.

       -trimseqs
              Eliminate similar seqs from -seq file.

       -noinfo
              Don't write help to report file.

       -quiet Don't write progress messages to stderr.

   Criteria for CRISPR detection, defaults in parentheses:
       -minarray <N>
              Must be at least <n> repeats in array (3).

       -mincons <F>
              Minimum  conservation  (0.9).  At least N repeats must have identity >= F with the consensus sequence.  Value is in range 0 .. 1.0.  It is recommended to use a value < 1.0 because using 1.0
              may suppress true arrays due to boundary misidentification.

       -minrepeat <L>
              Minimum repeat length (16).

       -maxrepeat <L>
              Maximum repeat length (64).

       -minspacer <L>
              Minimum spacer length (8).

       -maxspacer <L>
              Maximum spacer length (64).

       -minrepeatratio <R>
              Minimum repeat ratio (0.9).

       -minspacerratio <R>
              Minimum spacer ratio (0.75).  'Ratios' are defined as minlength / maxlength, thus a value close to 1.0 requires lengths to be similar, 1.0 means identical lengths.  Spacer lengths sometimes
              vary significantly, so the default ratio is smaller. As with -mincons, using 1.0 is not recommended.

   Parameters for creating local alignments:
       -minhitlength <L>
              Minimum alignment length (16).

       -minid <F>
              Minimum identity (0.94).
