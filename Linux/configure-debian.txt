NAME
       configure-debian - central configuration program for packages using debconf

SYNOPSIS
        configure-debian [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is meant to be a simple frontend to the dpkg-reconfigure program. Many new users who do not know about this program are unaware of how to return to the debconf configuration seen
       during package install. Others who do know about it often forget or do not know the package name of the program they want to reconfigure. This program is meant to address both of those issues.

       Note that this is not meant to be a complete configuration system!  Debconf is a purposely simple system, and is not meant to solve all configuration needs. Still, it is very flexible and can
       accomplish a lot with relative ease.

OPTIONS
       -l --list List all packages initially, don't show them by section

       configure-debian accepts all the command line options for dpkg-reconfigure(1), and passes them along to it when it calls the program. See its manpapge for details on these options.

SEE ALSO
       dpkg-reconfigure(1)
