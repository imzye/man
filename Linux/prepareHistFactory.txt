NAME
       prepareHistFactory - create a working directory for the HistFactory tools

SYNOPSIS
       prepareHistFactory [dir_name]

DESCRIPTION
       prepareHistFactory  is  a simple script that prepares a working area (and creates the directory dir_name if specified).  Within the directory dir_name, it creates a results/, data/, and config/ direc‐
       tory relative to the given path.  It also copies the HistFactorySchema.dtd and example XML files into the config/ directory.  Additionally, it copies a root file into the data/ directory for use  with
       the examples.  Once this is done, one is ready to run the example hist2workspace input.xml or edit the XML files for a new project.
