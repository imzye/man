NAME
       approx.conf - configuration file for approx proxy server

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/approx/approx.conf

DESCRIPTION
       Each non-blank line of the configuration file should contain a name/value pair, separated by white space.  Comments start with a "#" character and continue to the end of the line.

       Names that begin with the "$" character are reserved for use as configuration parameters.  The following parameters are currently defined:

       $cache Specifies  the  location of the approx cache directory (default: /var/cache/approx).  It and all its subdirectories must be owned by the approx server (see also the $user and $group parame‐
              ters, below.)

       $interval
              Specifies the time in minutes after which a cached file will be considered too old to deliver without first checking with the remote repository for a newer version (default: 60)

       $max_rate
              Specifies the maximum download rate from remote repositories, in bytes per second (default: unlimited).  The value may be suffixed with "K", "M", or "G" to indicate kilobytes, megabytes, or
              gigabytes per second, respectively.

       $max_redirects
              Specifies the maximum number of HTTP redirections that will be followed when downloading a remote file (default: 5)

       $user, $group
              Specifies the user and group that owns the files in the approx cache (default: approx)

       $syslog
              Specifies the syslog(3) facility to use when logging (default: daemon)

       $pdiffs
              Specifies whether to support IndexFile diffs (default: true)

       $offline
              Specifies whether to deliver (possibly out-of-date) cached files when they cannot be downloaded from remote repositories (default: false)

       $max_wait
              Specifies how many seconds an approx(8) process will wait for a concurrent download of a file to complete, before attempting to download the file itself (default: 10)

       $curl_path
              Specifies the path to the curl binary (default: /usr/bin/curl)

       $verbose
              Specifies whether informational messages should be printed in the log (default: false)

       $debug Specifies whether debugging messages should be printed in the log (default: false)

       The other name/value pairs  are used to map distribution names to remote repositories.  For example,

              debian          http://ftp.debian.org/debian
              debian-security http://security.debian.org/debian-security

TCP PORT NUMBER
       The port on which approx(8) listens is not specified in this file, but in /etc/inetd.conf.  The default value is 9999, for compatibility with apt-proxy(8), but it may be  changed  by  running  the
       command

              dpkg-reconfigure approx

       approx(8), inetd(8)
