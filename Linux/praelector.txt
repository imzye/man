NAME
       praelector - program to help one to read latin sentences

SYNOPSIS

       praelector

DESCRIPTION
       praelector is a program that helps one to read a latin phrase in a "natural" way.

       William G. Hale (1849-1928) explained in "The Art Of Reading Latin" principles of such a "natural" way of reading latin sentences, which is radically different of the way of reading our modern
       languages.

SEE ALSO
       collatinus(1).
