NAME
       hostlist - handle hostlist expressions

SYNOPSIS
       hostlist [OPTION]... [HOSTLIST]...

DESCRIPTION
       Perform a set operation (union, intersection, difference or symmetric difference) on the given hostlists. Output the result as a hostlist, a count of hostnames or an expanded list of hostnames.

       If  "-"  is  used instead of a hostlist argument, an arbitrary number of hostlists are read from stdin. The union of them is used as if it had been present on the command line as a single hostlist
       argument.

OPTIONS
       -u, --union
              Compute the union of the hostlists. A hostname is present in the output if it is included in at least one of the hostlists. This is the default operation.

       -i, --intersection
              Compute the intersection of the hostlists. A hostname is present in the output if it is included in all the hostlists.

       -d, --difference
              Compute the difference of the hostlists. A hostname is present in the output if it is included in the first hostlist but not any of the following.

       -x, --symmetric-difference
              Compute the symmetric difference of the hostlists. A hostname is present in the output if it is included in an odd number of the hostlists.

       -o OFFSET, --offset=OFFSET
              Filter the result to skip OFFSET hosts from the beginning. If OFFSET is not less than the number of hosts in the result, the result will become empty. If OFFSET is  negative,  keep  -OFFSET
              hosts from the end of the result.  The default is to skip nothing.

       -l LIMIT, --limit=LIMIT
              Filter  the  result  to  limit it to the first LIMIT hosts. If LIMIT is not less than the number of hosts in the result, this option does nothing.  This filter is applied after the --offset
              filter (see above).  The default is to have no limit.

       -c, --collapse
              Output the result as a hostlist expression. This is the default. See the --chop option for splitting into multiple hostlists of a certain size.

       -n, --count
              Output the number of hostnames in the result.

       -e, --expand
              Output the result as an expanded list of hostnames.

       -w     Output the result as an expanded list of hostnames. This option is deprecated. Use -e or --expand instead.

       -q, --quiet
              Output nothing. This option is useful together with --non-empty.

       -0, --non-empty
              Return success if the resulting hostlist is non-empty and failure if it is empty.

       -s SEPARATOR, --separator=SEPARATOR
              Use SEPARATOR as the separator between the hostnames in the expanded list (and between (chopped) hostlists in collapsed mode).  The default is a newline.

       -p PREPEND, --prepend=PREPEND
              Output PREPEND before each hostname in the expanded list (and before each hostlist in collapsed mode).  The default is to prepend nothing.

       -a APPEND, --append=APPEND
              Output APPEND after each hostname in the expanded list (and after each hostlist in collapsed mode).  The default is to append nothing.

       -S FROM,TO, --substitute=FROM,TO
              Apply a regular expression substitution to each hostname, replacing all FROM with TO.  The default is to do no substitution.

       --append-slurm-tasks=SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE
              Append the number of tasks parsed from the SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE string. You need to use -e/--expand and you probably need to specify -a/--append and -s/--separator too. NOTE:  The  hostlist
              is always sorted internally by this program. The task counts from SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE is then applied to each hostname in the sorted list.

       --repeat-slurm-tasks=SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE
              Repeat  each  hostname  so  it is listed multiple times as specified by the SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE string. You need to use -e/--expand.  NOTE: The hostlist is always sorted internally by this
              program. The task counts from SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE is then applied to each hostname in the sorted list.

       --chop=CHUNKSIZE
              When outputting as collapsed hostlist (the default mode --collapse) split into hostlists of size CHUNKSIZE and output each hostlist separately. The last hostlist may  be  smaller  than  the
              rest.

       --version
              Show the version of the utility and the underlying Python library.

EXAMPLES
       Output the union of n[10-19] and n[15-24] (which is n[10-24]):
              hostlist n[10-19] n[15-24]

       Output the result of removing n15 and n[17-18] from n[1-20] (which is n[1-14,16,19-20]):
              hostlist -d n[1-20] n15 n[17-18]

       Output the result as an expanded list of hostnames (one hostname per line):
              hostlist -d -e n[1-20] n15 n[17-18]

       Output the result as an expanded list of hostnames separated by commas:
              hostlist -d -e -s, n[1-20] n15 n[17-18]

       Output the result as an expanded list of hostnames (followed by space and the digit "8") separated by spaces:
              hostlist -d -e -s " " -a " 8" n[1-20] n15 n[17-18]

       Expand a hostlist, replacing "n" with "ni":
              hostlist -e -S n,ni n[1-20]

       Print INCLUDED as n11 is in n[10-20]:
              if hostlist -q0 -i n11 n[10-20]; then echo INCLUDED; else echo NOT INCLUDED; fi

NOTES
       The  square  brackets  used  in the hostlist expression syntax are also used in shell glob patterns. This may cause unwanted surprises if you have files in your current directory named after hosts
       present in the hostlist. Always quote the hostlist expression to avoid this problem:

         % hostlist n[1-10]
         n[1-10]
         % touch n1
         % hostlist n[1-10]
         n1
         % echo n[1-10]
         n1
         % hostlist "n[1-10]"
         n[1-10]
