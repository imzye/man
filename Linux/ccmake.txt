NAME
       ccmake - CMake Curses Dialog Command-Line Reference

SYNOPSIS
          ccmake [<options>] {<path-to-source> | <path-to-existing-build>}

DESCRIPTION
       The  ccmake  executable  is  the CMake curses interface.  Project configuration settings may be specified interactively through this GUI.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal
       when the program is running.

       CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a  source  tree  with  the  name  CMake‐
       Lists.txt.  Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.

OPTIONS
       -S <path-to-source>
              Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.

       -B <path-to-build>
              Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.

              If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

       -C <initial-cache>
              Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

              When  CMake  is  first  run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from
              which to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's CMake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the project's default values.  The given file should be  a  CMake
              script containing set() commands that use the CACHE option, not a cache-format file.

              References to CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR within the script evaluate to the top-level source and build tree.

       -D <var>:<type>=<value>, -D <var>=<value>
              Create or update a CMake CACHE entry.

              When  CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that
              takes priority over the project's default value.  The option may be repeated for as many CACHE entries as desired.

              If the :<type> portion is given it must be one of the types specified by the set() command documentation for its CACHE signature.  If the :<type> portion is omitted the entry  will  be  created
              with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a command in the project sets the type to PATH or FILEPATH then the <value> will be converted to an absolute path.

              This option may also be given as a single argument: -D<var>:<type>=<value> or -D<var>=<value>.

       -U <globbing_expr>
              Remove matching entries from CMake CACHE.

              This  option may be used to remove one or more variables from the CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ? are supported.  The option may be repeated for as many CACHE entries as
              desired.

              Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non-working.

       -G <generator-name>
              Specify a build system generator.

              CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating a particular build system.   Possible  generator  names  are  specified  in  the
              cmake-generators(7) manual.

              If not specified, CMake checks the CMAKE_GENERATOR environment variable and otherwise falls back to a builtin default selection.

       -T <toolset-spec>
              Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.

              Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell the native build system how to choose a compiler.  See the CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET variable for details.

       -A <platform-name>
              Specify platform name if supported by generator.

              Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the native build system to choose a compiler or SDK.  See the CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM variable for details.

       -Wno-dev
