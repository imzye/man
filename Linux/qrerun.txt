NAME
       qrerun - rerun a pbs batch job

SYNOPSIS
       qrerun [-f] job_identifier ...

DESCRIPTION
       The qrerun command directs that the specified jobs are to be rerun if possible.

       To rerun a job is to terminate the session leader of the job and return the job to the queued state in the execution queue in which the job currently resides.

       If  a  job  is marked as not rerunable then the rerun request will fail for that job.  If the mini-server running the job is down, or the rejects the request, the Rerun Job batch request will return a
       failure unless -f is used.

       Using -f violates IEEE Batch Processing Services Std and should be handled with great care.  It should only be used under exceptional circumstances.  Best practice is to fix  the  problem  mini-server
       host and letting qrerun run normally.  The previous nodes may need manual cleaning.  See the -r option on the qsub and qalter commands.

OPERANDS
       The qrerun command accepts one or more job_identifier operands of the form:
           sequence_number[.server_name][@server]

STANDARD ERROR
       The qrerun command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qrerun command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qrerun command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
