NAME
     chicken — A Scheme-to-C translator

SYNOPSIS
     chicken [OPTION ...] [FILENAME ...]

DESCRIPTION
     chicken is a compiler and interpreter for the programming language Scheme supporting most of the features as described in the Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.  The chicken program is
     the basic Scheme-to-C translator used in this system.  For a more convenient interface, see csc(1).

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables change the behaviour of chicken:

     CHICKEN_INCLUDE_PATH  Contains one or more pathnames where the compiler should additionally look for include-files, separated by ‘;’ characters.

     CHICKEN_OPTIONS       Holds a string of default compiler options that should apply to every invocation of chicken.

EXIT STATUS
     The chicken utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
