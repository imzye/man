NAME
       lcovrc - lcov configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The lcovrc file contains configuration information for the lcov code coverage tool (see lcov(1)).

       The  system-wide configuration file is located at $LCOV_HOME/etc/lcovrc.  This is typically either /etc/lcovrc or /usr/local/etc/lcovrc but may be wherever you have installed the lcov package.  To
       change settings for a single user, place a customized copy of this file at location ~/.lcovrc.  Where available, command-line options override configuration file settings.

       The genhtml, lcov, and geninfo commands also support the --config-file option, which can be used to specify one or more files which should be used instead of the system or user default  rc  files.
       Multiple options files may be useful if you have both project- and team-specific common options and want to ensure consistency across multiple users.  If multiple --config-file options are applied
       in the order they appear.  Note that the "--config-file" option name must be specified in full and cannot be abbreviated.  An error will occur if the option is not recognized.

       Lines in a configuration file can either be:

            * empty lines or lines consisting only of white space characters. These lines are ignored.

            * comment lines which start with a hash sign ('#'). These are treated like empty lines and will be ignored.

            * statements in the form 'key = value'.

            * Values may be taken from environment variables via the syntax

              'key = ...$ENV{ENV_VAR_NAME}...'.

              The substring '$ENV{ENV_VAR_NAME}' is replaced by the value of the environment variable.

              One or more environment variables may be used to set the RC value.

       A list of valid statements and their description can be found in section 'OPTIONS' below.
       NOTE  that there is no error checking of keys in the options file:  spelling errors are simply seen as values which are not used by some particular tool.  If you are unsure of whether your options
       file is read or its values applied, you can use the --verbose --verbose flag to enable printing of option value overrides.  (The option appears twice to enable a higher level of verbosity.)

       Both 'list' and 'scalar' (non list) options are supported in the lcovrc file.

       For scalar (non list) options:

            * if specified on the command line and in the lcovrc file, the value specified on the command line wins.  The value from the RC file is ignored.

            * Scalar options include: 'criteria_script = ...'  , 'genhtml_annotate_script = ...'  , 'version_script = ...'  , etc.

       For list options:

            * the RC file entry can be used multiple times; each use appends to the list.
              For example, the entry below will result in two 'omit' patterns which will both be checked:

              # note explicit start/end line markers in the regexp
              omit_lines = ^\s+//\s*MY_EXCLUDE_MARKER\s*$
              # Note that the regexp below matches anywhere on the line
              omit_lines = NR_CM_DBG_PRINT

            * If entries are specified on the command line, then the RC file entries are ignored:  command line wins.  If entries are specified in more than one RC file (i.e., multiple --config-file  ar‐
              guments are supplied), then RC files are applied in order of appearance, and list entries are appended in order.  For most list-type options, order is not important.

            * list options include:
                  filter = ...
                  exclude = ...
                  ignore = ...
                  substitute = ...
                  omit_lines = ...
                  erase_functions = ...
                  genhtml_annotate_script = ...
              etc.  For a complete set of list options, see the documentation of each configuration option, below.

       Example configuration:

       Note that this example does not include all possible configuration options.
       In general:  (almost) all command line options can be specified in the configuration file instead, whereas some configuration file options have no command line equivalent.

       See the OPTIONS section below for details.

OPTIONS
       config_file = filename

              Include another config file.

              Inclusion is equivalent to inserting the text from filename at this point in the current file.  As a result, settings from the included file are processed after earlier settings in the cur‐
              rent file, but before later settings from the current file.  As a result:

              Scalar  options  set  earlier in the current file are overridden by settings from the included file, and scalar options from the included file are overridden by later setting in the current
              file.

              Array options from earlier in the current file appear before setting from the included file, and array options from later in the current file appear after.

              Config file inclusion is recursive:  an included config file may include another file - and so on.  Inclusion loops are not supported and will result in a usage error.

              The most common usecase for config file inclusion is so that a site-wide or project-wide options file can include a user-specific or module-specific options file - for example, as

                  ...
                 config_file = $ENV{HOME}/.lcovrc_user
                  ...

       genhtml_css_file = filename

              Specify an external style sheet file. Use this option to modify the appearance of the HTML output as generated by genhtml.  During output generation, a copy of this file will be  placed  in
              the output directory.

              This option corresponds to the --css-file command line option of genhtml.

              By default, a standard CSS file is generated.

       genhtml_header = string

              Specify header text to use ta top of each HTML page.

              This option corresponds to the --header-title command line option of genhtml.
              Default is "LCOV - (differential )? coverage report"

       genhtml_footer = string

              Specify footer text to use at bottom of each HTML page.

              This option corresponds to the --footer command line option of genhtml.

              Default is LCOV tool version string.

       genhtml_dark_mode = 0|1

              If non-zero, display using light text on dark background rather than dark text on light background.

              This option corresponds to the --dark-mode command line option of genhtml.

              By default, a 'light' palette is used.

       genhtml_hi_limit  = hi_limit
       genhtml_med_limit = med_limit

              Specify  coverage  rate limits for classifying file entries. Use this option to modify the coverage rates (in percent) for line, function and branch coverage at which a result is classified
              as high, medium or low coverage. This classification affects the color of the corresponding entries on the overview pages of the HTML output:

              High:   hi_limit  <= rate <= 100        default color: green
              Medium: med_limit <= rate < hi_limit    default color: yellow
              Low:    0         <= rate < med_limit   default color: red

              Defaults are 90 and 75 percent.

              There are also options to configure different thresholds for line, branch, and function coverages.  See below.

       genhtml_line_hi_limit  = line_hi_limit
       genhtml_line_med_limit = line_med_limit

              Specify specific threshold for line coverage limits used to decide whether a particular line coverage percentage is classified as high, medium, or low coverage.  If the line-specific values
              are not specified, then the default genhtml_med_limit or genhtml_hi_limit values are used.

       genhtml_branch_hi_limit  = branch_hi_limit
       genhtml_branch_med_limit = branch_med_limit

              Specify specific threshold for branch coverage limits used to decide whether a particular branch coverage percentage is classified as high, medium, or low coverage.  If the  branch-specific
              values are not specified, then the default genhtml_med_limit or genhtml_hi_limit values are used.

       genhtml_function_hi_limit  = function_hi_limit
       genhtml_function_med_limit = function_med_limit

              Specify  specific  threshold  for function coverage limits used to decide whether a particular function coverage percentage is classified as high, medium, or low coverage.  If the function-
              specific values are not specified, then the default genhtml_med_limit or genhtml_hi_limit value is used.

       rtl_file_extensions = str[,str]+

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be RTL code (e.g., Verilog).

              If not specified, the default set is 'v,vh,sv,vhdl?'.  There is no command line option equivalent.
              This option is used by genhtml and lcov.

       info_file_pattern = str

              Specify a glob-match pattern associated with lcov trace files (suitable as an argument to 'find'.  If not specified, the default is '*.info'.

       c_file_extensions = str[,str]+

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be C/C++ code.

              If not specified, the default set is 'c,h,i,C,H,I,icc,cpp,cc,cxx,hh,hpp,hxx'.  If you want all files to be treated as C/C++ code, you can use: c_file_extensions = .*

              This parameter must be set from the lcovrc file or via the --rc name=value command line option; note that you may need to protect the value from shell expansion in the latter case.

       java_file_extensions = str[,str]+

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be Java code.

              If not specified, the default set is 'java'.  If you want all files to be treated as Java code, you can use: java_file_extensions = .*

              This parameter must be set from the lcovrc file or via the --rc name=value command line option; note that you may need to protect the value from shell expansion in the latter case.

       perl_file_extensions = str[,str]+

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be Perl code.

              If not specified, the default set is 'pl,pm'.  If you want all files to be treated as Perl code, you can use: perl_file_extensions = .*

              This parameter must be set from the lcovrc file or via the --rc name=value command line option; note that you may need to protect the value from shell expansion in the latter case.

       python_file_extensions = str[,str]+

              Specify a comma-separated list of file extensions which should be assumed to be Python code.

              If not specified, the default set is 'py'.  If you want all files to be treated as Python code, you can use: python_file_extensions = .*

              This parameter must be set from the lcovrc file or via the --rc name=value command line option; note that you may need to protect the value from shell expansion in the latter case.

       filter_lookahead = integer

              Specify the maximum number of lines to look at when filtering bogus branch expressions.  A larger number may catch more cases, but will increase execution time.

              If not specified, the default set is 10.  There is no command line option equivalent.
              This option is used by genhtml and lcov.

       filter_bitwise_conditional = 0|1

              If set to non-zero value, bogus branch filtering will assume that expressions containing  bitwise operators '&', '|', '~' are conditional expressions - and will not filter them out.

              If not specified, the default set is 0 (do not treat them as conditional).  There is no command line option equivalent.
              This option is used by genhtml and lcov.

       filter_blank_aggressive = 0|1

              If set to non-zero value, then blank source lines will be ignored whether or not their 'hit' count is zero.  See the --filter blank section in man genhtml(1).

              If not specified, the default set is 0 (filter blank lines only if they are not hit).
              There is no command line option equivalent.

       ignore_errors = message_type(,message_type)*

              Specify a  message type which should be ignored.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to ignore multiple message types.

              This option is equivalent to the --ignore-errors option to geninfo, genhtml, or lcov.  Note that the lcovrc file message list is not applied (those  messages  NOT  ignored)  if  the  '--ig‐
              nore-errors' command line option is specified.
              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       expect_message_count = message_type:expr(,message_type:expr)*

              Specify  a  constraint on the number of messages of one or more types which are expected to be produced during tool execution.  If the constraint is not true, an error of type count will be
              generated.

              Multiple constraints can be specified using a comma-separated list or by using the option multiple times.

              Substitutions are performed on the expression before it is evaluated:

              For example:

          -  expect_message_count = inconsistent : %C == 5
             says that you expect exactly 5 messages of this type

          -  expect_message_count inconsistent : %C > 6 && %C <= 10
             says that you expect the number of messages to be in the range (6:10].

       This option is useful if errors are caused by conditions that you cannot fix - for example, due to inconsistent coverage data generated by your toolchain.  In those scenarios, you may decide:

          -  to exclude the offending code, or

          -  to exclude the entire offending file(s), or

          -  to ignore the messages, either by converting them to warnings or suppressing them entirely.

       In the latter case, this option provides some additional safety by warning you when the count differs due to some change which occurred, giving you the opportunity to diagnose the change and/or to
       review message changes.

       This option is equivalent to the --expect-message-count command line flag.

       max_message_count = integer

              Set the maximum number of warnings of any particular type which should be emitted. This can be used to reduce the size of log files.

              No more warnings will be printed after this number is reached.  0 (zero) is interpreted as 'no limit'.
              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       stop_on_error = 0|1

              If set to 0, tell the tools to ignore errors and keep going to try to generate a result - however flawed or incomplete that result might be.  Note that some errors  cannot  be  ignored  and
              that ignoring some errors may lead to other errors.
              The  tool  will return a non-zero exit code if one or more errors are detected during execution when stop_on_error is disabled.  That is, the tool will continue execution in the presence of
              errors but will return an exit status.

              This is equivalent to the '--keep-going' command line option.

              Default is 1:  stop when error occurs.

              If the 'ignore_error msgType' option is also used, then those messages will be treated as warnings rather than errors (or will be entirely suppressed if the message  type  appears  multiple
              times in the ignore_messages option).  Warnings do not cause a non-zero exit status.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       treat_warning_as_error = 0|1

              If set to 1, tell the tools that messages which are normally treated as warnings ( e.g., certain usage messages) should be treated as errors.

              Note that ignored messages will still appear as warnings:  see the ignore_errors entry, above.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       warn_once_per_file = 0|1

              If set to 1, tell the tools to emit certain errors only once per file (rather than multiple times, if the issue occurs multiple times in the same file).

              Default is 1:  do not report additional errors.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       check_data_consistency = 0|1

              If set to 1, tell the tools to execute certain data consistency checks - e.g., that function with a non-zero hit count contains at least one line with a non-zero hit count - and vice versa.

              It may be useful to use this option to disable checking if you have inconsistent legacy data and have no way to correct or exclude it.

              Default is 1:  execute consistency checks.

       genhtml_line_field_width = number_of_characters

              Specify the width (in characters) of the source code view column containing line coverage information.

              Default is 12.

       genhtml_branch_field_width = number_of_characters

              Specify the width (in characters) of the source code view column containing branch coverage information.

              Default is 16.

       genhtml_mcdc_field_width = number_of_characters

              Specify the width (in characters) of the source code view column containing MC/DC coverage information.

              Default is 14.

       genhtml_owner_field_width = number_of_characters

              Specify  the  width  (in  characters)  of the source code view column containing owner information (as reported by your annotation script.  This option has an effect only if you are using a
              source annotation script:  see the --annotation-script option in the genhtml man page.

              Default is 20.

       genhtml_age_field_width = number_of_characters

              Specify the width (in characters) of the source code view column containing age of the corresponding block (as reported by your annotation script).   This option has an effect only  if  you
              are using a source annotation script:  see the --annotation-script option in the genhtml man page.

              Default is 5.

       genhtml_frames = 0 | 1

              Specify whether source detail view should contain a navigation image.  See the --frame entry in the genhtml man page.

       genhtml_overview_width = pixel_size

              Specify the width (in pixel) of the overview image created when generating HTML output using the --frames option of genhtml.

              Default is 80.

       genhtml_nav_resolution = lines

              Specify the resolution of overview navigation when generating HTML output using the --frames option of genhtml.  This number specifies the maximum difference in lines between the position a
              user selected from the overview and the position the source code window is scrolled to.

              Default is 4.

       genhtml_nav_offset = lines

              Specify the overview navigation line offset as applied when generating HTML output using the --frames option of genhtml.

              Clicking a line in the overview image should show the source code view at a position a bit further up, so that the requested line is not the first line in the window.  This number specifies
              that offset.

              Default is 10.

       genhtml_keep_descriptions = 0|1

              If non-zero, keep unused test descriptions when generating HTML output using genhtml.

              This option corresponds to the --keep-descriptions option of genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_no_prefix = 0|1

              If non-zero, do not try to find and remove a common prefix from directory names.

              This option corresponds to the --no-prefix option of genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_no_source = 0|1

              If non-zero, do not create a source code view when generating HTML output using genhtml.

              This option corresponds to the --no-source option of genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_num_spaces = num

              Specify the number of spaces to use as replacement for tab characters in the HTML source code view as generated by genhtml.

              This option corresponds to the --num-spaces option of genhtml.

              Default is 8.

       genhtml_legend = 0|1

              If non-zero, include a legend explaining the meaning of color coding in the HTML output as generated by genhtml.

              This option corresponds to the --legend option of genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_html_prolog = filename

              If set, include the contents of the specified file at the beginning of HTML output.

              This option corresponds to the --html-prolog option of genhtml.

              Default is to use no extra prolog.

       genhtml_html_epilog = filename

              If set, include the contents of the specified file at the end of HTML output.

              This option corresponds to the --html-epilog option of genhtml.

              Default is to use no extra epilog.

       genhtml_html_extension = extension

              If set, use the specified string as filename extension for generated HTML files.

              This option corresponds to the --html-extension option of genhtml.

              Default extension is "html".

       genhtml_html_gzip = 0|1

              If set, compress all html files using gzip.

              This option corresponds to the --html-gzip option of genhtml.

              Default extension is 0.

       genhtml_sort = 0|1

              If non-zero, create overview pages sorted by coverage rates when generating HTML output using genhtml.

              This option can be set to 0 by using the --no-sort option of genhtml.

              Default is 1.

       genhtml_hierarchical = 0|1

              If non-zero, the HTML report will follow the hierarchical directory structure of the source code.

              This option is equivalent to using the --hierarchical command line option of genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_flat_view = 0|1

              If non-zero, the top-level HTML table will contain all of the files in the project and there will be no intermediate directory pages.

              This option is equivalent to using the --flat command line option of genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_show_navigation = 0|1

              If non-zero, the 'source code' view summary table will contain hyperlinks from the number to the first source line in the corresponding category ('Hit' or 'Not hit') in the non-differential
              coverage report.  Source code hyperlinks are always enabled in differential coverage reports.

              This option is equivalent to using the --show-navigation command line option of genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_show_owner_table = 0|1|all

              If non-zero, equivalent to the genhtml --shwow-owners flag: see man genhtml(1) for details.

              Default is 0.

       compact_summary_tables = 0|1

              If non-zero, suppress the 'Total' row in the 'date' and 'owner' summary table if there is only one element in the corresponding bin.
              When there are a large number of files with a single author, this can cut the summary table size by almost half.

              Default is 1 (enabled).

       owner_table_entries = integer

              This  option  is used to tell genhtml the number of 'owner' table entries to retain in the summary table (at the top of the page) if owner table truncation is requested.  Authors are sorted
              by quantity of un-exercised code - so elided entries will be smaller offenders: maximal offenders are retained.  If the option is not set, then owner tables are not truncated.

              This option has no effect unless genhtml --show-owners is enabled.  See the --show-owners option in genhtml(1) for details.

              Default is not set ( i.e., do not truncate owner tables).

       truncate_owner_table = comma_separated_list

              This option is used to tell genhtml whether to truncate the 'owner' table at the top, directory, or file level.  This option acts together with the owner_table_entries parameter  to  deter‐
              mine how many author entries are retained.

              This option has no effect unless genhtml --show-owners is enabled and and the owner_table_entries configuration is set.

              If  this option is set multiple times in the lcovrc file, the values are combined to form the list of levels where truncation will occur.  Similarly, if this option is not set and owner_ta‐
              ble_entries is set, then the table will be truncated everywhere.

              See the --show-owners option in genhtml(1) for details.

              Default is to not truncate the list.

       genhtml_show_noncode_owners = 0|1

              If non-zero, equivalent to the genhtml --shwow-noncode flag: see man genhtml(1) for details.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_show_function_proportion = 0|1

              If nonzero, add column to "function coverage detail" table to show the proportion of lines and branches within the function which are exercised.

              This option is equivalent to using the --show-proportion command line option of genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_synthesize_missing = 0|1

              If non-zero, equivalent to the genhtml --synthesize-missing flag: see man genhtml(1) for details.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_charset = charset

              Specify the character set of all generated HTML pages.

              Use this option if the source code contains characters which are not part of the default character set. Note that this option is ignored when a custom HTML prolog  is  specified  (see  also
              genhtml_html_prolog).

              Default is UTF-8.

       demangle_cpp = c++filt

              If set, this option tells genhtml/lcov/geninfo to demangle C++ function names  in function overviews, and gives the name of the tool used for demangling.  Set this option to one if you want
              to convert C++ internal function names to human readable format for display on the HTML function overview page.

              If the demangle_cpp option is used multiple times, then the arguments are concatenated when the callback is executed - similar to how the gcc -Xlinker parameter works.  This provides a pos‐
              sibly  easier  way  to  pass  arguments  to your tool, without requiring a wrapper script.  In that case, your callback will be executed as: | tool-0 'tool-1; ...  Arguments are quoted when
              passed to the shell, in order to handle parameters which contain spaces.

              Note that the demangling tool is called via a pipe, and is expected to read from stdin and write to stdout.

              This option corresponds to the --demangle-cpp command line option of genhtml.

              Default is not set (C++ demangling is disabled).

       genhtml_demangle_cpp_tool = path_to_c++filt

              Specify the location of the demangle tool (see c++filt(1)) used to convert C++ internal function names to human readable format for display on the HTML function overview page.

              This option is deprecated and will be removed from a future lcov release.  Please use demangle_cpp = path_to_c++filt instead.

       genhtml_demangle_cpp_params = parameters

              Specify extra parameters to be passed to the demangling tool

              Use this option if your environment requires additional parameters such as --no-strip-underscore for correctly demangling C++ internal function names. See also c++filt(1)).

              This argument is deprecated.  Please use the Xlinker-like demangle_cpp argument instead.

       genhtml_desc_html = 0|1

              If non-zero, test case descriptions may contain HTML markup.

              Set this option to one if you want to embed HTML markup (for example to include links) in test case descriptions. When set to zero, HTML markup characters will be  escaped  to  show  up  as
              plain text on the test case description page.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_precision = 1|2|3|4

              Specify how many digits after the decimal-point should be used for displaying coverage rates.

              Default is 1.

       merge_function_aliases = 0|1

              If non-zero, group function aliases in the function detail tabile.  See man(1) genhtml.

              Default is 0.

       genhtml_missed = 0|1

              If non-zero, the count of missed lines, functions, or branches is shown as negative numbers in overview pages.

              Default is 0.

       suppress_function_aliases = 0|1

              If non-zero, do not show aliases in the function detail table.
              If nonzero, implies that merge_function_aliases is enabled.
              See the genhtml man page for more details.

              Default is 0.

       derive_function_end_line = 0|1

              If  non-zero, use 'line' coverage data to deduce the end line of each function definition.  This is useful when excluding certain functions from your coverage report.  See the --erase-func‐
              tions, --filter trivial and --show-proportion options.

              Default is 1.

              This option is not required if you are using gcc/9 or newer; these versions report function begin/end lines directly.

              Note that end lines are derived only for C/C++ files unless the derive_function_end_lines_all_files option is enabled; see the c_file_extensions setting, above, for the list  of  extensions
              used to identify C/C++ these files.
              Lambda  functions are ignored during end line computation. Note that lambdas are identified via function name matching - so you must enable demangling if your toolchain is too old to report
              demangled names in the GCOV output.  See the demangle_cpp setting, above.

              For languages other than C/C++:  end-line derivation may compute the wrong value - e.g., in cases where there are lines of code in global scope following some function definition.  In  this
              case, lcov will incorrectly associate the following code with the preceding function.
              If this creates problems - for example, causes lcov to warn about inconsistent coveage data - then there are several possible workarounds:

              -  disable end-line derivation - e.g., via --rc derive_function_end_line=0 .

              -  exclude the offending code and/or then entire associated file.

              -  ignore the error message, e.g., via the --ignore-errors command line option

              -  disable coverage DB consistency checks - e.g., via --rc check_data_consistency=0 .

       derive_function_end_line_all_files = 0|1

              If non-zero, derive end lines for all functions, regardless of source language.  By default, end lines are computed only in  C/C++ files.
              This option has no effect if derive_function_end_lines is disabled.

              Default is 0 (disabled).

       trivial_function_threshold = integer

              Set the maximum size of function (in number of lines) which will be checked by --filter trivial filter.

              Default is 5.

       excessive_count_threshold = number

              Set the threshold for hit count that lcov deems excessive/unlikely/indicating a bug somewhere in your toolchain.
              tens of billions of hits.
              excessive is used to report potential issue - see the genhtml(1), lcov(1), geninfo(1) man pages.

              Default is not set. (Do not check for excessive counts.)

       geninfo_gcov_tool = path_to_gcov

              Specify the location of the gcov tool (see gcov(1)) which is used to generate coverage information from data files.

              This option can be used multiple times - e.g., to add arguments to the gcov callback.  See the geninfo man page for details.

       geninfo_adjust_testname = 0|1

              If non-zero,  adjust test names to include operating system information when capturing coverage data.

              Default is 0.

       forget_testcase_names = 0|1

              If non-zero, ignore testcase names in .info file.  This may improve performance and reduce memory consumption if user does not need per-testcase coverage summary in coverage reports.

              This is equivalent to the "--forget-test-names" lcov/genhtml option.

              Default is 0.

       geninfo_checksum = 0|1
       checksum = 0|1

              If  non-zero, generate source code checksums when capturing coverage data.  Checksums are useful to prevent merging coverage data from incompatible source code versions but checksum genera‐
              tion increases the size of coverage files and the time used to generate those files.

              The backward compatible geninfo_checksum option is deprecated.  Please use checksum instead.  The new option is preferred as it is more clear that the option is used by lcov and genhtml  as
              well as geninfo,

              This option can be overridden by the --checksum and --no-checksum command line options.

              Default is 0.

              Note that this options is somewhat subsumed by the version_script option - which does something similar, but at the 'whole file' level.

       geninfo_compat_libtool = 0|1

              If non-zero, enable libtool compatibility mode. When libtool compatibility mode is enabled, lcov will assume that the source code relating to a .da file located in a directory named ".libs"
              can be found in its parent directory.

              This option corresponds to the --compat-libtool and --no-compat-libtool command line option of geninfo.

              Default is 1.

       geninfo_external = 0|1

              If non-zero, capture coverage data for external source files.

              External  source  files are files which are not located in one of the directories (including sub-directories) specified by the --directory or --base-directory options of lcov/geninfo.  Also
              see the --follow option and the geninfo_follow_symlinks and geninfo_follow_file_links for additional path controls.

              Default is 1.

       geninfo_capture_all = 0|1

              If non-zero, capture coverage data from both runtime data files as well as compile time data files which have no corresponding runtime data.  See the --all flag description in  man(1)  gen‐
              info for more information.

              Default is 0:  do not process bare compile-time data files.

       geninfo_external = 0|1

              If non-zero, capture coverage data for external source files.

              External  source  files are files which are not located in one of the directories (including sub-directories) specified by the --directory or --base-directory options of lcov/geninfo.  Also
              see the --follow option and the geninfo_follow_file_links for additional path controls.

              Default is 1.

       geninfo_follow_symlinks = 0|1

              Equivalent to the lcov/geninfo --follow command line option.  See man geninfo(1) for details.

              Default is 0:  do not modify follow symbolic links.

       geninfo_follow_file_links = 0|1

              If non-zero and the lcov/geninfo --follow command line option is specified, then source file pathnames which contain symlinks are resolved to their actual target.  Note that the parent  di‐
              rectory of the link target may be considered 'external' and thus be removed by the --no-external flag.

              Default is 0:  do not modify pathnames.

       geninfo_gcov_all_blocks = 0|1

              If non-zero, call the gcov tool with option --all-blocks.

              Using  --all-blocks  will  produce  more  detailed branch coverage information for each line. Set this option to zero if you do not need detailed branch coverage information to speed up the
              process of capturing code coverage or to work around a bug in some versions of gcov which will cause it to endlessly loop when analyzing some files.

              Default is 1.

       geninfo_unexecuted_blocks = 0|1

              If non-zero, adjust the 'hit' count of lines which have attribute unexecuted_block : true but which contain no branches and have a non-zero count.  Assume that these lines are not executed.

              Note that this option is effective only for gcov versions 9 and newer.

              Default is 0.

       geninfo_compat = mode=value[,mode=value,...]

              Specify that geninfo should enable one or more compatibility modes when capturing coverage data.

              This option corresponds to the --compat command line option of geninfo.

              Default is 'libtool=on, hammer=auto, split_crc=auto'.

       geninfo_adjust_src_path = pattern => replacement
       geninfo_adjust_src_path = pattern

              Adjust source paths when capturing coverage data.

              Use this option in situations where geninfo cannot find the correct path to source code files of a project. By providing a pattern in Perl regular expression format (see perlre(1))  and  an
              optional replacement string, you can instruct geninfo to remove or change parts of the incorrect source path.

              Example:

              1. When geninfo reports that it cannot find source file

                  /path/to/src/.libs/file.c

              while the file is actually located in

                  /path/to/src/file.c

              use the following parameter:

                  geninfo_adjust_src_path = /.libs

              This will remove all "/.libs" strings from the path.

              2. When geninfo reports that it cannot find source file

                  /tmp/build/file.c

              while the file is actually located in

                  /usr/src/file.c

              use the following parameter:

                  geninfo_adjust_src_path = /tmp/build => /usr/src

              This will change all "/tmp/build" strings in the path to "/usr/src".

              The  adjust_src_path  option  is  similar  to  the  substitution  =  ...  option - which is somewhat more general and allows you to specify multiple substitution patterns.  Also see the re‐
              solve_script option.

       source_directory = dirname

              Add 'dirname' to the list of places to look for source files.  Also see the --source-directory entry in the lcov, geninfo, and genhtml man pages.

              For relative source file paths e.g., found in some tracefile or in gcov output, first look for the path from 'cwd' (where genhtml was invoked) and then from each alternate directory name in
              the order specified.  The first location matching location is used.

              This option can be specified multiple times, to add more directories to the source search path.

              Note that the command line option overrides the RC file entries (if any).

       build_directory = dirname

              Add 'dirname' to the list of places to look for matching GCNO files (geninfo) or source file soft links (genhtml).  See the the --build-directory description in the geninfo and in the  gen‐
              html man page.

              This option can be specified multiple times, to add more directories to the source search path.

              Note that the command line option overrides the RC file entries (if any).

       geninfo_auto_base = 0|1

              If non-zero, apply a heuristic to determine the base directory when collecting coverage data.

              Use this option when using geninfo on projects built with libtool or similar build environments that work with multiple base directories, i.e. environments, where the current working direc‐
              tory when invoking the compiler is not the same directory in which the source code file is located, and in addition, is different between files of the same project.

              Default is 1.

       geninfo_intermediate = 0|1|auto

              Specify whether to use gcov intermediate format

              Use  this option to control whether geninfo should use the gcov intermediate format while collecting coverage data. The use of the gcov intermediate format should increase processing speed.
              It also provides branch coverage data when using the --initial command line option.

              Valid values are 0 for off, 1 for on, and "auto" to let geninfo automatically use immediate format when supported by gcov.

              Default is "auto".

       geninfo_no_exception_branch = 0|1
       no_exception_branch = 0|1

              Specify whether to exclude exception branches from branch coverage.  Whether C++ exception branches are identified and removed is dependent on your compiler/toolchain correctly marking them
              in the generated coverage data.

              This option is used by lcov, geninfo, genhtml.

              The value no_exception_branch = 1 is equivalent to the --filter exception command line option.

              The backward compatible geninfo_no_exception_branch option is deprecated.  Please use no_exception_branch instead.  The new option is preferred as it is more clear that the option  is  used
              by lcov and genhtml as well as geninfo,

              Default is 0.

       geninfo_chunk_size = integer[%]

              Specify  the  number  of  GCDA files which should be processed per-call in each child process.  This parameter affects the balance of CPU time spent in the child and thus the number of com‐
              pleted child processes which are queued to be merged into the parent - which then affects the queuing delay.  Higher queuing delay lowers the effective parallelism.

              The default is 80% of total_number_of_gcda_files / maximum_number_of_parallel_children, the average number of files expected to be processed by each child.  See the --parallel entry in  the
              geninfo man page.

              The argument may be either an integer value to be used as the chunk size or a percentage of the average number files processed per child.

              This option has no effect unless the --parallel option has been specified.

       geninfo_interval_update = integer

              Seet the percentage of GCDA files which should be processed between console/progress updates.  This setting may be useful for parameter tuning and debugging apparent performance issues.

              The default is 5%.

              This option has no effect unless the --parallel option has been specified.

       lcov_filter_chunk_size = integer[%]

              Specify  the number of source files which should be processed per-call in each child process when applying coverpoint filters - see the filter=...  parameter, below.  This parameter affects
              the balance of CPU time spent in the child and thus the number of completed child processes which are queued to be merged into the parent - which then affects  the  queuing  delay.   Higher
              queuing delay lowers the effective parallelism.

              The default is 80% of total_number_of_source_files / maximum_number_of_parallel_children.

              The argument may be either an integer value to be used as the chunk size or a percentage of the average number files processed per child.

              This option has no effect unless the --parallel option has been specified and lcov_filter_parallel is not zero.

       lcov_filter_parallel = 0 | 1

              This option specifies whether coverpoint filtering should be done serially or in parallel.  If the number of files to process is very large, then parallelization may improve performance.

              This option has no effect unless the --parallel option has been specified.

              The default is 1 (enabled).

       lcov_gcov_dir = path_to_kernel_coverage_data

              Specify the path to the directory where kernel coverage data can be found or leave undefined for auto-detection.

              Default is auto-detection.

       lcov_tmp_dir = temp

              Specify the location of a directory used for temporary files.

              Default is '/tmp'.

       lcov_list_full_path = 0|1

              If non-zero, print the full path to source code files during a list operation.

              This option corresponds to the --list-full-path option of lcov.

              Default is 0.

       lcov_list_max_width = width

              Specify the maximum width for list output. This value is ignored when lcov_list_full_path is non-zero.

              Default is 80.

       lcov_list_truncate_max  = percentage

              Specify the maximum percentage of file names which may be truncated when choosing a directory prefix in list output. This value is ignored when lcov_list_full_path is non-zero.

              Default is 20.

       function_coverage = 0|1

              Specify whether lcov/geninfo/genhtml should generate, process, and display function coverage data.

              Turning  off function coverage by setting this option to 0 can sligly reduce memory and CPU time consumption when lcov is collecting and processing coverage data, as well as reduce the size
              of the resulting data files.

              This option can be overridden by the --function-coverage and --no-function-coverage command line options.

              Backward-compatible RC options lcov_function_coverage and genhtml_function_coverage are supported but deprecated.  Please use the new option instead.

              Default is 1.

       branch_coverage = 0|1

              Specify whether lcov/geninfo should generate, process, and display branch coverage data.

              Turning off branch coverage by setting this option to 0 can reduce memory and CPU time consumption when lcov is collecting and processing coverage data, as well as reduce the  size  of  the
              resulting data files.

              This option can be overridden by the --branch-coverage and --no-branch-coverage
               command line options.

              Backward-compatible RC options lcov_branch_coverage and genhtml_branch_coverage are supported but deprecated.  Please use the new option instead.

              Default is 0.

       mcdc_coverage = 0|1

              Specify whether lcov/geninfo should generate, process, and display Modified Condition / Decision Coverage (MC/DC) coverage data.

              Turning off MC/DC coverage by setting this option to 0 can reduce memory and CPU time consumption when lcov is collecting and processing coverage data, as well as reduce the size of the re‐
              sulting data files.

              This option can be overridden by the --mcdc-coverage
               command line option.

              Default is 0 (not enabled).

              See the MC/DC section of man genhtml(1) for more details

       lcov_excl_line = expression

              Specify the regular expression of lines to exclude.  Line, branch, and function coverpoints are associated with lines where this regexp is found are dropped.

              There are at least 2 (moderately) common use cases for custom exclusion markers:
              - You are using multiple tools for coverage analysis, each of which has its own directives, and you don't want to complicate your source code with directives for each of them.
              - You want to exclude different regions/different types of code in different contexts - for example, to ignore or not ignore debug/trace code depending on your team.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_LINE'.

       lcov_excl_br_line = expression

              Specify  the  regular  expression  of lines to exclude from branch coverage.  Branch coverpoints are associated with lines where this regexp is found are dropped.  (Line and function cover‐
              points are not affected.)

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_BR_LINE'.

       lcov_excl_exception_br_line = expression

              Specify the regular expression of lines to exclude from exception branch coverage.  Exception-related Branch coverpoints associated with lines  where  this  regexp  is  found  are  dropped.
              (Line, function coverpoints are not affected.  Branch coverpoints which are not associated with exceptions are also not affected.)

              Also see 'geninfo_no_exception_branch'; if nonzero, then all identified exception branches will be removed.

              Note that this feature requires support from your compiler - and thus may not ignore all exception-related coverpoints.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_EXCEPTION_BR_LINE'.

       lcov_excl_start = expression

              Specify the regexp mark the start of an exception region All coverpoints within exception regions are dropped.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_START'.

       lcov_excl_stop = expression

              Specify the regexp mark the end of an exception region

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_STOP'.

       lcov_excl_br_start = expression

              Specify the regexp used to mark the start of a region where branch coverpoints are excluded.  Line and function coverpoints within the region are not excluded.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_BR_START'.

       lcov_excl_br_stop = expression

              Specify the regexp used to mark the end of a region where branch coverpoints are excluded.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_BR_STOP'.

       lcov_excl_exception_br_start = expression

              Specify  the regexp used to mark the start of a region where branch coverpoints associated with exceptions are excluded.  Line, function, and non-exception branch coverpoints within the re‐
              gion are not excluded.

              Also see 'geninfo_no_exception_branch'; if nonzero, then all identified exception branches will be removed.

              Note that exception branch coverpoint identification requires support from your compiler - and thus may not ignore all exception-related coverpoints.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_EXCEPTION_BR_START'.

       lcov_excl_exception_br_stop = expression

              Specify the regexp used to mark the end of a region where exception-related branch coverpoints are excluded.

              Default is 'LCOV_EXCL_EXECEPTION_BR_STOP'.

       fail_under_branches = percentage

              Specify branch coverage threshold:  if the branch coverage is below this threshold, lcov/genhtml/geninfo will generate all the normal result files and messages, but will return  a  non-zero
              exit code.

              This option is equivalent to the --fail-under-branches lcov/genhtml/geninfo command line argument.  See man lcov(1) for more detailes.

              The default is 0 (no threshold).

       fail_under_lines = percentage

              Specify  line  coverage threshold to lcov.  If the line coverage is below this threshold, lcov/genhtml/geninfo will generate all the normal result files and messages, but will return a non-
              zero exit code.

              This option is equivalent to the --fail-under-lines lcov/genhtml/geninfo command line argument.

              The default is 0 (no threshold).

       profile = filename

              If set, tells genhtml, lcov, or geninfo to generate some execution time/profile data which can be used to motivate future optimizations.  It is equivalent to the --profile command line  op‐
              tion.

              If filename is empty, then the profile is written to the default location chosen by the application.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

              The default is unset: no data generated.

       parallel = integer

              Tells  genhtml, lcov, or geninfo the maximum number of simultaneous processes to use.  Zero means to use as many cores as are available on the machine.  The default is 1 (one) - which means
              to process sequentially (no parallelism).

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       memory = integer_Mb

              Tells genhtml, lcov, or geninfo the maximum memory to use during parallel processing operations.  Effectively, the process will not fork() if this limit would be exceeded.  Zero means  that
              there is no limit.  The default is 0 (zero) - which that there is no explicit limit.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       memory_percentage = number

              Tells genhtml, lcov, or geninfo the maximum memory to use during parallel processing operations.   Maximum is computed as a percentage of the total memory available on the system; for exam‐
              ple,  '75' would use limit to 75% of total memory, whereas 150.5 would limit to 150.5% ( i.e., larger than the total available.  Effectively, the process will not fork() if this limit would
              be exceeded.  Note that this value is used only if the maximum memory value is not set explicitly - either by a the --memory command line option or the memory = integer  configuration  file
              setting.

              The default is not not set.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       max_fork_fails = integer

              Tells  genhtml,  lcov, or geninfo the number of consecutive fork() failures to ignore during --parallel execution before giving up.  Note that genhtml/lcov/geninfo fail and stop immediately
              unless the fork error message ignored - either via the ignore_errors directive (above), the --ignore-errors command line option, or if stop_on_error is disabled or the --keep-going  command
              line option is used.

              The default fork failure maximum is 5.

       fork_fail_timeout = integer_seconds

              Tells genhtml, lcov, or geninfo how long to wait after a fork() failure before retrying.

              The default is 10 (seconds).

       max_tasks_per_core = integer

              This is the maximum number of files that genhtml will handle in a single child process during parallel execution.

              The default is 20.

       genhtml_date_bins = integer[,integer..]

              This option is equivalent to the "genhtml --date-bins" option.  See man genhtml(1) for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to set multiple cutpoints.

       genhtml_datelabels = string[,string..]

              This option is equivalent to the "genhtml --date-labels" option.  See man genhtml(1) for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to set multiple labels.  The number of labels should equal one greater than number of cutpoints.

       genhtml_annotate_script = path_to_executable|parameter

              This option is equivalent to the "genhtml --annotate-script" option.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both an annotation script and additional options which are passed to the script.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       genhtml_annotate_tooltip = tooltip_string

              This  option  sets the 'tooltip' popup which appears if user hovers mouse over the associated source code.  Note that the tooltop is generated only if the annotation-script callback is suc‐
              cessful and returns a commit ID other than "NONE".  Set tooltip_string to "" (empty string) to force genhtml to not produce the tooltip.

              Substitutions are performed on tooltip_string:

              %C:
              commit ID (from annotate callback - see --anotate-script entry in the genhtml man page)

              %U:
              commit author abbreviated name (returned by annotate callback)

              %F:
              commit author full name (returned by annotate callback)

              %D:
              commit date (as returned by annotate callback)

              %d:
              commit date with time of day removed (i.e., date part only)

              %A:
              commit age.

              %l
              source line number.

       context_script = path_to_executable_or_module|parameter

              This option is equivalent to the --context-script option of genhtml/lcov/geninfo

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both a criteria script and additional options which are passed to the script.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       criteria_script = path_to_executable_or_module|parameter

              This option is equivalent to the --criteria-script option of genhtml/lcov/geninfo

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both a criteria script and additional options which are passed to the script.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       criteria_callback_data = comma_separated_list

              This option is used to tell genhtml whether you want date and/or owner summary data passed back to your criteria callback.  Note that summary data is always passed.

              Note that lcov and geninfo do not record date or owner data - and so do not pass it to the callback.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both date and owner data should be returned, or you can specify both in a  comma-separated list.  Date and/or owner data
              will be returned if and only if your genhtml command has enabled annotation.

              If this option is appears multiple times in the lcovrc file; the values are combined to form the list of binning types which are passed to your callback.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       criteria_callback_levels = comma_separated_list

              This option is used to tell genhtml whether criteria callbacks should occur at the top, directory, or file level.

              If this option is appears multiple times in the lcovrc file, the values are combined to form the list of report levels when your callback will be executed.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       check_existence_before_callback = 0|1

              This option configures the tool to check that the file exists before calling the annotate-script or version-script callback.  If set and file does not exist, a source  error  is  triggered.
              (Note that the error may be ignored - see the --ignore-error option.)

              You may want to NOT check for file existence if your callback looks up information in a non-local repository.

              The default is 1 (check for file existence).

       compute_file_version = 0|1

              This  option is used to tell the tool to generate missing file version information when reading a .info (coverage data) file.  Version information may be missing because the data was gener‐
              ated by a tool which did not support versioning, or because the data was generated without the required --version-script argument - or for some other reason.

              Note that this option has no effect without a version-script callback - defined by either the --version-script command line option or the version_script config file option.

              The default is 0:  do not generate missing information.

       version_script = path_to_executable|parameter

              This option is equivalent to the geninfo/lcov/genhtml "--version-script" option.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both a version script and additional options which are passed to the script.

              See the genhtml man page for details.

       resolve_script = path_to_executable|parameter

              This option is equivalent to the geninfo/lcov/genhtml "--resolve-script" option.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both a resolve script and additional options which are passed to the script.

              The resolve script provides a mechanism to find a source or data file that cannot be found by simply modify paths via substitution patterns  (see  substitute  =  replace_regexp  above)  and
              searching along the corresponding directory list:

                     geninfo: the 'build_directory = dirname' config file entry or --build=directory command line option, used to search for GCNO files,

                     geninfo/genhtml/lcov: the 'source_directory = dirname' config file entry or --source=directory command line option, used to search for source files.

              The resolve script is called as:

                     resolve_script [callback_args]  file_name

              or

                     $resolve_callback = resolve_module ->new([callback_args])

              to initialize the callback, then

                     $resolve_callback-> resolve (file_name)

              to find the actual file location.

              If necessary, the callback can check the suffix of the filename to determine whether it should look for either a source or data file.

              The script should return either empty string (file not found/no such file) or the actual path name.  The returned path may be either absolute or relative to CWD.

       select_script = path_to_executable|parameter

              This option is equivalent to the genhtml "--select-script" option.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify both a select script and additional options which are passed to the script.

              The select script provides a mechanism to decide whether a particular source line is interesting - whether it should be included in the generated coverage report - or not.

              Lines which are not selected but fall within num_context_lines of a selected line are also included in the report.  See below.

              Note  that  selection is fundamentally intended to show regions of code with some surrounding context.  It might not do what you expect if there is no code - e.g., if the region of interest
              has been compiled out via compiler or exclusion directives.  For example: when selecting based on SHA or changelist ID, an inserted comment will not be selected unless it is within num_con‐
              text_lines of an inserted or changed line of code.

              The select script is called as:

                 select_script [callback_args] lineDataJson annotateDataJson fileName lineNumber

              or as:

                 $selectCallback = select_module ->new([callback_args])

              to initialize the callback object, then as

                  $selectCallback select (lineDataRef annotateDataRef fileName lineNumber)

              to determine selection, where

              -  fileName is the name of the source file and

              -  lineNumber is the source file line number, indexed from zero,

              -  lineDataJson is a json-encoded LineData structure (see the lcovutil.pm source code), and

              -  annotateDataJson is the json-encoded data returned by your annotate-script (see the --annotate-script parameter in man genhtml(1).  ), or the empty string if there are no annotations for
                 this file.

              The module callback is similar except that is is passed objects rather than JSON encodings of the objects.

       The script should return "1" or "0".

       See example implementation $LCOV_HOME/share/lcov/support-scripts/select.pm.

       num_context_lines = integer

              Set the number of lines around each selected line which is included in the report - see select_script = ...  above and the --select-script command line option in man genhtml(1).

       filter = str[,str...]

              This option is equivalent to the --filter option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the genhtml man page for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to enable multiple filters.  The filters specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the command line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       exclude = glob_pattern

              This option is equivalent to the --exclude option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the lcov man page for details.;

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple patterns to exclude.  The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the  com‐
              mand line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       include = glob_pattern

              This option is equivalent to the --include option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the lcov man page for details.;

              This  option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple patterns to include.  The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the com‐
              mand line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       substitute = regexp

              This option is equivalent to the --substitute option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the lcov man page for details.;

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple substitution patterns.  The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the  list  specified  on  the
              command line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       omit_lines = regexp

              This option is equivalent to the --omit-lines option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the genhtml man page for details.

              This  option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple patterns to exclude.  The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the com‐
              mand line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       erase_functions = regexp

              This option is equivalent to the --erase-functions option to geninfo, lcov, and genhtml.  See the genhtml man page for details.

              This option can be used multiple times in the lcovrc file to specify multiple patterns to exclude.  The patterns specified in the lcovrc file are appended to the list specified on the  com‐
              mand line.

              This option is used by genhtml, lcov, and geninfo.

       lcov_json_module = module|auto

              Specify  the  JSON module to use, or choose best available from a set of alternatives if set to 'auto'. Note that some JSON modules are slower than others (notably JSON::PP can be very slow
              compared to JSON::XS).

              Default is 'auto'.

       split_char = char

              Specify the character (or regexp) used to split list-like parameters which have been passed as a single string.  This parameter is useful in the case that you need want to use  a  multi-op‐
              tion string but one or more of the options contains a comma character which would otherwise be seen as a delimiter.

              Default is ',' (comma - no quotes).

       scope_regexp = regexp

              Print debug messages for data in filenames which match regexp.
              Only certain categories of message are logged; the set changes from time to time - depending on debug need.

       case_insensitive = [0|1]

              Specify whether string comparison is case insensitive when finding matching filenames, checking include/exclude directives, etc.

              Note  that  mixed-case or lower-case pathnames may be passed to your --version-script and --annotate-script callbacks when case-insensitive matching is used.  Your callbacks must handle po‐
              tential differences in case.

              Default is '0':  case sensitive matching.

       sort_input = [0|1]

              Specify whether to sort file names before capture and/or aggregation.  Sorting reduces certain types of processing order-dependent output differences - e.g., due to  ambiguities  in  branch
              data generated by gcc.

              Default is '0':  no sorting - process files in the order they were specified on the command line and/or were found during traversal of the filesystem.
