NAME
       ganesha-rgw-config - NFS Ganesha RGW Configuration File

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/ganesha/rgw.conf

       /etc/ganesha/rgw_bucket.conf

DESCRIPTION
       NFS-Ganesha install two config examples for RGW FSAL:
       /etc/ganesha/rgw.conf

       /etc/ganesha/rgw_bucket.conf

       This file lists RGW specific config options.

   EXPORT { }
       RGW supports exporting both the buckets and filesystem.

   EXPORT { FSAL {} }
       Name(string, "RGW")
              Name of FSAL should always be RGW.

       User_Id(string, no default)

       Access_Key(string, no default)

       Secret_Access_Key(string, no default)

   RGW {}
       The following configuration variables customize the startup of the FSAL's radosgw instance.

       ceph_conf
              optional full-path to the Ceph configuration file (equivalent to passing "-c /path/to/ceph.conf" to any Ceph binary

       name   optional  instance name (equivalent to passing "--name client.rgw.foohost" to the radosgw binary);  the value provided here should be the same as the section name (sans brackets) of the ra‐
              dosgw facility in the Ceph configuration file (which must exist)

       cluster
              optional cluster name (equivalent to passing "--cluster foo" to any Ceph binary);  use of a non-default value for cluster name is uncommon, but can be verified by examining the startup  op‐
              tions of Ceph binaries

       init_args
              additional  argument strings which will be passed verbatim to the radosgw instance startup process as if they had been given on the radosgw command line provided for customization in uncom‐
              mon setups
