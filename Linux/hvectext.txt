NAME
       hvectext - construct Geomview VECT text object from Hershey fonts

SYNOPSIS
       hvectext [-w totallength] [-s textheight] [-plane xy|xz|yz] [-at X Y Z]
            [-align n|s|e|w|ne|nw|se|sw|c] [-hershey fontfile.gsf] [--] text
            string ...

DESCRIPTION
       Hvectext  generates a Geomview/OOGL vector-text object, of given height
       or total length (default -s .25).  It aligns the given 3-D  point  (de‐
       fault  -at 0 0 0) with the given corner of the text (default -align c).
       Alignment specs are like  geographic  directions;  -align sw  puts  the
       ``at'' point at the ``southwest'' corner of the text, so that its lower
       left corner is at that coordinate.

       The corresponding VECT object is written to  standard  output.   If  no
       non-blank  text characters are given, hvectext produces a null geom ob‐
       ject ("{ }") as output.

       The special option -- marks the end of options; it's useful in case the
       text itself begins with a hyphen.

       Hvectext  accepts  Ghostscript  Hershey  fonts; the built-in default is
       Hershey-Plain-Simplex   a.k.a.   hrpl_s.gsf.    Others   of   interest:
       hrsy_r.gsf  (Symbol),  hrpl_t.gsf  (Triplex).  For a complete list, see
       all the Ghostscript font files of nontrivial  size  whose  names  begin
       with "hr".

       Although  there's  no  way to switch fonts within the string, the first
       line of output from hvectext is an OOGL comment resembling:
       # Continue with: -align sw -plane xy -s 0.25 -at 1.24378 0 0
       giving options for hvectext to continue the string where it left off.

ENVIRONMENT
       GS_FONTPATH, if present, is a colon-separated list  of  directories  in
       which Hershey font files are sought.

FILES
       perl (either version 4 or 5) must be installed.

       /usr/local/lib/ghostscript/fonts  is  searched if -hershey is given and
       GS_FONTPATH isn't set.
