NAME
       oligotm - Prints oligo's melting temperature on stdout

SYNOPSIS
       oligotm [OPTIONS] {oligo}

       where oligo is a DNA sequence of between 2 and 36 bases

DESCRIPTION
       oligotm prints the melting temperature of a given deoxyribonucleotide on the standard output. It is part of the oligotm library.

OPTIONS
       -mv monovalent_conc
           Concentration of monovalent cations in mM, by default 50 mM.

       -dv divalent_conc
           Concentration of divalent cations in mM, by default 0 mM.

       -n dNTP_conc
           Concentration of deoxynucleotide triphosphate in mM, by default 0 mM.

       -d dna_conc
           Concentration of DNA strands in nM, by default 50 nM.

       -tp [0|1]
           Specifies the table of thermodynamic parameters and the method of melting temperature calculation:

           •   0 Breslauer et al., 1986 and Rychlik et al., 1990 (used by primer3 up to and including release 1.1.0). This is the default, but not the recommended value.

           •   1 Use nearest neighbor parameter from SantaLucia 1998.  This is the recommended value.

       -sc [0..2]
           Specifies salt correction formula for the melting temperature calculation:

           •   0 Schildkraut and Lifson 1965, used by primer3 up to and including release 1.1.0. This is the default, but not the recommended value.

           •   1 SantaLucia 1998.  This is the recommended value.

           •   2 Owczarzy et al., 2004.

       -i
           prints references to publications which were used for thermodynamic calculations.
