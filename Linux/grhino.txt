NAME
       grhino - othello/reversi boardgame

SYNOPSIS
       grhino

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the grhino command.

       grhino  is  an  Othello/Reversi  game  on Linux and other UNIX-like systems.  What distinguish GRhino from most other Othello games is that GRhino will be targeted for experienced Othello players.
       Strong AI is the main focus with some additional good, useful features (like an endgame solver) is planned. The ultimate target strength of the AI is that it should be able to beat the best  human
       player at the highest difficulty level. Beating Logistello (the strongest program available) is not in the plan :)
