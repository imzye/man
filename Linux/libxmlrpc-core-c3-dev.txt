NAME
       xmlrpc - makes an XML-RPC remote procedure call and displays the response

SYNOPSIS
             xmlrpc url method parameters [-transport=transportname]
                                          [-username=username -password=passwd]
                                          [-curlinterface={interface|host}]
                                          [-curlnoverifypeer]
                                          [-curlnoverifyhost]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is used to execute Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) using a XML-RPC client. Its main purpose is debugging and learning since RPC are usually embedded in source code of other programs.

ARGUMENTS
       url    This  is  the  URL of the XML-RPC server. As XML-RPC uses HTTP, this must be an HTTP url. However, if you don't specify a type ("http:") in the URL, xmlrpc assumes an "http://" prefix and a
              "/RPC2" suffix. RPC2 is the conventional file name for an XML-RPC responder.

       method The name of the XML-RPC method you want to invoke.

       parameters
              List of parameters for the RPC. xmlrpc turns each of these arguments into an XML-RPC parameter, in the order given. You may specify no parameters if you like.

              You specify the data type of the parameter with a prefix ending in a slash. Example: i/5. Here, the "i" signifies an integer data type. "5" is the value.

              xmlrpc is capable of only a subset of the possible XML-RPC types, as follows by prefix:

              i/ integer (<i4>) (32 bit).

              s/ string (<string>).

              h/ byte string (<base64>). Specify the value in hexadecimal.

              b/ boolean (<boolean>). Specify the value as "true" or "t" for true; "false" or "f" for false.

              d/ double (<double>) - i.e. real number.

              n/ nil (<nil>).

              I/ 64 bit integer (<i8>).

OPTIONS
       -transport=transportname
              This selects the XML transport facility (e.g. libwww) that xmlrpc uses to perform the RPC. The name transportname is one that the Xmlrpc-c programming library recognizes. This is  typically
              libwww, curl, and wininet. By default, xmlrpc lets the Xmlrpc-c library choose.

       -username=username

       -password=passwd
              These  two options, which must be used together, cause the client to authenticate itself to the server, if the server requires it, using HTTP Basic Authentication and the specified username
              and password.

       -curlinterface={interface|host}
              This option gives the "interface" option for a Curl XML transport. The exact meaning of this option is up to the Curl library, and the best documentation for it is the manual for the 'curl'
              program that comes with the Curl library. But essentially, it chooses the local network interface through which to send the RPC. It causes the Curl library to perform a "bind" operation  on
              the  socket it uses for the communication. It can be the name of a network interface (e.g. on Linux, "eth1") or an IP address of the interface or a host name that resolves to the IP address
              of the interface. Unfortunately, you can't explicitly state which form you're specifying, so  there's  some  ambiguity.   Examples:  -interface=eth1  -interface=64.171.19.66  -interface=gi‐
              raffe.giraffe-data.com This option causes xmlrpc to default to using the Curl XML transport. You may not specify any other transport.

       -curlnoverifypeer
              This  option gives the "no_ssl_verifypeer" option for the Curl XML transport, which is essentially the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option of the Curl library. See the curl_easy_setopt() man page
              for details on this, but essentially it means that the client does not authenticate the server's certificate of identity -- it just believes whatever the server says. You may  want  to  use
              -curlnoverifyhost  as  well.  Since you're not authenticating the server's identity, there's not much sense in checking it. This option causes xmlrpc to default to using the Curl XML trans‐
              port.  You may not specify any other transport.

       -curlnoverifyhost
              This option gives the "no_ssl_verifyhost" option for the Curl XML transport, which is essentially the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST option of the Curl library. See the curl_easy_setopt() man  page
              for  details on this, but essentially it means that the client does not verify the server's identity. It just assumes that if the server answers the IP address of the server as indicated by
              the URL (probably via host name), then it's the intended server. You may want to use -curlnoverifypeer as well. As long as you don't care who the server says it is, there's no point in  au‐
              thenticating its identity. This option causes xmlrpc to default to using the Curl XML transport. You may not specify any other transport.

EXAMPLES
       $ xmlrpc http://localhost:8080/RPC2 sample.add i/3 i/5

       Result: Integer: 8

       $ xmlrpc localhost:8080 sample.add i/3 i/5

       Result: Integer: 8

       $ xmlrpc http://xmlrpc.example.com/~bryanh echostring "s/This is a string"

       Result: String: This is a string

       $ xmlrpc http://xmlrpc.example.com/~bryanh echostring "This is a string in shortcut syntax"

       Result: String: This is a string in shortcut syntax

       $ xmlrpc http://xmlrpc.example.com sample.add i/3 i/5 -transport=curl -curlinterface=eth1 -username=bryanh -password=passw0rd

       Result: Integer: 8

LIMITATIONS
       If  you  run xmlrpc in an environment in which programs get their arguments encoded some way other than UTF-8, xmlrpc will generate garbage for the XML-RPC call and display garbage for the XML-RPC
       response. Typically, you control this aspect of the environment with a LANG environment variable.  One safe value for LANG is "C".
