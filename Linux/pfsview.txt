NAME
       pfsview - Viewer for high-dynamic range images in pfs format

SYNOPSIS
       pfsview [--window_min <log_lum>] [--window_max <log_lum>]

DESCRIPTION
       pfsview is a QT application for viewing high-dynamic range images. It expects pfs stream on the standard input and displays the frames in that stream one by one.

       pfsv script can be more convienent to use if hdr images are to be displayed without any prior processing.

DYNAMIC RANGE WINDOW
       To  show  high-dynamic  range data on a low-dynamic range monitor, pfsview uses concept of a dynamic range window. The dynamic range window is the highest and lowest value that should be mapped to
       black and white pixel. Values above or below the window are clipped (see clipping methods below). The dynamic range window is displayed in pfsview as a blue area on the dynamic range scale (second
       toolbox from the top). The window can be moved, shrunk and expended using a mouse or a keyboard.

CLIPPING METHODS
       Currently, two clipping methods are available (see View menu):

       Simple clipping
              The values above and below the dynamic range window are displayed as black or white.

       Color-coded clipping
              The values above the dynamic range window are displayed as yellow and below the window as green. This is helpful to see which parts of the image do not fit into the selected dynamic range.

       Keep brightness and hue
              This method tries to preserve brightness and hue while sacrificing color saturation when the colors exceed the RGB color gamut. Colors are desaturated in the RGB  color  space  towards  the
              neutral color (D65) of the corresponding luminance.

MAPPING METHODS
       High-dynamic range data are usually better visualized using non-linear scale, for example a logarithmic or a power function. pfsview offers several such scales, shown in View menu. Gray-scale val‐
       ues for each mapping method are computed by the formulas:

       LINEAR: y = (x-min)/(max-min)

       GAMMA: y = [ (x-min)/(max-min) ]^gamma

       LOGARITHMIC: y = (log10(x)-log10(min))/(log10(max)-log10(min))

       where y is the gray-scale value after mapping, x is an input HDR value, min and max are lower and upper bounds of the dynamic range window.

REPRODUCING MAPPING WITH PFSGAMMA
       To reproduce the displayed image and save it to LDR image using pfs commands, you can use the following commands:

       pfsin image.hdr | pfsgamma -g 2.2 -m 0.01 | pfsout image.png

       where "2.2" is the gamma value from the "Mapping" combo box, and 0.01 is the exposure value. The exposure is shown as the right-most number in the window status bar of pfsview.

OPTIONS
       --window_min <log_lum>

              Lower  bound  of the values that should be displayed or minimum value of the dynamic range window. The value should be given in log_10 units, for example -1 if the lower bound should be 0.1
              (10^-1).

       --window_max <log_lum>
              Upper bound of the values that should be displayed or minimum value of the dynamic range window. The value should be given in log_10 units, for example -1 if the upper bound should  be  0.1
              (10^-1).

EXAMPLES
       pfsin memorial.hdr | pfsview
              See the memorial image.

       pfsv memorial.hdr
              The same as above, but using the utility script 'pv'.
