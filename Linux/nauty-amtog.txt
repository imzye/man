NAME
       nauty-amtog - read graphs in matrix format

SYNOPSIS
       amtog [-n#sgzhq] [-o#] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Read graphs in matrix format.

       -n#    Set the initial graph order to # (no default).  This can be overridden in the input.

       -g     Write the output in graph6 format (default).

       -s     Write the output in sparse6 format.

       -z     Write the output in digraph6 format.

       -h     Write a header (according to -g or -s).

       -w     Don't warn about loops (which are suppressed for -g)

       -q     Suppress auxiliary information.

       -o#    Treat digit # as 1 and other digits as 0.

              Input consists of a sequence of commands restricted to:

       n=#    set number of vertices (no default) The = is optional.

       m      Matrix to follow An 'm' is also assumed if a digit is encountered.

       M      Complement of matrix to follow (as m)

       t      Upper triangle of matrix to follow, row by row

              excluding the diagonal.

       T      Complement of upper trangle to follow (as t)

       s      Upper triangle of matrix to follow, row by row

              excluding the diagonal; lower triangle is complement.

       q      exit (optional)
