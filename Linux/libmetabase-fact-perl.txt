NAME
       metabase-profile - create a metabase profile

VERSION
       version 0.025

SYNOPSIS
         $ metabase-profile
         Enter full name: John Doe
         Enter email address: jdoe@example.com
         Enter password/secret: zqxjkh
         Writing profile to 'metabase_id.json'

USAGE
       The metabase-profile program makes it easy to create a user profile for submitting facts and reports to a Metabase server.

       Valid options include:

             --email   ADDRESS   user email address eg "jd@example.com"
             --name    FULLNAME  full user name, eg "John Doe"
         -o, --output  FILENAME  output filename
             --secret  PASSWORD  password for authentication
         -h, --help              print man page

       If no output file name is given, the default name 'metabase_id.json' will be used.  If the output filename (or default) exists, the program will abort rather than overwrite the file.  The output
       file will be in JSON and contain the user profile and the user's shared secret.

       Typically, when a Metabase server first receives a report from a new user profile, the shared secret is recorded and will be used to authenticate subsequent submissions.  The output should not be
       shared publicly or made group or world readable.

       Use the resulting file according to the instructions of your Metabase client program. You may wish to copy it across computers if you would like to be identified consistently when submitting
       reports from different locations.
