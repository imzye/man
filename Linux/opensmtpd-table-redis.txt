NAME
       table_redis — format description for smtpd redis tables

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the file format of redis tables used by the smtpd(8) mail daemon.

       The format described here applies to tables as defined in smtpd.conf(5).

REDIS TABLE
       A Redis table allows the storing of usernames, passwords, aliases, and domains in a redis server.

       The  table is used by smtpd(8) when authenticating a user, when user information such as user-id and/or home directory is required for a delivery, when a domain lookup may be required, and/or when
       looking for an alias.

       A Redis table consists of one Redis Databases with one or more keys.

       If the table is used for authentication, the password should be encrypted using the crypt(3) function.  Such passwords can be generated using the encrypt(1) utility or smtpctl(8) encrypt command.

REDIS TABLE CONFIG FILE
       master             This is the IP of the master redis server.  To connect via an unix socket use unix:/path/to/sock The default is 127.0.0.1

       master_port        This is the port used to connect to the master redis server.  The default is 6379

       slave              This is the IP of the slave redis server, if any.  To connect via an unix socket use unix:/path/to/sock

       slave_port         This is the port used to connect to the slave redis server if any.

       database           The database number to use.  The default is 0.

       password           The password to use to authenticate to the redis server if any.

       query_domain       This is used to provide a query for a domain query call.  All the '%s' are replaced with the appropriate data, in this case it would be the right hand side of the SMTP  address.
                          This expects one string to be returned with a matching domain name.

       query_userinfo     This  is  used  to provide a query for looking up user information.  All the '%s' are replaced with the appropriate data, in this case it would be the left hand side of the SMTP
                          address.  This expects three fields to be returned an int containing a UID, an int containing a GID and a string containing the home directory for the user.

       query_credentials  This is used to provide a query for looking up credentials.  All the '%s' are replaced with the appropriate data, in this case it would be the left hand side  of  the  SMTP  ad‐
                          dress.  the query expects that there are two strings returned one with a user name one with a password in encrypted format.

       query_alias        This  is used to provide a query to look up aliases.  All the '%s' are replaced with the appropriate data, in this case it would be the left hand side of the SMTP address.  This
                          expects one string to be returned with the user name the alias resolves to.  If the query returns an array, all the data will be concatenated into one string with ',' as a sepa‐
                          rator

       query_mailaddr     This is used to provide a query to check if a mail address exists.  All the '%s' are replaced with the appropriate data, in this case it would be the SMTP address.  This expects
                          an integer as a reply, 0 = false and 1 = true

EXAMPLES
       Due to the nature of redis, multiple schemas can be used.  Those provided here a known to work.

       domain
         Using a set for the domains:
               # redis-cli sadd domains example.net
         in the redis table configuration file:
               query_domain SISMEMBER domains %s

       userinfo
         Hash works well for users
               # redis-cli HSET user:foo uid 1001
               # redis-cli HSET user:foo gid 1001
               # redis-cli HSET user:foo maildir /mail/foo
         in the redis table configuration file :
               query_userinfo HMGET user:%s uid gid maildir

       credentials
         We can extend the hash for our user to put credential in it
               # redis-cli HSET user:foo login foo
               # redis-cli HSET user:foo passwd encrypted_password
         in the redis table configuration file:
               query_credentials HMGET user:%s login passwd

       alias
         Using redis sorted list:
               # redis-cli LPUSH aliases:foo@example.net foo
               # redis-cli LPUSH aliases:bar@example.net foo
         in the redis table configuration file:
               query_alias LRANGE aliases:%s 0 -1

       mailaddr
         Using a set for the addresses:
               # redis-cli sadd mailaddr foo@example.net
         in the redis table configuration file:
               query_mailaddr SISMEMBER mailaddr %s

HISTORY
       The first version of table_redis was written in 2015.  It was converted to the stdio protocol in 2024.
