NAME
       clc-clbuild - invoke lisp with clbuild active

SYNOPSIS
       clc-lisp

DESCRIPTION
       This is a thin wrapper round clbuild for use with common lisp controller.  In effect it will just run

       clbuild lisp

       this is not working at the moment due to a patch we need to have in clbuild

BUGS
       Bug reports should be sent to the debian BTS, preferably with reportbug.
