NAME
       Statistics::TopK - Implementation of the top-k streaming algorithm

SYNOPSIS
           use Statistics::TopK;

           my $counter = Statistics::TopK->new(10);
           while (my $val = <STDIN>) {
               chomp $val;
               $counter->add($val);
           }
           my @top = $counter->top;
           my %counts = $counter->counts;

DESCRIPTION
       The "Statistics::TopK" module implements the top-k streaming algorithm, also know as the "heavy hitters" algorithm. It is designed to process data streams and probabilistally calculate the "k"
       most frequent items while using limited memory.

       A typical example would be to determine the top 10 IP addresses listed in an access log. A simple solution would be to hash each IP address to a counter and then sort the resulting hash by the
       counter size. But the hash could theoretically require over 4 billion keys.

       The top-k algorithm only requires storage space proportional to the number of items of interest. It accomplishes this by sacrificing precision, as it is only a probabilistic counter.

METHODS
   new
           $counter = Statistics::TopK->new($k)

       Creates a new "Statistics::TopK" object which is prepared to count the top $k elements.

   add
           $count = $counter->add($element)

       Count the given $element and return its approximate count (if any) in the "Statistics::TopK" object.

       Note that adding an element does not guarantee it will be counted yet, as the algorithm is probabilistic, and the occurrence of the current element might only be used decrease the count of one of
       the current top elements.

   top
           @top = $counter->top()

       Returns a list of the top-k counted elements.

   counts
           %counts = $counter->counts()

       Returns a hash of the top-k counted elements and their counts.
