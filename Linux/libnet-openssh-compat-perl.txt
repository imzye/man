NAME
       Net::OpenSSH::Compat - Compatibility modules for Net::OpenSSH

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::OpenSSH::Compat 'Net::SSH2';
         use Net::OpenSSH::Compat 'Net::SSH::Perl';

DESCRIPTION
       This package contains a set of adapter modules that run on top of Net::OpenSSH providing the APIs of other SSH modules available from CPAN.

       Currently, there are adapters available for Net::SSH2 and Net::SSH::Perl. Adapters for Net::SSH and Net::SFTP are planned... maybe also for Net::SCP and Net::SCP::Expect if somebody request them.
