NAME
       ptosort - sort pto files with variable criteria

SYNOPSIS
       ptosort [options] infile.pto outfile.pto

        Options:
         -p | --point order    Provide a sorting order for control points
         -i | --image order    Provide a sorting order for images
         -c | --clean yes/no   Switch removal of duplicate control points
                               on/off, default is on
         -h | --help           Show the full manpage

DESCRIPTION
       ptosort takes a pto file as input, sorts it and writes a sorted pto file as output. By default images are sorted according to their filename and control points are sorted by left image number, right
       image number and y pixel coordinate.

       The --point and --image command line options can be used to modify the sorting order. The order string should consist of a list letters separated by commas identifying the values to be taken for the
       comparison, e.g. for images y means yaw or r means roll. By default sorting for yaw (y), pitch (p), roll (r) and exposure (Eev) is fuzzy, i.e. values within an interval of 10 degress for yaw are
       considered to be the same. This is especially useful when sorting multirow panoramas. Appending a colon to the sort parameter forces strict sorting without fuzziness, while appending a tilde and a
       numerical value can be used to specify the fuzziness in terms of intervall width.

EXAMPLES
       ptosort --image n --point n,N,y in.pto out.pto
            Sort the images by filename and the control points by left image number, right image number and y pixel coordinate. This is identical to the default behaviour without options.

       ptosort --image y in.pto out.pto
            Sort images by yaw and control points using the default.

       ptosort --image y,p,Eev in.pto out.pto
            Sort images in a multiraw panorama by position and exposure value.

       ptosort --image Eev:,y~5.5,p in.pto out.pto
            Sort strict without fuzziness by exposure value, with a fuzziness interval of 5.5 degree by yaw and by pitch.
