NAME
       sen - terminal user interface for docker engine

SYNOPSIS
       sen

DESCRIPTION
       sen is a terminal user interface for docker engine:

       •   it can interactively manage your containers and images: manage? start, stop, restart, kill, delete,...

       •   there is a "dashboard" view for containers and images

       •   you are able to inspect containers and images

       •   sen can fetch logs of containers and even stream logs real-time

       •   buffers support searching and filtering

       •   sen receives real-time updates from docker when anything changes e.g. if you pull a container in another terminal, sen will pick it up

       •   sen notifies you whenever something happens (and reports slow queries)

       •   supports a lot of vim-like keybindings (j, k, gg, /, ...)

       •   you can get interactive tree view of all images (equivalent of docker images --tree)
