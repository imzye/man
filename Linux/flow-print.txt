NAME
       flow-print - Display flows in formatted ASCII.

SYNOPSIS
       flow-print [ -hlnpw ]  [ -d debug_level ]  [ -f format ]

DESCRIPTION
       The flow-print utility will display flow data in ASCII using pre-defined formats selectable with -f.

       Some of the less descriptive column headers are defined below

                  1 2 line (includes timing and flags)
                  2 2 line candidate TCP syn attack flows
                  3 1 line, no interfaces, decimal ports
                  4 1 line with AS number
                  5 1 line, 132 column
                  6 show ip accounting emulation
                  7 1 line, 132 column +router_id
                  8 1 line, 132 column +encapsulation
                  9 1 line with tag values
