IDA(1)                 Image viewing and editing program                IDA(1)

NAME
       ida - image viewing and editing program

SYNOPSIS
       ida [options] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Ida  is  a  small  and  fast application for viewing images. Some basic
       editing functions are available too.

       You can specify any number of image files as arguments on  the  command
       line.  Or  you  can read a single image from stdin by specifying "-" as
       only argument ("xwd | ida -" works nice for screenshots).

OPTIONS
       Ida understands the usual toolkit options (-geometry + friends).  Addi‐
       tional options are:

       -help  print a short help text

       -pcd n Pick size for PhotoCD images (n = 1 .. 5, default 3).

       -debug Enable  debug messages. Also has the side effect that error mes‐
              sages are displayed on stderr only and not as message box.

GETTING STARTED
   Mouse functions
       With the left mouse button you can creates and edit a selection rectan‐
       gle.  The  middle  button  is used to start drag'n'drop operations. The
       right button brings up the control window with menus, toolbar and  file
       list.

   Keyboard Shortcuts
       Many keyboard shortcuts used by xv are available in ida too. If you are
       familiar with xv if should be easy for you to get started with ida.

       All available keyboard shortcuts are also listed in the  menus  of  the
       control window. The most important ones are listed below:

       SPACE  Next file.

       BACKSPACE
              Previous file.

       LEFT_ARROW, RIGHT_ARROW, UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW
              Scrolling (hold Ctrl key for big steps).

       +/-    Zoom in/out.

       q      Quit.

   Supported image formats
       Read:  BMP (uncompressed), PhotoCD, PPM, XBM, XPM, XWD, GIF, JPEG, PNG,
              TIFF. The last four are supported  using  the  usual  libraries,
              i.e. you need to have them installed at compile time.

       Write: JPEG, PNG, PostScript, PPM, TIFF.

   Using drag'n'drop
       Ida is a motif application and thus supports the motif drag'n'drop pro‐
       tocol in both directions. The xdnd protocol is supported too, but  only
       in one direction (receive drops).

       Ida  uses  the middle mouse button to start a drag'n'drop operation (as
       the motif style guide suggests). This works for the main window and the
       file buttons within the file browser.

       Motif  applications  should  have  absolutely  no problems to deal with
       ida's drag'n'drop support. You can drop images into some  netscape  4.x
       window -- it imply works. Mozilla accepts motif drops too.

       Interoperation  with  gnome / gtk is good. I can drag files from ida to
       eeyes and visa versa without problems. File drops  from  gmc  into  ida
       work just fine too.

       Interoperation  with  KDE  is  bad.  cut+paste  works most of the time,
       drag'n'drop often doesn't. The X11 selection handling of the Qt toolkit
       has a few design bugs and sucks. Basically the troll guys didn't under‐
       stand what the TARGETS target is good for and violate the  ICCCM  specs
       by ignoring it.
