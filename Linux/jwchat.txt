NAME
       jwchat - jabber web chat

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jwchat webpage.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a man page.

       jwchat  works  via  your  web  browser,  and  so has no command line options, simply point your browser to http://<server_name>/ and gaze in wonder! The actual location of the jwchat files is
       /usr/share/jwchat/www.

AUTHOR
       This manual page was written by Martin Lohmeier <martin@mein-horde.de>, for the Debian system (but may be used by others).
