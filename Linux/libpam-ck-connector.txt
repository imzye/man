NAME
       pam_ck_connector - Register session with ConsoleKit

SYNOPSIS

       pam_ck_connector.so [debug]

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_ck_connector PAM module registers a login session with the system-wide ConsoleKit daemon. This PAM module should be used with caution; only local login managers such as login(1) should use
       this. Since the ConsoleKit daemon can accept both an tty and an X11 display the normal parameters set by PAM are not always useful.

       An application can therefore override these with the PAM environment variables CKCON_TTY, CKCON_X11_DISPLAY and CKCON_X11_DISPLAY_DEVICE (the application should remember to unset these before
       starting the login session).

       Also note that the ConsoleKit daemon may reject registration attempts if the given set of data are inconsistent with each other. More more information, see the ConsoleKit documentation on the
       OpenSessionWithParameters() method call on the org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager D-Bus interface.

       If registration with the ConsoleKit daemon succeeds, this PAM module will set the environment variable XDG_SESSION_COOKIE which is used to defined membership of a login session.

       This PAM module has the side effect that it creates a connection to the system message bus that is kept open until the session ends. This is used by the ConsoleKit daemon to track the life-cycle
       of the session and, as such, should the login manager crash, the session will be properly unregistered.

OPTIONS
       debug
          Print debug information.

       nox11
          Do not create a session if PAM specifies an X11 display instead of a /dev/tty terminal.
