NAME
       fio_generate_plots - Generate plots for Flexible I/O Tester

SYNOPSIS
       fio_generate_plots  title

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the fio_generate_plots command. This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       fio_generate_plots  is  a  shell script that uses gnuplot to generate plots from fio run with --latency-log (-l) and/or --bandwidth-log (-w). It expects the log files that fio generated in the current
       directory.

OPTIONS
       The script takes the title of the plot as only argument. It does not offer any additional options.
