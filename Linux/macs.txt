NAME
       mac3_randsample - Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Sequencing

DESCRIPTION
       usage: macs3 randsample [-h] -i IFILE [IFILE ...] (-p PERCENTAGE | -n NUMBER)

       [--seed SEED] [-o OUTPUTFILE] [--outdir OUTDIR]
              [-s TSIZE] [-f {AUTO,BAM,SAM,BED,ELAND,ELANDMULTI,ELANDEXPORT,BOWTIE,BAMPE,BEDPE}] [--buffer-size BUFFER_SIZE] [--verbose VERBOSE]

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -i, --ifile IFILE [IFILE ...]
              Alignment file. If multiple files are given as '-t A B C', then they will all be read and combined. REQUIRED.

       -p, --percentage PERCENTAGE
              Percentage  of  tags you want to keep. Input 80.0 for 80%. This option can't be used at the same time with -n/--num. If the setting is 100, it will keep all the reads and convert any format
              that MACS3 supports into BED or BEDPE (if input is BAMPE) format. REQUIRED

       -n, --number NUMBER
              Number of tags you want to keep. Input 8000000 or 8e+6 for 8 million. This option can't be used at the same time with -p/--percent. Note that the number of tags in output is approximate  as
              the number specified here.  REQUIRED

       --seed SEED
              Set  the random seed while down sampling data. Must be a non-negative integer in order to be effective. If you want more reproducible results, please specify a random seed and record it.DE‐
              FAULT: not set

       -o, --ofile OUTPUTFILE
              Output BED file name. If not specified, will write to standard output. Note, if the input format is BAMPE or BEDPE, the output will be in BEDPE format. DEFAULT: stdout

       --outdir OUTDIR
              If specified all output files will be written to that directory. Default: the current working directory

       -s, --tsize TSIZE
              Tag size. This will override the auto detected tag size. DEFAULT: Not set

       -f, --format {AUTO,BAM,SAM,BED,ELAND,ELANDMULTI,ELANDEXPORT,BOWTIE,BAMPE,BEDPE}
              Format of tag file, "AUTO", "BED" or "ELAND" or "ELANDMULTI" or "ELANDEXPORT" or "SAM" or "BAM" or "BOWTIE" or "BAMPE" or "BEDPE". The default AUTO option will macs3 randsample decide which
              format the file is. Please check the definition in README file if you choose ELAND/ELANDMULTI/ELANDEXPORT/SAM/BAM/BOWTIE or BAMPE/BEDPE. DEFAULT: "AUTO"

       --buffer-size BUFFER_SIZE
              Buffer size for incrementally increasing internal array size to store reads alignment information. In most cases, you don't have to change this parameter.  However, if there are large  num‐
              ber  of  chromosomes/contigs/scaffolds in your alignment, it's recommended to specify a smaller buffer size in order to decrease memory usage (but it will take longer time to read alignment
              files). Minimum memory requested for reading an alignment file is about # of CHROMOSOME * BUFFER_SIZE * 8 Bytes. DEFAULT: 100000

       --verbose VERBOSE
              Set verbose level. 0: only show critical message, 1: show additional warning message, 2: show process information, 3: show debug messages. If you want to know where are the duplicate reads,
              use 3. DEFAULT:2
