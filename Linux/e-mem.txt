NAME
       e-mem - finds position and length of all Maximal Exact Matches (MEMs) for very large genomes

SYNOPSIS
       e-mem [options]  <reference-file>  <query-file>

DESCRIPTION
       e-mem finds and outputs the position and length of all maximal exact matches (MEMs) between <query-file> and <reference-file>

OPTIONS
       -n     match only the characters a, c, g, or t they can be in upper or in lower case

       -l     set the minimum length of a match. The default length is 50

       -b     compute forward and reverse complement matches

       -r     only compute reverse complement matches

       -c     report the query-position of a reverse complement match relative to the original query sequence

       -F     force 4 column output format regardless of the number of reference sequence input

       -L     show the length of the query sequences on the header line

       -d     set the split size. The default value is 1

       -t     number of threads. The default is 1 thread

       -h     show possible options
