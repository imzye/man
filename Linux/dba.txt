NAME
       dba — characterising shared regulatory regions of genomic DNA

SYNOPSIS
       dba [options ... ]  { seq1 seq2 }

DESCRIPTION
       dba  -  standing  for Dna Block Aligner, was developed by Niclas Jareborg, Richard Durbin and Ewan Birney for characterising shared regulatory regions of genomic DNA, either in upstream regions or in‐
       trons of genes

       The idea was that in these regions there would a series of shared motifs, perhaps with one or two insertions or deletions but between motifs there would be any length of sequence.

       The subsquent model was a 3 state model which was log-odd'd ratio to a null model of their being no examples of a motif in the two sequences.
