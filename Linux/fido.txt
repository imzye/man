NAME
       fido is a realish-time log watchdog and alert daemon.

SYNOPSIS
       fido [option]

DESCRIPTION
       fido is a multi-threaded daemon that can watch several files at once.
       It looks for patterns that you configure and executes scripts or pro‐
       grams in the event of a match. fido works in "realish-time" in that it
       is about a second or so behind the clock.

OPTIONS
       Option Syntax

       Since fido uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every op‐
       tion has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more
       convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix dif‐
       ferent option styles, i.e.,

         $ fido -d --pid=/var/run/fido.pid

       Startup Options

       -V, --version
           Display the version of fido and exit.

       -h, --help
           Print a help message describing all of fido's command-line options
           and exit.

       -C, --config
           Prints the default values for all configurable settings. Values are
           read from the active resource file and command line arguements.

       -f /path/file, --file=/path/file
           This option can be used to specify a fido config file. If none is
           selected it will attempt to load FIDORC as an ENV variable. If FI‐
           DORC is not set, then it will attempt the following files in this
           order:

             /etc/fido/fido.conf
             /etc/fido.conf
             /usr/local/etc/fido.conf
             /usr/local/etc/fido/fido.conf

           At this point, if fido hasn't found a config file, it will try to
           run off command line arguments. NOTE: Command line arguments take
           precedent over config file settings.

       -d, --daemon
           This options tells fido to run in the background as a daemon. This
           is a default option so select this to override the config file.

           Sets the network protocol to ICMP. During a netscan, fido can use
           either ICMP echo (default) or TCP/IP connect for discovery. This
           option sets the protocol to ICMP.  This option is like pinging
           hosts on a network with the ping utility. ICMP requires raw sock‐
           ets. Therefore, fido must either be run as root or setuid root.
           (see ERRORS below).

       -p /path/file, --pid=/path/file
           By default, fido writes a pid file to /var/run/fido.pid You may
           override that location with this option, fido
           --pid=/var/lib/run/fido.pid

       -l VAL, --log=VAL
           Use this option to specify a logging method. The values can be
           "/path/to/file" or "syslog" fido can either log its messages to
           syslog or it can use its own internal logging mechanism to write to
           a specified file.

CONFIG FILE
           fido's configurable options can be set and stored in config files.
           All stored settings can be overridden with command line arguments.
           If a logging mechanism is set in config file, it can be overridden
           with --log. fido reads config files in a priortized fashion. The
           ENV variable FIDORC is the highest. That is followed by '-f
           /path/file' and by the system defaults:

             /etc/fido/fido.conf
             /etc/fido.conf
             /usr/local/etc/fido.conf
             /usr/local/etc/fido/fido.conf

           Here is an example that sets an ENV variable and invokes the pro‐
           gram:

             $ FIDORC=/home/jeff/haha fido -d
