NAME
       mkgmap - Generate Garmin maps from OpenStreetMap data

SYNOPSIS
       mkgmap [options] files.osm ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mkgmap command.

       mkgmap  is  a program that converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into a map that can be loaded onto a Garmin GPS device.  The mapping between OSM features and the features in the map can be completely
       customized by writing what we term a "style".

OPTIONS
       --help <filename>
              Use this option to get alist of the built in help topics.  In particular calling --help=options will list all the available options and is always up to date.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       This project is almost entirely based on the file format specification document written by John Mechalas at the SourceForge project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/garmin-img.
