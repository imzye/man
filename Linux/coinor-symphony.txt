NAME
       symphony - mixed-integer linear program (MILP) solver

SYNOPSIS
       symphony  [  -hagrtbd  ]  [  -u  ub  ]  [  -p  procs  ]  [  -n rule ] [ -v level ] [ -s cands ] [ -c rule ] [ -k rule ] [ -m max ] [ -l pools ] [ -i iters ] [ -f parameter_file_name ] [-j 0/1] [-o
       tree_out_file]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the symphony command.

       symphony is a generic MILP solver that can be invoked from the command line (through an interactive shell or in a batch mode), or by linking to the provided callable library. When no  options  are
       given symphony enters the interactive shell mode. Otherwise the program enters the batch mode, for which a summary of options is included below.

OPTIONS
       At a minimum, one must specify the name of the file to be read and solved.

       -h     help

       -a     no cut timeout

       -d     enable graph drawing

       -g     use cut generator

       -r     do repricing in root

       -t     trim the tree

       -b     don't perform branch and cut

       -u ub  use upper bound 'ub'

       -p procs
              allow 'procs' active nodes

       -n i   use node selection rule 'i'

       -v i   set verbosity to level 'i'

       -s cands
              use 'cands' candidates for strong branching

       -k i   use rule 'i' to select child

       -m n   allow a max of 'n' cuts to enter per iteration

       -e n   allow a max of 'n' cut pools

       -l n k load balance level 'n' and iterations 'k'

       -i n   allow a max of 'n' iterations in presolve

       -f file
              read parameters from parameter file 'file'

       -j 0/1 whether or not to generate cgl cuts

       -z n   set diving threshold to 'n'

       -o file
              output vbc-like tree information to file 'file'

       Solver-specific switches:

       symphony [ -H ] [ -FL file ]

       -H     help (solver-specific switches)

       -F model
              model should be read in from file 'model' (MPS format is assumed unless -D is also present)

       -L model
              LP format model should be read in from file 'model'

       -D data
              model is in AMPL format and data is in file 'data'
