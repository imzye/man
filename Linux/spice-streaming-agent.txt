NAME
       spice-streaming-agent - An agent, running on a guest, sending video stream of X display to a remote client (over SPICE)

SYNOPSIS
       spice-streaming-agent [ <options> ]

DESCRIPTION
       spice-streaming-agent is an agent, running on a guest, sending video stream of X display to a remote client (over SPICE)

       The video stream itself depends on plugins/codecs installed on the guest (and the client).

       Currently only supports X display (Xorg/X11).

       Requires a virtio-port device to communicate and a recent enough spice-server.

       spice-streaming-agent should start automatically with your X session.

OPTIONS
       -p portname
              The virtio-serial port to use (default is /dev/virtio-ports/org.spice-space.stream.0)

       -l file
              log frames to file

       --log-binary
              log binary frames (following -l)

       --log-categories
              log categories, separated by ':' (currently: frames)

       --plugins-dir path
              change plugins directory

       -d     enable debug logs

       -c variable=value
              A generic way to change plugins/codecs settings.  This only affects plugins that support this variable and this value (and ignored otherwise).

       -c framerate=1-100

EXAMPLES
       run spice-streaming-agent with a framerate of 20 frames per second
              spice-streaming-agent -c framerate=20

       run and log binary frames to /tmp/ssa.log
              spice-streaming-agent -l /tmp/ssa.log --log-binary

       run and print a lot of debug information
              spice-streaming-agent -d
