NAME
       ethxlattopology

       Generates  a topology XML file of a cluster using your customized <topologyfile>.csv and core switch linksum files, e.g. linksum_swd06.csv, and linksum_swd24.csv as input. The output topology XML file
       can be used to bring up and verify the cluster.

Syntax
       ethxlattopology [-d  level] [-v  level] [-i  level] [-K] [-f  linkfiles]

       [-o  report] [source [dest]]

Options
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -d level

                 Specifies the output detail level. Default is 0. Levels are additive.

                 By default, the top level is always produced. Switch, rack, and rack group topology files can be added to the output by choosing the appropriate level. If the output at  the  group  or  rack
                 level is specified, then group or rack names must be provided in the spreadsheet. Detailed output can be specified in any combination. A directory for each topology XML file is created hier‐
                 archically, with group directories (if specified) at the highest level, followed by rack and switch directories (if specified).

                 1         Core switch topology files.

                 2         Rack topology files.

                 4         Rack group topology files.

       -v level

                 Specifies the verbose level. Range is 0 - 8. Default is 2.

                 0         No output.

                 1         Progress output.

                 2         Reserved.

                 4         Time stamps.

                 8         Reserved.

       -i level

                 Specifies the output indent level. Default is 4.

       -K

                 Specifies DO NOT clean temporary files.

                 Prevents temporary files in each topology directory from being removed. Temporary files contain CSV formatted lists of links, NICs, and switches used to create a topology XML file. Temporary
                 files are not typically needed after a topology file is created, or can be retained for subsequent inspection or processing.

       -f linkfiles

                 Specifies the space separated core switch linksum files.

       -o report

                 Specifies the report type for output. By default, all the sections are generated.

                 Report Types:

                 brnodes   Creates the <Node> section xml for the csv input.

                 links     Creates the <LinkSummary> section xml for the csv input.

       source

                 Specifies the source csv file. Default is topology.csv.

       dest

                 Specifies the output xml file. Default is topology.xml

                 The default output file name can be used to specify destination folder.

Description
       The  ethxlattopology  script  reads  your customized <topologyfile>.csv file from the local directory, and reads the core switch linksum files specified by -f argument. Two sample topology XLSX files,
       detailed_topology.xlsx and minimal_topology.xlsx, are located in the /usr/share/eth-tools/samples/ directory. You must create your <topologyfile>.csv file by editing one of the sample spreadsheets and
       saving  the Fabric Links tab as a CSV file. Inspect your <topologyfile>.csv file to ensure that each row contains the correct and same number of comma separators. Any extraneous entries in the spread‐
       sheet can cause the CSV output to have extra fields. Do the same thing on the "Internal xxx Links" tab to create your own internal core switch linksum csv files.

Example
       ethxlattopology -f "/usr/share/eth-tools/samples/linksum_swd06.csv /usr/share/eth-tools/samples/linksum_swd24.csv" /tmp/detailed_topology.csv

       Parsing linksum file: /usr/share/eth-tools/samples/linksum_swd06.csv

       Parsing linksum file: /usr/share/eth-tools/samples/linksum_swd24.csv

       Both sample files contain examples of links between NIC and Edge SW (rows 4-7), NIC and Core SW (rows 8-11), and Edge SW and Core SW (rows 12-15).

Environment Variables
       The following environment variables allow user-specified MTU.

       MTU_SW_SW

                 If set, it overrides default MTU on switch-to-switch links. Default is 10240

       MTU_SW_NIC

                 If set, it overrides default MTU on switch-to-NIC links. Default is 10240

Multi-Rail and Multi-Plane Fabrics
       For Multi-Rail/Multi-Plane fabrics, you have the following options:

       ·      For Multi-Rail fabrics or for a Single Plane fabric with some multi-ported hosts, you can create multiple rows for a host with different Port names, and then follow the  standard  procedure  to
              generate <topologyfile>.xml.

       ·      For  a  Multi-Plane  fabric with identical planes, the tool can be run multiple times on the same <topologyfile>.csv modified with different port names.  For example, if there are two identical
              fabrics (fabric_1 and fabric_2) connected to a single host with two NICs (eth2 and eth3), the tool can be run twice like this:

       ·      For fabric_1:

              In <topologyfile>.csv, set port name to be eth2 for hosts.

       ·      For fabric_2:

              In <topologyfile>.csv, set port name to be eth3 for hosts.

       ·      For a fabric with both Multi-Rail and Multi-Plane segments, you can use a combination of the above techniques to generate the desired <topologyfile>.xml file.
