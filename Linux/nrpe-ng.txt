NAME
       nrpe-ng - the next generation Nagios Remote Plugin Executor

SYNOPSIS
       nrpe-ng -c CONFIG_FILE [options]

DESCRIPTION
       nrpe-ng  is  a  rewrite  of  NRPE,  the Nagios Remote Plugin Executor. It is a combination of a daemon, nrpe-ng, and a client program, check_nrpe_ng, which work in concert to run Nagios check
       scripts on remote hosts. This man page is for the daemon component that runs on the hosts on which you wish to run the check programs.

OPTIONS
       This program supports the following options:

       -h     Show a summary of the available command-line options.

       -v     Display the program's version number and exit.

       --debug
              Enable debugging mode, which produces much more verbose logging but prevents the program from logging to syslog.

       --c CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
              Specify the configuraiton file to use when running the daemon. This option is required.

       -d, --daemon
              Fork the program and continue running in the background as a daemon. This mode is the default, so neither of these options need to be given to gain this behaviour.

       -f     Do not fork into the background and remain in the foreground. This option is the opposite of -d or --daemon, and may be useful for debugging.
