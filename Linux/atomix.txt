NAME
       atomix - molecule puzzle game

SYNOPSIS
       atomix [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       Atomix is a Sokoban like puzzle game in which you have to build full molecules, from simple inorganic ones in the first levels to extremely complex organic ones in the last levels, out of isolated
       atoms, which are laying around among walls and other obstacles on the playfield.

       Once  you  push an atom in a certain direction, it will move until it hits something that makes it stop, which could be a wall or another atom.  This behaviour is exactly what makes playing it not
       trivial and, therefore, fun, as you need to think quite a lot about how to have your molecule organized.
