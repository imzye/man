DESCRIPTION
       Disc-Cover creates front and back covers for audio CDs. The CD has to be present in the CD-ROM drive, or alternatively a valid CDDB file can be used.  Disc-Cover searches the CDDB database for an
       entry corresponding to the CD's CDDB ID. It starts by looking for a local CDDB entry in ~/.cddb (or another directory pointed to by your cddb installation). If no local CDDB entry matches the CD,
       disc-cover continues to search the online CDDB databases or CDINDEX databases as configured in the AudioCD library. It then formats the entry to produce a Latex, Dvi, Postscript or PDF file, which
       contains the front and back covers on a single page. Other formats supported include a simple text output, a CDDB compatible format, HTML and an output format that can be used with cdlabelgen
       (http://www.red-bean.com/~bwf/software/cdlabelgen/), another cover builder.

QUICKSTART
       The easiest way of using Disc-Cover is to put an audio cd in your cdrom drive and then run disc-cover without options. Disc-Cover will tell you what it does and if it is able to create a set of
       covers it tells you the name of the file it creates. Normally this is a PostScript file that is ready for printing.

LAYOUT
       The front cover shows artist, album title and when available extended disc info. Optionally a picture can be added to the front cover. The back cover holds the title and artist in the same
       fashion. In addition to those, the back cover lists the individual tracks, preceded by a track number and followed by their running time. The total running time of the CD is given at the bottom of
       the back cover. The sides of the back cover contain the artist and CD title.  Another flap hangs on the side of the right of the back cover. When using fully transparent jewel cases this flap is
       visible from the front. By default it holds the user's full name. Colour is also supported.

FEATURES
       - Uses Latex to produce high quality output.
       - Outputs in Latex, Dvi, Postscript, Pdf, Cddb entry, HTML, Text and a format to use with cdlabelgen.
       - Supports caching of cddb entries in a directory that can be shared with other cddb-aware programs.
       - Connects with a cddb or cdindex server to get the disc title, artist and list of track titles and extended information where available.
       - Optionally put a picture on the front cover, supports almost any image format.
       - Optionally let Disc-Cover search on allmusic.com for a small version of the corresponding front cover of the cd, which it will put on your front cover.
       - Assign different colours to different items such as artist name and track numbers.
       - Supports double albums (two cds in one jewel case).
       - Creates covers for jewel cases and various slim cases.

OPTIONS
       -2, -second filename
           When  using  this  option  disc-cover  goes  into  double album mode, meaning it will print the front cover using the first cddb entry, either reading the cd in the drive or by using a file as
           described in "-f, -file filename" option. Then it prints the back cover with two halves, the upper half consists the title/artist and then the tracks of the first cd, the lower  half  contains
           the tracks of the second cd.

       -a, -additional text
           Add text to the bottom of the front cover. Default is to put extended disc information here. You can use this to cancel the extended disc information by doing '-a " "'.

       -allmusic
           Search  on  wwww.allmusic.com for the front cover of the album. This picture will be put on the front cover, just like with -p and -pic. These last options override this flag. This way you can
           enable -allmusic by default in the config file and override it whenever you need to.

       -b, -flaptext text
           Add text to the additional flap at the side of the back cover. This flap is visible when used with a fully transparent jewel case. These are becoming more common everyday. By default text from
           the password entry is used. We take the string from the comments field up until the first comma. Most times this should be the user's full name. Cancel this text  by  using  the  configuration
           file or with '-b " "'.

       -c, -casetype (jewel|slim|x-slim|tevion-slim|letter-slim)
           These  options correspond with files in one of the @config_template_dirs which are templates that describe case types. You can also copy one of these files to your current directory, change it
           and let disc-cover use your own template.  The cases described next are delivered together with Disc-Cover.  Setting this to slim will have Disc-Cover output covers in a  format  suitable  for
           slim  cases.  These  are thinner cases often used for single cds or EPs. Use x-slim if you want the side and flap exchanged. Even more slim are the cases provided by Tevion (use: tevion-slim).
           For people using letter format that have trouble with not getting the whole case fitted on paper, please use letter-slim.

       -C, -Configuration filename
           Output configuration to a file. The current flags and options set in existing configuration files or given on the commandline are used to set the  values.   To  see  the  current  settings  do
           ;disc-cover -C -'.  For example, you can change the default output format to pdf as follows:

             disc-cover -t pdf -C ~/.disc-coverrc

       -D, -Device device
           Specify the CD-ROM device. Default is to use /dev/cdrom

       -e, -extended
           This  flag  enables  extended  track  information,  when  available. This extended information will be added below the track names. It is mostly used in compilation cds for artist information.
           Sometimes this extended track information has been used for lyrics, needles to say this will not fit at the back of one cd cover and hence to prevent the destruction of  the  layout  only  the
           first line will be used. That is why this is an option instead of default behaviour.

       -f, -file filename
           Use filename as input instead of searching the local and online CDDB database. File should be a valid CDDB entry.

       -g, -genre
           Include  the  genre of the disc as the last line of the bottom text on the front cover.  The line looks like this: "genre: genre". Default is off, as often the wrong genre is used or even just
           misc or data has been chosen.

       -h, -help
           Print help message and exit.

       -H, -Help
           Show the manual page using pod2text, this should be installed and working (you can check this by typing 'pod2text /path/to/disc-cover')

       -n, -new
           Creates a new cddb entry. This works with any format, but should be used in conjunction with '-t cddb' to create a template for you to fill in. See the "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS"  to  create
           covers for your custom cds or for cds that are not in the CDDB database yet.

       -o, -output filename
           The  -o  switch  allows one to specify the name of the output file. By default the filename will be Artist_Title.xxx, where xxx is txt, tex, dvi, ps, pdf or html, depending on the file format.
           See -t option for supported file formats. Using "-o -" will send the output to standard output.

       -p filename
           Includes the picture filename on the front cover in a framed box right aligned with the artist name. The format of the picture  has  to  be  known  to  the  program  convert  that  comes  with
           ImageMagick. Also the graphicx package for LaTeX has to be available. The picture is scaled to 200x200 and converted into Adobe Encapsulated PostScript Interchange format. Remember that output
           in tex, dvi, txt, html and labelgen are completely useless with pictures. In case of output in pdf the picture is transformed into Encapsulated Portable Document Format (EPDF).

       -pic filename
           Include  a  graphics  file on the front cover without converting it. This only works when the format of the file is the same as the output format. In case of PostScript (PS) output you can use
           Encapsulated PostScript (EPS,EPSI) files. In case of Portable Document Format (PDF) you can use Encapsulated Portable Document Format (EPDF). Note that this is essentially the same  option  as
           in "-p filename" but no scaling or converting is performed. More responsibility goes to the user this way.

       -R, -Remove
           By default disc-cover deletes all temporary files it creates before it exits.  This behaviour can be overwritten by specifying the this option. For debugging purposes only.

       -S, -Server
           Create  a  default  configuration  for  the  selection  of  CDDB server. This configuration is used by other CDDB aware programs too, so be careful. Note that Disc-Cover will not overwrite the
           configuration file.

       -t, -type txt|tex|dvi|ps|pdf|cddb|lbl|html
           The -t switch allows one to specify the output format. By default disc-cover will create a Postscript file. Other formats supported include ASCII text (txt), LaTeX (tex), DVI (dvi), PDF (pdf),
           cddb database format (cddb), a cdlabelgen compatible format (lbl) and in Hypertext Markup Language (html).

       -u, -uppercase
           Fixes those annoying entries that are written without capitals. It capitalises every single word in titles and artists.

       -v, -version
           Print version and program information and exit.

       -V, -Verbose
           Enable verbose output of Disc-Cover, the libaudiocd library and all third party software, such as LaTeX, dvips and convert. For debugging purposes.

       -va, -variousartists
           Some CDDB entries code every track in the 'artist / title' format. Mostly, this is used for artists that contain various artists. By enabling this option Disc-Cover will decode  and  use  that
           information.

       -template_list
           Prints a list of output template types and their descriptions.

CONFIGURATION
       Disc-cover  first  checks  the  file  /etc/disc-cover.conf  for  system  wide  parameters  and  then  looks  at ~/.disc-coverrc. Following are all the different variables that can be set. The file
       ~/.cdserverrc is used indirectly through the AudioCD library. This file contains the CDDB and CDINDEX servers. Furthermore it can be used to control certain other options of this library. See  the
       appropriate documentation.

       You can generate a configuration file with the "-C, -Configuration filename" option. Keep in mind that the values in this file will be set by looking at the current settings. That is, any existing
       configuration files or options on the commandline will be used.

       To make a clean configuration file, first remove the ~/.disc-coverrc file and then run Disc-Cover without any option but '-C': disc-cover -C ~/.disc-coverrc

       $config_version_config
           This will be used in the future by new versions of Disc-Cover to check for inconsistencies in changed, removed or added configuration options.

            Default: '1.4.0';

       $config_tmp_dir
           This sets the directory that is used for temporary files.

            Default: '/tmp';

       $config_output_format
           This is the default output format. Although you can choose any of the types listed in 'disc-cover -h' option the most common would be 'ps' or 'pdf'.

            Default: 'ps';

       $config_device
           The default cdrom drive that is used to scan a cd. See "-D, -Device device"

            Default: '/dev/cdrom';

       $config_cddb_cache_directory
           The path where cddb entries are stored in and retrieved from. This can be shared with other programs that also use cddb.

            Default: "$ENV{HOME}/.cddb";

       $flag_with_extended_track_info
           Setting  this  to  one  will force disc-cover to include extended track information. See "-e, -extended" option. It is advised to keep this 0 as there are lots of entries that contain ugly and
           meaningless extended information. Most of the time it is only useful in case of various artists cds.

            Default: 0;

       $flag_various_artist_cd
           Setting this to one will force disc-cover to parse every track the same way it parses the 'artist / title' label. This might be useful for various artist cds where every track is formatted  in
           the same way. It is advised to leave this option 0, as disc-cover will issue a warning whenever it encounters such a disc.  You can easily turn it on with "-va, -variousartists"

            Default: 0;

       $flag_double_disc_cdtitle
           Setting this flag during the processing of a double cd (using the "-2, -second" option) enables a 'smart' algorithm that attempts to find a nice title for the cd, using the titles of both cddb
           entries.  It will remove all characters unequal in both strings, and gets rid of any characters surrounding uncommon parts. Last, it removes the words 'disc' and 'disk', plus any whitespace at
           the beginning or end., -second>> option) enables a 'smart' algorithm that attempts to find a nice title for the cd, using the titles of both cddb entries. It will remove all characters unequal
           in both strings, and gets rid of any characters surrounding uncommon parts. Last, it removes the words 'disc' and 'disk', plus any whitespace at the beginning or end.

            Default: 1;

       $flag_genre
           By setting this an additional line will be added to the bottom of the bottom text on the front cover with the genre (taken from the database) of the disc. See -g, -genre option.

            Default: 0;

       $flag_picture_use_allmusic
           Setting this flag does the same as the -allmusic option. That is, Disc-Cover will search for a cover picture on allmusic to be put on the front cover.

            Default: 0;

       $flag_uppercase_fix
           Setting this flag does the same as the -u,-uppercase option. That is, Disc-Cover will capitalise every single word in titles and artists.

            Default: 0;

       %config_latex_colors
           This is a list of colours that can be set to alter most of the different items that appear on the covers. You can change the colour of the title, artist, discinfo, track strings, track numbers
           and track times independently. Use colours from the color.sty Latex file: black, white, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta and yellow.

            Default: ( title => 'black',
                       artist => 'black',
                       discinfo => 'black',
                       track_number => 'black',
                       track_string => 'black',
                       track_time => 'black',
                       track_extended => 'black'
                       track_artist => 'black'
                       flaptext => 'black',
                     );

       $config_flaptext
           This takes the string from the comments field of the user's password entry. We use only the text up until the first comma, which normally is set to the user's full name. You  can  also  put  a
           simple string here or an empty one to cancel the output. See also "-b, -flaptext text" option.

            Default: split ',', (getpwuid($<)))[6];

       $config_casetype
           This determines for which type of case output is generated. It searches for a template file in all the @config_template_dirs with the same name.

            Default: "jewel";

       $latex_user_packages
           If  you  create  a  template that requires special LaTeX packages, they can be added here. Generally not advised if you want to share your templates with others as they need to own those LaTeX
           packages, and add them to Disc-Cover's configuration file.

            Default: "";

       $latex_language_encoding
           Whenever you create cds with languages not normally supported by LaTeX you should add or change this. It calls \usepackage[$latex_language_encoding]{inputenc}. Main encodings are,  latin1  for
           ISO Latin-1, ascii for pure ASCII, ansinew and cp1252 (they are synonyms) for Windows 3.1 ANSI (an MS extension of ISO Latin-1) and applemac for Apple MacIntosh.

            Default: "latin1";

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
       Here you might find an answer between the FAQs.

   Q: I get the following error (or similar), what's wrong?

        BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./disc-cover line 811."

       A:  Install  the  Perl modules called libwww-perl, HTML-Parser, URI, and MIME-Base64, which can be found at www.cpan.org or at the 'more stuff...'  directory on the homepage of Disc-Cover. See the
       file INSTALL for more details.

   Q: I get the following error with the option -V, what's wrong?
        "Disc-Cover: running verbose version x.x.x (config y.y.y)
        Disc-Cover: creating tmp dir (/tmp/disc-cover-4436)

        Disc-Cover: ...back from call to Audio-CD library.
        Disc-Cover: Audio-CD library says success, let's continue"

       A: You have no CDDB servers configured. Either use the wonderful program cdcd to create such a configuration or run disc-cover with the options -S.

   Q: How do I make a cover for homemade cds?
       A: Follow these steps.

       1. Insert the homemade cd.

       2. Run disc-cover like this:
           disc-cover -n -t cddb -o myfile.cddb

       3. Edit the myfile.cddb with some text editor, the tracks will all be named
          "Untitled". This should be very easy.

       4. For printable output run disc-cover again:
           disc-cover -f myfile.cddb

   Q: I have been using 1.0.1. under SuSE 7.3 for a while an want to upgrade to 1.3.X or higher However, Audio-CD does not compile.
       A:  You have to install lbcdaudio first. Your distribution does not contain it, or it does not install it with the standard setup.

   Q: After installation all my CD's are reread from the internet.
       A: Run the following commands (from a script, if you like)

         cd ~/.cddb
         ln -s . blues
         ln -s . classical
         ln -s . country
         ln -s . data
         ln -s . folk
         ln -s . jazz
         ln -s . newage
         ln -s . reggae
         ln -s . rock
         ln -s . soundtrack
         ln -s . misc

   Q: Q3. Mike Oliphant's grip creates cddb-files with track-artist held in a special field called TARTIST0, TARTIST1, ...  Why can't disc-cover print these labels appropriately by the "-va" option?
       A: Unfortunately Mike's idea to invent new tags for the track artist violates the freedb-conventions for handling samplers. There will be no support for this.

   Q: How to cut the covers?
       A: This is my routine for jewel cases, just one way of doing it. I start with the front cover.  I cut it with two cuts along the width of the paper. This results in a front cover with  two  pieces
       of paper along the sides. These are folded backwards to help the cover keep in place when it is inserted in the jewel case. The back cover is just cut with four cuts.

   Q: When I print my cover from PDF in Acrobat Reader the resulting covers are too small. How come?
       A: Hendrik Neumann <h-n@gmx.net>: The problem is the option 'Fit to page' that makes Acrobat Reader scale the page before printing. Turn it off before attempting to print.

   Q: I'm not root and I want to install Audio::CD
       A: Adam Spiers <adam@spiers.net>: make sure that the correct parameters are given to the perl Makefile.PL file as follows:

         perl Makefile.PL LIBS="-L/nfs-home/adams/local/lib -lcdaudio" \
         INC=-I/nfs-home/adams/software/libcdaudio-0.99.6/source PREFIX=~

   Q: How do I make covers for double cds?
       A: Follow these steps:

       1. insert the second disc

       2. Run disc-cover:
           disc-cover -t cddb -o disc2.cddb

       3. replace the second disc with the first

       4. Run disc-cover again:
           disc-cover -2 disc2.cddb

   Q: The quality of the picture is reduced!
       A:  The  image  is resized to 200x200 pixels, this is to make sure that the size of the resulting eps or pdf picture is not too large. You can work around this by converting your picture yourself,
       for example with jpeg2ps, and then including this in your cover using the '-pic' option. This options includes files as they are.

   Q: I want Disc-Cover to have this specific feature, what now?
       A: Send me an e-mail with your feature or better yet, implement it yourself and send me a patch file. This does not guarantee that your feature will be in any future version though. I  would  like
       to keep Disc-Cover as simple to use as possible. But, sometimes I can't resist to put in something new, or the number of e-mails on one feature grows large enough for me to add it to Disc-Cover.

   Q: I run Disc-Cover and it does not produce a correct cover, what's wrong?
       A:  I  don't  know!  If  you  e-mail  the problem I can try to fix it. When you mail some error please remember to state the problem as exact as you can and to include the cddb entry (save it with
       'disc-cover -t cddb'). Also, two debug options are included. Use "-V, -Verbose" to get verbose output of what the program is doing. This helps me locate the problem if you email me  your  problem.
       Use "-R, -Remove" to prevent disc-cover from deleting temporary files. This enables you to examine intermediate files (.tex, .div, pictures).

FILES
       /etc/disc-cover.conf
           System wide configuration file (for its format see "CONFIGURATION")). All its items can be overridden in a user configuration file.

       $HOME/.disc-coverrc
           User configuration file (for its format see "CONFIGURATION").

       $HOME/.cdserverrc
           Configuration of the AudioCD library. Use this to select which servers are to be used.

BUGS
       1.  Whenever there is more than one file in the cddb cache directory disc-cover will issue a warning and just use the first one it found.

       2.  Not possible to use CDINDEX files as input.

       3.  The layout of the tracks can be slightly deformed when special international characters or any other tall characters appear in the title.
