NAME
       lz4jsoncat - decompress tool for mozilla lz4json format

SYNOPSIS
       lz4jsoncat somefile.mozlz4 > somefile.json

DESCRIPTION
       lz4jsoncat can unpack lz4json files as generated by Firefox's bookmark backups and session restore.  The data is dumped to stdout.

CAVEATS
       The input file must be mmappable - so you can't use a pipe here.
