NAME
       tjbench - benchmark the performance of libjpeg-turbo

DESCRIPTION
       tjbench is a JPEG decompression/compression benchmark part of libjpeg-turbo.

USAGE
              tjbench <Inputimage (BMP|PPM)> <Quality> [options]

              tjbench <Inputimage (JPG)> [options]

OPTIONS
       -alloc  = Dynamically allocate JPEG buffers -bmp = Use Windows Bitmap format for output images [default = PPM] -bottomup = Use bottom-up row order for packed-pixel source/destination buffers -tile
       = Compress/transform the input image into separate JPEG tiles of varying

              sizes (useful for measuring JPEG overhead)

       -rgb, -bgr, -rgbx, -bgrx, -xbgr, -xrgb =

              Use the specified pixel format for packed-pixel source/destination buffers [default = BGR]

       -cmyk = Indirectly test YCCK JPEG compression/decompression

              (use the CMYK pixel format for packed-pixel source/destination buffers)

       -fastupsample = Use the fastest chrominance upsampling algorithm available -fastdct = Use the fastest DCT/IDCT algorithm available -accuratedct = Use the most accurate DCT/IDCT algorithm available
       -progressive = Use progressive entropy coding in JPEG images generated by

              compression and transform operations

       -subsamp <s> = When compressing, use the specified level of chrominance

              subsampling (<s> = 444, 422, 440, 420, 411, or GRAY) [default = test Grayscale, 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4 in sequence]

       -quiet = Output results in tabular rather than verbose format -yuv = Compress from/decompress to intermediate planar YUV images -yuvpad <p> = The number of bytes by which each row in each plane of
       an

              intermediate YUV image is evenly divisible (must be a power of 2) [default = 1]

       -scale M/N = When decompressing, scale the width/height of the JPEG image by a

              factor of M/N (M/N = 2/1, 15/8, 7/4, 13/8, 3/2, 11/8, 5/4, 9/8, 1/1, 7/8, 3/4, 5/8, 1/2, 3/8, 1/4, or 1/8)

       -hflip, -vflip, -transpose, -transverse, -rot90, -rot180, -rot270 =

              Perform the specified lossless transform operation on the input image prior to decompression (these operations are mutually exclusive)

       -grayscale = Transform the input image into a grayscale JPEG image prior to

              decompression (can be combined with the other transform operations above)

       -copynone = Do not copy any extra markers (including EXIF and ICC profile data)

              when transforming the input image

       -benchtime <t> = Run each benchmark for at least <t> seconds [default = 5.0] -warmup <t> = Run each benchmark for <t> seconds [default = 1.0] prior to

              starting the timer, in order to prime the caches and thus improve the consistency of the benchmark results

       -componly = Stop after running compression tests.  Do not test decompression.  -nowrite = Do not write reference or output images (improves consistency of

              benchmark results)

       -limitscans = Refuse to decompress or transform progressive JPEG images that

              have an unreasonably large number of scans

       -stoponwarning = Immediately discontinue the current

              compression/decompression/transform operation if a warning (non-fatal error) occurs

       NOTE:  If the quality is specified as a range (e.g. 90-100), a separate test will be performed for all quality values in the range.
