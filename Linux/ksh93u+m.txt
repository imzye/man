NAME
       shcomp93 - compile a ksh93 shell script

SYNOPSIS
       shcomp [ options ] [infile] [outfile]]

ORIGIN OF THIS MAN PAGE
       This man page was written by Christophe Martin <Schplurtz@free.fr> for the Debian GNU/Linux system. It is based on "shcomp --man" output.

DESCRIPTION
       Unless -D is specified, shcomp takes a shell script, infile, and creates a binary format file, outfile, that ksh93 can read and execute with the same effect as the original script.

       Since aliases are processed as the script is read, alias definitions whose value requires variable expansion will not work correctly.

       If -D is specified, all double quoted strings that are preceded by $ are output. These are the messages that need to be translated to locale specific versions for internationalization.

       If outfile is omitted, then the results will be written to standard output.  If infile is also omitted, the shell script will be read from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -D, --dictionary
              Generate a list of strings that need to be placed in a message catalog for internationalization.

       -n, --noexec
              Displays warning messages for obsolete or non-conforming constructs.

       -v, --verbose
              Displays input from infile onto standard error as it reads it.

       --man  Displays this man page on standard error and exits.

       --help Shows a short help message and exits.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful completion.

       >0     An error occurred.
