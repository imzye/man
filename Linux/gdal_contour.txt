DESCRIPTION
       The gdal_contour generates a vector contour file from the input  raster
       elevation model (DEM).

       The  contour  line-strings  are oriented consistently and the high side
       will be on the right, i.e. a line string goes clockwise around a top.

       -b <band>
              Picks a particular band to get the DEM from. Defaults to band 1.

       -a <name>
              Provides a name for the attribute in which to put the elevation.
              If  not provided no elevation attribute is attached.  Ignored in
              polygonal contouring (-p) mode.

       -amin <name>
              Provides a name for the attribute in which to  put  the  minimum
              elevation  of contour polygon. If not provided no minimum eleva‐
              tion attribute is attached. Ignored in default  line  contouring
              mode.

              New in version 2.4.0.

       -amax <name>
              Provides  a  name  for the attribute in which to put the maximum
              elevation of contour polygon. If not provided no maximum  eleva‐
              tion  attribute is attached.  Ignored in default line contouring
              mode.

              New in version 2.4.0.

       -3d    Force production of 3D vectors instead of 2D.   Includes  eleva‐
              tion at every vertex.

       -inodata
              Ignore  any nodata value implied in the dataset - treat all val‐
              ues as valid.

       -snodata <value>
              Input pixel value to treat as "nodata".

       -f <format>
              Create output in a particular format.

              New in version 2.3.0: If not specified, the  format  is  guessed
              from the extension (previously was ESRI Shapefile).

       -dsco <NAME=VALUE>
              Dataset creation option (format specific)

       -lco <NAME=VALUE>
              Layer creation option (format specific)

       -i <interval>
              Elevation interval between contours.

       -off <offset>
              Offset from zero relative to which to interpret intervals.

       -fl <level>
              Name one or more "fixed levels" to extract.

       -e <base>
              Generate  levels on an exponential scale: base ^ k, for k an in‐
              teger.

              New in version 2.4.0.

       -nln <name>
              Provide a name for the output vector layer.  Defaults  to  "con‐
              tour".

       -p     Generate contour polygons rather than contour lines.

              New in version 2.4.0.

       -q     Be quiet.

C API
       Functionality of this utility can be done from C with GDALContourGener‐
       ate().

EXAMPLE
       This would create 10-meter contours from the DEM data  in  dem.tif  and
       produce  a shapefile in contour.shp|shx|dbf with the contour elevations
       in the elev attribute.

          gdal_contour -a elev dem.tif contour.shp -i 10.0
