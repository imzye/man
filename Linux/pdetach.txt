NAME
       pdetach - execute detached processes

SYNOPSIS
       args [stdiooptions] command [args...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command is used to execute processes that are fully detached from the shell and the user's controlling terminal.  Detached processes will not exit if the user logs out.  The stdio options can be
       manipulated to attach the process to another device or file.

OPTIONS
       --error=path
              Set stderr for the detached process.

       --input=path
              Set stdin for the detached process.

       --output=path
              Set stdout for the detached process.
