NAME
       t1dotlessj - create a dotless-j PostScript Type 1 font

SYNOPSIS
       t1dotlessj [OPTIONS...]  font [outputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       T1dotlessj creates a PostScript Type 1 font whose only character is a dotless 'j' matching the input font's design.  It works simply by removing the dot from the input font's 'j'.  The output font has
       three characters: '.notdef', 'space', and 'uni0237', where 'uni0237' is the dotless 'j'.  The command fails if the input font already has a dotless 'j' character, or if there seems to be no dot to re‐
       move.  T1dotlessj writes the created PFA or PFB font to the standard output (but see the --output option); if no input file is supplied, it reads a PFA or PFB font from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       --output=file, -o file
            Send output to file instead of standard output.

       --pfb, -b
            Output a PFB font.  This is the default.

       --pfa, -a
            Output a PFA font.

       --name=name, -n name
            Set the output font's PostScript name to name.  The default is InputFontNameLCDFJ.

       -q, --quiet
            Do not generate any error messages.

       -h, --help
            Print usage information and exit.

       -v, --version
            Print the version number and some short non-warranty information and exit.

RETURN VALUES
       T1dotlessj exits with one of the following values:

       0    A dotless-j font was successfully generated.

       2    The font's "j" character had no dot to remove.
