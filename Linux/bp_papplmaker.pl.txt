NAME
       papplmaker.PLS -  Analysis tools module generator

SYNOPSIS
         # get some help
         papplmaker.PLS -h

         # generate module for program 'seqret'
         papplmaker.PLS -n edit.seqret

         # ditto, but specify where to find 'seqret'
         papplmaker.PLS -n edit::seqret
                    -l http://localhost:8080/axis/services

         # ditto, but specify a non-default access method to 'seqret'
         papplmaker.PLS -n edit::seqret
                    -l http://corba.ebi.ac.uk/IOR/Analyses.ref
                    -a corba

         # generate modules for all available analyses
         # (using default location and default access method)
         papplmaker.PLS

         # do not generate but see what would be generated
         papplmaker.PLS -s
         papplmaker.PLS -S

         # generate module for analysis 'edit::seqret'
         # but name it 'MySeqret'
         papplmaker.PLS -n edit::seqret -m MySeqret

             # ...and use it
             use MySeqret;
             print new MySeqret->sequence_direct_data ('tatatacccgt')
                               ->osformat ('embl')
                               ->wait_for
                               ->outseq;

         # ditto but put the result into directory '/tmp/my'
         # (directories do not need to exist)
         papplmaker.PLS -n edit::seqret -m MySeqret -d /tmp/my/

         # generate modules for all analysis whose names
         # matches given regular expression (case insensitive)
         papplmaker.PLS -r 'edit'

         # ditto, but name generated module with your own names
         # (letting papplmaker.PLS substitute parts of your names)
         papplmaker.PLS -r 'edit' -m 'My_$ANALYSIS'

DESCRIPTION
       The module "Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis" provides access to the local and remote analysis tools in a unified way (defined in "Bio::AnalysisI"). The module uses general approach allowing to set arbitrary
       input data and to retrieve results by naming them. However, sometimes is more convenient to use a specific module, representing one analysis tool, that already knows about available input and result
       names.

       The generator "papplmaker.PLS" creates such dedicated modules.

       "papplmaker.PLS" uses the same access method as the general module - which means that depending on the parameter "access" it can use SOAP, CORBA or any other (supported) protocol, or it can access
       local analysis (available on the same machine where "papplmaker.PLS" is invoked).

       "papplmaker.PLS" does its job either for one named analysis (specified by the "-n" option, or it uses "Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory" module in order to find what analyses are available, and can
       limit their number by matching against a regular expression given by the "-r" option.

       The generated module or modules are named by default similarly to the names of the corresponding analyses, but this can be changed by the "-m" option which is actually a template where the following
       strings are recognised and replaced:

       $ANALYSIS or ${ANALYSIS}
           Will be replaced by the name of the analysis.

       $CATEGORY or ${CATEGORY}
           Will be replaced by the name of the category where the analysis belongs to.

       $SERVICE or ${SERVICE}
           Will be replaced by the entire name of the service (which is usually a concatenation of a category and a analysis name, and it is used also as a default module name, btw).

       What is a difference between the "service" and "analysis", and what does "category" mean? Sometimes these terms may be confusing because they may mean slightly different things depending on the access
       method used to communicate with them. Generally, an "analysis" is a program (an application, a tool) running somewhere, but sometimes on a local machine. An example of an analysis is "seqret" (from
       the EMBOSS package). The analyses can be grouped into categories by their functions or by type of data they deal with (but sometimes there are no categories at all). Each analyses can be accessed
       using a higher level of abstraction, a "service". A service is usually a protocol-dependent wrapper, such as a Web Service, or a CORBA service. For example there is a "edit::seqret" service which
       represents analysis "seqret" in the category "edit".
