Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi(3pm)                                               User Contributed Perl Documentation                                               Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi(3pm)

NAME
       Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi - multiple Cache::Memcache::Managed objects

SYNOPSIS
        use Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi;

        my $multi = Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi->new( @managed );

DESCRIPTION
       Provides the same API as Cache::Memcached::Managed, but applies all methods called to all of the objects specified, except for new and objects.

CONTEXT
       All methods are called on all of the Cache::Memcached::Managed objects in the same context (list, scalar or void) in which the method is called on the Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi object.  The
       return value differs in format depending on the context also:

       scalar
          my $listref = $multi->method;
          print "Result: @{$listref}\n";

         When  called  in  scalar context, a list ref with scalar values is returned in the same order in which the objects are used (which is determined by the order in which they were supplied with new
         and returned by objects..

       list
          my @listref = $multi->method;
          print "Result $_: @{$listref[$_]}\n" foreach 0..$#listref;

         When called in list context, a list of list references is returned in the same order in which the objects are used (which is determined by the order in which they  were  supplied  with  new  and
         returned by objects.

       void
          $multi->method;

         When called in void context, nothing is returned (not strangely enough ;-).

SPECIFIC CLASS METHODS
       There is only one specific class method.

   new
        my $multi = Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi->new( @managed );

       Create an object containing multiple Cache::Memcached::Managed objects.  Returns the instantiated object.

SPECIFIC INSTANCE METHODS
   objects
        my @managed = $multi->objects;

       Returns the list of instantiated Cache::Memcached::Managed objects that the object is a proxy for.
