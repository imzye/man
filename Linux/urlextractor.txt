NAME
       URLEXTRACTOR - Information gathering and website reconnaissance

SYNOPSIS
       urlextractor [URL]

DESCRIPTION
       urlextractor gathers information from the specified URL and prints it to STDOUT
        gathering the following information:
         - IP and hosting info like city and country (using FreegeoIP)
         - DNS servers (using dig)
         - ASN, Network range, ISP name (using RISwhois)
         - Load balancer test
         - Whois for abuse mail (using Spamcop)
         - PAC (Proxy Auto Configuration) file
         - Compares hashes to diff code
         - robots.txt (recursively looking for hidden stuff)
         - Source code (looking for passwords and users)
         - External links (frames from other websites)
         - Directory FUZZ (like Dirbuster and Wfuzz - using Dirbuster) directory list)
         - URLvoid API - checks Google page rank, Alexa rank and possible blacklists
         - Provides useful links at other websites to correlate with IP/ASN
         - Option to open ALL results in browser at the end

FILES
        urlextractor at runtime wil check if the directory $HOME/.urlextractor
        exists if the directory does not exists the directory will be created.
        The previous behaviour has been added in Debian Systems in order to have a better
        user experience

       $HOME/.urlextractor/config
               The configuration file used to customize default program settings.
               After the directory $HOME/.urlextractor is created a default configuration file is
               copied from the package examples directory /usr/share/doc/urlextractor/examples/config
               containing a default configuration to enable urlextractor to work.
               For more information about the configuration check the example file.

       $HOME/.urlextractor/log.csv
               Save the scanned sites for future reference.
