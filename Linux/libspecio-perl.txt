NAME
       Specio::Constraint::AnyDoes - A class for constraints which require a class name or an object that does a specific role

VERSION
       version 0.53

SYNOPSIS
           my $type = Specio::Constraint::AnyDoes->new(...);
           print $type->role;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a specialized type constraint class for types which require a class name or an object that does a specific role.

API
       This class provides all of the same methods as Specio::Constraint::Simple, with a few differences:

   Specio::Constraint::AnyDoes->new( ... )
       The "parent" parameter is ignored if it passed, as it is always set to the "Defined" type.

       The "inline_generator" and "constraint" parameters are also ignored. This class provides its own default inline generator subroutine reference.

       This class overrides the "message_generator" default if none is provided.

       Finally, this class requires an additional parameter, "role". This must be a single role name.

   $any_isa->role
       Returns the role name passed to the constructor.

ROLES
       This class does the Specio::Constraint::Role::DoesType, Specio::Constraint::Role::Interface, Specio::Role::Inlinable, and MooseX::Clone roles.
