NAME
       Test2::Warnings - Test for warnings and the lack of them

VERSION
       version 0.038

SYNOPSIS
           use Test2::V0;
           use Test::Warnings;

           pass('yay!');
           done_testing;

       emits TAP:

           ok 1 - yay!
           ok 2 - no (unexpected) warnings (via done_testing)
           1..2

       and:

           use Test::More tests => 3;
           use Test::Warnings 0.005 ':all';

           pass('yay!');
           like(warning { warn "oh noes!" }, qr/^oh noes/, 'we warned');

       emits TAP:

           ok 1 - yay!
           ok 2 - we warned
           ok 3 - no (unexpected) warnings (via END block)
           1..3

DESCRIPTION
       See Test::Warnings for full documentation.

       For now, this is a simple wrapper around Test::Warnings, but there is a plan to make this a full port and eject all the old Test::Builder compatibility and use the Test2 suite correctly.
