Environment Variables
       The following environment variables are also used by this command:

       FF_ANALYSIS_DIR

                 Top-level directory for baselines and failed health checks.

Details
       The  ethallanalysis command performs the set of analysis specified in FF_ALL_ANALYSIS, which must be a space-separated list. This can be provided by the environment or using /etc/eth-tools/ethfastfab‐
       ric.conf. The analysis set includes the options: fabric.

       Note that the ethallanalysis command has options which are a super-set of the options for all other analysis commands. The options are passed along to the respective tools as needed. For example,  the
       -c file option is passed on to ethfabricanalysis if it is specified in FF_ALL_ANALYSIS.

       The output files are all the output files for the FF_ALL_ANALYSIS selected set of analysis. See the previous sections for the specific output files.
