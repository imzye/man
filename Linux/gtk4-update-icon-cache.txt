NAME
       gtk4-update-icon-cache - Icon theme caching utility

SYNOPSIS
       gtk4-update-icon-cache [--force] [--ignore-theme-index] [--index-only | --include-image-data] [--source NAME] [--quiet] [--validate] PATH

DESCRIPTION
       gtk4-update-icon-cache creates mmapable cache files for icon themes.

       It expects to be given the PATH to an icon theme directory containing an index.theme, e.g.  /usr/share/icons/hicolor, and writes a icon-theme.cache containing cached information about the icons in the
       directory tree below the given directory.

       GTK can use the cache files created by gtk4-update-icon-cache to avoid a lot of system call and disk seek overhead when the application starts. Since the format of the cache files allows them to be
       shared across multiple processes, for instance using the POSIX mmap() system call, the overall memory consumption is reduced as well.

OPTIONS
       --force, -f
           Overwrite an existing cache file even if it appears to be up-to-date.

       --ignore-theme-index, -t
           Don't check for the existence of index.theme in the icon theme directory. Without this option, gtk4-update-icon-cache refuses to create an icon cache in a directory which does not appear to be the
           toplevel directory of an icon theme.

       --index-only, -i
           Don't include image data in the cache.

       --include-image-data
           Include image data in the cache.

       --source, -c
           Output a C header file declaring a constant NAME with the contents of the icon cache.

       --quiet, -q
           Turn off verbose output.

       --validate, -v
           Validate existing icon cache.
