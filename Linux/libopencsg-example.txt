NAME
       opencsgexample - demo program for the OpenCSG library

SYNOPSIS
       opencsgexample

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the opencsg command.

       opencsgexample is a program that displays built-in 3D demo objects using the constructive solid geometry methods of the OpenCSG library and can thus be used to check if basic OpenCSG functionality
       is working on a system.

OPTIONS
       The program takes no options.

       Using  the program window's context menu (right mouse button), the object shown, the algorithm used for rendering and display options can be changed at runtime. Whether the object spins or not can
       be toggled by pressing the space button.
