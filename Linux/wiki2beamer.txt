NAME
       wiki2beamer - convert wiki-formatted text to latex-beamer code

SYNOPSIS
       wiki2beamer [OPTION...] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       FILE
           the text-file(s) to be processed

       -h, --help
           show a short usage help

       --version
           show version information

       -o,--output  FILE
           write output to FILE instead of stdout

USAGE
       Usually you want to pipe the output of wiki2beamer into a file:

       wiki2beamer footalk.txt > footalk.tex

       If called with multiple input files, wiki2beamer processes them in order with their content being simply concatenated. If called without any input file, wiki2beamer will attempt to read input from
       STDIN. If no input files are supplied and nothing is available on STDIN, wiki2beamer prints its usage message and exits.

       If an error occurs, wiki2beamer returns a return code other then 0.

SYNTAX
       Wiki2beamer has it’s own wiki-syntax which (evolved without much of a concept ;) and) is described below. Everything that is unknown to wiki2beamer will be passed through to the LaTeX output
       (unless inside special environments).

   Overall Structure
       A wiki2beamer txt file can consist of two sections: the head and the body. The head is optional and is an autotemplate environment. The body contains the content of the document. If the head
       (autotemplate) is not given, then only the code for the body will be generated and can be included into a manually crafted LaTeX template file.

   Managing Input
       You can split input to wiki2beamer into multiple files. This helps to keep things apart and avoids conflicts. There are two ways to split input. The first is to use multiple input files which
       wiki2beamer will read and process in order as if they were one concatenated file. The second is to use the >>>include<<< syntax.

       >>>includefile<<<
           Include the file named includefile at this line. Works recursively. Endless recursion will be detected and treated as an error. Including files doesn’t work inside [nowiki] and [code]
           environments (see below).

   Structuring the Presentation
       == sectionname ==
           opens a section called sectionname

       == longsectionname ==[shortname]
           opens a section called longsectionname, passing the parameter shortname to latex

       === subsectname ===
           opens a subsection called subsectname

       === longsubsectname ===[shortname]
           opens a subsection called longsubsectname, passing the parameter shortname to latex

       ==== frametitle ====_
           opens a frame with the title frametitle

       ==== frametitle ====[param]
           opens a frame with the title frametitle, passes frame parameters like t, fragile, verbatim etc. to latex

       !==== frametitle ====[param]
           the ! added in front of a frame, selects a frame for exclusive generation. It makes wiki2beamer skip all frames that are not selected. You can select multiple frames. This can speed up the
           edit-compile-view cycle massively.

       Sectioning commands work only at the beginning of a line.

   Lists (Bullets/Enumerations)
       * text
           create a bullet (itemize) with text

       *<onslide> text
           create a bullet (itemize) with text that only appears on the specified slides (onslide)

       # text
           create a numbered item (enumerate) with text

       #<onslide> text
           create a numbered item (enumerate) with text that only appears on the specified slides (onslide)

       Cascaded lists, mixed ordered and unordered items:

            * This is a crazy list.
            *# It contains different items.
            *# In different formats.
            *** On different levels.
            ***<2-> which are animated
            *<3-> Quite a lot of fun.
            **<4-> Isn't it?

   Environments
       LaTeX knows many environments, some of which are as simple as \begin{center} \end{center}, others are more complicated. To use these in a more wiki-like fashion, use <[name] to open and [name]> to
       close environments. It will be simply converted to \begin{name} and end{name}.

       Warning

       No parsing is done. The user is responsible for closing any opened environment. Environment-tags are only recognized at the beginning of a line.

   Special Environments
       Unlike standard environments, some environment names are recognized by wiki2beamer. These are: nowiki, code, autotemplate and frame. If wiki2beamer detects one of these it will do some advanced
       parsing, which can even fail with a syntax error.

   Autotemplate
       Autotemplate can be used at the beginning of a beamer .txt file. It will create the required LaTeX headers to compile the content.

       <[autotemplate]
           opens the autotemplate environment

       [autotemplate]>
           close the autotemplate environment

       key=value (inside [autotemplate])_
           insert a template command \keyvalue

       key=value pairs are converted to \keyvalue in the output (except special keys) — everything after = is just appended to \key.

           <[autotemplate]
           usepackage=[utf8]{inputenc}
           [autotemplate]>

       will be converted to \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}.

       There is a built-in set of options:

           <[autotemplate]
           documentclass={beamer}
           usepackage={listings}
           usepackage={wasysym}
           usepackage={graphicx}
           date={\today}
           lstdefinestyle={basic}{....}
           titleframe=True
           [autotemplate]>

       titleframe is a special key that tells wiki2beamer to create a title frame. To set the title, subtitle and author of the presentation use the keys title, subtitle and author. Overriding of the
       default options works on:

       •   per-key level for: documentclass, titleframe

       •   per-package level for: usepackage

       •   no overriding for: everything else

   Code
       Use code-environments to display animated code listings.

       <[code]
           open a code environment

       <[code][param]
           open a code environment passing parameters to the latex lstlisting environment.

       [code]>
           close the code environment

               <[code][key=value,...]
               ...
               [code]>

       <[code] opens the environment, [code]> closes it, everything after <[code] is passed to the LaTeX listings package as options for this listing. Inside the code environment, [ and ] must be escaped
       as \[ and \]. Things between [ and ] are animations. There are two kinds of animations:

       •   [<slidespec>some code] - show "some code" only on specified slides

       •   [[<slidespec>some code][<slidespec>some other code]] - show "some code" on the slides in the first spec, show "some other code" on the slides in the second spec, fill up space on slides
           without content with spaces

       Slide-specs can be of the form:

       •   n - one single frame n

       •   n-m - sequence of frames n to m

       •   spec,spec,... - combine multiple specs into on (e.g. <1-3,5>)

   Nowiki
       Nowiki-Environments completely escape from wiki2beamer replacements. <[nowiki] opens the environment, [nowiki]> closes it.

   Frame
       The LaTeX-frame environment is where the content of a slide goes. You can manually close a frame-environment which was opened with ==== Frametitle ==== with [frame]>. Wiki2beamer is then aware
       that the last frame is already closed and doesn’t try to close it again.

   Text Formatting
       '''text'''
           typeset text bold

       ''text''
           typeset text italic

       @text@
           typeset text in typewriter type, to ignore an @, escape it as \@

       !text!
           alert text, to ignore an !, escape it as \!

       _ color _ text _
           make text appear in color

   Columns
       <[columns]
           opens the column environment

       [[[ width ]]]
           creates a column of width, everything below goes into this column

       [columns]>
           closes the column environment

   Graphics
       <<<pathtofile>>>
           include image from pathtofile

       <<<pathtofile,_key=value_>>>
           include image from pathtofile passing key=value parameters to latex

   Footnotes
           create a footnote containing text

   Layout
       --length--
           when found at start of line, with nothing afterwards, insert a \vspace{length} (vertical space of length length)

       --*length--
           same as above, but insert a \vspace* (a forced vspace)

       +<_overlay_>{content}
           \uncover the content on the given overlay subframes. They will already take up the space, they need to be displayed, so the geometry of the frame doesn’t change when the element pops up.

       -<_overlay_>{content}
           \only show the content on the given overlay subframes. They will not take up the space they need to be displayed, so the geometry of the frame changes when the element pops up.

   Substitutions
       -->
           becomes $\rightarrow$

       ==>
           becomes $\Rightarrow$

       <--
           becomes $\leftarrow$

       <==
           becomes $\Leftarrow$

       :-)
           becomes \smiley (requires package wasysym)

       :-(
           becomes \frownie (requires package wasysym)

   Frame Headers/Footers
       There are two variables, FRAMEHEADER and FRAMEFOOTER. The content of these will be inserted at the beginning/end of all following slides.

       @FRAMEHEADER=text
           set frameheader to text

       @FRAMEFOOTER=text
           set framefooter to text

       Leave text empty to reset frame headers and footers.
