NAME
       buici-clock - attractive X11 clock

SYNOPSIS
       buici-clock [ -geometry geometry ]

DESCRIPTION
       buici-clock displays an attractive, analog, X11 clock.  Among the many digital clocks and analog clocks with peculiar display artifacts, buici-clock intends to stand out as a stylish, low-overhead
       clock.

OPTIONS
       -geometry geometry
              This standard X11 options specifies the position and size of the clock; see X(1).

USAGE
       What's  to  say.  This release of buici-clock offers no customizable features.  It has a white clock face, black markers, a black border, and a red second hand with a circular pointer.  The minute
       and hour hands are black and rectangular.  Some may recognize the form from Swiss railway clocks.

RESOURCES
       Because this program doesn't use a toolkit, it recognizes only the resources specified here.

       showSecondHand
               Is a boolean indicating whether or not the second hand will display.  Note that in the current version of buici-clock, disabling the second hand does not prevent an  update  of  the  clock
               face every second.
