NAME
       pfstmo_pattanaik00 - Time-dependent Visual Adaptation Model

SYNOPSIS
       pfstmo_pattanaik00 [--time-dependence] [--fps <val>] [--mul <multiplier>] [--local] [--cone <val>] [--rod <val>] [--verbose] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This command implements a tone mapping operator as described in:

       Time-Dependent Visual Adaptation for Realistic Image Display.  S.N. Pattanaik, J. Tumblin, H. Yee, and D.P. Greenberg.  In Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH 2000.

       This operator requires properly calibrated image data (in cd/m2) and its results should be gamma corrected.

       The local version of this operator is based on the following paper:

       Adaptive Gain Control For High Dynamic Range Image Display.  S.N. Pattanaik, H. Yee.  In proceedings of SCCG 2002.

OPTIONS
       --time-dependence, -t

              Use  time dependent model of adaptation. This should be used for tone mapping of an animation. It has no influence on single-frame input. Switched off by default.  Note: it is important to cor‐
              rectly set the speed of the input animation (--fps).

       --fps <val>, -f <val>

              Speed of input animation in frames per second. Used when time-dependence is switched on (-t). Default value: 16.0

       --mul <multiplier>, -m <multiplier>

              Multiply input values by a multiplier value.  Useful if input data is not calibrated. Default value: 1.0

       --local, -l

              Use local version of the tone mapping. Time-dependent effects are cancelled while using local version, global version is used by default.

       --cone <val>, -c <val>

              Set the adaptation level for cones. If --rod parameter is not used, this will also set the adaptation level for rods. By default, the adaptation level is calculated as a logarithmic average  of
              luminance in the input image.

       --rod <val>, -r <val>

              Set the adaptation level for rods. By default, the adaptation level is calculated as a logarithmic average of luminance in the input image.

       --verbose

              Print additional information during program execution.

       --help

              Print list of command line options.
