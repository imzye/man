NAME
       Net::TFTP - TFTP Client class

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::TFTP;

           $tftp = Net::TFTP->new("some.host.name", BlockSize => 1024);

           $tftp->ascii;

           $tftp->get("remotefile", "localfile");

           $tftp->get("remotefile", \*STDOUT);

           $fh = $tftp->get("remotefile");

           $tftp->binary;

           $tftp->put("localfile", "remotefile");

           $tftp->put(\*STDOUT, "remotefile");

           $fh = $tftp->put("remotefile");

           $err = $tftp->error

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::TFTP" is a class implementing a simple Trivial File Transfer Protocol client in Perl as described in RFC1350. "Net::TFTP" also supports the TFTP Option Extension (as described in RFC2347),
       with the following options

        RFC2348 Blocksize Option

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ])
           Create a new Net::TFTP object where HOST is the default host to connect to and OPTIONS are the default transfer options. Valid options are

            Option     Description                                           Default
            ------     -----------                                           -------
            Timeout    Timeout in seconds before retry                          5
            Retries    Maximum number of retries                                5
            Port       Port to send data to                                    69
            Mode       Mode to transfer data in, "octet" or "netascii"     "netascii"
            BlockSize  Negotiate size of blocks to use in the transfer        512
            IpMode     Indicates whether to operate in IPv6 mode              "v4"

METHODS
       get ( REMOTE_FILE [, LOCAL ] [, OPTIONS ])
           Get REMOTE_FILE from the server. OPTIONS can be any that are accepted by "new" plus the following

             Host    Override default host

           If the LOCAL option is missing the get will return a filehandle. This filehandle must be read ASAP as the server will otherwise timeout.

           If  the  LOCAL  option  is  given  then it can be a file name or a reference.  If it is a reference it is assumed to be a reference that is valid as a filehandle. "get" will return true if the
           transfer is successful and undef otherwise.

           Valid filehandles are

           •   A sub-class of IO::Handle

           •   A tied filehandle

           •   A GLOB reference (eg "\*STDOUT")

       put ( [ LOCAL, ] REMOTE_FILE [, OPTIONS])
           Put a file to the server as REMOTE_FILE. OPTIONS can be any that are accepted by "new" plus the following

             Host    Override default host

           If the LOCAL option is missing the put will return a filehandle. This filehandle must be written to ASAP as the server will otherwise timeout.

           If the LOCAL option is given then it can be a file name or a reference.  If it is a reference it is assumed to be a valid filehandle as described above.  "put" will return true if the transfer
           is successful and undef otherwise.

       error
           If there was an error then this method will return an error string.

       host ( [ HOST ] )
       timeout ( [ TIMEOUT ] )
       port ( [ PORT ] )
       mode ( [ MODE ] )
       retries ( [ VALUE ] )
       block_size ( [ VALUE ] )
       debug ( [ VALUE ] )
           Set or get the values for the various options. If an argument is passed then a new value is set for that option and the previous value returned.  If no value is passed then the  current  value
           is returned.

       ip_mode ( [ VALUE ] )
           Set or get which verion of IP to use ("v4" or "v6")

       ascii
       netascii
           Set the transfer mode to "netascii"

       binary
       octet
           Set the transfer mode to "octet"
