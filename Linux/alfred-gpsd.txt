ALFRED-GPSD(8)                                                                           Alfred GPS distribution server                                                                          ALFRED-GPSD(8)

NAME
       alfred-gpsd - Alfred GPS distribution server

SYNOPSIS
       alfred-gpsd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       alfred-gpsd can be used to distribute GPS location information over your batman-adv mesh network. It reads the current location from gpsd, or a fixed location from the command line, and distributes
       this information via alfred. By gathering this local information, any alfred-gpsd node can get location information about other nodes.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Print the version

       -h, --help
              Display a brief help message.

       -u, --unix-path path
              path to unix socket used for alfred server communication.

       -s, --server
              Start up in server mode. This server will read the current location from gpsd and set it in alfred via unix socket. The alfred server must run too to get this information set.

       -l, --location <lat>,<lon>,<alt>
              Rather than read the current location from gpsd, use a fixed location.

       -g, --gpsd server[:port[:device]]
              Specify the server hostname and optional port of where gpsd is listening. Additionally, a specific device connected to gpsd can be specified.

EXAMPLES
       Start an alfred-gpsd server which is fetching GPS data from the local gpsd.
            alfred-gpsd -s

       Start an alfred-gpsd server with a fixed location
            alfred-gpsd -s -l 48.858222,2.2945,358

       To get a list of GPS locations, in JSON format:
            alfred-gpsd
       [
         { "source" : "f6:00:48:13:d3:1e", "tpv" : {"class":"TPV","tag":"RMC",
           "device":"/dev/ttyACM0","mode":3,"time":"2013-10-01T10:43:20.000Z",
           "ept":0.005,"lat":52.575485000,"lon":-1.339716667,"alt":122.500,

           "climb":0.000,"eps":31.44} },
         { "source" : "8e:4c:77:b3:65:b4", "tpv" : {"class":"TPV",
           "device":"command line","time":"2013-10-01T10:43:05.129Z",
           "lat":48.858222,"lon":2.2945,"alt":358.000000,"mode":3}
         }
