NAME
       File::Remove - Remove files and directories

VERSION
       version 1.61

SYNOPSIS
           use File::Remove 'remove';

           # removes (without recursion) several files
           remove( '*.c', '*.pl' );

           # removes (with recursion) several directories
           remove( \1, qw{directory1 directory2} );

           # removes (with recursion) several files and directories
           remove( \1, qw{file1 file2 directory1 *~} );

           # removes without globbing:
           remove( \1, {glob => 0}, '*');

           # trashes (with support for undeleting later) several files
           trash( '*~' );

DESCRIPTION
       File::Remove::remove removes files and directories.  It acts like /bin/rm, for the most part.  Although "unlink" can be given a list of files, it will not remove directories; this module remedies
       that.  It also accepts wildcards, * and ?, as arguments for filenames.

       File::Remove::trash accepts the same arguments as remove, with the addition of an optional, infrequently used "other platforms" hashref.

SUBROUTINES
   remove
       Removes files and directories.  Directories are removed recursively like in rm -rf if the first argument is a reference to a scalar that evaluates to true.  If the first argument is a reference to
       a scalar, then it is used as the value of the recursive flag.  By default it's false so only pass \1 to it.

       If the next argument is a hash reference then it is a key/values of options.  Currently, there is one supported option of "'glob' => 0" which prevents globbing. E.g:

           remove(\1, {glob => 0}, '*');

       Will not remove files globbed by '*' and will only remove the file called asterisk if it exists.

       In list context it returns a list of files/directories removed, in scalar context it returns the number of files/directories removed.  The list/number should match what was passed in if everything
       went well.

   rm
       Just calls remove.  It's there for people who get tired of typing remove.

   clear
       The "clear" function is a version of "remove" designed for use in test scripts. It takes a list of paths that it will both initially delete during the current test run, and then further flag for
       deletion at END-time as a convenience for the next test run.

   trash
       Removes files and directories, with support for undeleting later.  Accepts an optional "other platforms" hashref, passing the remaining arguments to remove.

       Win32
           Requires Win32::FileOp.

           Installation not actually enforced on Win32 yet, since Win32::FileOp has badly failing dependencies at time of writing.

       OS X
           Requires Mac::Glue.

       Other platforms
           The first argument to trash() must be a hashref with two keys, 'rmdir' and 'unlink', each referencing a coderef.  The coderefs will be called with the filenames that are to be deleted.

   expand
       DO NOT USE. Kept for legacy.

   undelete
       DO NOT USE. Kept for legacy.
