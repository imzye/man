NAME
       ethmergeperf2

       Merges  the  output from two ethextactperf2 runs from the same fabric. Delta counters for matching links will be computed (before subtracted from after) and a CSV file equivalent to ethextractperf2 's
       output format will be generated suitable for importing into a spreadsheet or parsing by other scripts.

       NOTE: The before.csv and after.csv input files must be generated from the same fabric, with before.csv containing counters prior to after.csv. Both files must have been generated to contain  the  run‐
       ning counters

       without any counter clears between before.csv and after.csv.
