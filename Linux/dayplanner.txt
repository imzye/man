Day Planner(1)                                                                                                                                                                                   Day Planner(1)

NAME
       Day Planner - a simple Day Planner for Gtk2/GNOME.

SYNOPSIS
       dayplanner [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Day Planner is a program designed to help you easily plan and manage your time. It can manage appointments, birthdays and more and makes sure you remember your appointments by displaying reminders.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display the help screen.

       -v, --version
           Display version information.

       -d, --debuginfo
           Display information useful for debugging. You should include the output of this command with any bug report.

       -t, --test N
           Start Day Planner in "test" mode. This starts up a Day Planner instance completely separate from your real instance, so that no data will be touched.  This is mainly useful for testing unstable
           versions of Day Planner.

           --test can take an optional argument (N) which is a number. This number specifies the test instance to use, which allows you to have many different instances for different purposes.

       --confdir DIR
           Use the directory DIR instead of the default Day Planner configuration directory. See also --test.

       -s, --shutdaemon
           Shut down the Day Planner daemon when closing Day Planner.

       --nodaemon
           Run Day Planner without the Day Planner daemon. This is useful on systems where memory is low, primarily embedded systems. You should be somewhat careful with running in this mode because the
           daemon is the component that launches the notifier, if it isn't running then you won't recieve any notifications.

       --exportical FILE
           Export Day Planner calendar data in the iCalendar format to FILE.

       --importical FILE
           Import iCalendar data from FILE.

       --exporthtml DIR
           Export Day Planner data as HTML to DIR. DIR should be empty before you issue this command (although Day Planner will happily overwrite data in the directory if it isn't).

FILES
       CONFDIR is XDG_CONFIG_PATH/dayplanner by default. XDG_CONFIG_PATH is ~/.config by default. So on most installations CONFDIR is ~/.config/dayplanner/. See --debuginfo to see which path this install is
       using.

       These paths are altered by the --confdir and --test commandline arguments.

           The holiday definitions file. Feel free to edit it.

       CONFDIR/daemon_state.conf
           The daemon's internal state file. You really should not edit this.

       CONFDIR/daemon.log CONFDIR/services.log
