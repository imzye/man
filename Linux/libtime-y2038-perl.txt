Time::y2038::Everywhere(3pm)                                                        User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                        Time::y2038::Everywhere(3pm)

NAME
       Time::y2038::Everywhere - Use Time::y2038's gmtime and localtime everywhere.

SYNOPSIS
           use Time::y2038::Everywhere;

           # All uses of localtime() and gmtime() in the whole program
           # are now using Time::y2038's

DESCRIPTION
       Time::y2038::Everywhere replaces localtime() and gmtime() with its own functions everywhere.  This ensures not just that your code is 2038 safe, but that any modules you use are, too.

NOTES
       May also override Time::Local::timelocal and Time::Local::timegm in the future.
