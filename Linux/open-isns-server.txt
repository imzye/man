NAME
       isnsd - iSNS server daemon

SYNOPSIS
       isnsd [-f] [-4] [-6] [-c filename] [-d debug-facility] [--dump-db] [--init]

DESCRIPTION
       Isnsd implements the iSNS protocol as defined in RFC 4171.  iSNS is a discovery protocol for iSCSI and iFCP.

OPTIONS
       By default, isnsd will take most of its settings from the configuration file /etc/isns/isnsd.conf, with the exception of the following options:

       --config filename, -c filename
              This option overrides the default configuration file.

       --foreground,-f
              By default, isnsd will put itself into the background. By specifying this option, you can tell it to run in the foreground. Any error messages or debug output will be printed to the console
              rather than being sent to syslog.

       -4     tells isnsd to create an IPv4 socket only. Normally, it defaults to IPv6 (which will accept both IPv4 and IPv6 connections).

       -6     tells isnsd explicitly to create an IPv6 socket only. Since it defaults to IPv6 anyway, this is really a no-op.

       --debug facility, -d facility
              enables debugging. Valid facilities are

       --dump-db
              This is a helper function that will read the database from the file system, and display it in human readable form. When using this option, isnsd will not open any sockets, and terminate im‐
              mediately after display the database.

              This option is intended to be used by the administrator when suspecting that the database contains bad/inconsistent information.

       --init This option will create the server's authentication key, and the required DSA parameters. The private key is stored in the file specified by the AuthKey option (usually /etc/isns/auth_key).
              The public portion of the key is written to same directory, with the suffix .pub appended to the key file name.
