NAME
       planarity - The Edge Addition Planarity Suite

SYNOPSIS
       planarity [-q] [-h|-help] [-i|-info] [-r] [-s] [-rm] [-rn]

DESCRIPTION
       Invokes the Edge Addition Planarity Suite commandline tool.

       Without argument, the tool presents a menu-driven interactive interface.

       When used in batch mode, the tool returns 0 for a planar graph, 1 for a nonplanar graph and -1 on error.

OPTIONS
       -q     Quiet mode

       -h, -help
              Display some help

       -i, -info
              Display copyright, license and reference articles information

FEATURES
       Features in batch mode.

       -r C K N
              Run the C command (see below) on K random graphs with N vertices

       -s C I O [O2]
              Run the C command (see below) on a specific graph given in the I input file, with output in the primary O file and complementary information in the secondary O2 file.

       -rm N O [O2]
              Compute a maximal planar random graph on N vertices with output in the primary O file and optionally the chosen graph in the O2 file.

       -rn N O [O2]
              Compute a nonplanar random graph (maximal planar and an edge) on N vertices with output in the primary O file and optionally the chosen graph in the O2 file.

COMMANDS
       Determine which algorithm implementation to run

       -p     Planar embedding and Kuratowski subgraph isolation

       -d     Planar graph drawing by visibility representation

       -o     Outerplanar embedding and obstruction isolation

       -2     Search for subgraph homeomorphic to K_{2,3}

       -3     Search for subgraph homeomorphic to K_{3,3}

       -4     Search for subgraph homeomorphic to K_4

       -a     All of the above

EXAMPLES
       planarity -s -q -p infile.txt embedding.out [obstruction.out]
              Process infile.txt in quiet mode (-q), putting planar embedding in embedding.out or (optionally) a Kuratowski subgraph in Obstruction.out Process returns 0=planar, 1=nonplanar, -1=error

       planarity -s -q -d infile.txt embedding.out [drawing.out]
              If graph in infile.txt is planar, then put embedding in embedding.out and (optionally) an ASCII art drawing in drawing.out Process returns 0=planar, 1=nonplanar, -1=error
