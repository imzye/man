NAME
       locktest - Find differences in locking between two SMB servers

SYNOPSIS
       locktest {//server1/share1} {//server2/share2} [-U user%pass] [-U user%pass] [-s seed] [-o numops] [-a] [-O] [-E] [-Z] [-R range] [-B base] [-M min]

DESCRIPTION
       locktest is a utility for detecting differences in behaviour in locking between SMB servers. It will run a random set of locking operations against //server1/share1 and then the same random set
       against //server2/share2 and display the differences in the responses it gets.

       This utility is used by the Samba team to find differences in behaviour between Samba and Windows servers.

OPTIONS
       -U user%pass
           Specify the user and password to use when logging on on the shares. This parameter can be specified twice (once for the first server, once for the second).

       -s seed
           Seed the random number generator with the specified value.

       -o numops
           Set the number of operations to perform.

       -a
           Print the operations that are performed.

       -A
           Backtrack to find minimal number of operations required to make the response to a certain call differ.

       -O
           Enable oplocks.

       -u
           Hide unlock fails.

       -E
           enable exact error code checking

       -Z
           enable the zero/zero lock

       -R range
           set lock range

       -B base
           set lock base

       -M min
           set min lock length

       -k
           Use kerberos
