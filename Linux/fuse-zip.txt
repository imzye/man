NAME
       fuse-zip - a FUSE filesystem for zip archives with write support

SYNOPSIS
       fuse-zip [options] zip-file mount-point

OPTIONS
       -h     print help

       -V     print version

       -r     open archive in read-only mode

       -o opt[,opt...]
              mount options (refer to mount.fuse(8) for details)

       -f     don't detach from terminal

       -d     turn on debugging, also implies -f

   Specific mount options:
       force_precise_time
              By  default high precision timestamp is saved to archive only for new files or files with known creation time. You can force high-precision time saving by specifying '-o force_precise_time'
              option. In this case creation time will be equal to a first known file modification time.

DESCRIPTION
       fuse-zip is a FUSE filesystem, that enables any program to work with a ZIP archive as though it is a plain directory.  Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any application without  modifica‐
       tions.

       Unlike other FUSE filesystems, only fuse-zip provides write support to ZIP archives.  Also, fuse-zip is faster than all known implementations on large archives with many files.

       Since version 0.3.0 fuse-zip has support for absolute and parent-relative paths in file names, but only in read-only mode (-r command line switch). Absolute paths are displayed under "ROOT" direc‐
       tory, every ".." in path replaced by "UP" in directory name and "normal" files are placed under "CUR" directory.

       Support for UNIX file permissions and owner information has been added in version 0.4.0. See PERMISSIONS for details.

       Since version 0.5.0 fuse-zip forces open in read-only mode if archive file or its parent directory is not writable.

       File/archive comments are supported since version 0.7.0. To read/modify file comment use extended attribute "user.comment". Archive comment is accessible via mount point's extended attribute.

       If you want to specify character set conversion for file names in archive, use the following fusermount options:

         -omodules=iconv,from_code=$charset1,to_code=$charset2

       See FUSE documentation for details.

USAGE
       General usage would look like this

       1   mkdir /tmp/zipArchive
       2   fuse-zip foobar.zip /tmp/zipArchive
       3   (do something with the mounted file system)
       4   fusermount -u /tmp/zipArchive

       Be patient. Wait for fuse-zip process finish after unmounting, especially on a big archives.

PERMISSIONS
       Access check will not be performed unless -o default_permissions mount option is given.

FILES
       /var/log/user.log
              see this file in case any errors occur

SEE ALSO
       fusermount(1), mount.fuse(8).
