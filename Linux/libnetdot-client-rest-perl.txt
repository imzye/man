NAME
       Netdot::Client::REST - RESTful API for Netdot

SYNOPSIS
        use Netdot::Client::REST;
        use Data::Dumper;

        my $netdot = Netdot::Client::REST->new(
            server=>'http://localhost.localdomain/netdot',
            username=>'admin',
            password=>'xxxxx',
            );

        # Get all devices
        my @devs = $netdot->get('/Device');

        print Dumper(@devs);

        # Get Device id 1
        my $dev = $netdot->get('/Device/1');

        # Get Device id 1 and foreign objects one level away
        my $dev = $netdot->get('/Device/1?depth=1');

        # Update Device 1
        $dev = $netdot->post('/Device/1', {community=>'public'});

        # Delete Device 1
        $netdot->delete('/Device/1');

       See examples/ directory for a sample script

DESCRIPTION
       Netdot::Client::REST can be used in Perl scripts that need access to the Netdot application database. Communication occurs over HTTP/HTTPS, thus avoiding the need to open SQL access on the machine
       running Netdot.

CLASS METHODS
   new - Constructor and login method
         Arguments:
           server    - Netdot installation URL (e.g. http://host.localdomain/netdot)
           username  - Netdot username
           password  - Netdot password
           retries   - Number of retries (default: 3)
           timeout   - seconds (default: 10)
           format    - Representation format (default: xml)
                       Currently only XML is supported
         Returns:
           Netdot::Client::REST object
         Examples:
           my $netdot = Netdot::Client::REST->new(
                server   =>'http://host.localdomain/netdot',
                username => 'myuser',
                password => 'mypass',
           );

INSTANCE METHODS
   get - Get all attributes from one or more Netdot objects
         Arguments:
           Resource  - string containing RESTful resource

           In addition to the object's class and (optional) ID, the HTTP argument "depth"
           allows the user to fetch all foreign objects recursively, limited by the
           value of the depth argument.  Foreign objects include relational records
           referenced by the given object and records that reference the given object (both
           sides of the one-to-many relationship).  The performance impact of the given depth
           is a balance between fewer queries with large datasets and more queries with smaller
           datasets. The default depth is 0 (only return the given object plus references
           to objects directly related).

         Returns:
           hashref with object's attributes

           A special attribute is added for each foreign key that allows the programmer
           to request that resource more easily.  For example, if a record has a field
           called 'foo' which is a foreign key pointing to a record of class 'Bar',
           with id '1', then the result hashref will include a keys like:

              foo => 'Foo bar name',
              foo_xlink => 'Bar/1',

           where 'foo_xlink' can be passed to this method to get the full Bar/1 resource.

         Examples:
           my $dev = $netdot->get('Device/1');
           my $dev = $netdot->get('Device/1?depth=1');
           my @alldevs = $netdot->get('Device');
           my @mydevs = $netdot->get('Device?sysname=mydev');

   post - Update or Insert a Netdot object
         Arguments:
           Resource  - string containing RESTful resource
           data      - Hashref containing key/value pairs
         Returns:
           hashref with object's attributes
         Examples:
           $netdot->post('Device/1', \%data);
           $netdot->post('Device', \%data);

   delete - Delete a Netdot object
         Arguments:
           Resource  - string containing RESTful resource
         Returns:
           True if successful
         Examples:
           $netdot->delete('Device/1');
