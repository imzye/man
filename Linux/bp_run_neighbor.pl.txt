NAME
       run_neighbor - run Phylip's 'neighbor' program through Bioperl

SYNOPSIS
       run_neighbor [-i inputfile] [-o outfilename]

DESCRIPTION
       Provide an matrix file to run neighbor on.  File should be named of the forma file.matrix or file.protdist (the ending doesn't matter, but the program expects a file in the form of (\S+)\.(\S+).

       This will run the application 'neighbor' to build a Neighbor-Joining tree from a protein distance matrix.
