NAME
       "socket_getnameinfo" - command-line tool to "getnameinfo(3)" resolver

SYNOPSIS
       socket_getnameinfo [options...] address port

DESCRIPTION
       This tool provides a convenient command-line wrapper around the getnameinfo(3) resolver function. It will perform a single reverse lookup to convert an address and port number into its host and
       service names. This is mainly useful when debugging names resolution problems, because it allows inspection of the getnameinfo(3) behaviour itself, outside of any real program that is trying to
       use it.

OPTIONS
       --address, -A ADDR
               Numerical form of address to look up. If not supplied, will use the first positional argument.

       --port, -P PORT
               Port number to look up. If not supplied, will use the second positional argument.

       --dgram Sets the "NI_DGRAM" flag; looks up a "SOCK_DGRAM" (udp) port allocation rather than "SOCK_STREAM" (tcp).

       --help  Display a help summary and exit

NOTE
       Upstream this script is known as "getnameinfo", but was renamed on Debian.
