NAME
       pam-panel-icon - A notification area indicator of pam_timestamp status

SYNOPSIS
       pam-panel-icon

DESCRIPTION
       pam-panel-icon  should  be  automatically started when starting an X11 desktop environment.  For example, in GNOME gnome-session should be configured to start pam-panel-icon.  In a properly configured
       system it should never be necessary to start pam-panel-icon manually.

       pam-panel-icon uses pam_timestamp_check(8) to watch the pam_timestamp timestamp status.  If the pam_timestamp authorization is active, allowing an unprivileged user to temporarily authenticate as  the
       root user without providing a password, an icon in the notification area of the panel is displayed.  The icon allows dropping the authorization immediately.

EXIT STATUS
       Ordinarily, pam-panel-icon keeps running until the X11 desktop session ends, and then returns 0.  pam-panel-icon only returns with non-zero status on unexpected error.

FILES
       /sbin/pam_timestamp_check
              A hard-coded location of the pam_timestamp_check executable.
