JACK-STDIN(1)                                                                             General Commands Manual                                                                             JACK-STDIN(1)

NAME
       jack-stdin - write JACK audio data to stdin

SYNOPSIS

       jack-stdin [OPTIONS] port1 [ port2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       jack-stdin reads raw audio data from standard-input and writes it to a JACK audio port.

       The number of given ports detemine the number of audio channels that are used.  If more than one channel is given, the input audio-sample data needs to be interleaved.

OPTIONS
       -b, --bitdepth BITS
              Specify  the  bit-depth of each sample. For integer-encoding this can be 16 or 24.  The default is 16.  This setting is only used for integer encoding: Floating-point samples will always be
              32 bit wide.

       -d, --duration SEC
              Specify the time for which jack-stdin should run in seconds.  A value less than 1 means to run indefinitely. The default is 0 which reads until end-of-file.

       -e, --encoding FORMAT
              Set the input format of the data: signed-integer, unsigned-integer, floating-point (default: signed)

       -n, --name CLIENTNAME
              Set JACK client name (default: jstdin)

       -f, --file FILENAME
              Read data from given file instead of standard-input.

       -h, --help
              Print a brief usage information

       -p, --prebuffer PERCENT
              Pre-fill the buffer before starting audio output to JACK (default 50.0%).  NOTE: disable pre-buffering (-p 0) or use a small buffer size to play back very short samples.

       -L, --little-endian
              The input-data is in little-endian byte-order or native-byte-order float (this is the default)

       -B, --big-endian
              Interpret input audio data in big-endian byte-order or swap the byte-order of floating-point.

       -q, --quiet
              Inhibit usual output.  This affects information and buffer-overflow warnings but not setup-errors.

       -S, --bufsize SAMPLES
              Choose the internal buffer-size in samples. The default size is 65536.  The given value will be multiplied by the number of channels and bit-depth to get the size of the ring-buffer.  Note:
              the buffersize must be larger than JACK's period size.

EXAMPLES
         jack-stdout vlc_31994:out_1 vlc_31994:out_2 \
            | sox -t raw -r 48k -e signed -b 16 -c 2 - \
                  -t raw -r 48k -e signed -b 16 -c 2 - \
               tremolo 5 100 \
            | ./jack-stdin system:playback_1 system:playback_2

         cat /dev/dsp \
            | jack-stdin system:playback_1 system:playback_2

KNOWN ISSUES
       jack-stdin is not suitable to play-back files shorter than twice the jack-period size.
