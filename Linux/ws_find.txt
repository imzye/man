NAME
       ws_find - give path to a workspace

SYNOPSIS
       ws_find [-h] [-F FILESYSTEM] [-l] WORKSPACE

DESCRIPTION
       Return path to a workspaces of the calling user.  The output can be restricted to workspaces in a certain FILESYSTEM.

       The idea of the workspace is to allow the administrator to keep control of filespace in working filesystems, and to avoid the situations that data of past and finished projects/jobs is idling for ever
       on disks. A user can create and dispose arbitrary number of workspaces, they are cheap, and can be created e.g. for each job.

       From the system side, workspaces will be deleted after beeing expired. A friendly user can release workspaces before the expiration date using ws_release which will mark the workspace for future dele‐
       tion and make the data unavailable.

       Deletion is probably a task done once a night and not immediately.

       If a workspace was forgotten and expired, it might make sense to contact the administrator, as he probaly can restore a workspace for some time, if disk space is not low.

OPTIONS
       -h     display usage help text

       -l     list the available filesystems, only filesystems the user has access to will be shown.

       -F     select the filesystem to list the workspace from.

EXAMPLES
       get a workspace path
              ws_find myworkspace
