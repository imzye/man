PMLOGMV(1)                  General Commands Manual                 PMLOGMV(1)

NAME
       pmlogmv - move (rename) Performance Co-Pilot archive files

SYNOPSIS
       pmlogmv [-fNV?]  oldname newname

DESCRIPTION
       A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive consists of multiple files as cre‐
       ated by pmlogger(1).  pmlogmv allows all the files of a single PCP  ar‐
       chive to be moved or renamed as a group in a single operation.

       The  oldname  argument identifies the target archive, and may be either
       the basename that is common to all files in that archive or one of  the
       archive's files.  The new archive's basename is newname.

       Because  PCP archives are important records of system activity, special
       care is taken to ensure the  integrity  of  an  archive's  files.   For
       recoverable  problems  encountered during the execution of pmlogmv, all
       the files associated with oldname will be preserved, and no  new  files
       with  the  newname  prefix  will  be created.  ``Recoverable problems''
       include signals that can be caught (such as SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and
       SIGTERM),  permissions  issues, new files already existing, file system
       full events, etc.

       The implementation of pmlogmv uses hard links in the file system and so
       follows the semantic restrictions of ln(2) which for most systems means
       the directories containing both the oldname and the newname PCP archive
       files need to be writeable and within the same file system.

OPTIONS
       The available command line options are:

       -f, --force
            Normally  pmlogmv  takes a conservative view in respect of newname
            and will not proceed if newname contains any characters  that  are
            likely to cause a problem for sh(1).  This includes ``glob'' char‐
            acters like ``?'', ``*'' and ``['', shell syntax  meta  characters
            like  ``('', ``|'', ``;'' and ``&'', shell I/O redirection charac‐
            ters like ``<'' and ``>'', the dollar sign, a space, etc.

            The -f flag forces pmlogmv to proceed, even  if  newname  contains
            any of these ``unsafe'' characters.

       -N, --showme
            Perform  a  dry-run,  checking and reporting what changes would be
            made without making any changes.

       -V, --verbose
            Enable verbose mode.

       -?, --help
            Display usage message and exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error and warning messages are intended to be easily understood and
       errors produce a non-zero exit status.
