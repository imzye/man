NAME
       /usr/sbin/laptop_mode - apply laptop mode settings

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/laptop_mode [ cmd ] [ force ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the /usr/sbin/laptop_mode command. laptop_mode is a program that applies the settings given in the /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf configuration file. The pri‐
       mary use is to control the laptop mode feature included in Linux kernels with versions 2.6.6 and higher, and 2.4.23 and higher.  This feature increases battery life by letting your hard drive spin
       down.  This is achieved by grouping disk write activity into "chunks" that are spaced at larger intervals than they normally would be. In addition to supporting the Linux kernel's laptop mode fea‐
       ture, /usr/sbin/laptop_mode also supports various power saving modules which are configured through configuration files in the /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d directory.

       It is not recommended to call /usr/sbin/laptop_mode directly to start or stop laptop mode, except in hardware event handlers. To apply new configuration settings from  laptop-mode.conf,  call  the
       laptop-mode service init script with the reload parameter.

COMMANDS
       Specify force as the second parameter to force laptop_mode to re-apply a state even if the computer is already in that state. These are the values that are allowed for cmd :

       auto      Enable or disable laptop mode based on the current power state. Note that this will not do anything if the laptop-mode service has not been started!

       status    Display a status report about everything that laptop_mode affects.
