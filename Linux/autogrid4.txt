NAME
       autogrid - preparing protein and ligand for AutoDock analysis

SYNOPSIS
       autogrid4 [options] -p gridparameterfile

DESCRIPTION
       AutoGrid  prepares a 3D grid representation of the non-covalent interaction energies that various user-specified ligand atom types will experience around a user-specified target macromolecule.  In ad‐
       dition, the electrostatic potential and desolvation free energy grid maps may also be calculated.  The grid maps are stored in plain text files with the extension '.map' and are required by AutoDock 4
       to  perform  dockings.  AutoGrid also outputs a '.xyz' file which describes the spatial extents of the grid box, and an AVS field '.fld' file which describes the consistent set of atomic affinity grid
       maps that were calculated together for a given target macromolecule. Note: it is necessary to compute grid maps for all the atom types in the ligand or set of ligands that will be docked, as  well  as
       an electrostatic potential grid map and a desolvation free energy map. For example, if a ligand has an aliphatic carbon and a hydrogen-bond-accepting oxygen atom, it would be necessary to compute both
       a 'C' map and an 'OA' map.  See http://autodock.scripps.edu/faqs-help/faq/where-do-i-set-the-autodock-4-force-field-parameters for more information about AutoDock 4 atom types.

       The input to AutoGrid is best prepared with the program suite AutoDockTools.  There is no way to run autodock4 without a grid.

OPTIONS
       -o Use old PDBq format (q in columns 55-61)

       -u     Usage information, also -h on Debian.

       -d     Increased verbosity of messages to help debugging.

       -l     logfile

       -p     filename Specifies Grid Parameter File

EXAMPLE
       A range of tests is made available with the AutoGrid sources that can be used as follows:
       $ D=/usr/share/doc/autogrid/Tests
       $ cd /tmp
       $ ln -s $D/AD4_parameters.dat .
       $ gunzip -c $D/hsg1_sm.pdbqt.gz > hsg1_sm.pdbqt
       $ autogrid4 -p $D/hsg1_no_receptor_types.gpf -l hsg1_no_receptor_types.glg

       This command prepares grid map files for each of the AutoDock atom types specified in the grid parameter file (in this case: hsg1_sm.A.map, hsg1_sm.C.map, hsg1_sm.d.map, hsg1_sm.e.map, hsg1_sm.HD.map,
       hsg1_sm.NA.map,  hsg1_sm.N.map,  hsg1_sm.OA.map),  the  AVS  field  file  (hsg1_sm.maps.fld)  and hsg1_sm.maps.xyz. To perform the cocking calculation, AutoDock should be executed, though it demands a
       separate docking parameter file (with extension .dpf).  The 'DPF' refers to the grid map files that are necessary to the docking and allows the setting of  other  important  parameters,  such  as  the
       search method and how many dockings to perform.
