Template::Plugin::Stash(3pm)                                                        User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                        Template::Plugin::Stash(3pm)

NAME
       Template::Plugin::Stash - expose the stash, ideal for Dumpering...

SYNOPSIS
           [% USE Stash %]
           [% USE Dumper Indent = 1%]
           <pre>[% Dumper.dump_html( Stash.stash() ) %]</pre>

DESCRIPTION
       Instead of messing with "[% PERL %]" blocks to get at the stash, simply "[% USE Stash %]".

       Output will look something like

           $VAR1 = {
               'global' => {},
               'var1' => 6666666,
               'var2' => {
               'e' => 'f',
               'g' => 'h',
               'a' => 'b',
               'c' => 'd'
               },
           };

       which should be all you need.
