NAME
     xaumix — aumix wrapper for X

SYNOPSIS
     xaumix

DESCRIPTION
     xaumix is a wrapper to select one of rxvt, xterm, kterm, or one of the other possible xterm "clones", and to launch that with aumix running in it. For some X terminal emulators an aumix colour scheme
     file is used to generate a sensible display (for example, rxvt and xterm behave differently with respect to the handling of colours).

     This script was originally intended for use from the Debian menu system, but may also be invoked manually from a shell.  The GTK+ interface to aumix largely supersedes it.
