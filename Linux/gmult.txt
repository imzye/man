DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the Multiplication Puzzle (gmult) game. This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       Multiplication Puzzle is a simple GTK 4 game that emulates the multiplication game found in emacs. Basically, a multiplication problem is shown with all digits replaced by letters. Your job is to
       guess which letter represents which number.
