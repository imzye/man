NAME
       dualcoax - determine impedance of a coaxial structure with two concentric dielectrics.

SYNOPSIS
       dualcoax D1 D2 D3 Er1 Er2

DESCRIPTION
       dualcoax  computes  the  impedaance  of a dualcoaxial cable, with two concentric dielectrics, given the outside diameter of the inner conductor D1, the outside diameter of the inner dielectric D2, the
       outside diameter of the outer dielectric (which is also the inside diameter of the outer conductor) D3, as well as the relative permttivity of the inner dielectric Er1 and the outer dielectric Er2.
