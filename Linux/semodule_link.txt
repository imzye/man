DESCRIPTION
       semodule_link  is  a  developer  tool  for  manually  linking  together a set of SELinux policy module packages into a single policy module package.  This tool is not necessary for normal operation of
       SELinux.  In normal operation, such linking is performed internally by libsemanage in response to semodule commands.  Module packages are created by semodule_package.
