NAME
       gp-display-text - display the performance data in plain text format

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng display text [OPTION(S)] [COMMAND(S)] [-script <script_file>] EXPERIMENT(S)

DESCRIPTION
       Print a plain text version of the various displays supported by gprofng.

OPTIONS
       --version
              print the version number and exit.

       --help print usage information and exit.

       --verbose {on|off}
              enable (on) or disable (off) verbose mode; the default is "off".

       -script <script-file>
              execute the commands stored in the script file; this feature may be combined with commands specified at the command line.

COMMANDS
       This tool supports a rich set of commands to control the display of the data; instead of, or in addition to, including these commands in a script file, it is
       also allowed to include such commands at the command line; in this case, the commands need to be prepended with the "-" symbol; the  commands  are  processed
       and interpreted left from right, so the order matters; The gprofng manual documents the commands that are supported.

       If  this  tool is invoked without options, commands, or a script file, it starts in interpreter mode. The user can then issue the commands interactively; the
       session is terminated with the "exit" command in the interpreter.

DOCUMENTATION
       A getting started guide for gprofng is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the info and gprofng programs are properly installed  at  your  site,  the  command
       "info gprofng" should give you access to this document.
