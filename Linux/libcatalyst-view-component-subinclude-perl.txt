NAME
       Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude::ESI - Edge Side Includes (ESI) plugin for C::V::Component::SubInclude

VERSION
       Version 0.07_03

SYNOPSIS
       In your view class:

         package MyApp::View::TT;
         use Moose;

         extends 'Catalyst::View::TT';
         with 'Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude';

         __PACKAGE__->config( subinclude_plugin => 'ESI' );

       Then, somewhere in your templates:

         [% subinclude('/my/widget') %]

DESCRIPTION
       "Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude::ESI" renders "subinclude" calls as Edge Side Includes (ESI) include directives. This is a feature implemented by Varnish
       (<http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/>) which allows cache-efficient uses of includes.

METHODS
   "generate_subinclude( $c, $path, @args )"
       Note that $path should be the private action path - translation to the public path is handled internally. After translation, this will roughly translate to the following code:

         my $url = $c->uri_for( $translated_path, @args )->path_query;
         return '<!--esi <esi:include src="$url" /> -->';

       Notice that the stash will always be empty. This behavior could be configurable in the future through an additional switch - for now, this behavior guarantees a common interface for plugins.
