NAME
       collectdmon - Monitoring daemon for collectd

SYNOPSIS
       collectdmon [options] [-- collectd options]

DESCRIPTION
       collectdmon is a small "wrapper" daemon which starts and monitors the
       collectd daemon. If collectd terminates it will automatically be
       restarted, unless collectdmon was told to shut it down.

OPTIONS
       collectdmon supports the following options:

       -c <path>
           Specify the pathname of the collectd binary. You may either specify
           an absolute path or simply the name of the binary in which case the
           PATH variable will be searched for it. The default is "collectd".

       -P <pid-file>
           Specify the pid file. The default is "/var/run/collectdmon.pid".

       -h  Output usage information and exit.

       collectd options
           Specify options that are passed on to collectd. If it is not
           already included, -f will be added to these options. See
           collectd(1).

SIGNALS
       collectdmon accepts the following signals:

       SIGINT, SIGTERM
           These signals cause collectdmon to terminate collectd, wait for its
           termination and then shut down.

       SIGHUP
           This signal causes collectdmon to terminate collectd, wait for its
           termination and then restart it.
