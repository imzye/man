SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
     apertium-despptx is an PPTX format processor.  Data should be passed through this processor before being piped to lt-proc(1).  The program takes input in the form of an PPTX document and produces output
     suitable for processing with lt-proc(1).  PPTX tags and other format information are enclosed in brackets so that lt-proc(1) treats them as whitespace between words.
