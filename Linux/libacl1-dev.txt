NAME
       acl_delete_perm — delete a permission from an ACL permission set

LIBRARY
       Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/acl.h>

       int
       acl_delete_perm(acl_permset_t permset_d, acl_perm_t perm);

DESCRIPTION
       The  acl_delete_perm()  function  deletes the permission contained in the argument perm (one of ACL_READ, ACL_WRITE, ACL_EXECUTE) from the permission set referred to by the argument permset_d.  An
       attempt to delete a permission that is not contained in the permission set is not considered an error.

       Any existing descriptors that refer to permset_d continue to refer to that permission set.

RETURN VALUE
       The acl_delete_perm() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_delete_perm() function returns -1 and sets errno to the corresponding value:

       [EINVAL]           The argument permset_d is not a valid descriptor for a permission set within an ACL entry.

                          The argument perm does not contain a valid acl_perm_t value.

STANDARDS
       IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned)
