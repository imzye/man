NAME
       hmmconvert - convert profile file to a HMMER format

SYNOPSIS
       hmmconvert [options] <hmmfile>

DESCRIPTION
       The hmmconvert utility converts an input profile file to different HMMER formats.

       By default, the input profile can be in any HMMER format, including old/obsolete formats from HMMER2, ASCII or binary; the output profile is a current HMMER3 ASCII format.

       <hmmfile> may be '-' (dash), which means reading this input from stdin rather than a file.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

       -a     Output profiles in ASCII text format. This is the default.

       -b     Output profiles in binary format.

       -2     Output in legacy HMMER2 ASCII text format, in ls (glocal) mode. This allows HMMER3 models to be converted back to a close approximation of HMMER2, for comparative studies.

       --outfmt <s>
              Output in a HMMER3 ASCII text format other then the most current one.  Valid choices for <s> are 3/a through 3/f.  The current format is 3/f, and this is the default. The format 3/b was used in
              the official HMMER3 release, and the others were used in the various testing versions.
