NAME
       salt-lint - A command-line utility that checks for best practices in SaltStack.

SYNOPSIS
       salt-lint [OPTIONS] [FILE ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes the salt-lint program, a linting utility that checks for best practices in SaltStack SLS files.

OPTIONS
   positional arguments:
       FILE   one or more files or paths

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -L     list all the rules

       -r RULESDIR
              specify one or more rules directories using one or more -r arguments. Any -r flags override the default rules in $rulesdir/saltlint/rules, unless -R is also used.

       -R     Use default rules in $rulesdir/saltlint/rules in addition to any extra rules directories specified with -r. There is no need to specify this if no -r flags are used.

       -t TAGS
              only check rules whose id/tags match these values

       -T     list all the tags

       -v     Increase verbosity level

       -x SKIP_LIST
              only check rules whose id/tags do not match these values

       --nocolor, --nocolour
              disable colored output

       --force-color, --force-colour
              Try force colored output (relying on salt's code)

       --exclude EXCLUDE_PATHS
              path to directories or files to skip. This option is repeatable.

       --json parse the output as JSON

       --severity
              add the severity to the standard output

       -c C   Specify configuration file to use. Defaults to ".saltlint"

FILES
       $PWD/.saltlint  --  Salt-lint  checks  the  working directory for the presence of this file and applies any configuration found there. The configuration file location can also be overridden via the -c
       path/to/file CLI flag.

       If a value is provided on both the command line and via a configuration file, the values will be merged (if a list like exclude_paths), or the True value will be preferred, in the  case  of  something
       like quiet.
