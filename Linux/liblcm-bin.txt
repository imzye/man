NAME
       lcm-logplayer - minimalist log playback tool

SYNOPSIS
       lcm-logplayer [options] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       lcm-logplayer  is a minimalist Lightweight Communications and Marshalling logfile playback tool.  It provides a small set of options for controlling logfile playback, and is primarily intended for
       situations where a command line program is either desired or the only option.  In situations where both Java and a graphical interface are available, lcm-logplayer-gui provides a  more  featureful
       logplayer with a graphical user interface.

       The following options are provided by lcm-logplayer

       -v, --verbose
              Print information about each packet.

       -s, --speed=NUM
              Playback speed multipler.  Default is 1.0

       -e, --regexp=EXPR
              POSIX regular expression of channels to play.
