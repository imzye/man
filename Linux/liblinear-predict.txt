NAME
       liblinear-predict - Make predictions based on a trained linear classifier model

SYNOPSIS
       linear-predict [options] test_file model_file output_file

DESCRIPTION
       liblinear-predict uses the linear classifier model-file to make predictions for each of the samples in test_file and stores the results in output_file.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -b (0|1)
              Whether to output probability estimates or not (default: 0)

       -q     quiet mode (no outputs)

EXAMPLES
       Train a linear SVM using L2-loss function with linear-train(1):

                  liblinear-train data_file

       Output probability estimates (for logistic regression only):

                  liblinear-predict -b 1 test_file data_file.model output_file
