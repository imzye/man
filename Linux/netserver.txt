NAME
       netserver - a network performance benchmark server

SYNOPSIS
       netserver  [-4]  [-6]  [-d] [-h] [-L name,family] [-p portnum] [-v ver‐
       bosity] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       Netserver  listens  for  connections  from  a  netperf  benchmark,  and
       responds  accordingly.   It can either be run from inetd or as a stand‐
       alone daemon (with the -p flag). If run from inetd the -p option should
       not be used.

   OPTIONS
       -4     Use  AF_INET  (aka IPv4) addressing for the control and possibly
              data connections.

       -6     Use AF_INET6 (aka IPv6) addressing for the control and  possibly
              data connections.

       -d     Increase  the  quantity  of  debugging output displayed during a
              test (possibly at the expense of performance).

       -h     Display a usage string, and exit.

       -L name,family
              Set the local name and/or address family for the socket used for
              the control connection.

       -p portnum
              Listen  on  the  specified port.  This is used when running as a
              standalone daemon.

       -v verbosity
              Set the verbosity level for the test.

       -V     Display the netperf version and exit.

       No known bugs at this time. If you think you have found a  bug,  please

       perf.org.
