NAME
       gtkpod - GTK2 based software for managing songs and playlists on an Apple iPod

SYNOPSIS
       gtkpod [-h] [-m path] [-p filename] [--hash filename]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly describes the gtkpod command.

OPTIONS
       gtkpod supports the following options:

       -h, --help
           Displays the help message.

       -m, --mountpoint path
           Define the mountpoint of your iPod.

       -p filename
           Increment playcount for file filename by one.

       --hash filename
           Print gtkpod hash for file filename.

FILES
       ~/.gtkpod/prefs
           Per user configuration file. Should normally only updated through the program itself.

       /etc/gtkpod/prefs
           Global configuration file. Used if no configuration file exist for the user starting gtkpod.

       ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.in
           If this file exists, gtkpod will try to execute it at startup This is done before attempting to mount the iPod directory (optional) or read the iTunesDB (optional).

       ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.out
           If this file exists, gtkpod will try to execute it while exiting the program. This is done after attempting to unmount the iPod directory (optional) and sending the "eject" command to the iPod
           (optional).

       /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.in, /etc/gtkpod/gtkpod.out
           Used instead of the per user scripts if the former ones don't exist and these do.

       ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.load
           If this file exists, gtkpod will execute it before loading the contents of an iPod with the iPod's mountpoint as the only command line argument. Put any commands needed to access the iPod here,
           for example if you need to mount the iPod manually.

       ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.eject
           If this file exists, gtkpod will execute it when ejecting an iPod with the the iPod's mountpoint as the only command line argument. Put any commands you want to execute after gtkpod has written
           the changes to the iPod here.  For example:

           sudo eject $1

           gtkpod will not attempt to do any magic of it's own to mount/unmount/eject the iPod.
