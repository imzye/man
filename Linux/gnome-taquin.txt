NAME
       Taquin - A sliding puzzle game for GNOME.

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-taquin [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       Taquin is a computer version of the 15-puzzle and other sliding puzzles.

       either indicated with numbers, or with parts of a great image.

       --fifteen
       --sixteen
              Sets the puzzle game launched.
              The option --fifteen is for a classical 15-Puzzle, whereas the --sixteen option is for a more contemporary puzzle.

              The game is intended to be played in size 3 to 5.
              It accepts value from 2 to 9; 2 is for debug only, whereas 6 or more sizes are just not verified working.

       --mute
       --unmute
              Turn off/on the sound.
              If the two options are given, the game is muted.

              Prints the program version and exits.

       This program also accepts the standard GTK+ options.
