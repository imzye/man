NAME
       unison-2.51+4.13.1 - a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows

SYNOPSIS
       unison-2.51+4.13.1 [options]
       unison-2.51+4.13.1 root1 root2 [options]
       unison-2.51+4.13.1 profilename [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents Unison, and was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. For a full description, please refer
       to the inbuilt documentation or the manuals in /usr/share/doc/unison-2.51+4.13.1/. The unison-2.51+4.13.1-gtk binary has similar command-line options, but allows the user to select and create
       profiles and configure options from within the program.

       Unison  is  a  file-synchronization  tool for Unix and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same
       host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.

       Unison offers several advantages over various synchronization methods such as CVS, Coda, rsync, Intellisync, etc. Unison can run on and synchronize between Windows and  many  UNIX  platforms.
       Unison  requires  no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function. Unison can synchronize changes to files and directories in both directions, on the same machine, or across a
       network using ssh or a direct socket connection.

       Transfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol, making it ideal for slower links. Unison has a clear and precise specification, and is resilient to failure due to  its  careful
       handling of the replicas and its private structures.

       The two roots can be specified using an URI or a path. The URI must follow the convention: protocol://[user@][host][:port][/path]. The protocol part can be file, socket, ssh or rsh.
