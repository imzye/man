REPORTBUG.CONF(5)                                                                           File Formats Manual                                                                           REPORTBUG.CONF(5)

NAME
       reportbug.conf - The configuration file for reportbug

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/reportbug.conf - The configuration file for reportbug, a program designed to report bugs in the Debian distribution

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the layout of the reportbug and querybts configuration file and the available configuration options.  The default location of the file is /etc/reportbug.conf and the op‐
       tions may be overriding in $HOME/.reportbugrc (which follows the same format as reportbug.conf).

       Please  note  that  any  configuration file has to be a valid UTF-8 document, and not in a different locale; this is particularly important in situations where localized characters have to be used
       (like for realname).

FILE FORMAT
       Configuration options can be specified in the form

       option-name option-value

       True/False (boolean) options can be specified as

       boolean-option

       (if it's present, it's a True).

       Usually, no-option will disable option if option is boolean.

       Options can be specified in any order.

OPTIONS
       The summary of possible options (in alphabetical order) is as follows:

       bts    The bug tracking system to use, see reportbug --bts=help for a list of currently supported BTSes.

       cc (boolean)
              Whether the reporter should be Cc:ed on the bug report.

       check-available (boolean)
              Whether Debian package lists should be queried for newer releases of the package.  In advanced and expert mode, https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html is also checked.

       compress (boolean)
              Whether modified configuration files included in the bug report should be stripped down.

       config-files (boolean)
              Whether modified configuration files should be included with the bug report.

       draftpath
              The directory where unsubmitted reports should be saved. The default is /tmp.

       editor The editor to use to edit the bug report.  Example:

              editor "emacs -nw"

       email  Default From address of the bug email (override with environment variables, see reportbug(1)). Example:

              email "humberto@example.com"

       envelopefrom
              Specify the Envelope From mail header (also known as Return-path); by default it's the From address but it can be selected a different one in case the MTA doesn't canonicalize  local  users
              to public addresses. This can be set to the empty string if the MTA does not allow setting the Envelope From.

       list-cc-me (boolean)
              Send a carbon copy of the report to your automatically detected email address after a report number is assigned, like the --list-cc-me option.

       mbox_reader_cmd
              Specify  a  command  to  open the bug reports mbox file. You can use %s to substitute the mbox file to be used, and %% to insert a literal percent sign. If no %s is specified, the mbox file
              name is supplied at the end of the argument list. Example:

              mbox_reader_cmd "mutt -f %s"

       header Additional headers to add to the bug email.  Like:

              header "X-Silly-Header: I haven't edited my /etc/reportbug.conf"
              header "X-Debbugs-No-Ack: please" # to suppress acknowledgments

              Note that setting additional headers may not work reliably if the bug email is passed to an external MUA for submission.

       http_proxy
              Default HTTP proxy used to query the BTS (override with environment variables, see reportbug(1)). Example:

              http_proxy http://proxy.example.com:3128/

       justification
              The justification in case of a Release Critical bug (severity either 'critical', 'serious' or 'grave'). Example:

              justification "text here"

       keyid  The GPG key to use, if different from the default one on the system.  Example:

              keyid 12345678

       maintonly
              See the --maintonly entry in reportbug(1).

       max_attachment_size
              The max size any attachment can have. Example:

              max_attachment_size 5000000

       mh     Use the mh mailer.

       mode [novice|standard|advanced|expert]
              The default operating mode for reportbug(1).

       mta    The path to the MTA used.  Any SMTP server on Debian should be OK with the default:

              mta /usr/sbin/sendmail

       mua    The mail user agent to use (the default is empty, to use an internal mailer). Example:

              mua 'mutt -H'

       mutt   Use the mutt mailer.

       nmh    Use the nmh mailer.

       no-check-uid (boolean)
              Disables checking whether the UIDs are outside admin range (root is still checked).

       no-debconf (boolean)
              Disables adding the debconf-show output to the bug report.

       no-query-source (boolean)
              Disables querying the source packages for bugs.

       offline
              Disables all external queries.

       query-bts (boolean)
              Whether the BTS should be queried for existing bug reports.

              replyto "Humberto Flores <humflores@example.org>"

       severity [critical|grave|serious|important|normal|minor|wishlist]
              The default severity level of the bug reported.  Setting this in the configuration file will disable prompting while running reportbug.

       sign [gpg|pgp|gnupg|none]
              Program used to digitally sign bug reports automatically ('none' to disable it).
