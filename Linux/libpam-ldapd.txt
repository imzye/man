NAME
       pam_ldap - PAM module for LDAP-based authentication

SYNOPSIS
       pam_ldap.so [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a PAM module that uses an LDAP server to verify user access rights and credentials.

OPTIONS
       use_first_pass
              Specifies that the PAM module should use the first password provided in the authentication stack and not prompt the user for a password.

       try_first_pass
              Specifies that the PAM module should use the first password provided in the authentication stack and if that fails prompt the user for a password.

       nullok Specifying this option allows users to log in with a blank password.  Normally logins without a password are denied.

       ignore_unknown_user
              Specifies that the PAM module should return PAM_IGNORE for users that are not present in the LDAP directory.  This causes the PAM framework to ignore this module.

       ignore_authinfo_unavail
              Specifies that the PAM module should return PAM_IGNORE if it cannot contact the LDAP server.  This causes the PAM framework to ignore this module.

       no_warn
              Specifies that warning messages should not be propagated to the PAM application.

       use_authtok
              This causes the PAM module to use the earlier provided password when changing the password. The module will not prompt the user for a new password (it is analogous to use_first_pass).

       debug  This option causes the PAM module to log debugging information to syslog(3).

       minimum_uid=UID
              This option causes the PAM module to ignore the user if the user id is lower than the specified value. This can be used to bypass LDAP checks for system users (e.g. by setting it to 1000).

MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED
       All services are provided by this module but currently sessions changes are not implemented in the nslcd daemon.

       /etc/pam.conf
              the main PAM configuration file

       /etc/nslcd.conf
              The configuration file for the nslcd daemon (see nslcd.conf(5))
