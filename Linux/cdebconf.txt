NAME
       debconf - run a debconf-using program

SYNOPSIS
        debconf [options] command [args]

DESCRIPTION
       Debconf is a configuration system for Debian packages. For a debconf overview and documentation for sysadmins, see debconf(7).

       The debconf program runs a program under debconf's control, setting it up to talk with debconf on stdio. The program's output is expected to be debconf protocol commands, and it is expected to
       read result codes on stdin. See debconf-devel(7) for details about the debconf protocol.

OPTIONS
       -opackage, --owner=package
           Tell debconf what package the command it is running is a part of. This is necessary to get ownership of registered questions right, and to support unregister and purge commands properly.

       -ftype, --frontend=type
           Select the frontend to use.

       -pvalue, --priority=value
           Specify the minimum priority of question that will be displayed.

       -s, --showold
           Redisplay old, already seen questions.

EXAMPLES
       To debug a shell script that uses debconf, you might use:

        DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer debconf my-shell-prog

       Or, you might use this:

        debconf --frontend=readline sh -x my-shell-prog
