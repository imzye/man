NAME
       pipenightdreams - Just another pipe trip (PipeDream clon).

SYNOPSIS
        pipenightdreams [--datadir <DATADIR>] [--fullscreen]

DESCRIPTION
        pipenightdreams  is  a PipeDream style game. The objetive of the game is to carry liquid from some point to the exit using different kinds of pipes. On each level there is a minimum number of re‐
       quired pipes that should be at least reached for it to be completed.

       The score is increased by using as many pipes as possible an by collecting various bonus tokens making the liquid pass through their pipes. There are also life bonus and, hopefully  soon,  "freeze
       tokens".

       The game is not exactly a copy of PipeDream. It's based only on the facts I remember and on many other things which have been added, or changed hoping for making it better.

   KEYS
       The game is entirely played using the keyboard and the key layout is as follows:

       SPACE  Puts the next pipe where the pointer is.

       CURSOR KEYS
              Move the pointer.

       ENTER  Speeds up the liquid (Avoids skillful players to get bored).

       ESC    Goes back to the main screen or exits.

   BONUS TYPES
       The various types of bonus tokens are the following:

       LIFE BONUS
              The purple one with a "L" on it.

       SUPER BONUS
              The red one with a "B" on it.

       ULTRA BONUS
              The blue one.

       HYPER BONUS
              The green one.

OPTIONS
        --datadir  <CUSTOM DATA DIR>  is used when the data directory is not the default one ( /usr/share/games/pipenightdreams if installed from a rpm package and  /usr/local/share/games/pipenightdreams
       when installed by compiling the source package).

        --fullscreen  switchs to fullscreen mode.

BUGS
       Not known.
