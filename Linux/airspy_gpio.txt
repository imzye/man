NAME
       airspy_gpio - read and write gpio pin values

DESCRIPTION
       The Airspy is a tiny and efficient software defined radio receiver.

       This application lets the user read and write gpio pins.

SYNOPSIS
       airspy_gpio

OPTIONS
       -p, --port_no <p>: set port number<p>[0,7] for subsequent read/write operations0

       -n, --pin_no <n>: set pin number<n>[0,31] for subsequent read/write operations0

       -r, --read: read port number/pin number value and direction specified by last -n argument, or all port/pin0

       -w, --write <v>: write value specified by last -n argument with value<v>[0,1]0

       [-s serial_number_64bits]: Open board with specified 64bits serial number.0

Examples
       <command> -p 0 -n 12 -r # reads from port 0 pin number 120

       <command> -r          # reads all pins on all ports0

       <command> -p 0 -n 10 -w 1 # writes port 0 pin number 10 with 1 decimal0
