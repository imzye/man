NAME
       Packager - A class for creating the Excel XLSX package.

SYNOPSIS
       See the documentation for Excel::Writer::XLSX.

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used in conjunction with Excel::Writer::XLSX to create an Excel XLSX container file.

       From Wikipedia: The Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) is a container-file technology initially created by Microsoft to store a combination of XML and non-XML files that together form a single entity
       such as an Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS) document. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Packaging_Conventions>.

       At its simplest an Excel XLSX file contains the following elements:

            ____ [Content_Types].xml
           |
           |____ docProps
           | |____ app.xml
           | |____ core.xml
           |
           |____ xl
           | |____ workbook.xml
           | |____ worksheets
           | | |____ sheet1.xml
           | |
           | |____ styles.xml
           | |
           | |____ theme
           | | |____ theme1.xml
           | |
           | |_____rels
           |   |____ workbook.xml.rels
           |
           |_____rels
             |____ .rels

       The "Excel::Writer::XLSX::Package::Packager" class co-ordinates the classes that represent the elements of the package and writes them into the XLSX file.
