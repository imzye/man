NAME
       DSA - Digital Signature Algorithm

DESCRIPTION
       DSA is the Digital Signature Algorithm specified in [DSS], a standard for public-key based digital signatures from NIST, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology.  DSA employs
       SHA(5).

       For a description of DSS, its history and security, see [AC2].
