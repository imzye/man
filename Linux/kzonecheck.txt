NAME
       kzonecheck - Knot DNS zone check tool

SYNOPSIS
       kzonecheck [options] filename

DESCRIPTION
       The  utility  checks  zone  file syntax and runs semantic checks on the
       zone content. The executed checks are the same as the checks run by the
       Knot DNS server.

       Please,   refer   to   the   semantic-checks  configuration  option  in
       knot.conf(5) for the full list of available semantic checks.

   Parameters
       filename
              Path to the zone file to be checked. For reading from stdin  use
              /dev/stdin or just -.

   Options
       -o, --origin origin
              Zone origin. If not specified, the origin is determined from the
              file name (possibly removing the .zone suffix).

       -d, --dnssec on|off
              Also check DNSSEC-related records.  The  default  is  to  decide
              based on the existence of a RRSIG for SOA.

       -t, --time time
              Current  time  specification. Use UNIX timestamp, YYYYMMDDHHmmSS
              format, or [+/-]time[unit] format, where unit can be Y, M, D, h,
              m, or s. Default is current UNIX timestamp.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable debug output.

       -h, --help
              Print the program help.

       -V, --version
              Print the program version.

EXIT VALUES
       Exit  status  of  0  means  successful operation. Any other exit status
       indicates an error.
