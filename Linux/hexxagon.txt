NAME
       hexxagon - Hexagonal Ataxx-style game

SYNOPSIS
       hexxagon

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the hexxagon command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       hexxagon is a nice clone of Ataxx, only in hexagonal form.

       Click on one of your pieces to move or jump. Moving will create a new piece, jumping will, well, jump. When you put one of your pieces next to your opponent's pieces, those will change color.

OPTIONS
       This program doesn't take any command line options.
