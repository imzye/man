NAME
       osmo-bsc - Osmocom BSC

SYNOPSIS
       osmo-bsc [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This is the BSC-only version of OpenBSC. It requires a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) to operate.

       You might rather prefer to use osmocom-nitb which is considered a "GSM Network-in-a-Box" and does not depend on a MSC.

       Typically you start osmo-bsc with the -c option specifying where to find the configuration file. There are example configuration files in:

          /usr/share/doc/osmocom-bsc/examples/osmo-bsc
