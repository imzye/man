              turn on debug information (multi-level -d -d ...)

       -D  | --no-extension
              don't look at ./.spcrc[-ext] for config file

       -h  | --help
              display this help and exit

       -m  | --matching
              print only lines that have matches

       -n  | --line-numbers
              precede each line with a line number

       -r  | --reverse
              reverse black and white

              dont look in ~/.spcrc for config files

       -S  | --printsysdir
              print SYSTEM_DIRECTORY and exit

       -t  | --type=TYPE
              specify the effective file type or extension

       -w  | --webpage
              generate web page

       With no FILE read standard input.

CONFIGURATION FILE SEARCH
       Configuration files are required for proper operation.  These files are found by searching in a number of locations until a proper one is found.  The directories and file names are searched in the
       following order for a file with the extension ".foo" or if the "-t foo" option is used.  Also, if the "-C bar" option is used it's place in the search is shown.

               ./.spcrc-foo

               ./.spcrc

               ~/.spcrc/spcrc-foo

               ~/.spcrc/spcrc

               bar/spcrc-foo

               bar/spcrc

               SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/spcrc-foo

               SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/spcrc

       The  file  extension  is  obtained by using the characters after the final '.' character in the file name.  If there is no extension then the filename itself is used.  However, if the extension is
       "log" then additional processing is done.  The filename, i.e. the part of the path after the last '/' character, is used up to the first '.' character.  For example, this results in  an  extension
       of "apache" for an apache log with the name "apache.0.log".  This behavior can be over-ridden using the -t option.

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       SuperCat configuration files have a fixed columnar format for readability and easy parsing.  There are 6 fields per line although only 2-3 require entries.  The format is:

                1         2         3         4         5
       1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345
       HTML Color Name      Col A N T RE / String / Characters
       #################### ### # # # ########################

       HTML Color Name (columns 1-20)
              This optional field specifies the standard HTML color name to
              use when creating a web page.  It is only required if the -w
              option of Supercat is used.

       Col - Color (columns 22-24)
              This is the mandatory three character color name which may take
              on one of the values: blk, red, grn, yel, blu, mag, cya or whi.

       A - Color Attribute (column 26)
              This is a color attribute which may take on one of the following
              values: '-':normal, 'b':bold, 'u':underline,

       N - Number of matches to color (column 28)
              This is a single digit number that indicates the number of
              matches to color on a single line. '0' indicates all.
              A space ' ' defaults to '0':all.

       T - Type of Match (column 30)
              This is a single character which may take on the following
              values:

              r : regular expression
              R : regular expression (case-insensitive)
              s : string
              c : characters
              t : unix time conversion RE (MMDDHHMMSS)
              T : unix time conversion RE (YYMMDDHHMM)
              u : unix time conversion RE (  HH:MM:SS)
              U : unix time conversion RE (YYYY:MM:DD)

              A space ' ' defaults to 'r':RE.

              An extended regular expression (see regex(7)) specifies the
              pattern to match and the pattern or sub-pattern(s) to color.
              The portions of the pattern in parentheses are colored.

              The string matches the exact string and colors it.

              For the list of characters, each character is matched
              individually and colored.

              The time RE extended regular expression specifies a pattern to match
              with one sub-pattern to color of the form ([0-9]{10}).  This
              should match a 10 decimal digit Unix seconds since 01/01/1970.  This
              number will be converted to the human readable form: MMDDHHMMSS
              or YYMMDDHHMM replacing the same 10 columns.

       RE / String / Characters - Attribute (columns 32-)

COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES
       spc spc.c
              Colorize file spc.c.

       cat spc.c | spc -t c
              Read standard input formatting type C file to standard output.

CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLES
       Take a look at some of the configuration files delivered with SuperCat that can be found in the SYSTEM_DIRECTORY.  The following are a few simple examples of the syntax of the configuration file.

       Magenta              mag - 0 r ([0-9]{2}):([0-9]{2}):([0-9]{2})
              Color a time field HH:MM:SS but not the colons.

       Cyan                 cya     t ^([0-9]{10})
              Match a 10 decimal digit number at the beginning of a line treating it as a Unix seconds since epoch and convert it to MMDDHHMMSS in cyan.

       Cyan                 cya   1 t ([0-9]{10})
              Similar to above but using numeric count.

       Yellow               yel       "(.*)"
              Color quoted string in yellow.
