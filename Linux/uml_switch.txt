NAME
       uml_switch — switch daemon for user-mode Linux

SYNOPSIS
       uml_switch [-unix control_socket data_socket]  [-hub]  [-tap tun device]  [-compat-v0]  [-daemon]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the uml_switch program.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       uml_switch is a daemon for managing a virtual network between user-mode Linux systems, with no connection to the host system's network.

       It will listen for connections on a pair of UNIX domain sockets, and forward packets between clients which connect to them.

OPTIONS
       -unix control_socket data_socket
                 Listen on the specified pair of sockets, instead of the defaults.

       -hub      Act  like a hub.  This means that packets received will be broadcast over all virtual links.  The default is to act as a switch, where packets are only sent to the link matching the destina‐
                 tion MAC address of the packet.

       -tap tap device
                 Connect the switch to a dynamically created tap device on the host

       -compat-v0
                 Specify control protocol version 0 compatibility.

       -daemon   Run in the background as a daemon.
