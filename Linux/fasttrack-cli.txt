FASTTRACK-CLI(1)                 User Commands                FASTTRACK-CLI(1)

NAME
       fasttrack-cli – Use FastTrack from the command line

SYNOPSIS
       fasttrack-cli [OPTION]...  [FILE]...

OPTIONS
       All  arguments  are  mandatory  except --backPath and --cfg.  Loading a
       configuration file with --cfg overwrites any selected parameters.

       §

       --maxArea
              maximal area of objects

       --minArea
              minimal area of objects

       --lightBack
              is the background light?  0: Yes, 1: No

       §

       --thresh
              binary threshold, if lightBack is set to 0  (resp.   1),  pixels
              with  values less (resp. more) than thresh are considered to be‐
              long to an object

       --reg  registration method, 0: None, 1: Simple, 2: ECC, 3: Features

       §

       --spot part of the object that features is used for  the  matching,  0:
              head, 1: tail, 2: body

       --normDist
              normalization distance pixels

       --normAngle
              normalization angle degrees

       --normArea
              normalization area pixels

       --normPerim
              normalization perimeter pixels

       --maxDist
              maximal  distance  of  matching  in pixels; if an object travels
              more than this distance, it is considered as a new object

       --maxTime
              maximal time; if an object disappears more than this time, it is
              considered as a new object

       §

       --nBack
              number of images to compute the background

       --methBack
              method to compute the background.  0: min, 1: max, 2: average

       --regBack
              registration method to compute the background.  0: None, 1: Sim‐
              ple, 2: ECC, 3: Features

       §

       --xTop roi x top corner (0:width-1)

       --yTop roi y top corner (0:height-1)

       --xBottom
              roi x top corner (0:xTop-1), set to 0 to avoid cropping

       --yBottom
              roi y top corner (0:yTop-1), set to 0 to avoid cropping

       §

       --morph
              morphological operation, 0: None, 1: Erode, 2: Dilate, 3:  Open,
              4: Close, 5: Gradient, 6: TopHat, 7: BlackHat, 8: HitMiss

       --morphSize
              size  of  the kernel used in the morphological operation; can be
              omitted if no operation are performed

       --morphType
              type of the kernel used in the morphological operation;  can  be
              omitted if no operation are performed, 0: Rect, 1: Cross, 2: El‐
              lipse

       §

       --path path to the movie or one image of a sequence

       --backPath
              optional, path to a background image

       §

       --cfg  optional, path to a configuration file; if path is not  included
              in  the configuration file, --path option needs to be put before
              --cfg option
