NAME
       pop3p - POP3 proxy gateway service

SYNOPSIS
       pop3p [-d] [-l[[@]logfile]] [-pport] [-iinternal_ip] [-eexternal_ip] [-hdefault_ip[:port]]

DESCRIPTION
       pop3p is POP3 gateway service to allow internal users to access external POP3 servers.

OPTIONS
       -I     Inetd mode. Standalone service only.

       -d     Daemonise. Detach service from console and run in the background.

       -t     Be silenT. Do not log start/stop/accept error records.

       -u     Never look for username authentication.

       -e     External address. IP address of interface proxy should initiate connections from.  By default system will deside which address to use in accordance with routing table.

       -i     Internal address. IP address proxy accepts connections to.  By default connection to any interface is accepted. It´s usually unsafe.

       -p     Port. Port proxy listens for incoming connections. Default is 110.

       -h     Default destination. It's used if targed address is not specified by user.

       -l     Log. By default logging is to stdout. If logfile is specified logging is to file. Under Unix, if ´@´ preceeds logfile, syslog is used for logging.

       -S     Increase or decrease stack size. You may want to try something like -S8192 if you experience 3proxy crashes.

CLIENTS
       You  can use any MUA (Mail User Agent) with POP3 support. Set client to use internal_ip and port as a POP3 server. Address of real POP3 server must be configured as a part of POP3 username. Format for
       username is username@server, where server is address of POP3 server and username is user´s login on this POP3 server. Login itself may contain ´@´ sign.  Only cleartext  authentication  is  supported,
       because challenge-response authentication (APOP, CRAM-MD5, etc) requires challenge from server before we know which server to connect.
