NAME
       ndrdump - DCE/RPC Packet Parser and Dumper

SYNOPSIS
       ndrdump [-c context] {pipe} {format} {in|out|struct} {filename}

       ndrdump [pipe]

       ndrdump

DESCRIPTION
       ndrdump tries to parse the specified filename using Samba's parser for the specified pipe and format. The third argument should be either in, out or structdepending on whether the data should be
       parsed as a request, reply or a public structure.

       Running ndrdump without arguments will list the pipes for which parsers are available.

       Running ndrdump with one argument will list the functions and public structures that Samba can parse for the specified pipe.

       The primary function of ndrdump is debugging Samba's internal DCE/RPC parsing functions. The file being parsed is usually one exported by wiresharks “Export selected packet bytes” function.

       The context argument can be used to load context data from the request packet when parsing reply packets (such as array lengths).
