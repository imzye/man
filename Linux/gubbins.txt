DESCRIPTION
       Gubbins supports rapid phylogenetic analysis of large samples of recombinant bacterial whole genome sequences.

       Gubbins  (Genealogies  Unbiased  By  recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences) is an algorithm that iteratively identifies loci containing elevated densities of base substitutions while concurrently
       constructing a phylogeny based on the putative point mutations outside of these regions. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate reconstructions under realistic  models  of
       short-term bacterial evolution, and can be run in only a few hours on alignments of hundreds of bacterial genome sequences.

OPTIONS
   positional arguments:
       alignment_filename
              Multifasta alignment file

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --outgroup OUTGROUP, -o OUTGROUP
              Outgroup name for rerooting. A list of comma separated names can be used if they form a clade

       --starting_tree STARTING_TREE, -s STARTING_TREE
              Starting tree

       --use_time_stamp, -u
              Use a time stamp in file names

       --verbose, -v
              Turn on debugging

       --no_cleanup, -n
              Don't cleanup intermediate files

       --tree_builder TREE_BUILDER, -t TREE_BUILDER
              Application to use for tree building [raxml|fasttree|hybrid], default RAxML

       --iterations ITERATIONS, -i ITERATIONS
              Maximum No. of iterations, default is 5

       --min_snps MIN_SNPS, -m MIN_SNPS
              Min SNPs to identify a recombination block, default is 3

       --filter_percentage FILTER_PERCENTAGE, -f FILTER_PERCENTAGE
              Filter out taxa with more than this percentage of gaps, default is 25

       --prefix PREFIX, -p PREFIX
              Add a prefix to the final output filenames

       --threads THREADS, -c THREADS
              Number of threads to run with RAXML, but only if a PTHREADS version is available

       --converge_method CONVERGE_METHOD, -z CONVERGE_METHOD
              Criteria to use to know when to halt iterations [weigh ted_robinson_foulds|robinson_foulds|recombination]

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       --min_window_size MIN_WINDOW_SIZE, -a MIN_WINDOW_SIZE
              Minimum window size, default 100

       --max_window_size MAX_WINDOW_SIZE, -b MAX_WINDOW_SIZE
              Maximum window size, default 10000
