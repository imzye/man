NAME
       ivar - functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing

SYNOPSIS
       ivar [command <trim|variants|filtervariants|consensus|getmasked|removereads|version|help>]

DESCRIPTION
       iVar  is  a computational package that contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing. Additional tools for metagenomic sequencing are actively being incorporated into iVar.
       While each of these functions can be accomplished using existing tools, iVar contains an intersection of functionality from multiple tools that are required to call iSNVs and  consensus  sequences
       from viral sequencing data across multiple replicates.

COMMANS
       trim   Trim reads in aligned BAM file

       variants
              Call variants from aligned BAM file

       filtervariants
              Filter variants across replicates or samples

       consensus
              Call consensus from aligned BAM file

       getmasked
              Detect primer mismatches and get primer indices for the amplicon to be masked

       removereads
              Remove reads from trimmed BAM file

       version
              Show version information

       To view detailed usage for each command type `ivar <command>`
