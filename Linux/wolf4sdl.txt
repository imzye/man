DESCRIPTION
       Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D to the cross-plattform multimedia library Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) (http://www.libsdl.org). It is
       meant to keep the original feel while taking advantage of some improvements.

       The  wolf4sdl-wl6,  wolf4sdl-wl6a, wolf4sdl-wl6a1, wolf4sdl-wl1, wolf4sdl-sod and wolf4sdl-sdm binaries start the Wolf3d Full v1.4 GT/ID/Activision, Wolf3d Full v1.4 Apogee (with ReadThis), Wolf3d
       Full v1.1 Apogee (with ReadThis), Wolf3d Shareware v1.4, Spear of Destiny Full and Mission Disks and Spear of Destiny Demo games, respectively. The wolf4sdl wrapper script automatically  runs  the
       engine that fits to the data files found in /usr/share/games/wolf3d.
