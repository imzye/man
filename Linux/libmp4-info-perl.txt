NAME
       MP4::Info - Fetch info from MPEG-4 files (.mp4, .m4a, .m4p, .3gp)

SYNOPSIS
               #!perl -w
               use MP4::Info;
               my $file = 'Pearls_Before_Swine.m4a';

               my $tag = get_mp4tag($file) or die "No TAG info";
               printf "$file is a %s track\n", $tag->{GENRE};

               my $info = get_mp4info($file);
               printf "$file length is %d:%d\n", $info->{MM}, $info->{SS};

               my $mp4 = new MP4::Info $file;
               printf "$file length is %s, title is %s\n",
                       $mp4->time, $mp4->title;

DESCRIPTION
       The MP4::Info module can be used to extract tag and meta information from MPEG-4 audio (AAC) and video files. It is designed as a drop-in replacement for MP3::Info.

       Note that this module does not allow you to update the information in MPEG-4 files.

       $mp4 = MP4::Info->new(FILE)
           OOP  interface  to  the rest of the module. The same keys available via "get_mp4info" and "get_mp4tag" are available via the returned object (using upper case or lower case; but note that all-
           caps 'VERSION' will return the module version, not the MPEG-4 version).

           Passing a value to one of the methods will not set the value for that tag in the MPEG-4 file.

       use_mp4_utf8([STATUS])
           Tells MP4::Info whether to assume that ambiguously encoded TAG info is UTF-8 or Latin-1. 1 is UTF-8, 0 is Latin-1. Default is UTF-8.

           Function returns new status (1/0). If no argument is supplied, or an unaccepted argument is supplied, function merely returns existing status.

           This function is not exported by default, but may be exported with the ":utf8" or ":all" export tag.

       get_mp4tag (FILE)
           Returns hash reference containing the tag information from the MP4 file.  The following keys may be defined:

                   ALB     Album
                   APID    Apple Store ID
                   ART     Artist
                   CMT     Comment
                   COVR    Album art (typically JPEG or PNG data)
                   CPIL    Compilation (boolean)
                   CPRT    Copyright statement
                   DAY     Year
                   DISK    Disk number & total (2 integers)
                   GNRE    Genre
                   GRP     Grouping
                   NAM     Title
                   RTNG    Rating (integer)
                   TMPO    Tempo (integer)
                   TOO     Encoder
                   TRKN    Track number & total (2 integers)
                   WRT     Author or composer

           For compatibility with MP3::Info, the MP3 ID3v1-style keys TITLE, ARTIST, ALBUM, YEAR, COMMENT, GENRE and TRACKNUM are defined as synonyms for NAM, ART, ALB, DAY, CMT, GNRE and TRKN[0].

           Any and all of these keys may be undefined if the corresponding information is missing from the MPEG-4 file.

           On error, returns nothing and sets $@.

       get_mp4info (FILE)
           Returns hash reference containing file information from the MPEG-4 file.  The following keys may be defined:

                   VERSION         MPEG version (=4)
                   LAYER           MPEG layer description (=1 for compatibility with MP3::Info)
                   BITRATE         bitrate in kbps (average for VBR files)
                   FREQUENCY       frequency in kHz
                   SIZE            bytes in audio stream

                   SECS            total seconds, rounded to nearest second
                   MM              minutes
                   SS              leftover seconds
                   MS              leftover milliseconds, rounded to nearest millisecond
                   TIME            time in MM:SS, rounded to nearest second

                   COPYRIGHT       boolean for audio is copyrighted
                   ENCODING        audio codec name. Possible values include:
                                   'mp4a' - AAC, aacPlus
                                   'alac' - Apple lossless
                                   'drms' - Apple encrypted AAC

                                   'enca' - Unspecified encrypted audio
                   ENCRYPTED       boolean for audio data is encrypted

           Any and all of these keys may be undefined if the corresponding information is missing from the MPEG-4 file.

           On error, returns nothing and sets $@.

BUGS
       Doesn't support writing tag information to MPEG-4 files.

       If you find a bug, please send me a patch. If you cannot figure out why it does not work for you, please put the MP4 file in a place where I can get it (preferably via FTP, or HTTP)  and  send  me
       mail regarding where I can get the file, with a detailed description of the problem. I will keep a copy of the file only for as long as necessary to debug the problem.
