NAME
       silan - Soundfile Silence Analyzer

SYNOPSIS
       silan [ OPTIONS ] <file-name>

DESCRIPTION
       silan - Audiofile Silence Analyzer.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -b, --bounds
              skip silence mid file.  print start/end boundaries only.

       -B, --fastbounds
              same as -b, except the sound-off is detected by decoding backwards from the end.  This is much faster but also inacurate.

       -f, --format <format>
              specify output format (default: 'txt')

       -F, --filter <float>
              high-pass filter coefficient (default:0.98) disable: 1.0; range 0 < val <= 1.0

       -i, --include-initial
              display initial state (don't assume initial silence at start).

       -o, --output <filename>
              write data to file instead of stdout

       -p, --progress
              show progress info on stderr

       -q, --quiet
              inhibit error messages

       -s, --threshold <float>
              RMS signal threshold (default 0.001 ^= -60dB) postfix with 'd' to specify decibels

       -t, --holdoff <float>
              holdoff time in seconds (default 0.5)

       -u, --unit <unit>
              specify output unit (default: 'seconds')

       -v, --verbose
              increase debug-level (can be used multiple times)

       -V, --version
              print version information and exit

       This application reads a single audio file and analyzes it for silent periods. Timestamps/ranges of silence are printed to standard output.

       Valid output formats are: txt, JSON, audacity (label file)

       Valid output units are: samples, seconds or bytes (audacity format uses seconds regardless).

       Sound  is  detected if the signal level exceeds a given threshold for a duration of at least <holdoff> time.  Note that the returned timestamps are corrected
       for the holdoff-time.

       The fast boundary scan can decrease the time it takes to analyze a file at the cost of accuracy.  Use --fastbounds with care. Due to low-pass  filtering  and
       RMS calculation the results will be different (+- .1 sec), furthermore some codecs are not suitable for backwards decoding or sample-accurate seeking and may
       skew the timestamp by one second or more.  The fast boundary scan mode requires a seekable file and does not work with streams.
