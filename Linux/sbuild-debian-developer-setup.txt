SBUILD-DEBIAN-DEVELOPER-SETUP(1)                                                               Debian sbuild                                                               SBUILD-DEBIAN-DEVELOPER-SETUP(1)

NAME
       sbuild-debian-developer-setup - set up sbuild so that packages for Debian unstable can be built

SYNOPSIS
       sbuild-debian-developer-setup [-h|--help] [--distribution=distribution] [--suite=suite] [--arch=arch]

DESCRIPTION
       Deprecated:  Note  that  this  uses the schroot backend which is no longer used on the Debian buildds. Please switch to the unshare backend. It does not need any prior setup nor regular cron jobs.
       Don't run newgrp sbuild for the unshare backend as it will break the unshare calls.

       sbuild-debian-developer-setup is a convenience script to set up an sbuild environment for Debian Developers.

       When run, it adds the current user to the sbuild group, creates a schroot for building packages for Debian unstable in /srv/chroot/unstable-$arch-sbuild, and creates a cronjob which  updates  said
       schroot daily.

       The script assumes you are on an un-metered internet connection (daily schroot updates might be costly otherwise).
