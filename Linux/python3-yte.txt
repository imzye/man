NAME
       yte - command line interface for yte

DESCRIPTION
       usage: yte [-h] [-r]

       Process a YAML file given at STDIN with YTE, and print the result to STDOUT.

              Note: if nothing is provided at STDIN, this will wait forever.

       It can be used to process a YTE template from STDIN and prints the rendered version to STDOUT:

              yte < template.yaml > rendered.yaml

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -r, --require-use-yte
              require that the document contains a `__use_yte__: true` statement at the top level. If the statement is not present or false, return document unprocessed (except removing the `__use_yte__:
              false` statement if present)
