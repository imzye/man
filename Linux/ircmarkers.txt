NAME
       ircmarkers - place markers on maps at given coordinates

SYNOPSIS
       ircmarkers [-q] [-o command] [-y south/north -x west/east] config [inputmap outputmap]

DESCRIPTION
       IrcMarkers takes a map in .png or .jpg format and a list of coordinates and labels in xplanet format and places markers on the map.  It was written to generate user maps of IRC channels.

       GnuPG/PGP key ids can be associated with each marker, to create "maps of trust".

       IrcMarkers reads its configuration and the list of markers from a config file.  The most important options (map to read/write, map dimensions) can be specified on the command line. Settings on the
       command line override settings in the config file.

OPTIONS
       config
           Config file to read markers and options from. This parameter is mandatory.

       inputmap
           Read input map from inputmap. Supported formats are .gif, .jpg/jpeg, .png, .xbm, .xpm, and the libgd-Formats .gd/gd1 and .gd2.

       outputmap
           Write output map to outputmap. Supported formats are .gif, .jpg/jpeg, .png, .gd/gd1, .gd2, and .wbmp.

       -q  Be quiet. Per default, IrcMarkers prints which labels and links are placed on the map.

       -y south/north
       -x west/east
           Declare  input  map dimensions. Unless specified otherwise in the config file, the map is assumed to be in equirectangular projection. -y specifies the lower/upper latitude coordinates, -x the
           left/right edge longitude. Per default, the map is assumed to be a world map (-y -90/90 -x -180/180).

       -o command
           Evaluate a configuration command. It will be executed before any commands in the config file (i.e. it will not override commands there).

CONFIG FILE SYNTAX
       The following directives can be used in the config file:

   Marker and Label Definitions
       lat lon "marker"
       lat lon "marker" options
       aa11aa "marker" options
       "marker" options
           Place marker with label marker on map at given coordinates.  Use negative values for south/east, positive for north/west.  This (decimal) format is compatible with the xplanet syntax.

            49.2532 7.0425 "Myon"

           Alternative formats recognized are:

            N51X11.123 E006X25.846
            N 51 11.123 E 006 25.846
            N 51X 11' 7.38" E 006X 25' 50.76"

           The noise characters X'" are optional.

           Also recognized are Maidenhead (QTH) locators.

            JN39PF "Myon"

       label y x "text"
       label y x "text" options
           Place a label at position y/x (in pixels). Useful for headlines etc.  Using negative values will count from the bottom/right border in X11's -geometry style.

   Marker and Label Options
       The following options can be specified per marker or globally (except gpg).  Global options set defaults for all following marker definitions.

       gpg keyid
           Associate GnuPG/PGP keyid with the marker. If two keys have signed each other, and both markers are visible on the map, a link will be drawn between the markers. Multiple keyids can be  given.
           Example:

           "Myon" gpg B46B923B6D8ABE71 gpg C5AF774A58510B5A

           Note: This is the long, 16 character keyid. To retrieve it, use "gpg --list-key --with-colon".

       label_color R G B
       label_border R G B|none
           Color of the labels placed on the map. Default is label_color 255 255 0, label_border 0 0 0. The border can be removed by specifying the "none" color.

       font fontfile
           Full pathname to the .ttf font used for the labels. Default is font /usr/share/ircmarkers/fixed_01.ttf.

       fontsize|ptsize size
           Size in points of the labels. Default is fontsize 6.

       dot_color R G B
       dot_border R G B|none
           Color of the dots placed on the map. Default is dot_color 255 255 255, dot_border 0 0 0.

       dot_size size
           Size of the dots. Default is 2.

       dot_shape dot|circle
           Dots are filled (dot) or hollow (circle). Default is dot.

       href link
           Link target to use in an imagemap.

       alias|pic|bigpic|sex string
           Options for export to pisg(1), see the pisg option below.

   Link Definition and Options
       "marker1" <-> "marker2"
       "marker1" <-> "marker2" options
           Draw a link between marker1 and marker2.

       link_color|sign2_color R G B|none
           Color of the lines drawn between the markers. Default is link_color 255 128 0.

   Global Options
       read inputmap
           Read input map from inputmap. Supported formats are .jpg and .png.

       write outputmap
           Write output map to outputmap. Supported formats are .jpg, .png, .gd1, .gd2, and .wbmp.

       lat|south_north south/north
       lon|west_east west/east
           Declare input map dimensions. Default is lat -90/90, lon -180/180.

           Note: It is possible to use "unusual" values like lon 0/360 if you adjust the coordinates as well. (-20 becomes 340 etc.)

       view_lat|view_south_north south/north
       view_lon|view_west_east west/east
           Only show part of the map in the output. Default is to show the whole map.

       view_width pixels
       view_height pixels
           Size of output map. Default is input map, or size of part selected.

       projection square|mercator|sinusoidal
       center_lon center
           Map projection. Default is square, which selects equirectangular projection.  center_lon is only used for sinusoidal projection.  There is no default for center_lon.

       link_outside on|off
           Whether to draw lines to markers that are not visible on the map. Default is link_outside off.

       sign1_color R G B|none
           Color of the lines drawn for uni-directional GnuPG/PGP signatures. Default is link_color none.

       imagemap file
           Write HTML image map to file. The map contains areas for all markers and labels with a href option. The name of the imagemap is the basename of the output map with the extension stripped.

       overlap overlapcorrector
           Full  pathname  to the binary that moves the labels around to reduce overlap.  Default is overlapcorrector /usr/lib/ircmarkers/overlap.  Chances are that you only need to change that parameter
           if you are debugging the overlap corrector.

       overlap_correction on|off
           Whether to use the overlap corrector or not. Default is overlap_correction on.  Turn it off if you have really many labels.

       pisg
           Instead of writing a map, print a config file suitable for pisg(1), most useful with ircmarkers -o pisg file. The exported marker options are alias, pic, bigpic, sex, and href (the  latter  as
           link).

       recv-keys
           Call gpg --recv-keys (most useful with ircmarkers -o recv-keys).

       quiet on|off
           Be quiet. Default is quiet off.

       #include "configfile"
           Read auxillary config file.

       # comment
           Anything else starting with a # character is a comment.

               49.2532 7.0425 "Myon"
               50.8574 6.4585 "formorer" label_color 255 255 0

               #include "debian.de.keys"

BUGS
       The GD library keeps a raw bitmap of the map in memory. Big maps will use lots of memory. Precompute the map you are going to use, i.e. downsample it to the target size using Imagemagick's convert
       or IrcMarkers view_* functions.

       Thanks go to Uli Martens for the "map of trust" idea.

       Alexander Wirt suggested the capability to draw selected parts of the map.

       Elmar Hoffmann suggested several error checks and config options.

       Rico Gloeckner suggested to support Maidenhead locators.
