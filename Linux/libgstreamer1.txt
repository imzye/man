NAME
       dh_gstscancodecs ‐ enumerate and classify gstreamer codecs

SYNOPSIS
         dh_gstscancodecs [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is meant to assist in building a package that
provides
       codecs, demultiplexers and other media‐handling components
for
       gstreamer‐based applications.

       dh_gstscancodecs generates substitution variable  for  de‐
bian/control, by
       scanning libraries /usr/lib/gstreamer‐1.0/*.so and
       /usr/lib/$DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/gstreamer‐1.0/*.so.

       The generated substitution variables are

       gstreamer:Version
           Should be added to XB‐GStreamer‐Version

       gstreamer:Elements
           Should be added to XB‐GStreamer‐Elements

       gstreamer:Provides
           Should be added to Provides

       gstreamer:URISources
           Should be added to XB‐GStreamer‐URI‐Sources

       gstreamer:URISinks
           Should be added to XB‐GStreamer‐URI‐Sinks

       gstreamer:Encoders
           Should be added to XB‐GStreamer‐Encoders

       gstreamer:Decoders
           Should be added to XB‐GStreamer‐Decoders

       This control fields will be used by the
       /usr/bin/gstreamer‐codec‐install  helper  to  install  re‐
quired missing
       GStreamer elements.

OPTIONS
       The standard debhelper options are supported.
