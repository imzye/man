NAME
       fstrcmp - fuzzy comparison of strings

SYNOPSIS
       fstrcmp [ -p ] first‐string second‐string
       fstrcmp -w first‐string second‐string
       fstrcmp -a first‐file second‐file
       fstrcmp -s needle haystack...
       fstrcmp --version

DESCRIPTION
       The  fstrcmp  command is used to make fuzzy comparisons between strings.  The “edit distance” between the strings is printed, with 0.0 meaning the strings are utterly un‐alike, and 1.0 meaning the
       strings are identical.

       You may need to quote the string to insulate them from the shell.

OPTIONS
       The fstrcmp command understands the following options:

       -a

       --files-as-bytes
               This option is used to compare two files as arrays of bytes.  See fmemcmp(3) for more information.

       -p

       --pair  This option is used to compare two strings as arrays of bytes.  This is the default.  See fstrcmp(3) for more information.

       -s

       --select
               This option is used to select the closest needle from the provided haystack alternatives.  The most similar (single) choice is printed.   If  none  are  particularly  similar,  nothing  is
               printed.  See fstrcmp(3) for more information.  See below for example.

       -V

       --version
               This option may be used to print the version of the fstrcmp command, and then exit.

       -w

       --wide-pair
               This option is used to compare two multi‐byte character strings.  See fstrcoll(3) for more information.

EXIT STATUS
       The fstrcmp command exits with status 1 on any error.  The fstrcmp command only exits with status 0 if there are no errors.

EXAMPLE
       The fstrcmp --select option may be used in a shell script to improve error messages.
              case "$action" in
              start)
                  start
                  ;;
              stop)
                  stop
                  ;;
              restart)
                  stop
                  start
                  ;;
              *)
                  echo "$0: action \"$action\" unknown" 1>&2
                  guess=`fstrcmp --select "$action" stop start restart`
                  if [ "$guess" ]
                  then
                      echo "$0: did you mean \"$guess\" instead?" 1>&2
                  fi
                  exit 1
                  ;;
              esac
       Thus, the error message frequently suggests the correct action in the face of simple finger problems on the command line.
