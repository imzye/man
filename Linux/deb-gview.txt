DEB-GVIEW(1)                                                                                  deb-gview manual                                                                                 DEB-GVIEW(1)

NAME
       deb-gview - GNOME viewer for .deb package files and contents

DESCRIPTION
       deb-gview displays Debian control information, devscript details and details of the files that would be installed (names, sizes and locations). Files within the package can be viewed within the
       package or externally.

       deb-gview accepts package files on the command line to support the 'open' command in various file managers, one window for each package. Individual views can be closed independently or
       simultaneously using 'Quit'.

       Packages do not need to be installed to be viewed. Packages do not need to be suitable for installation, e.g. a foreign architecture.

       Package files and .changes files can be viewed from local and remote filesystems.

       When loading .changes files, deb-gview will load each referenced package in a new window. When opening a .changes file from the deb-gview toolbar, the original window is not changed.

       When opening Debian packages files from the deb-gview toolbar, the package data will replace the current window data.

   Usage:
       deb-gview [OPTIONS] [file...]

   COMMAND:
       file
           One or more Debian package files (.deb) to preload or a .changes file referencing various package files.

           Individual package files or a set of packages referenced in a .changes file can be viewed from local and remote filesystems.

   GUI Options:
       See also gtk-options (7).

       --display=DISPLAY
           X display to use

   Help Options:
       -h, --help
           Show help options

       -v, --version
           Show version number

FILE PREVIEWS
       deb-gview has migrated to the XDG specification for config files and uses a dot-file in your XDG config directory (default: ~/.config/deb-gview/preview) to specify which applications should be
       used to preview files from the package. You are free to edit this file, deb-gview will not modify it, although the defaults will be replaced if the file is deleted.

       Any previous config in ~/.deb-gview/preview will be moved into the new file but the ~/.deb-gview directory will be preserved - feel free to delete it once any other files are moved to the new
       location.

       The first matching pattern will be used, so put the most general wildcards (like *) at the end of this file.

   GROUPS
       The first group contains two deb-gview default settings. 'terminal' determines which application to use for viewers that need a terminal. You may want to change this to gnome-terminal or konsole
       from the rather limited xterm default. 'execute_command' specifies the command to pass to the terminal application to load an external command within the terminal. Most terminal emulators support
       '-e' for this command.

       Subsequent group names need to be unique but have no other meaning to deb-gview.

   KEYS
       pattern: glob-style pattern to match the location of the file in the package (not the filesystem).

       viewer: the program to call to view the file content (which must exist in your system PATH).

       use_terminal: whether to start the viewer in a terminal, TRUE or FALSE.

       binary_file: whether the viewer requires the content as a binary file, TRUE or FALSE. Typically, image previews require a binary file.

       file_suffix: if the viewer needs a specific suffix, specify it here. Note that deb-gview does not insist that the suffix of the temporary file matches the suffix of the file within the package, it
       is up to you to ensure that the suffix is suitable for the viewer you want to use. Leave blank for no suffix.

   DEFAULT VALUES
       The defaults for file previews are:

           # Your choice of terminal application.
           #
           [deb-gview]
           terminal=xterm

           pattern=./usr/share/man/man*/*
           viewer=man
           use_terminal=true
           binary_file=false
           file_suffix=
