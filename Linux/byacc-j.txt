NAME
       Yacc - an LALR(1) parser generator for Java

SYNOPSIS
       byaccj  [ -dlrtvJ ] [ -b prefix ] [-Jclass= classname ] [-Jpackage= package_name ] [-Jextends= extends_name ] [-Jimplements= implements_name ] [-Jsemantic= semantic_type ] [-Jnorun] [-Jnocontruct]
       [-Jstack= NNN ] [-Jnodebug] [-Jfinal] [-Jthrows= exception_list ] filename

DESCRIPTION
       Yacc reads the grammar specification in the file filename and generates an LR(1) parser for it.  The parsers consist of a set of LALR(1) parsing tables and a driver routine written in the  C  pro‐
       gramming language.  Yacc normally writes the parse tables and the driver routine to the file y.tab.c.

       The following options are available:

              -b prefix
                     The -b option changes the prefix prepended to the output file names to the string denoted by prefix.  The default prefix is the character y.

              -d     The -d option causes the header file y.tab.h to be written.

              -l     If  the  -l  option  is  not specified, yacc will insert The generated code to the user's original code.  If the -l option is specified, yacc will not insert the .TP -r The -r option
                     causes yacc to produce separate files for code and tables.  The code file is named y.code.c, and the tables file is named y.tab.c.

              -t     The -t option changes the preprocessor directives generated by yacc so that debugging statements will be incorporated in the compiled code.

              -v     The -v option causes a human-readable description of the generated parser to be written to the file y.output.

              -J     The -J option switches from C/C++ to Java output. Not necessary if other -J flags are used.

              -Jclass=<classname>
                     Changes the name of the Java class (and .java file) to classname

              -Jpackage=<packagename>
                      Changes the package in which the parser resides from the default <nothing> to packagename

              -Jextends=<extend_name>
                      Changes the class the parser extends from the default <nothing> to extend_name

              -Jimplements=<implement_name>
                      Changes the interface the parser implements from the default <nothing> to implement_name

              -Jsemantic=<semantic_type>
                       Changes the semantic (value of the rules' variables) type to semantic_type.  No extra class will be generated.

              -Jnorun
                     The -Jnorun option informs Byacc to not generate a run() method. Useful when working with threads.

              -Jnoconstruct
                     The -Jnoconstruct option informs Byacc to not generate constructors. Useful when extending classes.

              -Jstack=<NNN>
                      Changes the stack size from default 500 to NNN

              -Jnodebug
                     The -Jnodebug option informs Byacc to omit debugging code for further better performance.

              -Jfinal
                     The -Jfinal option makes generated class final.

              -Jthrows=<exception_list>
                      Informs Byacc to declare thrown exceptions for yyparse() method.

       If the environment variable TMPDIR is set, the string denoted by TMPDIR will be used as the name of the directory where the temporary files are created.

FILES

       y.tab.c
       y.tab.h

DIAGNOSTICS
       If there are rules that are never reduced, the number of such rules is reported on standard error.  If there are any LALR(1) conflicts, the number of conflicts is reported on standard error.
