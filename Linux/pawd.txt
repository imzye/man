NAME
       pawd - print automounter working directory

SYNOPSIS
       pawd [ path ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       pawd  is  used  to print the current working directory, adjusted to re‐
       flect proper paths that can be reused to go through the automounter for
       the  shortest possible path.  In particular, the path printed back does
       not include any of Amd's local mount points.  Using them is unsafe, be‐
       cause  Amd  may unmount managed file systems from the mount points, and
       thus including them in paths may not always find the files within.

       Without any arguments, pawd will print the automounter adjusted current
       working directory.  With any number of arguments, it will print the ad‐
       justed path of each one of the arguments.
