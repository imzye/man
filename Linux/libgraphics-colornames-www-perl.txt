Graphics::ColorNames::WWW(3pm)                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                      Graphics::ColorNames::WWW(3pm)

NAME
       Graphics::ColorNames::WWW - WWW color names and equivalent RGB values

SYNOPSIS
         require Graphics::ColorNames::WWW;

         $NameTable = Graphics::ColorNames::WWW->NamesRgbTable();
         $RgbBlack  = $NameTable->{black};

DESCRIPTION
       This module defines color names and their associated RGB values from various WWW specifications, such as SVG or CSS as well as common browser implementations.

       See the documentation of Graphics::ColorNames for information how to use this module.

       Currently, SVG and CSS define the same color keywords and include all color keywords supported by common web browsers. Therefore, the modules Graphics::ColorNames::WWW, Graphics::ColorNames::SVG
       and Graphics::ColorNames::CSS behave in identical ways.

       This may change if the specs should happen to diverge; then this module will become a superset of all color keywords defined by W3C's specs.

       It is recommended to use this module unless you require exact compatibility with the CSS and SVG specifications or specific browsers.

   NOTE
       Reportedly "fuchsia" was misspelled "fuscia" in an unidentified HTML specification. It also appears to be a common misspelling, so both names are recognized.

LIMITATIONS
       The "transparent" keyword is unsupported. Currently, Graphics::ColorNames does not allow RGBA values.

       Further, the system color keywords are not assigned to a fixed RGB value and thus unsupported: "ActiveBorder", "ActiveCaption", "AppWorkspace", "Background", "ButtonFace", "ButtonHighlight",
       "ButtonShadow", "ButtonText", "CaptionText", "GrayText", "Highlight", "HighlightText", "InactiveBorder", "InactiveCaption", "InactiveCaptionText", "InfoBackground", "InfoText", "Menu", "MenuText",
       "Scrollbar", "ThreeDDarkShadow", "ThreeDFace", "ThreeDHighlight", "ThreeDLightShadow", "ThreeDShadow", "Window", "WindowFrame", "WindowText" (these are deprecated in CSS3)
