NAME
       djvudump - Display internal structure of DjVu files.

SYNOPSIS
       djvudump [-o outputfile] djvufiles...

DESCRIPTION
       Program  djvudump  prints  an indented representation of the chunk structure of any DjVu files.  Each line represent contains a chunk ID followed by the chunk size.  Lines are indented in order to re‐
       flect the hierarchical structure of the IFF files.  The page identifier is printed between curly braces when a bundled multi-page DjVu document is recognized.  Additional information about each  chunk
       is provided when djvudump recognizes the chunk name and knows how to summarize the chunk data.

REMARKS
       This program is in fact able to describe any file complying with the Electronic Arts IFF 85 specification.  This includes a number of graphical and sound file formats.

CREDITS
