IRW(1)                           User Commands                          IRW(1)

NAME
       irw - Send data from Unix domain socket to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       irw [socket]

DESCRIPTION
       irw  will connect to any Unix domain socket and print the received data
       to stdout. Without a socket argument it will watch /var/run/lirc/lircd.
       Useful for debugging.

       Options:

       -h --help
              Display usage summary

       -v --version
              Display version

SIGNALS
       On receiving SIGUSR1 irw makes a clean exit.

EXAMPLE
       Dumping the default socket while pressing one button:

           myhost $ irw
           0000000000f40bf0 00 KEY_POWER ANIMAX
           0000000000f40bf0 01 KEY_POWER ANIMAX
           0000000000f40bf0 02 KEY_POWER ANIMAX
           0000000000f40bf0 03 KEY_POWER ANIMAX
           0000000000f40bf0 04 KEY_POWER ANIMAX
           0000000000f40bf0 05 KEY_POWER ANIMAX
           ^C
           myhost $

       Note that the second counter is incremented for each new event generated
       by the single key press. This is important for correct lircd operation.

NOTES
       Since the lircd socket supports multiple clients, irw can run in paral‐
       lel with other applications.

       irw does nothing more than dumps a unix-domain  socket,  a  task  which
       many  standard  tools  also can do. E. g., the ncat(1) tool can be used
       instead of irw to provide more flexibility (but without a sane  default
       socket):
           ncat -U /var/run/lirc/lircd

SEE ALSO
       The  documentation  for  lirc  is  maintained  as  html pages. They are
       located under html/ in the documentation directory.
