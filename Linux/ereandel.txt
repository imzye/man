NOTES
   Client certificates
       ereandel  can work with client certificates if capsules requires them for authentication.  ereandel allows a single client certificate per (sub)domain identified by it's name. If a client cert for
       a specific domain is available ereandel will send it to the server with every request.  When a resource requires a client cert and ereandel can't find one it will show you a command  to  create  a
       client cert for the capsule.  The certificates are stored in $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/ereandel/certs/.

       To remove a certificate simply delete the <domain>.crt and <domain>.key files in the directory mentioned above.

CONFIGURATION
       You can setup a config file at $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/ereandel/ereandel.conf to configure ereandel the way you like.  The file uses a simple key=value style, see the complete example for the default val‐
       ues below.
