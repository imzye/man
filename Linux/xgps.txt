DESCRIPTION
       These are the demonstration clients shipped with gpsd. They have some
       common options:

       The -h option causes each client to emit a summary of its options and
       then exit.

       The -V option causes each client to dump the package version and exit.

       The -l option, when present, sets the format of latitude and longitude
       reports. The value 'd' produces decimal degrees and is the default. The
       value 'm' produces degrees and decimal minutes. The value 's' produces
       degrees, minutes, and decimal seconds.

       xgps, cgps, and lcdgps look at variables in the environment to figure
       out what units they should default to using for display — imperial,
       nautical, or metric. Here are the variables and values they check:

               GPSD_UNITS one of:
                         imperial   = miles/feet
                         nautical   = knots/feet
                         metric     = km/meters
               LC_MEASUREMENT
                      en_US      = miles/feet
                         C          = miles/feet
                         POSIX      = miles/feet
                         [other]    = km/meters
               LANG
                      en_US      = miles/feet
                         C          = miles/feet
                         POSIX      = miles/feet
                         [other]    = km/meters

       These preferences may be overridden by the -u option.

       Where present, the -u option can be used to set the system units for
       display; follow the keyword with 'i' for 'imperial' for American units
       (feet in altitude and error estimates, miles per hour in speeds), 'n'
       for 'nautical' (feet in altitude and error estimates, knots in speed)
       or 'm' for 'metric' (meters in altitude and error estimates, kilometers
       per hour in speeds).

       The -D option, when present, sets a debug level; it is primarily for
       use by GPSD developers. It enables various progress messages to
       standard error.

       By default, clients collect data from all compatible devices on
       localhost, using the default GPSD port 2947. An optional argument to
       any client may specify a server to get data from. A colon-separated
       suffix is taken as a port number. If there is a second colon-separated
       suffix, that is taken as a specific device name to be watched. However,
       if the server specification contains square brackets, the part inside
       them is taken as an IPv6 address and port/device suffixes are only
       parsed after the trailing bracket. Possible cases look like this:

       localhost:/dev/ttyS1
           Look at the default port of localhost, trying both IPv4 and IPv6
           and watching output from serial device 1.

       example.com:2317
           Look at port 2317 on example.com, trying both IPv4 and IPv6.

       71.162.241.5:2317:/dev/ttyS3
           Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv4 address, collecting data
           from attached serial device 3.

       [FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:2317:/dev/ttyS5
           Look at port 2317 at the specified IPv6 address, collecting data
           from attached serial device 5.

       Not all clients shipped with GPSD are documented here. See also the
       separate manual pages for gpspipe(1) and gpsmon(1) and gpxlogger(1) .

   xgps
       xgps is a simple test client for gpsd with an X interface. It displays
       current GPS position/time/velocity information and (for GPSes that
       support the feature) the locations of accessible satellites.

       In the sky view, satellites are color-coded to indicate quality of
       signal; consult the data display to the left for exact figures in dB.
       Square icons indicate WAAS/EGNOS satellites, circles indicate ordinary
       GPS satellites. Filled icons were used in the last fix, outline icons
       were not.

   xgpsspeed
       xgpsspeed is a speedometer that uses position information from the GPS.
       It accepts an -h option and optional argument as for gps, or a -V
       option to dump the package version and exit.

       The default display mode is a speed and track presentation modeled
       after a marine navigation display; for backward compatibility the
       --nautical option forces this mode. The --landspeed option produces a
       simple speedometer.

       The -speedunits option can be used to set the speed units for display;
       follow the keyword with knots for nautical miles per hour, kph for
       kilometres per hour, or mph for miles per hour. The default is miles
       per hour.

       In the nautical mode only, --maxspeed sets the maximum on the
       speedometer.

   cgps
       cgps is a client resembling xgps, but without the pictorial satellite
       display and able to run on a serial terminal or terminal emulator.

       The -s option prevents cgps from displaying the data coming from the
       daemon. This display can also be toggled with the s command.

       The -m option will display your magnetic heading (as opposed to your
       true heading). This is a calculated value, not a measured value, and is
       subject to a potential error of up to two degrees in the areas for
       which the calculation is valid (currently Western Europe, Alaska, and
       Lower 48 in the USA). The formulas used are those found in the Aviation
       Formulary v1.43.

       cgps terminates when you send it a SIGHUP or SIGINT; given default
       terminal settings this will happen when you type Ctrl-C at it. It will
       also terminate on 'q'

   lcdgps
       A client that passes gpsd data to lcdproc, turning your car computer
       into a very expensive and nearly feature-free GPS receiver. Currently
       assumes a 4x40 LCD and writes data formatted to fit that size screen.
       Also displays 4- or 6-character Maidenhead grid square output.

   gegps
       This program collects fixes from gpsd and feeds them to a running
       instance of Google Earth for live location tracking.

       The -d argument is the location of the Google Earth installation
       directory. If not specified, it defaults to the current directory.

       If you have the free (non-subscription) version, start by running with
       the -i option to drop a clue in the Google Earth installation
       directory, as 'Open_in_Google_Earth_RT_GPS.kml', then open that file in
       Places (File > Open...). Run gegps in the normal way after that.
