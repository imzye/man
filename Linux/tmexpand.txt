NAME
       tmexpand - jed text-macro processor

SYNOPSIS
       tmexpand [ --version]  [ -g]  [ -Iinclude-dir -Iinclude-dir ...]  [ input-file|-]  [ output-file|-]

DESCRIPTION
       tmexpand is a simple jed-script program for expanding a text-macro file.  Both the S-Lang and jed documentation, as well as the jedsoft.org web pages are written in text-macro format.

       Included  in  the  tmexpand distribution are macros for the creation of jedsoft.org style HTML pages, macros for producing linuxdoc and docbook SGML files, and macros for expanding S-Lang function
       text-macro documentation to the S-Lang help file format.

OPTIONS
       --version
              Print version information

       -g     Load with _traceback set to 1.  This is useful for debugging tmexpand itself.

       -Iinclude-dir
              Append the directory to the macro-directory search list.

REQUIREMENTS
       tmexpand is a S-Lang script that is processed by the jed editor.  Version 0.99-17 or later of the jed editor is required to run the script.  To get the most out of tmexpand, jed should be compiled
       against S-Lang version 2.

USAGE
       This section is incomplete.

BUGS
       Debugging the output when something goes wrong can be tricky.
