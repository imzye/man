NAME
       debianize-vdrplugin - debianize a VDR plugin source archive

DESCRIPTION
       debianize-vdrplugin can be used to add a working debian-directory to the source-directory of a vdr-plugin.

       debianize-vdrplugin should be called directly from a plugin-source-directory.

       After debianize-vdrplugin was run, you should check the files inside the debian-directory if they fit your needs, and modify them accordingly.

       The next step to get a debian-package for the vdr-plugin is to call dpkg-buildpackage (You need the package dpkg-dev for this tool.)
