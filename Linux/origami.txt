DESCRIPTION
       Origami allows you to install, monitor, archive or restore Folding @ Home data on your local machine.  It also allows for central deployment, monitoring, archiving, restoration and updating
       the username and team data via the network to ssh-accessible machines.

       Origami supports cron-based scheduling, 32bit or 64bit and network proxy settings.  Install Stanfords Folding @ Home client to a single machine or network of machines.

COMMAND-LINE ACTIONS
       The first argument which does not begin with a hyphen ("-") is considered to be an action that the program should perform.  If an action is not specified Origami will display the help output.

       The following actions are available to the local machine:

       install Install Folding @ Home to the local machine.  This action will create a dedicated user, storage location for Folding @ Home data, startup script and request a work unit.

       deploy  Install  Folding  @ Home to remote machines as listed in the ~/.origamirc file.  This action will create a dedicated user, storage location for Folding @ Home data, startup script and
               request a work unit on the remote machine.  SSH access as the root user is required for the deploy action.

       archive Archive Folding @ Home data for the local Folding @ Home client.  This action will stop the Folding @ Home client, archive the current progress into a <hostname>-<date>.tar.bz2 format
               and store the data in ~/.origami/.

       network-archive
               Archive Folding @ Home data on the remote Folding @ Home client as listed in the ~/.origamirc.  This action will stop the Folding @ Home client, archive the current  progress  into  a
               <hostname>-<date>.tar.bz2 format and store the data in ~/.origami/.

       restore Restore Folding @ Home data on the local machine.  This action will require previously archived data (as generated by the archive action).

       network-restore
               Restore Folding @ Home data on the remote Folding @ Home clients as listed in the ~/.origamirc.  This action will require previously archived data (as generated by the network-archive
               action).

       erase   Erase current Folding @ Home installation.  Anything generated by the install function will be removed and all Folding @ Home progress will be lost.
