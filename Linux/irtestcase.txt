NAME
       irtestcase - Create or check decoding testcases.

SYNOPSIS
       irtestcase [-l lircrc-file -p prog] <socket>

       irtestcase [-l lircrc-file -p prog] -t testdata <socket>

       irtestcase [-v|-h]

DESCRIPTION
       irtestcase is a tool which can record keypresses from a remote together
       with the decoded values. Given output from another session, it can also
       verify that the decoding still works as expected.

       In  the  first form irtestcase will wait for input and create log files
       for it. Doing so, it also echoes received buttons on stdout.  There  is
       no  way  to  stop the program in a clean way, just use ctrl-C when com‐
       pleted.

       In the second form it will feed the data  from  the  testdata  file  to
       lircd and log the the decoded data as usually. Thus, this makes it pos‐
       sible to test the output from the remote which generated the  testdata.
       In this form lircd must be running with the "file" driver.

       The optional socket is the lircd output socket (lircd must be running).
       It defaults to LIRC_SOCKET_PATH in environment, falling back to a hard‐
       coded default value (/var/run/lirc/lircd).

OPTIONS
       -l, --lircrc  <lircrc config file>
           Log  also applications strings (as ircat(1)) using lircrc type con‐
           fig file.

       -p, --prog <program id>
           When using -l/--lircrc,  the  program  name  matching  the  PROG  =
           entries in lircrc

       -t, --testdata
           Use  data  i file instead of "live" input from the remote. This can
           be the durations.log file from a previous run, see  FILES.  It  can
           also be logged output from mode2(1).

       -v , --version
           Print version and exit.

       -h , --help
           Print help message.

ENVIRONMENT
       irtestcase respects LIRC_SOCKET_PATH which if defined holds the path to
       the lircd output socket to listen to.

FILES
       /tmp/irtestcase
           irtestcase creates files  in  /tmp/irtestcase  (hardcoded,  sorry).
           After a successful run here is:

           durations.log
               Printable space/pulse durations in the same format as mode2(1).
               This file is usable as -t/--testdata input.

           codes.log
               The decoded  buttons, in same format as irw(1).

           app_strings.log
               The application strings, as presented by ircat(1).

       ~/.cache/irtestcase.log
           Debug log. Setting the XDG_CACHE_HOME  environment  variable  relo‐
           cates  this  file  to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/irtestcase.log. The amount of
           logging respects the LIRC_LOGLEVEL environment variable, defaulting
           to the debug value in the [lircd] section of lirc_options.conf.

SEE ALSO
       The  documentation  for  lirc  is  maintained  as  html pages. They are
       located under html/ in the documentation directory.
