SMP_ZONE_LOCK(8)                                                                                   SMP_UTILS                                                                                   SMP_ZONE_LOCK(8)

NAME
       smp_zone_lock - invoke ZONE LOCK SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_zone_lock [--expected=EX] [--fpass=FP] [--help] [--hex] [--inactivity=TL] [--interface=PARAMS] [--password=PA] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) ZONE LOCK function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the --sa=SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the SAS_ADDR
       may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple present.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -E, --expected=EX
              set the 'expected expander change count' field in the SMP request.  The value EX is from 0 to 65535 inclusive with 0 being the default value. When EX is greater than  zero  then  if  the  value
              doesn't match the expander change count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when the request arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a function result of "invalid expander change
              count" in the response.

       -F, --fpass=FP
              where FP is the name of a file which contains the password. The password may be in ASCII in which case it is on one line surrounded by either single quotes are double quotes. Alternatively  the
              password may be given in ASCII hexadecimal; either as bytes separated by space, tab, comma or newline, or as longer strings of hexadecimal bytes in which every 2 digits represents a byte. Empty
              lines and those starting with "#" are ignored.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -i, --inactivity=TL
              sets the zone lock inactivity time limit to TL which has units of 100 milliseconds. The default value is 0 which implies no time limit.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -P, --password=PA
              where PA is the zone manager password which may be up to 32 bytes long. This option cannot be give together with the --fpass=FP option. The default password is 32 NULLs (zero bytes) and  PA  is
              padded with NULLs to the right (to make it 32 bytes long in the request).

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies the SAS address of the SMP target device. The mpt interface needs this option and it will typically be an expander's SAS address. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS addresses are
              shown in hexadecimal.  To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times.

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP ZONE LOCK function was introduced in SAS-2 .
