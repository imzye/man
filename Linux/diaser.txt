DESCRIPTION
       An  advanced  disk based backup volume accumulator, geo-duplication and
       management system for HE and SME. A quick and low-cost way to  make  an
       environment more robust and data more accessible by archiving in multi‐
       ple places. This replication also provides fast retrieval  of  archived
       data from all node hosting locations. A Perl installer creates the sys‐
       tem. Nodes can be dedicated to storage or used  for  existing  services
       over  unused  bandwidth. DIASER works in user space over SSH. The soft‐
       ware is based on DIAP/LTASP which is a storage architecture designed to
       structure  months to years of long term sustainable archiving space in‐
       cluding retrospective archiving.

OPTIONS
       More than one configuration file.

       It is possible to force diaser to read a particular configuration  file
       by executing ]$diaser diaser.conf --opts

       The configuration file can named as the user chooses i.e.

       ]$diaser my.config --opts

       Currently,  changes  will always be written to diaser.conf from the di‐
       rectory diaser was executed in. The user is free to change the name  of
       the  configuration file and read it into diaser as descibed above. This
       feature is particularly useful when there us more than one installation
       being managed from a single user account.

       --modify

       Apply modified settings to the running DIASER on your designated nodes.

       --numyear   years of operation required
       --startyear year to begin storing archives, this can be in the past
       --phase1    hour between 0 and 23
       --phase2    hour between 0 and 23
       --nodea     ip address in format 0.0.0.0
       --nodeb     ip address in format 0.0.0.0
       --nodec     ip address in format 0.0.0.0
       --dryrun    boolean 1(y) or 0(n)
       --lmb       lowest maximum bandwidth, KBytes per second
       --tzone_a   UTC or zeroed timezone, integer value 0-12
       --tzone_b   UTC offset against node A, integer value 0-12
       --tzone_c   UTC offset against node A, integer value 0-12
       --tout      copy time out in seconds
       --fillstarttime     time to run DIASER fill operation,
                           hour between 0 and 23
       --volumedir         the directory where your backup
                           volumes reside
       --diffconstprefix   prefix given to your Differential or
                           constant volumes
       --collectfull   are Full volumes to be collected or not,
                       boolean 1(y) or 0(n)
       --fullprefix    prefix given to your Full volumes

       --retrive

       Fetch  archive  data.  A simple tool provided which also has additional
       command line options. The retrieval tool will walk you through a set of
       questions  then  list files for you to pick and transfer. The file will
       retain it's name and be located in the diaser_rel directory.

       --r_year    which year
       --r_month   which month
       --r_day     which day
       --r_full    if not a day name a full directory - leave as default
       --nodea     ip address in format 0.0.0.0
       --nodeb     ip address in format 0.0.0.0
       --nodec     ip address in format 0.0.0.0
       --porta     int
       --portb     int
       --portc     int
       --user_acc  user account name, usually default set previously
