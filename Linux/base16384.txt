NAME
       base16384 - Encode binary files to printable utf16be

SYNOPSIS
       base16384 -[ed][t][n][cC] <inputfile> <outputfile>

DESCRIPTION
       There  are  16384 Chinese characters ( from 4E00 to 8DFF ) as the alphabet , just like what base64 did. If length of the data has a remainder after mod 7, an unicode Chinese character 3Dxx will be
       appended to present it with xx ranging from 01 to 06

OPTIONS
       -e   Read data from inputfile and encode them into outputfile. It's the default option when neither -e nor -d is specified.

       -d   Read data from inputfile and decode them into outputfile.

       -t   Show spend time.

       -n   Do not write utf16be file header 0xFEFF to the output.

       -c   Embed or validate checksum in remainder when using stdin or stdout or inputsize > _BASE16384_ENCBUFSZ.

       -C   Do -c forcely.

       inputfile
            An absolute or relative file path. Specially, pass - to read from stdin.

       outputfile
            An absolute or relative file path. Specially, pass - to write to stdout.

EXIT STATUS
       0    Exit on success.

       1    Get file size error.

       2    Fopen output file error.

       3    Fopen input file error.

       4    Write file error.

       5    Open input file error.

       6    Map input file error.

       7    Write file error in mmap.

       8    Invalid input/output filename.

       9    Invalid commandline parameter.

       10   Invalid decoding checksum.
