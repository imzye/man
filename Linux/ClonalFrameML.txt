NAME
       ClonalFrameML - Efficient Inference of Recombination in Whole Bacterial Genomes

SYNOPSIS
       ClonalFrameML newick_file fasta_file output_file [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       ClonalFrameML is a software package that performs efficient inference of recombination in bacterial genomes. ClonalFrameML was created by Xavier Didelot and Daniel Wilson. ClonalFrameML can be ap‐
       plied  to any type of aligned sequence data, but is especially aimed at analysis of whole genome sequences. It is able to compare hundreds of whole genomes in a matter of hours on a standard Desk‐
       top computer. There are three main outputs from a run of ClonalFrameML: a phylogeny with branch lengths corrected to account for recombination, an estimation of the key parameters of the  recombi‐
       nation process, and a genomic map of where recombination took place for each branch of the phylogeny.

       ClonalFrameML  is a maximum likelihood implementation of the Bayesian software ClonalFrame which was previously described by Didelot and Falush (2007). The recombination model underpinning Clonal‐
       FrameML is exactly the same as for ClonalFrame, but this new implementation is a lot faster, is able to deal with much larger genomic dataset, and does not suffer from MCMC convergence issues
