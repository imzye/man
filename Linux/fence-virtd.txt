NAME
       fence_virt.conf - configuration file for fence_virtd

DESCRIPTION
       The fence_virt.conf file contains configuration information for fence_virtd, a fencing request routing daemon for clusters of virtual machines.

       The file is tree-structured.  There are parent/child relationships and sibling relationships between the nodes.

         foo {
           bar {
             baz = "1";
           }
         }

       There are three primary sections of fence_virt.conf.

SECTIONS
   fence_virtd
       This section contains global information about how fence_virtd is to operate.  The most important pieces of information are as follows:

       listener
              the listener plugin for receiving fencing requests from clients

       backend
              the plugin to be used to carry out fencing requests

       foreground
              do not fork into the background.

       wait_for_init
              wait for the frontend and backends to become available rather than giving up immediately.  This replaces wait_for_backend in 0.2.x.

       module_path
              the module path to search for plugins

   listeners
       This section contains listener-specific configuration information; see the section about listeners below.

   backends
       This section contains listener-specific configuration information; see the section about listeners below.

   groups
       This section contains static maps of which virtual machines may fence which other virtual machines; see the section about groups below.

LISTENERS
       There  are various listeners available for fence_virtd, each one handles decoding and authentication of a given fencing request.  The following configuration blocks belong in the listeners section
       of fence_virt.conf

   multicast
       key_file
              the shared key file to use (default: /etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key).

       hash   the weakest hashing algorithm allowed for client requests.  Clients may send packets with stronger hashes than the one specified, but not weaker ones.  (default: sha256, but could be  sha1,
              sha512, or none)

       auth   the hashing algorithm to use for the simplistic challenge-response authentication (default: sha256, but could be sha1, sha512, or none)

       family the IP family to use (default: ipv4, but may be ipv6)

       address
              the multicast address to listen on (default: 225.0.0.12)

       port   the multicast port to listen on (default: 1229)

       interface
              interface to listen on.  By default, fence_virtd listens on all interfaces.  However, this causes problems in some environments where the host computer is used as a gateway.

   serial
       The  serial  listener  plugin utilizes libvirt's serial (or VMChannel) mapping to listen for requests.  When using the serial listener, it is necessary to add a serial port (preferably pointing to
       /dev/ttyS1) or a channel (preferably pointing to 10.0.2.179:1229) to the libvirt domain description.  Note that only type unix , mode bind serial ports and  channels  are  supported  and  each  VM
       should have a separate unique socket.  Example libvirt XML:

          <serial type='unix'>
            <source mode='bind' path='/sandbox/guests/fence_socket_molly'/>
            <target port='1'/>
          </serial>
          <channel type='unix'>
            <source mode='bind' path='/sandbox/guests/fence_molly_vmchannel'/>
            <target type='guestfwd' address='10.0.2.179' port='1229'/>
          </channel>

       uri    the URI to use when connecting to libvirt by the serial plugin (optional).

       path   The  same directory that is defined for the domain serial port path (From example above: /sandbox/guests). Sockets must reside in this directory in order to be considered valid. This can be
              used to prevent fence_virtd from using the wrong sockets.

       mode   This selects the type of sockets to register.  Valid values are "serial" (default) and "vmchannel".

   tcp
       The tcp listener operates similarly to the multicast listener but uses TCP sockets for communication instead of using multicast packets.

       key_file
              the shared key file to use (default: /etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key).

       hash   the hashing algorithm to use for packet signing (default: sha256, but could be sha1, sha512, or none)

       auth   the hashing algorithm to use for the simplistic challenge-response authentication (default: sha256, but could be sha1, sha512, or none)

       family the IP family to use (default: ipv4, but may be ipv6)

       address
              the IP address to listen on (default: 127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6)

       port   the TCP port to listen on (default: 1229)

   vsock
       The vsock listener operates similarly to the multicast listener but uses virtual machine sockets (AF_VSOCK) for communication instead of using multicast packets.

       key_file
              the shared key file to use (default: /etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key).

       hash   the hashing algorithm to use for packet signing (default: sha256, but could be sha1, sha512, or none)

       auth   the hashing algorithm to use for the simplistic challenge-response authentication (default: sha256, but could be sha1, sha512, or none)

       port   the vsock port to listen on (default: 1229)

BACKENDS
       There are various backends available for fence_virtd, each one handles routing a fencing request to a hypervisor or management tool.  The following configuration blocks belong in the backends sec‐
       tion of fence_virt.conf

   libvirt
       The libvirt plugin is the simplest plugin.  It is used in environments where routing fencing requests between multiple hosts is not required, for example by a user running a cluster of virtual ma‐
       chines on a single desktop computer.

       uri    the URI to use when connecting to libvirt.

              All libvirt URIs are accepted and passed as-is.

              See https://libvirt.org/uri.html#remote-uris for examples.

              NOTE: When VMs are run as non-root user the socket path must be set as part of the URI.

              Example: qemu:///session?socket=/run/user/<UID>/libvirt/virtqemud-sock

   cpg
       The cpg plugin uses corosync CPG and libvirt to track virtual machines and route fencing requests to the appropriate computer.

       uri    the URI to use when connecting to libvirt by the cpg plugin.

       name_mode
              The cpg plugin, in order to retain compatibility with fence_xvm, stores virtual machines in a certain way.  The default was to use 'name' when using fence_xvm and fence_xvmd, and so this is
              still the default.  However, it is strongly recommended to use 'uuid' instead of 'name' in all cluster environments involving more than one physical host in order to avoid the potential for
              name collisions.

GROUPS
       Fence_virtd supports static maps which allow grouping of VMs.  The groups are arbitrary and are checked at fence time.  Any member of a group may fence any other member.  Hosts may be assigned  to
       multiple groups if desired.

   group
       This defines a group.

       name   Optionally define the name of the group. Useful only for configuration readability and debugging of configuration parsing.

       uuid   Defines  UUID  as  a member of a group.  It can be used multiple times to specify both node name and UUID values that can be fenced.  When using the serial listener, the vm uuid is required
              and it is recommended to add also the vm name.

       ip     Defines an IP which is allowed to send fencing requests for members of this group (e.g. for multicast).  It can be used multiple times to allow more than 1 IP to send  fencing  requests  to
              the  group.   It is highly recommended that this be used in conjunction with a key file.  When using the vsock listener, ip should contain the CID value assigned by libvirt to the vm.  When
              using the serial listener, ip value is not used and can be omitted.

EXAMPLE
        fence_virtd {
         listener = "multicast";
         backend = "cpg";
        }

        # this is the listeners section

        listeners {
         multicast {
          key_file = "/etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key";
         }
        }

        backends {
         libvirt {
          uri = "qemu:///system";
         }
        }

        groups {
         group {
          name = "cluster1";
          ip = "192.168.1.1";
          ip = "192.168.1.2";
          uuid = "44179d3f-6c63-474f-a212-20c8b4b25b16";
          uuid = "1ce02c4b-dfa1-42cb-b5b1-f0b1091ece60";
          uuid = "node1";
          uuid = "node2";
         }
        }
