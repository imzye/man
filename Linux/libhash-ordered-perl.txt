NAME
       Hash::Ordered::Benchmarks - Ordered hash benchmarking

VERSION
       version 0.014

INTRODUCTION
       The Hash::Ordered internals are simple: a hash of data and an array of ordered keys.  I thought this would perform well for common tasks and likely outperform more complicated ordered hash
       implementations, so I decided to do some benchmarking to test it.

       Note: since the initial benchmarking, "Hash::Ordered" gained just-in-time indexing of the keys array to support faster tombstone deletion, which adds some conditional data structures to the
       internals.  It also now supports "tie".  The revised benchmarks include the "tie" mode for comparison with other tied hash implementations.

MODULES TESTED
       In my review of alternatives to "Hash::Ordered", six seemed sufficiently general-purpose to be worth benchmarking.  The modules tested are listed in the benchmark output in shorthand:

       •   Array::AsHash — denoted "a:ah"

       •   Array::OrdHash — denoted "a:oh"

       •   Data::XHash — denoted "d:xh"

       •   Hash::Ordered — denoted "h:o" and marked with "*"

       •   Tie::Hash::Indexed — denoted "t:h:i"

       •   Tie::IxHash — denoted "t:ix"

       •   Tie::LLHash — denoted "t:llh"

       Note that Tie::Hash::Indexed is written in XS and also may require forced installation as its tests often fail for Perl 5.18+ due to the hash randomization change.

       If there are different methods of doing something with a module, the variations are described in each section below.

BENCHMARKS
       I conducted benchmarking with the Benchmark module.  The test script is in the "devel" directory of the distribution.  Tests were run on Perl 5.20.2 on a Mac Book Pro (darwin-thread-multi-2level).
       Each benchmark ran for 5 CPU seconds.

       Benchmarks were run at several different scales to reveal differences in efficiency as hash size grows.  The details are described in each section below.

       A seed list of keys and values was generated from random integers using Math::Random::MT::Auto.  The same seed list was used for all benchmarks unless otherwise noted.

       I  did  not  test  advanced features of these modules, as apples-to-apples comparison is difficult.  Still, the performance on common, simple measures could suggest how features that combine these
       operations might perform.

   Ordered hash creation
       I tested hash creation for 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  For some modules there were different options for creating a hash:

       •   "Array::AsHash" takes an array-reference with an option to use it directly or to clone it.  In one case I provided the seed list array reference with the clone option to true ("a:ah_cp").   In
           another case I created a new array reference from the seed list and provided it directly ("a:ah_rf").

       •   "Hash::Ordered" can be initialized either with "new" ("h:o_oo") or via "tie" ("h:o_th").

       •   "Tie::IxHash" can be initialized either with "new" ("t:ix_oo") or via "tie" ("t:ix_th").

       •   "Data::XHash" can be created with a list ("t:xh_ls") or an array reference ("t:xh_rf").

       As expected, when "Array::AsHash" gets an array reference, it's very fast.  "Tie::Hash::Indexed" does well here, also.  Of the non-XS, more hash-like choices, "Hash::Ordered" does well.

   Getting hash elements
       I tested retrieving values for 10% of the keys, randomly selected, from hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  The hash was created beforehand so the benchmarks reflect only element access.

       Some modules had choices for how to retrieve an value, usually between a method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference ("_rf").

       Generally, method calls turned out faster than other approaches for a given module, demonstrating the inefficiency of tied objects.

   Setting hash elements
       I tested changing values for 10% of the keys, randomly selected, from hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  The hash was created beforehand so the benchmarks reflect only element mutation.  No new
       keys were added.

       Some modules had choices for how to modify a value, usually between a method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference ("_rf").

       Again, methods outperformed.

   Adding hash elements
       I tested adding 10, 100 and 1000 elements to an empty hash.

       Some modules had choices for how to append a value, usually between a method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference ("_rf").

       For "Tie::LLHash", I did not use the "lazy" option, but did the equivalent using "tied" and a method call:

               tied(%tllh)->last( irand(), 42 ) for 1 .. $n;

       Generally, it seemed like the differences were smaller than for other benchmarks.  Methods still outperformed.

   Deleting hash elements
       I  tested  creating hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements and then deleting 10% of the keys, chosen randomly.  I would have liked to have isolated creation from deletion, but I couldn't figure out a
       way to do that given how "Benchmark" runs the same tests over and over.

       Some modules had choices for how to delete a value, usually between a method (denoted with "_oo"), tied hash access ("_th") or with a dereference ("_rf").

       The performance changes (or lack thereof) at the three different sizes reveals implementation differences.  (Though recall that some of this is the  creation  performance  difference  as  well  as
       deletion difference.)

       For example, "Tie::Hash::Indexed" XS does very well, which could be its good creation performance, but could also be good deletion.

       "Hash::Ordered" does linear search deleting a key for the 10 element hash, but automatically switches to indexed, tombstone deletion for the larger hashes.  When deleting only 10% of keys, garbage
       collection of tombstoned keys never occurs, so that amortized cost is not included.

       "Tie::LLHash" improves at larger sizes as deleting from a linked list is faster than splicing out an element of an array.  Conversely, "Array::AsHash" just gets worse.

   Extracting the hash as a list
       I tested getting an ordered list of pairs from hashes of 10, 100 and 1000 elements.  The hash was created beforehand so the benchmarks reflect only conversion to a list.

       Oddly, modules that usually have more than one way to do things don't for this.  Even "Tie::IxHash" doesn't really have an OO way to do it, so I did it longhand:

               @list = map { $_ => $tix_oo->FETCH($_) } $tix_oo->Keys;

       Because "Array::AsHash" keeps its internal representation as an ordered list of pairs, it outperforms the rest handily as it merely needs to dereference that data structure.

CONCLUSION
       With  the  exception  of hash creation and element deletion, "Hash::Ordered" generally outperformed the other ordered hash implementations.  Even for creation, it was the fastest of the pure-Perl,
       hash-based implementations, often by a large margin.

       In the original release of "Hash::Ordered", deletion got worse as the hash size grew.  The new JIT indexing with tombstones now makes deletion far faster than any pure-Perl implementation.

       "Array::AsHash", with the opposite internal implementation compared to "Hash::Ordered", performs best at creation and listing pairs, but is dead last at element access and modification.  I believe
       the poor performance is mostly due to extra indirection (e.g. an extra function call) and logic in the element access methods.  For uses that don't require much element access  and  have  lots  of
       creation/serialization, it could still be a useful choice.

       Generally,  every  module  that  depends  on  "tie"  for some portion of its implementation pays a substantial performance penalty.  Comparing "Hash::Ordered" benchmarks with and without "tie" for
       individual element operations shows how severe this penalty can be.  "Tie::Hash::Indexed" — likely because of its XS implementation — performs decently, but  not  well  enough  in  my  opinion  to
       justify its use.

       As the author of "Hash::Ordered", I'm clearly biased, but I think these benchmarks make a very good case for it being the "go to" module for pure-Perl, general-purpose ordered hashes.
