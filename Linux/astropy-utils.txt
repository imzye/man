NAME
       fitscheck - script to detect and fix FITS standards violations

SYNOPSIS
       fitscheck [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       fitscheck  is  a command line script based on pyfits for verifying and updating the CHECKSUM and DATASUM keywords of FITS files.  itscheck can also detect and often fix other FITS standards viola‐
       tions. fitscheck facilitates re-writing the non-standard checksums originally generated by pyfits with standard checksums which will interoperate with cfitsio.

       fitscheck will refuse to write new checksums if the checksum keywords are missing or their values are bad.  Use --force to write new checksums regardless of whether or not they currently exist  or
       pass.  Use --ignore-missing to tolerate missing checksum keywords without comment.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display terse usage information (help).

       -k [standard | nonstandard | either | none], --checksum=[standard | nonstandard | either | none]
              Choose FITS checksum mode or none. Defaults to standard.

       -w, --write
              Write out file checksums and/or FITS compliance fixes.

       -f, --force
              Do file update even if original checksum was bad.

       -c, --compliance
              Do FITS compliance checking, fix if possible.

       -i, --ignore-missing
              Ignore missing checksums.

       -v, --verbose
              Generate extra output.

EXAMPLES
       % fitscheck --checksum either --write *.fits
       Verify and update checksums, tolerating non-standard checksums, updating to standard checksum.

       % fitscheck --write --force *.fits
       Write new checksums, even if existing checksums are bad or missing.

       % fitscheck --compliance *.fits
       Verify standard checksums and FITS compliance without changing the files.

       % fitscheck --checksum nonstandard *.fits
       Verify original nonstandard checksums only.

       % fitscheck --checksum none --compliance --write *.fits
       Only check and fix compliance problems,  ignoring checksums.

       % fitscheck *.fits
       Verify standard interoperable checksums.

       % fitscheck --checksum none --write *.fits
       Delete checksum keywords.
