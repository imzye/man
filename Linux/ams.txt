NAME
       ams - A software synthesizer modeled after modular patching synthesizers

SYNOPSIS
       ams [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The  AlsaModularSynth (AMS) is a software synthesizer designed after the great analog modular synths of the 1960s. It employs virtual control voltages (VC) for each module's parameter control, us‐
       ing the the Moog synthesizer's 1V/oct logarithmic control scale for its oscillator and filter functions.

       Following the modular synth model AMS supplies the user with a variety of sound-producing and sound-processing software modules such as digital oscillators, filters, amplifiers, and  DSP  effects.
       These  modules  are  linked  together (patched) to create complex audio synthesis networks. These network patches can be played in realtime via MIDI or internal control structures, and they may be
       saved and reloaded at will.
