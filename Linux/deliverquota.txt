NAME
       deliverquota - deliver to a maildir with a quota

SYNOPSIS
       deliverquota [-c] [-w percent] [-W filename] {maildir} {quota}

DESCRIPTION
       deliverquota delivers mail to a maildir taking into account any software-imposed quota on the maildir. This manually-enforced quota mechanism is described in the maildirquota(7)[1] and
       maildirmake(1)[2] manual pages. Instead of setting up your mail server to deliver the message directly to a maildir, configure the mail server to run the deliverquota program in order to deliver the
       message, and specify the location of the maildir as the argument to deliverquota.

       The second argument to deliverquota is optional. If present, quota specifies a new quota setting for this maildir. Specifying quota is equivalent to running maildirmake(1)[2] with the -q option. The
       second argument to deliverquota is considered obsolete, and may be removed in the future.

       deliverquota reads the message from standard input and delivers it to maildir.  maildir may specify a path directly to a maildir folder, not the main maildir (as long as the folder was created by the
       maildirmake(1)[2] command.

       The -c option automatically creates the maildir, and all missing parent subdirectories (as 'mkdir -p'). This option should be used with caution.

       The -w N option places a warning message into the maildir if the maildir has a quota setting, and after the message was successfully delivered the maildir was at least N percent full. The warning
       message is copied from the file specified by the -W option, or from /etc/quotawarnmsg if -W was not specified. The "Date:" and "Message-Id:" headers are added to the message. The warning is repeated
       every 24 hours (at least), until the maildir drops below N percent full.

RETURN CODE
       deliverquota delivers the message to the maildir and terminates with exit code 0 if the message can be delivered without going over quota.

       If the maildir is over its specified quota, deliverquota terminates with exit code 77 (EX_NOPERM).
