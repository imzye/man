NAME
       aconnectgui — FLTK based frontend for aconnect

SYNOPSIS
       aconnectgui

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the aconnectgui     commands. It was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       aconnectgui is a FLTK based frontend for aconnect.  It is written directly on top of the alsamixer source, leaving the original source intact, only adding a couple of ifdefs, and some calls to the
       gui part, so it provides exactly the same functionality, but with a graphical user interface.

OPTIONS
       Options given are ignored. Everything that aconnect has options for is done via the GUI.

SEE ALSO
       aconnect(1), aseqnet(1), aseqview(1).
