NAME
       flood_router26

SYNOPSIS
       flood_router26 [-HFD] [-sSG] [-RPA] interface [target]

       Flood the local network with router advertisements.  Each packet contains ~25 prefix and route enries

Modes
         default  sends both routing entries and prefix information
         -R       does only send routing entries, no prefix information
         -P       does only send prefix information, no routing entries
         -A       an attack to disable privacy extensions

OPTIONS
         -a       add a hopbyhop header with router alert
         -H       add a hopbyhop header to bypass RA guard security
         -f       add an atomic fragment header to bypass RA guard security
         -D       add a large destination header to bypass RA guard security
         -F       perform full RA guard evasion (disallows all other bypass options)
         -s       use small lifetimes, resulting in a more devasting impact
         -S       performs a slow start, which can increases the impact
         -G       gigantic packet of 64kb of prefix/route entries
