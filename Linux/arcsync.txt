NAME
       arcsync - ARC Synchronize

DESCRIPTION
       The arcsync command synchronizes your local jobs list with the information at a given cluster or index server.

SYNOPSIS
       arcsync [options]

OPTIONS
       -c, --cluster=name
              select one or more computing elements: name can be an alias for a single CE, a group of CEs or a URL

       -g, --index=name
              select one or more registries: name can be an alias for a single registry, a group of registries or a URL

       -j, --joblist=filename
              the file storing information about active jobs (default ~/.arc/jobs.xml)

       -f, --force
              don't ask for verification

       -T, --truncate
              shrinks the joblist before synchronizing

       -C, --convert
              instead of pulling jobs information from server read it from jobs storage and write it back. This option is mostly for converting format of jobs storage file.

       -P, --listplugins
              list the available plugins

       -t, --timeout=seconds
              timeout in seconds (default 20)

       -z, --conffile=filename
              configuration file (default ~/.arc/client.conf)

       -d, --debug=debuglevel
              FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE or DEBUG

       -v, --version
              print version information

       -?, --help
              print help

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The  ARC  user interface keeps a local list of active jobs in the users home directory (see arcsub(1)). If this file is lost, or the user wants to recreate the file on a different computer,the arcsync
       command can be used to recreate the file from the information available the specified cluster or index server.

       Since the information about a job retrieved from a cluster can be slightly out of date if the user very recently submitted or removed a job a warning is issued when this command is  run.  The  --force
       option disables this warning.

       The --cluster options can be used to select or reject clusters that should be considered in the synchronization. This options can be repeated several times.  See arcsub(1) for a discussion of the for‐
       mat of arguments to this option.

       If the joblist is not empty when invoking synchronization the old jobs will be merged with the new jobs, unless the --truncate option is given, in which case the joblist will first be cleaned  of  old
       jobs and then the new jobs will be added.

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

       ~/.arc/jobs.xml
              This  is  a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This
              list is used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the --all option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the --joblist option a different file can  be
              used than the default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       X509_USER_PROXY
              The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard location.

       ARC_LOCATION
              The  location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not specified the install location will be determined from the path to the command being executed, and if this fails a
              WARNING will be given stating the location which will be used.

       ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
              The location of ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The default location is  $ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc  (\  in
              Windows).
