NAME
       dinifti - converts DICOM files into the NIfTI format

SYNOPSIS
       dinifti [options] <DICOM input> <NIfTI output>

DESCRIPTION
       dinifti  converts  a  single or several files at once into the NIfTI data format.  The DICOM input can be specified as a single filename, a list of file or a directory. In case of a directory
       all files in this directory will be converted.

       Images belonging to the same recording series will be appropriately merged into a single 3d or 4d NIfTI file.  To achieve this dinifti gathers the number of time points and number  of  slices
       per  volume  from  the DICOM header. When this is impossible, dinifti will issue a warning (i.e. when it can find only 1 slice per volume and 1 time point). The user has the option of running
       the program using the -s option and specifying the number of slices per volume.

       A number of items are retrieved from the Siemens Shadow set. Following is a list of items and default value if this is not Siemens.

              Number of groups: 1

              Number of channels: 1

              Sagital, Coronal and Transverse position: From DICOM (0020,0032)

OPTIONS
       -g     NIfTI files will be compressed.

       -f [a2|n2|n1]
              Set the output file format.  If set to a2 ANALYZE 7.5 file pairs (hdr/img) will be generates.  Setting n2 will cause dinifti to generate NIfTI image file  pairs.   The  default  output
              format (n1) are single NIfTI files (header and image data combined in one file).

       -d     If set dinifti appends the series description from the DICOM header to the output file name(s).

              If two image series share a common description dinifti will append as many  characters as necessary to the second series description to create a unique filename. In this case a warning
              message is displayed that shows the old and the modified filename.

       --name="<format>"
              Format output file name(s) according to <format> string, which has to be enclosed in quotes (")

              The  format  is  interpreted in the usual printf-like way. Ordinary characters are directly copied, a percent sign is represented by %%, otherwise % indicates a conversion. The special
              character "/" is translated to "~" to avoid confusion with the directory separator.

              If --name is present, -d flag will be ignored.

              %I Subject ID

              %N Subject name

              %S Relative series number

              %D Series description

              %Y Series date (YYYYMMDD)

              %T Series time (HHMM)

              %A Accession number

              %C Image comments

              Example: --name="%Y:%T- %A - %I -%D(%S)"

       -s #   This option can be used to specify the number of slices in the volume, if dinifti fails to autodetect the correct value.

       -v, --verbose
              Enables verbose status messages. If any warning message occurs, this option can be helpful to determine which imageseries caused it.

       -n, --noact
              If set, dinifti performs all processing steps, but does not write NIfTI files at the end. This can be useful to quickly inspect the content of a DICOM directory (if ran  together  with
              --verbose).

       -h, --help
              Print this help page and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number and exit.
