NAME
       Devel::Confess::Builtin - Enable built in stack traces on exception objects

SYNOPSIS
         use Devel::Confess::Builtin;
         use Exception::Class 'MyException';

         MyException->throw; # includes stack trace

DESCRIPTION
       Many existing exception module can provide stack traces, but this is often not the default setting.  This module will force as many modules as possible to include stack traces by default.  It can
       be loaded before or after the exception modules, and it will still function.

       For supported modules, it will also prevent Devel::Confess from attaching its own stack traces.

SUPPORTED MODULES
       •   Exception::Class

       •   Ouch

       •   Class::Throwable

       •   Exception::Base

CAVEATS
       This module relies partly on the internal implementation of the modules it effects.  Future updates to the modules could break or be broken by this module.
