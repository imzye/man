NAME
     iscsi-target — service remote iSCSI requests

SYNOPSIS
     iscsi-target [-46DV] [-b block length] [-f configuration file] [-p port number] [-s maximum number of sessions] [-t target name] [-v verbose arg]

DESCRIPTION
     iscsi-target is the server for iSCSI requests from iSCSI initiators.  iscsi-target listens for discovery and login requests on the required port, and responds to those requests appropriately.

     Options and operands available for iscsi-target:

     -4      iscsi-target will listen for IPv4 connections, and respond back using IPv4.  This is the default address family.

     -6      iscsi-target will listen for IPv6 connections, and respond back using IPv6.

     -b blocksize
             Specify the underlying block size for iSCSI storage which will be served.  The possible sizes are: 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096 bytes, with the default being 512 bytes.

     -D      When this option is specified, iscsi-target will not detach itself from the controlling tty, and will not become a daemon.  This can be useful for debugging purposes.

     -f configfile
             Use the named file as the configuration file.  The default file can be found in /etc/iscsi/targets.  See targets(5) for more information.

     -p port number
             Use the port number provided as the argument as the port on which to listen for iSCSI service requests from initiators.

     -s maximum number of sessions
             Allow the maximum number of sessions to be initiated when connecting to the target.

     -t filename
             The target name (as it appears to the iSCSI initiator) can be specified using this flag.

     -V      iscsi-target will print the utility name and version number, and the address for bug reports, and then exit.

     -v argument
             The amount of information shown can be varied by using this command.  Possible values of argument are net to show network-related information, iscsi to show iSCSI protocol-related information,
             scsi to show SCSI protocol information, and all to show information from all of the above arguments.

FILES
     /etc/iscsi/targets         the list of exported storage
     /var/run/iscsi-target.pid  the PID of the currently running iscsi-target
