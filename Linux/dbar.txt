NAME
       dbar - ASCII progresbar

SYNOPSIS
         echo <percentage> | dbar [options] <indicator text>

DESCRIPTION
       dbar lets you define static 0% and 100% marks or you can define these marks dynamically at runtime.  Static and dynamic marks can be mixed, in this case the value specified at runtime will have a
       higher priority.

       You can specify ranges of numbers, negative, positive or ranges with a negative min value and positive max value.

       All numbers are treated as double precision floating point, i.e. the input is NOT limited to integers.

OPTIONS
       -l  Label to be prepended to the bar (default: "" ).

       -nonl
           no new line, don't put '\n' at the end of the bar (default: do print "\n")

       -max
           Value to be considered 100% (default: 100).

       -min
           Value to be considered 0% (default: 0).

       -s  Symbol represeting the percentage value in the meter (default: "=").

       -w  Number of charcaters to be considered 100% in the meter (default: 25)

EXAMPLES
       Static 100% mark or single value input:

           echo 25 | dbar -max 100 -l text

           Output: text  25% [======                   ]

       If your 100% mark changes dynamically or 2-values input:

           echo "50 150" | dbar
                 |   |
                 |   |__ max value
                 |
                 |__ value to display

           Output: 33% [========                 ]

       If your value range is not between [0, maxval] or 3-values input:

           echo "50 -25 150" | dbar
                 |   |  |
                 |   |  |__ max value 100% mark
                 |   |
                 |   |_____ min value 0% mark
                 |
                 |________ value to display

           Output: 43% [===========              ]

       Multiple runs:

           for i in 2 20 50 75 80; do echo $i; sleep 1; done | dbar | dzen2

           Output: Find out yourself.
