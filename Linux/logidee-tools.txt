NAME
       setup-logidee-tools - setup a directory to support a tree of XML documents

SYNOPSIS
       setup-logidee-tools [options] directories...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the setup-logidee-tools command.

       setup-logidee-tools  is  a  program that installs the necessary symlink and files in the current directory so that the directory is ready to accept XML files
       that can be used with the logidee-tools (which uses Makefiles to control the generation of those documents).

       The directories specified on the command line will be setup with the Makefile so that you can generate documents in them. If you don't specify  them  on  the
       command line, you will be prompted for them.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -r rootdir
              Use  rootdir  as  the  root  directory  of  the  logidee-tools  tree.  This  option  is  useful  if you have put the logidee-tools somewhere else than
              /usr/share/logidee-tools.
