DESCRIPTION
        pilot-read-palmpix  allows a Kodak PalmPix camera user to extract the images from their Palm handheld and convert them to Portable Network Graphic (.png) or Portable Pixmap (.ppm) files on their sys‐
       tem. The default output type is Portable Pixmap (.ppm).

        pilot-read-palmpix converts all pictures in the files given, or if no files are given, on a Palm handheld, to Portable Pixmap files.

OPTIONS
   pilot-read-palmpix options
                               -b,
                               --bias bias

       lighten or darken the image (0..49 darken, 51..100 lighten)

                               -c, --colour

       Do a simple colour correction. The colour correction code makes a histogram from the image. Using the histogram it then makes up a couple of colour tables to try and balance the colours. It also clips
       the top and bottom colours to produce better perceived contrast.

                               -l, --list

       List picture information found on the Palm handheld instead of converting the entries found to image files.

                               -n, --name
                               <pixname>

       Convert only pixname to STDOUT, and output as type: .ppm or .png.

                               -s, --stretch

       Do a histogram stretch on the colour planes

                               -t,
                               --type [ppm|png]

       Specify the output picture type. Can be either "png" or "ppm".

   Conduit Options
                               -p, --port port

       Use  device  file  <port> to communicate with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-read-palmpix will look for the  $PILOTPORT  environment variable. If neither are found or supplied, pi‐
       lot-read-palmpix will print the usage information.

                               -q,
                               --quiet

       Suppress 'Hit HotSync button' message

                               -v, --version

       Display version of pilot-read-palmpix and exit without connecting.

   Help Options
                               -h, --help

       Display the help synopsis for pilot-read-palmpix and exit without connecting.

                               --usage

       Display a brief usage message and exit without connecting.

USAGE
       If a filelist is not given, connects to the target Palm handheld, and reads the images found in the Kodak PalmPix image database (ArchImage.pdb), and allows the user to view the list of images and im‐
       age details, or to select one or all of them, and convert them to Portable Network Graphic (.png) or Portable Pixmap (.ppm) files to be viewed or printed at the desktop.

       If no options are specified, all of the images on the device will be converted to ppm files by default.

       If a filelist is given, convert all listed files previously fetched via pilot-xfer. See BUGS - a single file argument is ignored, a list will work.

AUTHOR
        pilot-read-palmpix  was originally written by Angus Ainslie <angusa at deltatee.com > ,and updated by John Marshall <jmarshall@acm.org> to include core pilot-link functionality.

BUGS
   Known Bugs
        pilot-read-palmpix's  colour  correction is nearly as good as Kodak's own, but Kodak has deprecated the PalmPix device, so it is not likely that there will be any updates to their software in the fu‐
       ture, so this may be as good as it gets. A simple method to improve the look of colours is to do a histogram equalization in your favourite image editor.

        pilot-read-palmpix command DOES read from a file, but only if you specify a LIST of files. If only one file is given, the command tries reading from $PILOTPORT.

   Reporting Bugs
       We have an online bug tracker. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed. Reporting bugs via email, while  easy,  is
       not very useful in terms of accountability. Please point your browser to http://bugs.pilot-link.org: http://bugs.pilot-link.org and report your bugs and issues there.
