NAME
       cdebootstrap - Bootstrap a Debian system

SYNOPSIS
       cdebootstrap [OPTION]... [ORIGIN/]CODENAME TARGET [MIRROR]

DESCRIPTION
       cdebootstrap  builds  a basic Debian system of CODENAME (e.g. jessie, stretch, sid) from ORIGIN (e.g Debian, Ubuntu) into TARGET using the source specified in MIRROR.  It supports http://, ftp://,
       file:// and ssh:// URL and defaults to http://ftp.debian.org/debian.  The ssh:// scheme uses cat on the remote host to access the files.  You have to setup a master connection and configure ssh to
       use it or use a key for authentication. No user interaction is possible.  The complete log is saved as /var/log/bootstrap.log in the new system.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --allow-unauthenticated
              Ignore if packages can't be authenticated.  This ignores the unavailability of Release.gpg, missing keyrings, broken signatures and missing gpgv executable.

       -a, --arch=ARCH
              Set the target architecture.

       -c, --configdir=CONFIGDIR
              Set the config directory.

       --debug
              Enable debug output.

       -d, --download-only
              Download packages, but don't perform installation.

       --exclude=A,B,C
              Drop packages from the installation list.  This only works if the package is pulled in explicitely, either via priority or explicit definition in the  config.   It  won't  exclude  packages
              which are pulled in via dependencies.

       --foreign
              Enable support for non-native arch (needs qemu-user-static).

       -f, --flavour=FLAVOUR
              Select the flavour to use (see FLAVOURS below).

       -k, --keyring=KEYRING
              Use given keyring.  Relative filename are looked up in /usr/local/share/keyrings, /usr/share/keyrings and CONFIGDIR.

       -H, --helperdir=DIR
              Set the helper directory.

       --include=A,B,C
              Install extra packages.

       -q, --quiet
              Be quiet.  Only warnings and errors are shown.

       --suite-config

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.  All command output is shown.

       -h, --help
              Display this help and exit.

       --version
              Output version information and exit.
