NAME
       scantool - ODB-II vehicle diagnostic scanner

SYNOPSIS
       scantool

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the scantool program.

       scantool  is  a  program  that communicates with an ODB-II serial device that converts CAN-bus to RS-232. Since the application was originally written for DOS, the internal configuration refers to
       COM1, COM2, etc.  As a work-around under Linux, selecting COM1 will attempt to open /dev/ttyUSB0 then /dev/ttyS0, and COM2 will attempt /dev/ttyUSB1 then /dev/ttyS1, etc. When connecting to a  ve‐
       hicle ODB-II system, the correct baud rate will need to be manually selected via trial-and-error.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options; all settings are configured within the GUI.
