NAME
       compose-write-repo-file - write .repo file pointing to a compose

SYNOPSIS
       compose-write-repo-file [OPTIONS...]  COMPOSE_PATH

DESCRIPTION
       compose-write-repo-file  loads  metadata  from  a compose and creates a
       YUM/DNF configuration file with entries for repositories  in  the  com‐
       pose.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       --arch=ARCH
              Use  URLs with this hardcoded architecture. By default $basearch
              is used.

       --include-debuginfo
              Create entries for debuginfo repositories.

       --include-source
              Create entries for source repositories.

       --variant=VARIANT
              Create entries only for listed variants. Can  be  used  multiple
              times. Variants that do not include repositories are skipped au‐
              tomatically.

       --disabled=VARIANT
              Make entries for this variant disabled. By default all reposito‐
              ries are created as enabled.

       --output=FILE_PATH
              Write output to this file instead of to stdout.

       --translate=PATH_PREFIX,URL_PREFIX
              By  default  local filepaths are created. With this option it is
              possible to generate URLs. The path prefix will be stripped from
              path, and replaced with URL prefix.

       --name-pattern=PATTERN
              Customize  name for the repositories. These fragments are avail‐
              able:

              - release_id, release_short, release_name, release_version,  re‐
              lease_type, release_major_version
              -  base_product_short,  base_product_name, base_product_version,
              base_product_type (these are only available for layered  product
              composes)
              - compose_id, compose_type, compose_date, compose_respin, label
              - variant (should always be used unless a single variant is pro‐
              cessed)
              - arch (only makes sense if --arch is used)

              The default is {release_short}-{release_version}-{variant}

EXIT CODE
       Exit code is always 0 on success and non-zero if there  was  a  problem
       loading the compose.
