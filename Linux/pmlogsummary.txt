NAME
       pmlogsummary - calculate averages of metrics stored in a set of PCP ar‐
       chives

SYNOPSIS
       pmlogsummary [-abfFHiIlmMNsvVxyz?]  [-B nbins] [-n pmnsfile] [-p preci‐
       sion]  [-S  starttime]  [-T  endtime] [-Z timezone] archive [metricname
       ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pmlogsummary prints statistical information about  metrics  of  numeric
       type  contained within the files of a set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
       archive logs.  The default output prints time averages for both counter
       and  non-counter metrics.  The set of archive logs is identified by ar‐
       chive, which is a comma-separated list of names, each of which  may  be
       the  base  name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one
       or more archives.  The archive logs are typically created using  pmlog‐
       ger(1).

       The metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments.  If met‐
       ricname is a non-leaf  node  in  the  Performance  Metrics  Name  Space
       (PMNS(5)),  then  pmlogsummary  will  recursively  descend the PMNS and
       report on all leaf nodes.  If no metricname argument is given, the root
       of the namespace is used.

       Metrics  with  counter  semantics  are  converted to rates before being
       evaluated.

OPTIONS
       The available command line options are:

       -a, --all
            Print all information.  This is equivalent to -blmMy.

       -b   Print both forms of averaging, that is both  stochastic  and  time
            averaging.

       -B nbins, --bins=nbins
            Print the approximate distribution of values, using histogram bins
            such that the value range (minimum - maximum) for each  metric  is
            divided equally into nbins bins, and each bin accumulates the fre‐
            quency of observed values in the corresponding  range.   Refer  to
            the  ``OUTPUT  FORMAT'' section below for a description of how the
            distribution of values is reported).

       -f   Spreadsheet format - the tab character is  used  to  delimit  each
            field printed.  This option is intended to allow pmlogsummary out‐
            put to be imported directly into common spreadsheet applications.

       -F   Spreadsheet format - the comma character is used to  delimit  each
            field printed.  This option is intended to allow pmlogsummary out‐
            put to be imported directly into common  spreadsheet  applications
            which support the Comma Separated Value (.csv) format.

       -H, --header
            Print  a one-line header at the start showing what each field rep‐
            resents.

       -i, --mintime
            Also print the time at which the minimum value  was  logged.   The
            format  of  this  timestamp  is described in the ``OUTPUT FORMAT''
            section below.

       -I, --maxtime
            Also print the time at which the maximum value  was  logged.   The
            format  of  this  timestamp  is described in the ``OUTPUT FORMAT''
            section below.

       -l, --label
            Also print the archive label, showing the log format version,  the
            time  and  date  for the start and end of the archive time window,
            and the host from which the performance metrics values  were  col‐
            lected.

       -m, --minimum
            Also print the minimum logged value for each metric.

       -M, --maximum
            Also print the maximum logged value for each metric.

       -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
            Load  an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5)) from
            the file pmnsfile.

       -N   Suppress any warnings resulting from  individual  archive  fetches
            (default).

       -p precision, --precision=precision
            Print  all  floating point numbers with precision digits after the
            decimal place.

       -s, --sum
            Print (only) the sum of all logged values for each metric.

       -S starttime, --start=starttime
            Set the starttime of the time window.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for  a
            complete description of the syntax for starttime.

       -T endtime, --finish=endtime
            Set  the  endtime  of the time window.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
            complete description of the syntax for endtime.

       -v, --verbose
            Report (verbosely) on warnings resulting from  individual  archive
            fetches.

       -V, --version
            Display version number and exit.

       -x   Print stochastic averages instead of the default (time averages).

       -y, --samples
            Also  print  the  number  of samples encountered in the set of ar‐
            chives for each metric.

       -z, --hostzone
            Change the timezone to the local timezone at the host that is  the
            source  of  the  performance  metrics,  as  specified in the label
            record of the archive log.

       -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
            By default, pmlogsummary reports the time of day according to  the
            local  timezone  on  the system where pmlogsummary is run.  Change
            the timezone to timezone in the format of the environment variable
            TZ as described in environ(7).

       -?, --help
            Display usage message and exit.

OUTPUT FORMAT
       The pmlogsummary output format is spartan as it is intended to be post-
       processed with standard tools.  This means that there is no  annotation
       associated  with  each output field which would make processing harder.
       The intention is that pmlogsummary output be  massaged  into  a  format
       which  can  be used by a spreadsheet program, is suitable for inclusion
       in a web page, or whatever.

       For each metric, pmlogsummary produces a single output line as follows:

          metricname  value(s) units

       For metrics with multiple  instances,  pmlogsummary  produces  multiple
       lines of output as follows:

          metricname ["instance 1"] value(s) units
          metricname ["instance 2"] value(s) units
          metricname ["instance N"] value(s) units

       The printed value(s) for each metric always follow this order: stochas‐
       tic average, time average, minimum, minimum timestamp, maximum, maximum
       timestamp,  count,  [bin  1 range], bin 1 count, ... [bin nbins range],
       bin nbins count.  The individual values for each metric are space-sepa‐
       rated (unless the -f option is used).

       All  counter  metrics  which are measured in units of time will be con‐
       verted to seconds before being rate converted and used in the pmlogsum‐
       mary  calculations.   The  values calculated for these metrics are also
       printed in seconds.

       The units will be displayed in the format described by pmUnitsStr(3).

       Given either of the -i or -I options, pmlogsummary produces two differ‐
       ent  timestamp formats, depending on the interval over which it is run.
       For an interval greater than 24 hours, the date is displayed  in  addi‐
       tion  to  the  time at which the maxima and/or minima occurred.  If the
       extent of the data being checked is less than 24 hours, a more  precise
       format is used (time is displayed with millisecond precision, but with‐
       out the date).

NOTES
       The average for an individual metric is calculated as follows:

       Non-counter metrics are averaged  using  stochastic  averaging  -  each
       observation has an equal weighting towards the calculation of the aver‐
       age (the sum of all values divided by the total number of  values,  for
       each metric).

       Counter metrics are averaged using time averaging (by default), but the
       -x option can be used to specify that counters be  averaged  using  the
       stochastic method instead.  When calculating a time average, the sum of
       the product of each sample value  multiplied  by  the  time  difference
       between  each sample, is divided by the total time over which that met‐
       ric was logged.

       Counter metrics whose measurements do not span 90% of the  set  of  ar‐
       chives  will  be  printed  with the metric name prefixed by an asterisk
       (*).
