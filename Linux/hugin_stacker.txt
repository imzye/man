NAME
       hugin_stacker - stack overlapping images to a single image

SYNOPSIS
       hugin_stacker [options] --mode=STRING images

DESCRIPTION
       hugin_stacker acts on a stack of overlapping images and produces a combined image and/or a set of masked output images.

       hugin_stacker is useful for e.g.

       •   automatic tourist removal (not only tourists, also other moving objects ;-))

       •   noise reduction

       •   visualize movement

       •   multiplicity

OPTIONS
       --mode
           Select stack mode:

           min|minimum|darkest
               Select the darkest pixel.

           max|maximum|brightest
               Select the brightest pixel.

           avg|average|mean
               Calculate the mean for each position.

           median
               Calculate the median for each position.

           winsor
               Calculate the Winsor trimmed mean for each position.  The parameter can be set with --winsor-trim=NUMBER (default: 0.2).

           sigma
               Calculate the sigma clipped mean for each position.  Fine-tune with --max-sigma=NUMBER (default: 2) and --max-iterations=NUMBER (default: 5).

   Further parameters
       --output=FILE
           Set the filename for the output file (if not given final.tif is used).

       --compression=value
           Set the compression of the output files.  For jpeg files use values between 0 and 100.  For tiff files valid values are: PACKBITS, DEFLATE, LZW.

       --bigtiff
           Write output in BigTIFF format (only with TIFF output).

   Mask input images
       --mask-input
           Beside the stacked output hugin_stacker can also mask the input images (available only for stacking modes median|winsor|clip). This mode is activated with --mask-input. In this case the stacked
           image is first calculated. Then each pixel in each image is checked: if the value of this pixel differs more then mask sigma * standard deviation from the mean/median, this pixel is made visible.
           If it is in the mentioned range the pixel is masked out.

       --mask-sigma=NUMBER
           sets the sigma parameter for --mask-input. Default is 2.

       --mask-suffix=STRING
           Output a separate mask image for each input image named inputfilenameSTRING.  Default value is "_mask".

       --multi-layer-output
           Output a layered TIFF with the name specified with --output. The file contains the averaged image as layer 0 and all input images as additional layers with the mask as described above.
