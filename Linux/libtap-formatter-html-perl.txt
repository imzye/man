App::Prove::Plugin::HTML(3pm)                                                       User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                       App::Prove::Plugin::HTML(3pm)

NAME
       App::Prove::Plugin::HTML - a prove plugin for HTML output

SYNOPSIS
        # command-line usage:
        prove -m -P HTML=outfile:out.html,css_uri:style.css,js_uri:foo.js,force_inline_css:0

        # NOTE: this is currently in alpha, this usage will likely change!

DESCRIPTION
       This is a quick & dirty second attempt at making TAP::Formatter::HTML easier to use from the command line.  It will change once App::Prove has better support for plugins than need to take cmdline
       data.

       The original goal was to be able to specify all the args on the cmdline, ala:

         prove --html=output.html --css-uri foo.css --css-uri bar.css --force-inline-css 0

       But this is currently not possible with the way the App::Prove plugin system works.

       As a compromise, you must use the following syntax:

         prove -P HTML=arg1:val1,arg2:val2,...

       Where argN is any TAP::Formatter::HTML parameter that is configurable via %ENV.

   Example
         prove -P HTML=outfile:out.html,css_uri:style.css,js_uri:foo.js,force_inline_css:0

       This will cause prove to load this plugin, which loads TAP::Formatter::HTML for you, and sets formatter to "TAP::Formatter::HTML" to save you some typing.

       To configure TAP::Formatter::HTML, the following %ENV vars are set:

         TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_OUTFILE=out.html
         TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_FORCE_INLINE_CSS=0
         TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_CSS_URIS=style.css
         TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_JS_URIS=func.js

       Yes, you can pass 2 or more css_uri or js_uri args.

   %ENV vars?!
       Briefly, App::Prove currently only lets you specify the "formatter_class" for TAP::Harness, it doesn't let you instantiate a formatter, or pass config to the formatter.

       Yes, I know %ENV vars are a horrible way to do things.  If it bugs you too, then join the TAP::Harness devs and help us fix it ;-).
