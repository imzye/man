NAME
       split2po - Creates a po file from two DocBook XML files

SYNOPSIS
       split2po {Original-XMLTranslated-XML}

DESCRIPTION
       split2po is a command-line tool that takes the two given DocBook XML files and produces a gettext message file (PO-file) that represents the changes between them. The resulting PO-file is sent to
       standard output.

       translated-XML must be the result of translating original-XML into another language. It is this translation that the resulting PO-file will represent.

       This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
