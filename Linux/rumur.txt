NAME
       murphi2uclid - translate a Murphi model to Uclid5

SYNOPSIS
       murphi2uclid [--output FILE | -o FILE] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The utility murphi2uclid is bundled with the model checker Rumur and can be used to translate a Murphi model into a Uclid5 model. See rumur(1) for more information about Rumur or Murphi.

OPTIONS
       --help or -?
              Display usage information.

       --module NAME or -m NAME
              Set the name to use for the generated Uclid5 module. If you do not supply this, it defaults to main.

       --numeric-type TYPER or -n TYPE
              Set the Uclid5 type used for ranges, scalarsets and numeric literals. This can be either integer or a bit-vector type, for example, bv8. If this option is omitted, either integer or bv64 is
              chosen automatically based on the content of the input model.

       --output FILE or -o FILE
              Set the path to write the output Uclid5 model to. If this argument is omitted, output is written to standard out.

       --quiet or -q
              Silence warning diagnostics.

       --verbose or -v
              Report extra debugging information.

       --version
              Display version information and exit.

NOTES
       Translation  to  Uclid5  is imprecise in the case where there is no direct Uclid5 equivalent for a Murphi concept. For example, an undefine statement in Murphi has no equivalent in Uclid5. This is
       translated to a havoc statement. Obviously this is not exactly equivalent. However the hope is that in real world models this achieves a similar effect. Namely, any read of an  undefined  variable
       results  in  the verifier exploring unintended behavior. To get reasonable utility out of translation of a model using undefine, you will likely need an assertion-heavy model. Or, put another way,
       defensive programming is advised.

LIMITATIONS
       The following Murphi concepts have no translation to Uclid5 and are rejected by murphi2uclid:

              • Aliases, in the form of declarations statements or rules

              • The isundefined operator

              • The modulo operator, %

              • The left and shift shift operators, << and >>

              • Early return statements, with or without an expression

              • Cover properties

              • Liveness properties inside rulesets

              • Cover and liveness statements

              • A clear statement with a value of complex type as its argument

              • Step sizes other than 1 in exists or forall expressions

       Function calls within expressions are translated as if they were calls to uninterpreted functions. Uclid5 does not support calling interpreted functions (procedures, in  Uclid5  terminology)  this
       way. The desirable mapping (uninterpreted function vs rephrasing the call site) cannot be determined automatically. So it is left to the user to tweak or post-process the output, as it will not be
       accepted by Uclid5 as-is.
