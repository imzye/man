NAME
       rmcpping - send RMCP Ping to network hosts

SYNOPSIS
       rmcpping [OPTION...] destination

DESCRIPTION
       rmcpping uses the RMCP Ping request datagram to elicit an RMCP Pong response from a remote host. The utility can be used to verify if a remote host supports RMCP or IPMI. The initial starting sequence
       number will be randomized.  rmcpping will return 0 to the environment if it receives atleast 1 response from the remote host. Otherwise, it exits with a value of 1.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available

       -h     Output help menu.

       -V     Output version.

       -c count
              Stop after sending count packets.

       -i interval
              Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. The default is to wait for one second between each packet.

       -I interface address
              Set source address to specified interface address. Argument may be numeric IP address or name of device.

       -t timeout
              Time to wait for a response, in seconds. Default is five seconds.

       -v     Verbose output.

       -s num Specify an initial starting sequence number. The default is to use a random initial sequence number.

       -d     Turn on debugging.

KNOWN ISSUES
       It has been observed that some remote BMCs can get "confused" and delay packet responses if duplicate packets (with duplicate sequence numbers) are sent in succession very quickly. There is  no  known
       way to cleanly deal with a "confused" BMC other than the wait awhile.

       Unlike ping(8), local network devices (e.g. 127.0.0.1) cannot be "pinged".
