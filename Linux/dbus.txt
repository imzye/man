NAME
       dbus - expose the mixer features of connected FFADO devices through DBus

SYNOPSIS
       ffado-dbus-server [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       ffado-dbus-server  exposes  the  mixer  and control features of connected FFADO devices though a DBUS interface.  The extent of support for controls on a given device depends entirely on the status of
       that device's FFADO driver.

       By using DBus it is possible for control applications to be developed independently of FFADO.  The DBus interface provided by ffado-dbus-server is used by ffado-mixer but there is no reason other  im‐
       plementations could not be written.
