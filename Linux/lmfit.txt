NAME
       lmfit - Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization

DESCRIPTION
       lmfit is a C library for Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization and curve fitting. It is mature code, based on decades-old algorithms from the FORTRAN library MINPACK.

       For fitting a data set {(x_i,y_i)|i=0,1,..} by a parametric curve f(x,t), see lmcurve(3).

       For generic minimization of the Eucledian norm of parametric vector, see lmmin2(3).

       For the simpler legacy API without error estimates, see lmmin(3).

       For an example how to use lmmin, see the source files lmcurve.h and lmcurve.c. Do not patch these files; copy and modify them to create your own, differently named version of lmcurve_data_struct,
       lmcurve_evaluate, and lmcurve.
