NAME
       winegcc - Wine C and C++ MinGW Compatible Compiler

SYNOPSIS
       winegcc [options] infile...

DESCRIPTION
       winegcc  is  a  gcc  wrapper which tries to provide a MinGW compatible compiler under Linux. This is most useful to Win32 developers who can simply take their MinGW code from Windows, and recompile it
       without modifications under Winelib on Linux.  wineg++ accepts mostly the same options as winegcc.

       The goal of winegcc is to be able to simply replace gcc/g++/windres with winegcc/wineg++/wrc in a MinGW Makefile, and just recompile the application using Winelib under Wine. While typically there are
       small adjustments that must be made to the application source code and/or Makefile, it is quite easy to do them in a fashion that is compatible between the MinGW and Wine environments.

       This manual will document only the differences from gcc; please consult the gcc manual for more information on those options.

OPTIONS
       gcc options: All gcc options are supported, and are passed along to the backend compiler.

       -b,--target target
              Specify the target architecture triplet for cross-compiling. winegcc will then invoke target-gcc instead of gcc.

       --wine-objdir dir
              Specify the Wine object directory. This is used when building Wine itself, to use the includes and libraries from inside the build tree.

       --winebuild name
              Specifies  the path and name of the winebuild binary that will be launched automatically by winegcc.  If not set, winegcc will look for a file named winebuild in the path. This takes precedence
              over the WINEBUILD environment variable.

       -fno-short-wchar
              Override the underlying type for wchar_t to be the default for the target, instead of using short unsigned int, which is the default for Win32.

       -mconsole
              This option passes '--subsystem console' to winebuild, to build console applications. It is the default.

       -mno-cygwin
              Use Wine implementation of MSVCRT, instead of linking against the host system libc. This is necessary for the vast majority of Win32 applications, as they typically depend on  various  features
              of  MSVCRT.  This  switch is also used by the MinGW compiler to link against MSVCRT on Windows, instead of linking against Cygwin libc. Sharing the syntax with MinGW makes it very easy to write
              Makefiles that work under Wine, MinGW+MSYS, or MinGW+Cygwin.

       -municode
              Set the default entry point of the application to be the Unicode wmain() instead of the standard main().

       -mwindows
              This option adds -lgdi32, -lcomdlg32, and -lshell32 to the list of default libraries, and passes '--subsystem windows' to winebuild to build graphical applications.

       -munix Set when building the Unix counterpart of a builtin module.

       -nodefaultlibs
              Do not use the standard system libraries when linking. These include at a minimum -lkernel32, -luser32, -ladvapi32, and any default libraries used by the backend compiler. The -mwindows  option
              augments the list of default libraries as described above.

       -nostartfiles
              Do not add the winecrt0 library when linking.

       -Wb,option
              Pass an option to winebuild.  If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

       -Wl,--out-implib,lib.a
              When linking a dll, also create its corresponding import library.

ENVIRONMENT
       WINEBUILD
              Specifies the path and name of the winebuild binary that will be launched automatically by winegcc.  If not set, winegcc will look for a file named winebuild in the path.

DEFINES
       winegcc defines __WINE__, for code that needs to know when it is being compiled under Wine. It also defines WIN32, _WIN32, __WIN32, __WIN32__, __WINNT, and __WINNT__ for compatibility with MinGW.

BUGS
       The dllimport/dllexport attributes are not supported at the moment, due to lack of support for these features in the ELF version of gcc.

       Static linking is not currently supported against Wine DLLs. As a result, the -static, --static, and -Wl,-static options will generate an error.

       Bugs can be reported on the Wine bug tracker ⟨https://bugs.winehq.org⟩.
