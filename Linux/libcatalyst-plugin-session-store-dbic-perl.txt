NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::DBIC::Delegate - Delegates between the session and flash rows

DESCRIPTION
       This class delegates between two rows in your sessions table for a given session (session and flash).  This is done for compatibility with Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::DBI.

METHODS
   session
       Return the session row for this delegate.

   flash
       Return the flash row for this delegate.

   _load_row
       Load the specified session or flash row from the database. This is a wrapper around "find_or_create" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet to add support for transactions.

   expires
       Return the expires row for this delegate.  As with Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::DBI, this maps to the "session" row.

   flush
       Update the session and flash data in the backend store.

   _clear_instance_data
       Remove any references held by the delegate.
