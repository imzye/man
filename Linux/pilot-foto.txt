DESCRIPTION
       This is a palm conduit to fetch, install, or remove, Foto files from a Palm. It can also convert *.jpg.pdb files that have already been fetched from the Palm to jpeg files.

       Delete all, or named fotos from handheld.

       Install one, or many jpeg images to handheld.

       List all jpeg files and thumbnails on handheld.

       Fetch all jpeg files, or certain ones by name.

       Tries to detect if a file really is a jpeg and refuses to install it, if it is not.

       pilot-foto allows you to do multiple operations in one sync. For instance, delete test.jpg and install test.jpg.

EXAMPLES
                   Examples:
                   pilot-foto -p /dev/pilot -f pilot-foto -d MyImage.jpg
                   pilot-foto -i MyImage.jpg
                   pilot-foto -i *.jpg
                   pilot-foto -f MyImage
                   pilot-foto -c MyImage.jpg.pdb

PROBLEMS
       Palm has not published their database format for the thumbnails. So, pilot-foto puts a generic penguin thumbnail for every image uploaded. Fotos can be accessed by a named list on the handheld as well
       as the thumbnails. This has been tried on a couple of handhelds. It is possible that a foreign palm or different model will not like it.

       To get a thumbnail image you can copy the jpegs to the memory card. If you copy them back to the handheld they will have a new thumbnail that matches the jpeg.

BUGS
       If a jpeg is installed with the same name as one already on the palm you will have 2 thumbnails pointing to the same jpeg. The new jpeg will overwrite the old jpeg.

       If the thumbnail fails to install then the jpeg should be removed. It is not.

       We  have  an online bug tracker. Using this is the only way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track them until they are resolved or closed. Reporting bugs via email, while easy, is
       not very useful in terms of accountability. Please point your browser to http://bugs.pilot-link.org: http://bugs.pilot-link.org and report your bugs and issues there.
