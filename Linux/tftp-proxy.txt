NAME
       tftp-proxy - TFTP server that request files not found from an HTTP backend

SYNOPSIS
           tftp-proxy -url=http://example.com -dir=/var/lib/tftpboot

DESCRIPTION
       This program is a simple TFTP server that additionally requests a file not found locally from a configured HTTP backend.

OPTIONS
       -dir=<directory>
           The directory to serve files from. Default: /var/lib/tftpboot

       -url=<address>
           The address of the HTTP server to connect to. Mandatory.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The http_proxy environment variable is respected when fetching files from the HTTP server. This might come handy as tftp-proxy does not write any files.
