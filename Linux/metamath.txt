NAME
       metamath - Formal proof verifier and proof assistant

SYNOPSIS
       metamath [ commands | file ]

DESCRIPTION
       metamath  is  a  formal  proof verifier and proof assistant for the Metamath language.  It can be initialized via a series of commands or with a data base file, which can then be explored interac‐
       tively.

       For details about the Metamath language and the command-line interface, type help into the command prompt, or read the Metamath book [1], which should have been installed along with the package.

LANGUAGE
       A Metamath database consists of a sequence of three kinds of tokens separated by white space (which is any sequence of one or more white space characters). The set of keyword tokens is ${, $}, $c,
       $v, $f, $e, $d, $a, $p, $., $=, $(, $), $[, and $].  The latter four are called auxiliary or preprocessing keywords. A label token consists of any combination of letters, digits, and  the  charac‐
       ters hyphen, underscore, and period.  The label of an assertion is used to refer to it in a proof.  A math symbol token may consist of any combination of the 93 printable ascii(7) characters other
       than $.  All tokens are case-sensitive.

       $( comment $)
              Comments are ignored.

       $[ file $]
              Include the contents of a file.

       ${ statements $}
              Scoped block of statements. A math symbol becomes active when declared and stays active until the end of the block in which it is declared.

       $v symbols $.
              Declare symbols as variables. A variable may not be declared a second time while it is active, but it may be declared again (as a variable, but not as a constant) after it becomes inactive.

       $c symbols $.
              Declare symbols as constants. A constant must be declared in the outermost block and may not be declared a second time.

       label $f constant variable $.
              Variable-type  hypothesis  to specify the nature or type of a variable (such as `let x be an integer.'). A variable must have its type specified in a $f statement before it may be used in a
              $e, $a, or $p statement. There may not be two active $f statements containing the same variable.

       label $e constant symbols $.
              Logical hypothesis, expressing a logical truth (such as `assume x is prime') that must be established in order for an assertion requiring it to also be true.

       $d variables $.
              Disjoint variable restriction. For distinct active variables, it forbids the substitution of one variable with another.

       label $a constant symbols $.
              Axiomatic assertion.

       label $p constant symbols $= proof $.
              Provable assertion. The proof is a sequence of statement labels.  This label sequence serves as a set of instructions that the Metamath program uses to construct a series of math symbol se‐
              quences. The construction must ultimately result in the math symbol sequence contained between the $p and $= keywords of the $p statement. For details, see section 4.3 in [1].   Proofs  are
              most easily written using the interactive prompt in metamath.

FILES
       /usr/share/metamath
              Data base files for several formal theories.
