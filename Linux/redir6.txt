NAME
       redir6

SYNOPSIS
       redir6 interface victim-ip target-ip original-router new-router [new-router-mac] [hop-limit]

       Implant a route into victim-ip, which redirects all traffic to target-ip to new-ip. You must know the router which would handle the route.  If the new-router-mac does not exist, this results in a DOS.
       If the TTL of the target is not 64, then specify this is the last option.
