DBIx::Connector::Driver::MariaDB(3pm)                                               User Contributed Perl Documentation                                               DBIx::Connector::Driver::MariaDB(3pm)

NAME
       DBIx::Connector::Driver::MariaDB - MariaDB-specific connection interface

DESCRIPTION
       This subclass of DBIx::Connector::Driver::mysql modifies the connection attributes as follows:

       "mariadb_auto_reconnect"
           Will always be set to false. This is to prevent MariaDB's auto-reconnection feature from interfering with DBIx::Connector's auto-reconnection functionality in "fixup" mode.
