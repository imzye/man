NAME
       rt-assets-import - import assets to rt

SYNOPSIS
           rt-assets-import /path/to/assets.csv
           rt-assets-import --update /path/to/assets.csv

DESCRIPTION
       This script will import/update assets from a CSV into rt.  See RT::Extension::Assets::Import::CSV for configuration.

OPTIONS
       "--config" file or "-c" file
           Provides  an explicit extra configuration file which is loaded before any other configuration files.  This is useful to provide per-import "AssetsImportUniqueCF" and "AssetsImportFieldMapping"
           settings if you are importing from multiple sources with differing columns.  If this option is used, RT_SiteConfig.pm should not contain a setting for "AssetsImportFieldMapping"  --  otherwise
           the two hashes will be merged, which will produce unexpected behavior.

       "--update"
           Without  this option, existing assets (as determined by matching "AssetsImportUniqueCF" values) are left untouched.  With this option provided, records will be updated based on their values in
           the CSV.

       "--insert"
           By default, assets without a "AssetsImportUniqueCF" values will produce a warning; with this flag, they will be inserted (generating their own id as needed) after all other operations.

       "--mdy", "--dmy"
           Force RT to parse dates as "mm/dd/yy" or "dd/mm/yy", respectively.  In the absence of this option, RT will default to the "DateDayBeforeMonth" setting, which defaults to "dd/mm/yy".

       dry-run
           If this option is provided, the script will only read the CSV and perform sanity checks, but will not import or update any assets.

       "--debug"
           Provide verbose output to STDERR during the import.
