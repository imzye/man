NAME
       netPanzer - an online multiplayer tactical warfare game

SYNTAX
       netpanzer [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is a free (GPL) isometric view real-time tactical game designed for play across the Internet and over LAN systems. One on one games are  possible via direct connect or modem.

       netPanzer  is  designed  for  FAST  ACTION combat -- it is not another resource management clone. In fact, there aren't any resources at all. Each player will have many units of different types at
       their disposal. Players can fight until their units are destroyed -- then respawn and keep on going.

       The game is real-time, but it's based on quick tactical action and unit management. Battles progress quickly and constantly; in fact, they never let up. There is no  stop  in  the  action  because
       there is no waiting for resources to be collected and converted into weaponry. Players can join or leave  multiplayer games at any time.
