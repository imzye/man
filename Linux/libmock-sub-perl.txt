NAME
       Mock::Sub::Child - Provides for Mock::Sub

METHODS
       Please refer to the "Mock::Sub" parent module for full documentation. The descriptions here are just a briefing.

   new
       This method can only be called by the parent "Mock::Sub" module.

   called
       Returns bool whether the mocked sub has been called yet.

   called_count
       Returns an integer representing the number of times the mocked sub has been called.

   called_with
       Returns a list of arguments the mocked sub was called with.

   mock
       This method should only be called by the parent mock object. You shouldn't be calling this.

   remock
       Re-mocks an unmocked sub back to the same subroutine it was originally mocked with.

   mocked_state
       Returns bool whether the sub the object represents is currently mocked or not.

   name
       Returns the name of the sub this object is mocking.

   return_value
       Send in any values (list or scalar) that you want the mocked sub to return when called.

   side_effect
       Send in a code reference with any actions you want the mocked sub to perform after it's been called.

   reset
       Resets all state of the object back to default (does not unmock the sub).

   unmock
       Restores original functionality of the mocked sub, and calls "reset()" on the object.
