DESCRIPTION
       Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal: To become the greatest civilization.

       Players of Civilization II® by Microprose® should feel at home, since one aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

       Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!

       This is the server program used to establish a Freeciv server - see also freeciv-client(6) .

       This  manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details of the directives necessary to configure freeciv-server see the Server Manual which can be found at the Freeciv website as well
       as the documentation which is part of the Freeciv distribution.

OPTIONS
       The following options are accepted on the command line of the server. They may not be combined; that is, "freeciv-server -fp savegame.sav 5557" will not work,  instead  you  would  need  to  enter
       "freeciv-server -f savegame.sav -p 5557". Most options have a short form (single hyphen and single letter) and a long form (double hyphen and a complete word); their effects are identical.

       -A protocol, --Announce protocol
              Uses protocol when announcing game in LAN.  Possible values for protocol are:

              IPv4

              IPv6

              none

       -a, --auth
              Enables server authentication and allows access to registered players only.  Requires the --Database option to be specified.

       -b address, --bind address
              Sets the address on which the server will listen for clients.

       -B address, --Bind-meta address
              Sets the address which request to metaserver are sent from. Defaults to address given by -b option.

       -d level, --debug level
              Sets the amount of debugging information to be logged in the file named by the -l option. Acceptable values for the level are:

              fatal     for fatal messages only.

              error     for fatal and error messages.

              warning   for fatal, error and warning messages

              normal    for fatal, error, warning and normal messages (default).

              verbose   for fatal, error, warning, normal, and verbose messages.

       -D filename, --Database filename
              Specifies a database configuration file for authentication. This file specifies the details of the database. See README.fcdb in the Freeciv distribution for details of its format.

       -e, --exit-on-end
              When a game ends, exit instead of restarting.

       -F [ signal_number ], --Fatal [ signal_number ]
              Raise a custom signal on failed assertion.  If signal_number is not specified, then the ABRT signal will be used.

       -f filename, --file filename
              Loads  a  saved game (filename) into the server before initialization, instead of starting a new game. This is for reloading saved games, or for loading scenarios. See ENVIRONMENT for where
              the server looks for these files.

              The distribution comes with several scenarios, typically stored in /usr/local/share/freeciv/scenarios, for example:

              • british-isles-85x80-v2.80.sav

              • earth-160x90-v2.sav

              • earth-80x50-v3.sav

              • europe-200x100-v2.sav

              • hagworld-120x60-v1.2.sav

              • iberian-peninsula-136x100-v1.0.sav

       -G, --Guests
              Allow guests to login as 'guest' when authentication is enabled.

       -h, --help
              Prints out a description of the command line options and exits.

       -i address, --identity address
              Reports the address to the metaserver.  Then, the metaserver will use this address to redirect the users.

       -L module, --LoadAI module
              Loads AI module. This option can appear multiple times to load different modules.

       -l filename, --log filename
              Defines a log file, filename, to be produced during processing. Use the -d option to set how much is logged.  By default, fatal, error, warning, and normal messages are printed to  standard
              output.  With a log file, such messages go to the log instead.  If filename already exists, it is appended to.

       -M address, --Metaserver address
              Specifies the address of the metaserver to send your server's information to. By default, the standard metaserver run by the Freeciv maintainers will be used.

       -m, --meta
              Directs  the server to communicate with a metaserver, a place where Freeciv servers can publish their presence. Freeciv clients consult the metaserver to offer users a selection of games to
              join. By default the standard Freeciv metaserver is used. You may specify an alternate metaserver with the -M option.

       -k, --keep
              Usually freeciv server stops sending updates to the metaserver, when there's problems on the connection once. With this option it keeps on trying to send further updates even after  it  has
              failed to send updated status once.  This option implies -m option.

       -N, --Newusers
              Allow new users to login and be registered in the players base if authentication is enabled.

       -p port, --port port
              Specifies the TCP port number to which clients will connect; players must know this number to be able to connect if they are not to use the default of 5556 decimal. You may need to use this
              if 5556 is not available for your use on your system, or if you would like to run multiple servers on the same system.

       -q time, --quitidle time
              Quits if no players are present for the specified time, in seconds, and restarts a new server.

       -R filename, --Ranklog filename
              Defines a log file, filename, to be produced during processing. This log contains information for player ranking.

       -r filename, --read filename
              Specifies  a  file,  filename, of server commands which the server will automatically read and process, as if you had typed them in at the server's prompt. The distribution comes with a few
              examples, including files that set options to be similar to Civilization I® and Civilization II® . The files are  named  civ1.serv  and  civ2.serv,  and  are  typically  found  at  /usr/lo‐
              cal/share/freeciv/.

       -S id, --Serverid id
              Sets the server id. This is used to identify a particular running game.

       -s directory, --saves directory
              Specifies  the  directory to place save game files created by the server.  This is especially useful when you're running more than one server on the same system, as it inhibits your servers
              from clobbering other's save game files.

              (This does not influence where the server looks when loading save game files; see FREECIV_SAVE_PATH for that.)

       --scenarios directory
              Specifies the directory to place scenarios saved by the server (for instance, those created with the in-game editor).

              (This does not influence where the server looks when loading scenario files; see FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH for that.)

       -v, --version
              Causes the server to display its version number and exit.

EXAMPLES
       freeciv-server --file oldgame.sav --port 2244
              Starts a server on port 2244, loading the save game file oldgame.sav.

       freeciv-server -R ranklog -l logfile -r script -f oldgame.sav.gz -p 2244
              Starts a server on port 2244, loading the save game file oldgame.sav.gz. Ranking related events are written to ranklog, other logging information is written  to  logfile.  When  the  server
              starts, it immediately executes the commands contained in script.

       freeciv-server -m -a -D fc_auth.conf -q 60 -p 2244 -d normal -l logfile -r script -s ~/saves
              Starts  a  server  on port 2244 with authentication enabled and communicates its existence to the standard Freeciv metaserver. Fatal, error, warning, and normal messages are written to log‐
              file. When the server starts it immediately executes the commands contained in script. Save game files are stored in the ~/saves directory. When there are no users on the server for 60 sec‐
              onds, the server will restart.

COMMANDS
       You may enter commands into the server at any time, either before or during the running of a game.

       Type "help" or "help help" for starters.

FILES
       The Freeciv server requires the following files in the Freeciv data directory, which is /usr/local/share/freeciv by default:

       • civ2civ3/buildings.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/cities.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/effects.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/game.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/governments.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/nations.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/styles.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/techs.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/terrain.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/units.ruleset

       • civ2civ3/script.lua

       • default/default.lua

       • default/nationlist.ruleset

       These are the default rule sets used for the game. Alternate sets of rules can be used by placing them in a separate directory and using the rulesetdir command to change your server's ruleset  di‐
       rectory.

       Type help rulesetdir for more information.

ENVIRONMENT
       The Freeciv server accepts these environment variables:

       FREECIV_CAPS
              A string containing a list of "capabilities" provided by the server. The compiled-in default should be correct for most purposes, but if you are familiar with the capability facility in the
              source you may use it to enforce some constraints between clients and server.

       FREECIV_COMPRESSION_LEVEL
              Sets the compression level for network traffic.

       FREECIV_DATA_ENCODING
              Sets  the  character  encoding  used for data files, savegames, and network strings). This should not normally be changed from the default of UTF-8, since that is the format of the supplied
              rulesets and the standard network protocol.

       FREECIV_INTERNAL_ENCODING
              Sets the character encoding used internally by freeciv-server; this encoding should not be visible at any interface. Defaults to UTF-8.

       FREECIV_LOCAL_ENCODING
              Sets the local character encoding (used for the command line and terminal output). The default is inferred from other aspects of the environment.

       FREECIV_MULTICAST_GROUP
              Sets the multicast group (for the LAN tab).

       FREECIV_DATA_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories pointing to the freeciv data directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following directories, in order, for any data files: the  current  directory;
              the  "data"  subdirectory of the current directory; the subdirectory ".freeciv/3.2" in the user's home directory; and the directory where the files are placed by running "make install".  If
              not set, FREECIV_SAVE_PATH A colon separated list of directories pointing to the freeciv save directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following directories, in order, for  save  files:
              the current directory; and the subdirectory ".freeciv/saves" in the user's home directory.

              (This does not affect where the server creates save game files; see the --saves option for that.)

       FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH
              A  colon  separated list of directories pointing to the freeciv scenario directories. By default Freeciv looks in the following directories, in order, for scenario files: the current direc‐
              tory; the "data/scenarios" subdirectory of the current directory; the subdirectories ".freeciv/3.2/scenarios" and then ".freeciv/scenarios" in the user's home directory; and  the  directory
              where the files are placed by running "make install".

              (This does not affect where the server creates scenario files; see the --scenarios option for that.)

       HOME   Specifies the user's home directory.

       http_proxy
              Set this variable accordingly when using a proxy.

       LANG  or  LANGUAGE
              Sets the language and locale on some platforms.

       LC_ALL  or  LC_CTYPE
              Similar to LANG (see documentation for your system).

       USER   Specifies the username of the current user.
