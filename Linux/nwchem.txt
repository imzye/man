NAME
       nwchem - high-performance computational chemistry software

SYNOPSIS
       nwchem input_file

DESCRIPTION
       nwchem provides many methods for computing the properties of molecular and periodic systems using standard quantum mechanical descriptions of the electronic wavefunction or density. Its clas‐
       sical  molecular dynamics capabilities provide for the simulation of macromolecules and solutions, including the computation of free energies using a variety of force fields. These approaches
       may be combined to perform mixed quantum-mechanics and molecular-mechanics simulations.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options to use.
