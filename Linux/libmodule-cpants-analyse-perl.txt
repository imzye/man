NAME
       Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee::FindModules - Find modules provided by a dist

SYNOPSIS
       Finds and reports all modules (i.e. *.pm files) in a distribution.

DESCRIPTION
   Methods
       order

       Defines the order in which Kwalitee tests should be run.

       Returns 30, as data generated by "MCK::FindModules" is used by other tests.

       analyse

       "MCK::FindModules" first looks in "basedir" and lib/ for "*.pm" files. If it doesn't find any, it looks in the whole dist, but the "proper_libs" kwalitee point is only awarded if the modules are
       lib/ or there's only one module in "basedir".

       kwalitee_indicators

       Returns the Kwalitee Indicators data structure.

       •   proper_libs
