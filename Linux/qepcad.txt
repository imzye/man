NAME
       CAD2D - A Program for producing CADs of R^2 Decomposition

SYNOPSIS
       cad2d [-h|-v] [-noecho] [-t <num> ] [+N <numcells> ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  CAD2D program is a minor modification of QEPCAD for quantifier-free formulas in 2 variables. It is able to do some lifting steps completely with validated floating-point arithmetic, which can
       lead to much reduced overall time for 2-dimensional CAD computation. Particularly, if you're interested in plotting a 2-dimensional CAD, this is a better choice than QEPCAD.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help information

       -v     Print version string

       -noecho
              Turns off echoing of input

       -t <num>
              Sets a timeout of <num> seconds.

       +N<numcells>
              Sets garbage collected space to <numcells>.  Default is 2000000.  Maximum allowable is 1073741822 (Because "Word" is 32 bits).

       +h     Prints Saclib help message.
