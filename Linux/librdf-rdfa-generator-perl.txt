NAME
       RDF::RDFa::Generator::HTML::Pretty::Note - a note about something

DESCRIPTION
       Often you'll want to create your own subclass of this as the basic notes are pretty limited (plain text only).

   Constructor
       "$note = RDF::RDFa::Generator::HTML::Pretty::Note->new($subject, $text)"
           $subject is an RDF::Trine::Node (though probably not a Literal!) indicating the subject of the note. $text is the plain text content of the note.

   Public Methods
       "$note->is_relevant_to($node)"
           $node is an RDF::Trine::Node or Attean IRI or blank. Checks if the subject of $note is $node.

           Alias: is_relevent_to.

       "$note->node($namespace, $tagname)"
           Gets an XML::LibXML::Element representing the note. $namespace and $tagname are used to create the new element. If an unexpected namespace or tagname is supplied, may die.

           Expected namespace is 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'. Expected tagname is any XHTML tag that can contain text nodes.
