NAME
       pvmgetarch - print PVM architecture string

SYNOPSIS
       pvmgetarch

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pvmgetarch command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       pvmgetarch  prints  the  architecture specific string used internally by PVM.  This may be used to identify which subdirectory of ~/pvm3/bin to place architecture specific binaries in.  aimk also uses
       this string.
