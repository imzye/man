NAME
       lcdvc - LCDproc virtual console

SYNOPSIS
       lcdvc [-fh] [-a addr] [-c file] [-p port] [-r level] [-s bool]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  shows content from a system console on a LCD controlled by LCDd. As the console is usually larger than a LCD, the area shown on the LCD screen can be scrolled using keys attached to the
       display.

       Additionally it has an autoscroll feature, which is on by default and can only be disabled by using lcdvc's menu.

       By default it uses /dev/vcs and /dev/vcsa devices as the console to show. Other console devices can be set in the configuration file /etc/lcdproc/lcdvc.conf. The keys used for scrolling can be set  in
       the config file as well.

OPTIONS
       The following options can be set in the configuration file /etc/lcdproc/lcdvc.conf as well, but those given on the command line take precedence:

       -a addr
              DNS name or IP address of the LCDd server (default localhost).

       -c file
              Specify configuration file.

       -f     Run in foreground.

       -h     Output help and exit.

       -p port
              Port of the LCDd server (default 13666).

       -r level
              Set reporting level (0-5, default: 2)

       -s bool
              Report to syslog (1) or stderr (0, default).

FILES
       /etc/lcdproc/lcdvc.conf
