       wmcoincoin - stupid dockapp to browse DaCode sites news and board

       wmcoincoin-kde - KDE-enabled version of wmcoincoin

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmcoincoin command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       To have a synopsis of the command line options, you can type wmcoincoin -h.

       At the first launch, wmcoincoin creates a sample .wmcoincoin/options file, which is self-documented.
