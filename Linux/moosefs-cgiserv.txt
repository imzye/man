              port to listen on (default: 9425)

       -R ROOT_PATH
              local path to use as HTTP document root (default is CGIDIR set up at configure time)

       -D DATA_PATH
              working directory (default: /var/lib/mfs)

       -f     run in foreground, don't daemonize

       -v     log requests on stderr

       -t LOCKTIMEOUT
              how long to wait for lockfile (in seconds; default is 60 seconds)
