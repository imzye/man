NAME
       Seyon - X11 Telecommunications Package.

SYNOPSIS
       seyon [-option ...] [-toolkit_option ...] [-- -emulator_option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Seyon is a complete full-featured telecommunications package for the X Window System. Some of its features are:

              * Dialing directory that supports an unlimited number of entries. The directory is fully mouse-driven and features call progress monitoring, dial timeout, automatic redial, multi-number di‐
              aling, and circular redial queue. Each item in the dialing directory can be configured with its own baud rate, bit mask, and script file.  The dialing directory uses a plain-text phone book
              that can be edited from withen Seyon. Seyon also supports manual dialing.

              *  Terminal  emulation  window  supporting  DEC  VT02, Tektronix 4014, and ANSI. Seyon delegates its terminal emulation to xterm, so all the familiar xterm functions such as the scroll-back
              buffer, cut-and-paste utility, and visual bell are availabe through Seyon's terminal emulation window. Using xterm also means that Seyon has a more complete emulation of  VT102  than  other
              any  Unix or DOS telecommunications program. Other terminal emulation programs can also be used with Seyon to suit the user's need; for example, color xterm can be used to provide emulation
              for color ANSI (popular on many BBS systems), and xvt can be used if memory is a bit tight.

              * Script language to automate tedious tasks such as logging into remote hosts. Seyon's script interpreter uses plain-text files and has a syntax similar to that of sh, with a few extra  ad‐
              dtions.  It supports many familiar statements such as conditional branching by if-else and looping by goto. Scripts may be assigned to items in the dialing directory for automatic execution
              after a connection is made.

              * Unlimited number of slots for external file transfer protocols.  Protocols are activated from a mouse-driven transfer console that uses a plain-text file, editable from withen Seyon,  for
              protocol  configuration.  Seyon  prompts  the user for filenames only if the chosen protocol requires filenames or if the transfer operation is an upload, for which Seyon also accepts wild‐
              cards. Multiple download directories can be specified for the different transfer slots.

              * Support for Zmodem auto-download. Seyon detects incoming Zmodem signature and automatically activates a user-specified zmodem protocol to receive incoming files. Zmodem transfers can thus
              be completely automatic and require no user intervention.

              * Translation modes. Seyon can perfrom useful trasnlations on the user's input. From example, Seyon can translate backspace to delete (useful on may Unix systems), newline to  carriage  re‐
              turn  (useful  on  many BBS hosts), and my favorite, meta key tranlation: to send keys pressed while the meta (ALT) key is held down as an escape (ESC) followed by the key press. The latter
              mode simulates the meta key on hosts that do not support 8-bit-clean connections and makes possible the use of the meta key in programs like Emacs on such hosts.

              * Other features: interactive setting of program parameters, on-line help, software (XONN/XOFF) and hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control, session capture to a file, and temporary  running  of  a
              local shell in the terminal emulation window.

       Seyon is intended to be both simple and extensively configurable.  Almost every aspect of Seyon can be configured via the resources to suit the user's taste.

OPTIONS
       Besides the toolkit options, Seyon recognizes the following command-line switches:

       -modems <device-list>
              Overrides the resource modems. Refer to the description of that resource below.  Unlike the resource, however, the list here has to be quoted if it consists of more than one entry.

       -emulator <terminal-emulation-program>
              Instructs  Seyon  to  use the specified program as the terminal emulator.  If Seyon fails to execute that program, it will fall back to xterm. If this option is not given, Seyon will try to
              use seyon-emu, which should be a link to your favorite terminal emulation program. Seyon will fall back to xterm in this case as well if it fails to execute seyon-emu.

       --     This switch instructs Seyon to pass the rest of the command-line to the terminal emulation program. All options following this switch will be passed blindly to  the  emulator.  This  switch
              cannot be combined with -noemulator.

       -nodefargs
              Seyon  usually  invokes the terminal emulation program with some options to set the application name and window and icon titles (those are -name Seyon -T "Seyon Terminal Emulator" -n Termi‐
              nal). If this switch is given, Seyon will not pass those options to the emulator.  This is to accommodate terminal emulation programs that use a different command-line syntax than xterm  --
              like xvt, cmdtool, shelltool, ..etc. You can use the '--' switch to pass your own options to the emulator.

       -noemulator
              This option is valid only if Seyon is invoked from withen a terminal emulation program in the foreground of an interactive shell session.  If given, Seyon will not launch a new terminal em‐
              ulator, but will use the existing one instead. You cannot use the '--' switch if this option is given.

       -script <script-file>
              Causes  Seyon to automatically executes the specified script after the startup script is run. The specified script file will be looked for according to the rule mentioned under the descrip‐
              tion of the resource scriptDirectory below.

       -entries <entries-list>
              Overrides the resource defaultPhoneEntries. Refer to the description of that resource below. Unlike the resource, however, the list here has to be quoted if it consists of more than one en‐
              try.

       -dial, -nodial
              Overrides the resource dialAutoStart and sets it to 'on' and If both -dial and -nodial are specified on the command-line, the override value will be set according to the last of the two  on
              the command-line.

RESOURCES
       Besides the toolkit resources, Seyon defines the following proprietry resources:

       autoZmodem (boolean)
              Specifies whether Seyon is to look for Zmodem auto-download signature.  If enabled, Seyon will detect incoming Zmodem signature and execute the action given by the resource autoZmodemAction
              (typically to start a local rz). Otherwise, Zmodem signature will be ignored.  Default value: on

       autoZmodemAction (string)
              Specifies  a  simple  or  compound action that will be executed when Zmodem auto-download signature is detected. This action will be executed only if the resource autoZmodem is enabled (see
              above). Refer to the section entitled SeQuickKeys for a description of available actions.  Default value: ShellCommand($rz);

       backspaceTranslation (boolean)
              Whether to translate user's backspace to delete. When the remote host is a Unix system, it's better to set this to on, since many Unix systems are not happy with backspace.  Default  value:
              off

       captureFile (string)
              The  name  of capture file. Seyon will write session captures to this file when capture is enabled. This file will be placed in Seyon's default directory. The capture file will not be over‐
              written by successive capture sessions. Seyon will merely apped new capture to its end.  Default value: capture

       connectString (string)
              The modem connect string. This the string response the modem gives when a connection is made after dialing.  Default value: CONNECT

       defaultBits (int)
              The default number of bits (character size). Seyon will set the number of bits to this value on startup and will use it for items in the dialing directory for which  no  such  parameter  is
              given. Valid values are 5, 6, 7, and 8.  Default value: 8

       defaultBPS (string)
              The default baud rate. Seyon will set the baud rate to this value on startup and will use it for items in the dialing directory for which no baud rate is given.  Default value: 9600

       defaultDirectory (string)
              Seyon's  default directory. When looking for its files, Seyon will first try this default directory, then the current directory. Seyon will also put the capture file in this directory.  De‐
              fault value: ~/.seyon

       defaultParity (int)
              The default parity. Seyon will set the parity to this value on startup and will use it for items in the dialing directory for which no such parameter is given. Valid values are 0  (no  par‐
              ity), 1 (odd parity), and 2 (even parity).  Default value: 0

       defaultPhoneEntries (int array)
              This  resource specifies a list of numbers corresponding to the order the entries in the dialing directory appear at. Seyon will highlight (select) those entries on startup and whenever you
              click ``Default'' from the dialing directory. This is useful if there is a set of entries that you most frequesntly dial that want to be highlghted automatically instead of doing that every
              time by hand. You can override this resource by the -entries command-line switch.  Unlike the command-line switch, however, the list here should not be quoted. Phonebook  entries  numbering
              starts at one.  No default value.

       defaultStopBits (int)
              The  default  number  of  stop bits. Seyon will set the number of stop bits to this value on startup and will use it for items in the dialing directory for which no such parameter is given.
              Valid values are 1 and 2.  Default value: 1

       dialAutoStart (boolean)
              This resource specifies that Seyon should start dialing the entries specified by the resource defaultPhoneEntries (or its override command-line switch) on startup. Seyon will commence dial‐
              ing those entries after executing the startup script and any script specified at the command line. A more convenient way of automatic dialing on startup is to use the override  command-line
              switch -dial, which overrides this resource and enables. If the resource is enabled, it can be disabled at the command line by the override switch -nodial. Refer to the description of these
              switches above.  Default value: off

       dialCancelString (string)
              The string Seyon sends to the modem to cancel dialing while in progress.  Default value: ^M

       dialDelay (int)
              How long in seconds Seyon should wait after no connection is made withen dialTimeOut before ciculating to the next number.  Default value: 10

       dialDirFormat (string)
              This  is  a format string that specifies the layout of the dialing direcotry. The default is '%-15s %-15s %6s %1c%1c%1c %1c%1c %s' (no quotes).  Briefly: the fields represent the host name,
              number, the baud rate, bits, parity, stop bits, whether there is a custom prefix, suffix, and the script name. You can understand more what each field refers to by  comparing  with  dialing
              directory, fields that use the current setting (via the keyword CURRENT) are designated by a question mark. Notice that you cannot change the order the items in the dialing directory appear
              at,  only the format. For example, if the numbers you call are all 7-digits, your host names are short, you never use baud rates above 9600, and you like dashes between the baud rate, bits,
              parity, and stop bits fields, then you may prefer to use the format string '%-10s %-8s %5s-%1c-%1c-%1c %1c%1c %s', which would be narrower than the default  format.   Default  value:  %-15s
              %-15s %6s %1c%1c%1c %1c%1c %s

       dialPrefix (string)
              The string Seyon sends to the modem before the phone number. To use pulse dialing, set this resource to .IR ATDP .  Default value: ATDT

       dialRepeat (int)
              How many times Seyon should try dialing a number. Seyon will give up on dialing a number if no connection is made after this many tries.  Default value: 5

       dialSuffix (string)
              The string Seyon sends to the modem after the phone number. This string has to contain a carraige return or the number will never get sent to the mode.  Default value: ^M

       dialTimeOut (int)
              How long in seconds Seyon should wait for a connection to made after dialing is complete. Seyon will cancel the dialing if no connection is made withen this period.  Default value: 45

       exitConfirm (boolean)
              Whether  Seyon should prompt for hanguping up before exiting. If off-line and the resource ignoreModemDCD is set to 'off', Seyon will not prompt for hanging up upon exiting even if this re‐
              source is set to Default value: on

       funMessages (string array)
              The fun messages to be displayed when Seyon has no other important information to show. This should be a list of double-quoted [funny] sentences.  Default value: varies, version-dependent

       funMessagesInterval (int)
              The temporal interval in seconds between successive fun messages.  Default value: 15

       idleGuard (boolean)
              If set to on, Seyon will send a string to the remote host whenever the terminal session is idle (no keyboard input) for a given amount of time. The  resources  idleGuardInterval  and  idle‐
              GuardString  specify the above time interval and the string to be sent to the remote host when idle. It is useful to enable this features to keep the session alive when one is away from the
              computer for a while (e.g.  to prevent auto-logout).  Default value: off

       idleGuardInterval (int)
              The amount of time in seconds Seyon is to consider the session idle when there is no keyboard activity at the terminal for that long.  Seyon will send a string to the remote host every such
              interval as long as the session is idle.  Default value: 300

       idleGuardString (string)
              The string to be sent to the remote host when the session is idle.  This string will be sent at a regular interval as long as the sesiion remains idle. Note that  the  current  translations
              will  be  used  in  sending  this string; for example, if backspaceTranslation is enabled, then the default string <Space><BS> will be sent as <Space><DEL>.  Default value: \s^H (space then
              backspace)

       ignoreModemDCD (boolean)
              If this resource is set to 'on', the modem DCD (Data Carrier Detect) status will be ignored. Some of the consequences of setting this to ´on´ is that Seyon will always prompt for hangup (if
              the resource exitConfirm is set to 'on') even if the modem DCD status indicates that it is off-line, and dialing will be attempted even if the modem DCD status indicates that it is on-line.
              It is highly recommended that you keep this set to 'off' unless your modem does not honor the DCD line. Consult your modem's manual for more details.  Default value: off

       hangupBeforeDial (boolean)
              When set to on, Seyon will hangup the line (if connected) before dialing the phone number. Otherwise, the number will be dialed without hanging up, and it is the  user's  responsibility  to
              ensure that the line is clear (no connection) when dialing.  Default value: on

       hangupConfirm (boolean)
              Whether Seyon should ask for confirmation before hanging up the phone Default value: on

       hangupViaDTR (boolean)
              When  enabled,  Seyon will hangup up the modem by dropping DTR. This is much quicker than hanging up by sending a Hayes-like hangup string to the modem and waiting to allow for escape guard
              time. However, some modems and serial drivers choke on dropping DTR and others just don't hangup when DTR is dropped, so in these cases it should  be  disabled.   If  disabled,  Seyon  will
              hangup the modem by sending the string specified by the resource modemAttentionString, followed by that specified by the resource modemHangupString.  Default value: off

       metaKeyTranslation (boolean)
              Whether to transmit keys pressed while the meta (ALT) key is held down as an escape (ESC) followed by the key press. Most hosts do not support 8-bit sessions, and hence do not recognize the
              meta key.  Therefore, this translation mode has to be enabled when connected to such hosts to take advantage of the meta key in programs that make use of it like Emacs.  Default value: on

       modemAttentionString (string)
              The  string to send to the modem to get its attention (switch to command mode). This string will be sent to the modem before the hangup string when hangupViaDTR is disabled.  Default value:
              +++

       modemHangupString (string)
              The hangup string to send to the modem when hangupViaDTR is disabled.  Default value: ATH^M

       modems (string)
              A list of modem devies to use. Seyon will try modems in this list one after the other until it finds an available modem or the list is exhausted.  No default value.

       modemStatusInterval (int)
              This resource controls the amount of time (in seconds) between updates to the modem status toggles (including the clock). The default is five seconds, but you can set it to one  second  (or
              any  other  number)  if  you  want the toggles to be updated more frequently. Even if you set this to a large number, Seyon is intellegent enough to update the toggles after each connect or
              hangup.  Default value: 5

       modemVMin (int)
              This resource specifies the minimum number of characters that should be in the buffer before the read process is satified. The read process will wait until that number of  incoming  charac‐
              ters  is  in  the  buffer or 0.1 second has elapsed between the receiption of two characters before displaying the data in the buffer. This results in the data being displayed in chunks and
              speeds up the terminal display. The speedup would be most noticeable on slow machnes with fast modems.

              Leave this resource at its default (1) or set it at a low value (6) if you have a slow modem (e.g. 2400bps). Otherwise you might set it to the maximum value, which is platform-dependent but
              generally 255. If you set it to any number greater than the maximum value, it will be truncated to the maximum value.  Default value: 1

       newlineTranslation (string)
              When the Enter key is pressed, newline character (\n) is generated.  This resource determines what to translate this character to. Three modes are possible: no translation  (newline),  car‐
              riage  return (\r), and carriage return / line feed. Unix systems usually expect newline or carrage return, DOS systems expect carraige return or carriage return / line feed. The three key‐
              words corresponding to the above modes are nl, cr, and cr/lf.  Default value: cr

       noConnectStringX [X = 1-4] (string)
              The response strings given by the modem when connection fails.  Default values: NO CARRIER, NO DIALTONE, BUSY, VOICE (respectively)

       phonelistFile (string)
              The name of the phone list (dialing directory) file. See the included example to learn how this file should be formatted.  Default value: phonelist

       postConnectAction (string)
              Specifies a simple or compound action that will be executed after a connection to a remote host is made. This action will be executed before running any script attached to that host in  the
              dialing directory. All actions here have to be synchronous. Refer to the section entitled SeQuickKeys below for a description of available actions.  Default value: Beep();

       protocolsFile (string)
              The  name of the protocols file. This file tells Seyon what file transfer protocols are available. The user will be promted with a list based on this file when file transfer is to be initi‐
              ated.  Default value: protocols

       quickKey?
              Refer to the section entitled SeQuickKeys below.

       rtsctsFlowControl (boolean)
              Whether Seyon should turn on RTS/CTS hardware flow control. Make sure the modem is set to use this as well.  Default value: off

       scriptDirectory (string)
              Seyon's script directory. When looking for scripts, Seyon will first try this script directory, then the current directory.  Default value: defaultDirectory

       showFunMessages (boolean)
              Whether to display funny messages when Seyon has no other important information to show. Seyon will display those messages at an interval specified by the funMessagesInterval resource  when
              there is no other important information to convey to the user. To disable the display of fun messages, this resource has be set to off.  Default value: on

       startupAction (string)
              Specifies a simple or compound action that will be executed on startup. This action is executed prior to running any script (in case the -script switch is given) or dialing any entry of the
              dialing  directory  (in  case the -dial switch is given or the resource dialAutoStart is enabled). You can make Seyon open the dialing directory automatically on startup by using the simple
              action ``OpenWidnow(Dial);'' as a constituent of this complex action stack.  Note that running the startup script is just a special case of this resource. Refer to the section entitled  Se‐
              QuickKeys for a description of available actions.  Default value: RunScript(startup);

       startupFile (string)
              Seyon's  startup  file.  Seyon will execute all commands in this file upon startup. This file can have any commands acceptable as script commands. The most useful command to put here is the
              set command, to set the various communications parameters.  Default value: startup

       stripHighBit (boolean)
              Whether to strip the high (eights) bit from incoming characters. If set to on, the high bit of all incoming characters will be stripped, which will make an 8-N-1 setting behave like  7-N-1,
              even though eight bits are used for each character.  Default value: off

       xonxoffFlowControl (boolean)
              Whether Seyon should turn on XON/XOFF software flow control.  Default value: off

SEQUICKKEYS
       Seyon  allows the user to have custom buttons, called SeQuickKeys (z quickies), to which actions can be attached. SeQuickKeys provide a convenient way via which the user can invoke frequently-used
       operations by a singe mouse click. SeQuickKeys are specified through the resources quickKeyX, where X is an integer corresponding to the order at which that SeQuickKey is to appear on the  command
       center.  Relevant subparts of that resource are visible, action, and label. Here is an example:

              Seyon*quickKey3.visible: on
              Seyon*quickKey3.action: FileTransfer(1,file); Beep();
              Seyon*quickKey3.label: Upload

       The  first line specifies that SeQuickKey3 should be visible. The second line specifies the action bound to the SeQuickKey (in this case, a compound action), and the third line specifies the label
       for that SeQuickKey's button. Other subparts can also be specified in a similar fashion (e.g.  background, foreground, ..etc.)

       Actions can be either simple or compound. A compound action consists of a stack of simple actions and can be used as simple mini-script.  Examples:

       • Set(idleGuard,on); DialEntries(Default);
       • Echo("Uploading files..."); Transmit(rz); \
             FieTransfer(1,"*.ico $HOME/acct.wks"); Echo(Done);
       • OpenWindow(Dial); DialEntries("2 5 6");
       • Echo("Goodbye.."); Hangup(); Quit();
       • Set(baud,9600); ManualDial("555-5555");
       • Echo("Will upload..."); ShellCommand("$sz *.wks");
       • Set(parity,0); RunScript(login.scr); Echo(Finished);

       The following is a list of actions Seyon currently supports. Asterisks designate asynchronoous actions. Brackets designate optional arguments.

       Beep ();
              Rings the bell making a short beep.

       CloseWindow(window [,...]);
              Closes (dismisses) the given windows. Currenly the only valid argument to this action is Dial, which corresponds to the dialing idrectory window. Example: CloseWindow(Dial);

       DialEntries(entries-list);*
              Dials entries in the dialing directory corresponding by order to the given list. Entries will be dialed as if the user had selected them on the dialing directory.  Entries  will  be  dialed
              without opening the dialing directory. You can use the action ``OpenWindow(Dial);'' and stack the two actions in a compound action if you want the dialing directory to be opened.

              The  list  must be quoted if it consists of more than one entry, and entries should be separated by white space, not commas.  If the list consists of just the word ``Default'', then the en‐
              tries given by the resource defaultPhoneEntries will be dialed, refer to the description of that resource for more details.

              The most common use of this action is attach frequesntly-dialed hosts to SeQuickKeys, making dialing those hosts a one-click operation. If this action is not the last in a  compound  action
              stack, actions specified by the resource postConnectAction may not work properly.  Examples: DialEntries(2); DialEntries("2 4 5"); DialEntries(Default);

       DivertFile([file]);*
              Sends  the  given  file  to the remote host as a text upload. If the optional argument ``file'' is not specified, Seyon will pop up a dialog box asking for the file name. In the latter case
              this action is similar to clicking Divert from the Misc window. Examples: DivertFile("/tmp/acct.wks"); DivertFile();

       Echo([string]);
              Echos the given string to the terminal. Does not send it to the modem (use Transmit for that). If the string consists of more than one word, it must be quoted. Note that  unlike  the  shell
              command  of  the  same  name,  this  command  does  not  accepts  the switch -n but always appends newline to the string. If the argument is omitted, an empty line will be echoed. Examples:
              Echo(Hello); Echo("Hello there"); Echo();

       FileTransfer(entry, [file-list]);*
              Executes the transfer protocol corresponding by order in the trasfer console (protocols file) to ``entry''. If that protocol requires a file name and file-list is omitted, Seyon will pop up
              a dialog box asking for the file. Otherwise file-list will be passed to that protocol. The list must be quotes if it consists of more than one word and items in it should  be  separated  by
              white space. It can contain wild cards and shell variables. Examples: FileTransfer(1); FileTransfer(2,acct.wks); FileTransfer(2,"*.wks $HOME/acct.wks");

       Hangup();
              Disconnects the line. Does not pop up a confirmation box.

       IconifyWindow(window [,...]);
              Iconifies  the  given  windows.  Valid arguments to this action are Main, Dial, and Term, corresponding respectively to the command center, dialing directory, and terminal emulator windows.
              When the argument is Term, this action will work only if the terminal emulator sets the envirenment variable WINDOWID, like xterm does. Examples: IconifyWindow(Main,Dial,Term);  IconifyWin‐
              dow(Dial);

       ManualDial([number]);*
              Dials a number as if the Manual button had been clicked from the dialing directory. If ``number'' is specified, it will be dialed directly and no dialog box will be popped up asking for the
              number.  Examples: ManualDial(555-5555); ManualDial();

       Message([string]);
              Echos the given string to the message box of Seyon's command center (main window). If the string consists of more than one word, it must be quoted. If the argument is omitted, an empty line
              will be echoed.  Examples: Message(Hello); Message("Hello there"); Message();

       OpenWindow(window [,...]);
              Opens each of the given windows by popping it if closed or de-iconifying it if in an iconic state. Valid arguments to this action are Main, Dial, and Term, corresponding respectively to the
              command center, dialing directory, and terminal emulator windows. When the argument is Term, this action will work only if the terminal emulator sets the envirenment variable WINDOWID, like
              xterm does.  Examples: OpenWindow(Main,Dial,Term); OpenWindow(Dial);

       Quit();
              Exits Seyon completely and returns to the shell. Does not pop up a confirmation box.

       RunScript([script-name]);*
              Executes  the  script given by the file script-name. The script will be executed as if the user had selected it via the Script button. If script-name is omitted, a dialog box will be popped
              up asking for the script name. This is a very versatile action, as many remote and local commands or series of commands can be performed by attaching appropriate scripts to SeQuickKeys. Ex‐
              amples: RunScript(login.scr); RunScript();

       Set(parameter, value);
              Sets the specified parameter to the given value. Can be used to set the various communications parameters. Available parameters are listed  under  the  script  command  ``set''.   Examples:
              Set(baud,9600); Set(parity,0); Set(idleGuard,off).

       ShellCommand(shell-command);*
              Executes  the given shell command via the user's shell pointed to by the SHELL environment variable, or /bin/sh if that environment variable is not set. Note that the command must be quoted
              if it consists of more than one word. If the first non-space letter of the command is the character ``$'', then standard input and standard output will be redirected to to the  modem.  This
              action can be used to execute any external program from withen Seyon. Example: ShellCommand(ls); ShellCommand("$cd $HOME; sz -vv *.wks");

       Transmit(string);
              Transmits  the  given string to the remote host. The string must be quoted if it consists of more than one word. The string is transmitted as is (no case conversions are performed). No new‐
              line character or carriage return is appended to the string, use the prefix characters for that (e.g. ^M, ^J). See the discripttion of the script command ``transmit'' for more details.  Ex‐
              ample: Transmit(ls^M); Transmit("ls -CF^M");

SCRIPT LANGUAGE
       Script files can automate some tedious tasks such as logging into a system.  A script file is an ascii text file and may be entered or edited using any standard text editor.

       The script file is read line by line.  Empty lines (consisting of white space only) are ignored.  Comments are lines whose first non-space character is a pound sign (#).

       The script processor reads each script line, ignoring leading white space, into words. A word is defined as either:

              • a sequence of characters delimited by white space, or
              • a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

       The  first  word  of a script file is considered the command word.  If the last character of the command word is a colon (:), the line is considered to be a label (the object of a goto statement).
       Otherwise, it is assumed to be a script command and is interpreted as such. Command words are case insensative.

       Some commands take one or more arguments. Each argument is parsed as a single word as defined above.  If blanks are required in an argument, the argument must be  quoted  using  single  or  double
       quotes.

   Script Command List
       Below is the description of all commands that may be used in the Seyon script language:

       capture on|off (currently may not work)
              The  command  capture  on  will  enable capture. All characters received during waitfor processing will be appended to the capture file. The command capture off will close the capture file.
              This setting does not currently extend to terminal mode. This may be offered in a later release.

       debug on|off
              If the argument is on, all subsequent command lines processed will be displayed on the local screen. The exception to this is lines containing a transmit  command.  These  lines  will  just
              print TRANSMIT..., so that passwords, etc. can be protected. If the argument is off, scripts will execute quietly (this is the default setting).

       dial <number>
              Dial  the  specified number.  Seyon supports generic "Hayes" compatible modems for dialing.  Note that this command requires an actual phone number. The phonebook is not used for this func‐
              tion.

       echo <string>
              Echos the given string to the terminal. Does not send it to the modem (use transmit for that). If the string contains spaces, it must be quoted. Note that unlike the shell  command  of  the
              same name, this command does not accepts the switch -n but always appends newline to the string.

       exit   Terminates the script file prior to the end of file. Returns to terminal mode.

       flush  Flushes the modem, i.e. discards data written to the modem but not transmitted and data received but not read.

       goto <label>
              Goes  to  the specified label in the script file and continues execution from that point. The label may either precede or follow the actual goto statement. A label is any command word whose
              last character is a colon (:).

       hanup  Hangups up the line and disconnects from the remote host.

       if, else, endif
              Syntax:
              if <condition>
                      <statements>
              [else
                      <statements>]
              endif

              Conditionally executes statements based on specified condition. Seyon supports the following conditions:

              waitfor: true if the last waitfor command was successful.
              linked: true if this script was executed from the dialing directory.

              Conditions may be negated using the prefix not or the character !:

              !waitfor: true If the last waitfor command timed out.
              not waitfor: same as !waitfor above

              The else and endif keywords must appear on their own lines. If statements may not be nested.

       pause <time>
              Suspends execution of the script for the specified number of seconds.  This is usually used for timing considerations; for example, waiting a couple of seconds after receiving  the  connect
              message and typing ^C to CompuServe.

       purge  Reads and discards all data coming from the modem for the duration of one second.

       quit   Terminates the script and exits the whole program (returns to the shell).

       redial Redials the last number dialed using the dial command.

       send_break
              Sends a BREAK signal to te remote host.

       set <parameter> <value>
              Sets  the  specified parameter to the given value. Can be used to set the various communications parameters for each host. The follwoing is a list of the set keywords that Seyon recognizes.
              Keywords marked with an asterisk set the current parameter only, not the default one. Refer to the corresponig resource (in parentheses below) for details of the function of each keyword.

              baud* (defaultBPS)
              bits* (defaultBits)
              parity* (defaultParity)
              stopBits* (defaultStopBits)
              stripHighBit (stripHighBit)
              newlineTranslation (newlineTranslation)
              del (backspaceTranslation)
              meta_tr (metaKeyTranslation)
              xoff (xonxoffFlowControl)
              rtscts (rtsctsFlowControl)
              autozm (zmodemAutoDownload)
              idleGuard (idleGuard)

              Boolean keywords accept on or off as their argument, other keywords accept the same arguments as the corresponding resources.

       shell <shell-command>
              Executes the given shell command via the user's shell pointed to by the SHELL environment variable, or /bin/sh if the environment variable SHELL is not set. Note that the  command  must  be
              quoted  if  it consists of more than one word. If the first non-space letter of the command is the character '$', then standard input and standard output will be redirected to to the modem.
              This command can be used to execute any external program from withen Seyon. Example: shell "cd /usr/dl; rz -vv".

       transmit <text>
              Transmits the specified text to the remote host. The text argument should be quoted (using single or double quotes) if there are spaces to be transmitted. The text is transmitted as is  (no
              case conversions are performed).

              Prefix characters:

              ^ is the Control character prefix: the next character is made into a control character. For example, ^M is carriage return (0x0D) and ^J is newline (0x0A).
              \ is quote prefix: the next character is transmitted verbatim. For example, \^ would transmit a literal ^.

       tty on|off
              This  command  specifies whether or not characters received from the modem will be displayed on the local terminal.  Since the only time that the script processor looks at the receive queue
              is during waitfor processing, the displays may look a bit erratic.  Use the tty off command to disable local display of received characters during script processing.

       waitfor <text> [timeout]
              Waits for the specified text to appear from the modem. The text argument should be quoted (using single or double quotes) if there are spaces to be transmitted.

              Special characters are interpreted the same as for transmit.  If the timeout argument is specified, Seyon will wait that number of seconds for the string to appear.  If no timeout is given,
              Seyon defaults to 30 seconds.

              During waitfor processing, characters received (up to and including the last character found in the text or in the timeout) can be captured to a disk file  (if  capture  on  is  specified),
              and/or displayed to the screen (if tty on is specified).

       when [<string-to-expect> <string-to-send>]
              Sends string-to-send whenever it encounters string-to-expect while waiting in a waitfor command, whatever the number if times string-to-expect is encountered.

              This  is is useful if the order of prompts expected is not known before hand. For example, some BBS systems (notably PCBoard) change the prompts depeding on the time of call, and a complete
              script for such boards cannot be written using waitfor only.

              As many number of when commands as desired can be specified. A when command with no arguments clears all outstanding when commands.  waitfor commands take precedence over when  commands  if
              they expect the same string.

              A typical use of this command would be:

                      when "Continue?"       "y^M"
                      when "More?"           "n^M"
                      waitfor "BBS Command?"
                      when

              The  above  script  keeps sending "y^M" to every Continue?" prompt and "n^M" to every "More?" prompt until the the string "BBS Command?" is encountered. The lasy when clears all outstanding
              when commands.

FILES
       The default Seyon files are startup, phonelist, and protocols.  These have to be in the current directory, Seyon's default directory (~/.seyon), or the user's home directory.  The  default  script
       directory is Seyon's default directory. All of these files and directories can be overridden by setting the appropriate resources. See the description of those resources as well as the description
       of the files above.

BUGS
       The  script  command  'set port' is not supported in this release. If the action DialEntries is not the last in a compound action stack, actions specified by the resource postConnectAction may not
       work properly.

       If Seyon is hung, it can be made to exit cleanly by killing its main process by signal 15 (SIGTERM) from another shell. Seyon's main process is the one that has the lowest PID (Process ID) number.
       For example, if ps shows:

                1100 p0 S     0:04 seyon -noemulator
                1101 p0 S     0:00 seyon -noemulator
                1102 p0 S     0:38 seyon -noemulator

       Then ``kill -15 1100'' or ``kill 1100'' would cause Seyon clean up and exit gracefully.
