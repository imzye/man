NAME
       R2spec - Automatically generates RPM spec file for R libraries.

SYNOPSIS
       R2spec -p <package name>
       R2spec -u <url to sources>
       R2spec - s <path to sources file>

DESCRIPTION
       This tool generate RPM spec file for R libraries according to the Fedora guidelines for R packaging.  These guidelines are available at: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/R

USAGE
       This program generates spec file for R libraries for Fedora.

       R2spec -p <package name>

              It  will browse the configure R repositories for this specified package name.  If found, the package will be downloaded, extracted, the information contained in the sources are read (especially
              those contained in the DESCRIPTION file). The sources are then removed from the current working directory (unless specified otherwise).  Finally the spec file is writen to the filesystem  using
              the information collected.

       R2spec -u <url to sources>

              This alternative expects directly an URL for the sources of the R packages.  R2spec will try to fill the spec as best as possible from the information collected.

       R2spec -s <local sources>

              This alternative uses local sources. The sources are copied to the sourcedir as defined by rpm. They are then extracted and the spec file generated.

       -p / --package
           The name of the package to search in the main repositories collected.

       -u / --url

       -s / --sources
           The sources of the R package present locally on the filesystem.

       --force-dl
           Enforce the download of the sources even if they are present on the system.

       --keep-sources
           Do not remove the sources once extracted.

       --repo
           Enable to specify a repository for a local package.

       --name
           Name of the packager to use in the spec file.

       --email
           Email of the packager to use in the spec file.
