NAME
       dnstap-read - print dnstap data in human-readable form

SYNOPSIS
       dnstap-read [-m] [-p] [-x] [-y] {file}

DESCRIPTION
       dnstap-read  reads dnstap data from a specified file and prints it in a human-readable format. By default, dnstap data is printed in a short summary format, but if the -y option is specified, a longer
       and more detailed YAML format is used.

OPTIONS
       -m     This option indicates trace memory allocations, and is used for debugging memory leaks.

       -p     This option prints the text form of the DNS message that was encapsulated in the dnstap frame, after printing the dnstap data.

       -x     This option prints a hex dump of the wire form of the DNS message that was encapsulated in the dnstap frame, after printing the dnstap data.

       -y     This option prints dnstap data in a detailed YAML format.
