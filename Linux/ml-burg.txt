NAME
       ml-burg - a tree parser generator for Standard ML

SYNOPSIS
       ml-burg file.burg

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ml-burg command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       The  ml-burg  program generates a Standard ML program to perform bottom-up rewriting of an input tree. Cost information associated with each rewrite rule is used to derive the minimum rewrite
       cost for the entire tree. A successful reduction corresponds to rewriting the input tree to a special non-terminal symbol called the start non-terminal.  Upon successful reduction, facilities
       are provided to walk the tree emitting semantic actions corresponding to the rules that matched.

       When ml-burg is presented with file.burg, the file file.sml is generated.

       The programs are documented fully by The ML-Burg -- Documentation, Florent Guillaume and Lal George, which is available in /usr/share/doc/smlnj-doc/ml-burg_manual.pdf.gz.
