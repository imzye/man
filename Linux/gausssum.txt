NAME
       gausssum - parses the output of a Gaussian, GAMESS or HyperChem job

SYNOPSIS
       gausssum [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       gausssum  parses the output file of a Gaussian, GAMESS or HyperChem computational chemistry job to extract useful information. It uses gnuplot(1) to graphically display of the output. GaussSum can
       do the following: (Gau=Gaussian, GAM=GAMESS, Hyp=HyperChem)

       •      display all lines containing a certain phrase (any)

       •      follow the progress of the SCF convergence (Gau,GAM)

       •      follow the progress of a geometry optimisation (Gau,GAM)

       •      extract molecular orbital information, including contributions of groups of atoms to the molecular orbitals (Gau,GAM)

       •      plot the density of states spectrum (and the partial density of states, in the case of groups of atoms) (Gau,GAM)

       •      plot the crystal orbital overlap population (COOP) spectrum, which gives information on the bonding/anti-bonding nature of an overlap between atoms/groups (Gau,GAM)

       •      extract information on the UV-Vis transitions (Gau,Hyp), including the change in the charge density of groups of atoms (Gau)

       •      plot the UV-Vis spectrum (Gau,Hyp) and the circular dichroism spectrum (Gau)

       •      automate the creation of electron density difference maps, which visually show the change in charge density associated with a given electronic transition (Gau)

       •      extract information on IR (Gau,GAM) and Raman vibrations (Gau)

       •      plot the IR and Raman spectra, which may be scaled using general or individual scaling factors (Gau)
