NAME
       simriscparams - The description of the  configuration files

DESCRIPTION
       This page describes the organization of the simrisc configuration files.  These files are formatted like standard unix configuration files. Lines are interpreted after removing initial white-space
       (blanks  and  tabs)  and  after  removing all characters from lines starting at the first # character: this is considered comment and is ignored. If a line (not containing a # character) ends in a
       backslash (\), then the next line (initial white-space removed) is appended to the current line.

       Note that all parameter identifiers are interpreted case sensitively. E.g., Costs: is a different parameter than costs:. The numeric values used in this  man-page  are  for  illustration  purposes
       only. Some restrictions apply though: standard deviations cannot be negative; proportions and probabilities must lie in the range 0..1; multiple probabilities (like the ones used for breast densi‐
       ties) must add up to 1; etc. If restrictions apply then they are mentioned at the various parameter descriptions below.

DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file provided in the simrisc distribution is
       /usr/share/doc/simrisc/simrisc.gz.

       Usually this file is unzipped by the user to the user’s ~/.config directory:

           gunzip < /usr/share/doc/simrisc/simrisc.gz > ~/.config/

       whereafter ~/.config/simrisc can be edited to contain local modifications.

       Various parameters specify probability distributions. Usually the Normal distribution is specified. The program also recognizes the LogNormal and Uniform distributions, and uses the Beta distribu‐
       tion  when handling parameter variations of the beta parameter used for lung cancer simulations (note that the similarity of the names beta (the parameter) and Beta (the distribution) is sheer ac‐
       cidentally).

       Parameter specifications start with keywords, followed by a colon. All keywords are covered below. The format of the specifications is fixed, but empty lines and white space may be used to improve
       the specifications’ readabilities.

       Parameter specifications starting with uppercase letters (like Scenario:) specify (sub)sections and contain no additional specifications. Specifications starting with lowercase letters (like  age‐
       Group:) are followed by actual parameter values.

       The configuration file must define all parameters of all configuration sections, but configuration parameters can be modified using a separate analysis file or they can be modified by command-line
       parameters.

       Several  section  namess  are optional, e.g., `Scenario:’. In this manual page the label `(opt.)’ is appended to the names of those sections. In actual confiuration specifications they can stil be
       used, but they can also completely be omitted.

Section `Scenario:’ (opt.)
       This section may start with a line containing Scenario: and specifies some general parameters of the simulation process. The default configuration file contains the following specifications:

       o      spread: false
              when specified as true parameter spreading is used;

       o      iterations:  1
              the (positive) number of iterations used in a simulation loop;

       o      generator: fixed
              in addition to fixed the modes random and increasing are available.
              This parameter specificies the way simrisc’s random number generators are initialized. When mode fixed is used the random number generators are initialized with seed’s  value;  mode  random
              results  in  the  random  number generators being initialized by randomly selected seeds and seed (below) is not used; mode increasing results in incrementing the seeds of the random number
              generators by a fixed increment at each iteration;

       o      seed: 1
              the (positive) value to seed the random number generator with. This parameter is ignored when generator: random was specified;

       o      cases: 1000
              the (positive) number of cases being simulated;

       o      death: ...
              the death: parameter may either be followed by the path to a file (if its initial character is a tilde (~) it is replaced by the user’s home directory; if it’s a plus (+) it is replaced  by
              the  base  directory  (specified  with the --base option, see the simrisc(1) man-page)), or it must be followed by 101 cumulative death proportions, where each line starts with <nr>:, where
              <nr> is the next order number to read. The default configuration file specifies:

                 death:
                    1: .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000
                   11: .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000 .00000
                   21: .00000 .00014 .00028 .00042 .00056 .00070 .00106 .00142 .00178 .00214
                   31: .00250 .00382 .00514 .00646 .00778 .00910 .01118 .01326 .01534 .01742
                   41: .01950 .02312 .02674 .03036 .03398 .03760 .04414 .05068 .05722 .06376
                   51: .07030 .07776 .08522 .09268 .10014 .10760 .11564 .12368 .13172 .13976
                   61: .14780 .15718 .16656 .17594 .18532 .19470 .20658 .21846 .23034 .24222
                   71: .25410 .27560 .29710 .31860 .34010 .36160 .39368 .42576 .45784 .48992
                   81: .52200 .56240 .60280 .64320 .68360 .72400 .75826 .79252 .82678 .86104
                   91: .89530 .90962 .92394 .93826 .95258 .96690 .97104 .97518 .97932 .98346
                  101: .98760

              which are the 101 cumulative death proportions used for breast cancer simulations.

              If the 101 cumulative death proportions are available in, e.g., the user’s .config/ directory as the file cumdeath then the specification could have been:

                  death:  ~/.config/cumdeath

              which might be convenient when using different values in Analysis: specifications (see section ANALYSES in the simrisc(1) man-page).

Section `Costs:’  (opt.)
       This section may start with a line containing Costs: and specifies several parameters used for cost-calculations. Modality-specific cost parameters are specified in Section  Modalities:  (see  be‐
       low). The default configuration file specifies:

       o      biop: 176
              the (positive) cost of performing a biopsy;

       o      diameters: 0: 6438  20: 7128  50: 7701
              pairs  of diameter: cost values specifying the treatment cost starting at the specified tumor diameter, up to the next pair’s diameter (if specified) or all diameters starting at the diame‐
              ter specified at the last pair. The first diameter must be 0. The second value of each pair specifies the (non-negative) treatment costs for that age-group.

       o      Discount: (opt.)
              the costs discount proportion starting at some age. This line is optional but the followed two additional lines are required: the line discount:  contains  two  values  specifying,  respec‐
              tively,  the  discount  proportions  for  breast- and lung-cancer simulations. When only one proportion is specified it represents the proportion of the actually used simulation type (i.e.,
              breast- or lung-cancer); the line age: specifies the discount’s starting age (for both simulation types):

                  Discount:       # breast    lung
                      proportion:      0      .04
                      age: 50

Section `BreastDensities:’
       This section starts with a line containing BreastDensities: which are used with breast-cancer simulations. It defines breast density values for various age groups, covering ages 0 through the max‐
       imum age for simulated cases. The default configuration file contains the following specifications:

           #                  bi-rad:  a       b       c       d
           ageGroup:  0  - 40         0.05    0.30    0.48    0.17
                      40 - 50         0.06    0.34    0.47    0.13
                      50 - 60         0.08    0.50    0.37    0.05
                      60 - 70         0.15    0.53    0.29    0.03
                      70 - *          0.18    0.54    0.26    0.02

       Optionally, each line may start with an ageGroup: specification, which is required for the first specification line.
       Age groups are half-open ranges: starting at their first ages, and endinf at (but not including) their second ages. The first ages of subsequent age groups must be equal  to  the  second  ages  of
       their previous age groups. For the last age group the specification * can be used, indicating that all ages at or above the last age group’s begin age are handled by that group.
       For each age group the probabilities of the four bi-rad classifications must sum to 1.0.

Section Modalities: (opt.)
       This  section  may  start with a line containing Modalities: and specifies cancer-scanning modalities. Currently three modalities are supported for breast-cancer simulations: Mammo, Tomo, MRI, and
       one modality is supported for lung-cancer simulations: CT.

       Some modalities specify age groups, which are (like the age ranges used for breastDensities) half-open ranges: they start at their first ages, and end at (not including) their  second-ages,  while
       subsequent age ranges must connect. Also, the last age group may use the end-age specification *.

       The default configuration file contains (below the line Modalities:) the following specifications (if modalities aren’t used their specifications are optional):

       o      CT:
              The  CT modality is used when performing lung cancer simulations. The screening costs are used instead of the value configured at the Costs: biop: specification. The diagnosis: costs speci‐
              fies the costs of performing a CT-scan. The M0 and M1 values specify the costs when, respectively, no metastatis or a matastasis has been detected.

              The radiation dose of CT scans is configured at the CT: dose: specification. The sensitivity depends on the tumor diameter. For tumor sizes between 3 and 5 mm. the sensitivity  is  computed
              using the formula (.5 * diameter - 1..5) * 100 (e.g., 50% for tumors of 4 mm.)

              The default configuration file contains the following CT specifications:

                  CT:
                      #        screening    diagnosis    M0      M1   (M0, M1: Table S3)
                      costs:      176         1908      37909   56556

                      dose:  1

                      #               diam.   value (must be integral 0..100 or -1)
                      sensitivity:    0 - 3:  0
                                      3 - 5:  -1  # formula: (.5 * diam - 1.5) * 100
                                      5 - *:  100

                      #               mean    stddev  dist
                      specificity:    .992    .076    Normal

              Optionally, each sensitivity specification line may start with a sensitivity: specification, which is required for the first specification line.

       o      Mammo:
              For the Mammo modality the costs, radiation doses and m: parameter specifications per bi-rad category, specificity probabilities for age groups, the parameters of the beta-function, and the
              systematic error probability must be specified.
              The Mammo sensitivity is computed using the beta-function published by Isheden and Humphreys (2017, Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 28(3), 681-702). From a randomly generated prob‐
              ability and the case’s age the case’s bi-rad category is determined and that category is then used to select the m-parameter that is used in the beta-function.
              The default configuration file contains the following Mammo specifications:

                  Mammo:
                      costs:          64

                      #      bi-rad:  a       b       c       d
                      dose:           3       3       3       3
                      m:             .136    .136    .136    .136

                      #             ageGroups:
                      specificity:  0 - 40:  .961     40 - *: .965

                      #       1       2       3        4
                      beta:  -4.38    .49     -1.34    -7.18

                      systematicError:  0.1

       o      Tomo:
              For the Tomo modality the costs, radiation doses per bi-rad category, sensitivity probabilities per bi-rad category, and specificity probabilities for age groups must be specified.
              The default configuration file contains the following Tomo specifications:

                  Tomo:
                      costs:         64

                      #      bi-rad:  a       b       c       d
                      dose:           3       3       3       3
                      sensitivity:    .87     .84     .73     .65

                      #             ageGroups:
                      specificity:  0 - 40:  .961     40 - *: .965

       o      MRI:
              For the MRI modality the costs, and the sensitivity and specificity probabilities must be specified.
              The default configuration file contains (below the line MRI:) the following specifications:

                      costs:         280
                      #                 proportion:
                      sensitivity:      .94
                      specificity:      .95

Section `Screening:’ (opt.)
       This  section  may  start with a line containing Screening: and it specifies the ages at which screenings are performed, the used screening modality/modalities for each of the used screening ages,
       and the probabilities that screening rounds are attended. If no screening rounds should be used then specify a single round-specification line:

           round: none

       Otherwise, the first screening round must start with the keyword round: followed by an age, which in turn is followed by a list of at least one space delimited modality  specification.  Subsequent
       screening  round  specifications  may optionally start with the keyword round:. Currently Mammo, Tomo, MRI and CT are available. Mammo, Tomo, and MRI can be specified when performing breast-cancer
       simulations, CT can be specified when performing lung-cancer simulations. The default configuration file contains the following round specifications:

           # round:     50  CT
           #            52  CT
           #            54  CT
           #            56  CT
           #            58  CT
           #            60  CT
           #            62  CT
           #            64  CT
           #            66  CT
           #            68  CT
           #            70  CT
           #            72  CT
           #            74  CT

           round:     50  Mammo
                      52  Mammo
                      54  Mammo
                      56  Mammo
                      58  Mammo
                      60  Mammo
                      62  Mammo
                      64  Mammo
                      66  Mammo
                      68  Mammo
                      70  Mammo
                      72  Mammo
                      74  Mammo

       The probability that a case will attend a screening round is specified by the attendanceRate: parameter:

           #                   probability:
           attendanceRate:     .8

Section `Tumor:’ (opt.)
       This section may start with a line containing Tumor: and it specifies the characteristics of tumors. Several of the parameters in this section can be varied by specifying spread: true in the  sec‐
       tion Scenario:, in which case statistical variations are applied to these parameters.

       Supported  distributions  are Normal, Uniform, LogNormal, and (for the lung-cancer’s Beir7 parameters) the Beta distribution. If value is the specified value parameter value, and spread the speci‐
       fied spread parameter then the values that are actually used during the simulations are:

       o      when using the Normal distribution N(mean, stddev):
                 N(value, spread)

       o      when using the Uniform distribution U(begin, end):
                 U(value - spread / 2, value + spread / 2)

       o      when using the LogNormal distribution L(mean, stddev):
                 L(value, spread)

       o      the Beta distribution is used when requestin lung cancer simulations. For male cases the 95% confidence intervals for the beta parameters ranges from .15 to .70, for female cases it  ranges
              from .94 to 2.10, and values drawn from these distributions are used when spread: true has been specified (see also section BETA DISTRIBUTIONS).

       The  spread  parameters  may  not  be negative. If spread values are configured then their distributions must also be specified.  If spread is not specified, then the value parameter won’t vary if
       spread: true is specified in the Scenario section. The same holds true for the Beta distribution: if no spreading should be applied, even though spread: true was specified, then the Beta distribu‐
       tion’s specificatins should be omitted.

       The Tumor: section has four subsections: Beir7:, Growth, Incidence:, Survival:, and S3:. They contain the following parameter specifications:

       Beir7:

       BEIR (tumor induction) parameters: only tumor induction type 7 (i.e., beir7) is used. The default configuration file contains specifications for breast cancer simulations and for male  and  female
       lung cancer simulations:

               #    eta   beta  spread   dist.
           breast:  -2.0   0.51   0.32  Normal

           #                            Beta-distribution parameters:
           # LC:    eta   beta  dist    constant factor   aParam    bParam
           male:    -1.4   .32  Beta    .234091  1.72727  2.664237  5.184883
           female:  -1.4  1.40  Beta    .744828   .818966 3.366115  4.813548

       If spread: true is specified then the actually used beta parameters are drawn from their respective distributions.

       Growth:

       Tumor growth specifications consist of three elements: start diameters, self-detect parameterss and doubling time specifications.

       The start parameters define the start diameters (in millimeters) of emerging tumors used with respectively, breast and lung cancer simulations. The default configuration file specifies

               # breast lung
           start:   5     3

       The default configuration file contains the following specifications of the self-detect parameters for breast and lung cancer simulations:

           #selfDetect:      # stdev      mean     spread    dist
         breast:             2.01375     18.5413   2.31637   Normal
         lung:               1.0141      20.8426   1.84043   Normal

       Four parameters are used when determining the diameter at which self-detection is possible. These parameters are:

       o      the standard deviation (stdev) used by the lognormal distribution to compute the diameter at which self-detection occurs. This parameter is required and cannot be negative;

       o      the mean (see below) used by the lognormal distribution. This parameter is required and cannot be negative. Its value will vary using the following two parameters if spread: true was speci‐
              fied;

       o      the spread (standard deviation) used by the distribution that is used to vary the mean if spread: true was specified. It can be omitted in which case the mean won’t vary;

       o      the distribution used to vary the mean. If the previous parameter is omitted then this parameter must also be omitted.

       The actually used self-detect diameter is computed using:

           diameter = L(mean, stdev)

       Finally, the Growth: subsection also defines tumor doubling times for various age groups when using breast cancer simulations and for all ages when using lung cancer simulations.

       Doubling times are computed like the self-detect diameters, i.e., using millimeters and lognormal distributions. Thus, for each age group and for the lung cancer  simulation  four  parameters  are
       specified  (of  which  the  final two are optional): the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution, the mean value of the lognormal distribution, and the spread and name of the distribution
       that is used when spread: true was specified.

       The age groups (used with breast cancer simulations) must cover ages 0 through the maximum age for simulated cases, and are specified as described at section BreastDensities:. The default configu‐
       ration file contains the following specifications:

           DoublingTime:
               #                    stdev      mean     spread   dist.
               ageGroup:  1 - 50:   1.84043    79.838   1.53726  Normal
                         50 - 70:   1.29693    157.591  1.1853   Normal
                         70 - * :   1.56831    188.67   1.2586   Normal

               #     all ages        stdev     mean     spread   dist.
               lung:                 1.23368   98.4944  2.09594  Normal

       Optionally, each ageGroup line may start with an ageGroup: specification, which is required for the first specification line.

       Incidence: (opt.)

       For breast cancer simulations three carrier types are supported: Normal, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Each having a probability of occurrence. The probabilities of these carriers must add to 1. In the default
       configuration file BRCA1 and BRCA2 are specified, but their probabilties are set to 0, in which case their specifications can also be removed from configuration files.

       Each carrier is identified by name (i.e., when performing breast cancer simulations Breast:, BRCA1:, and BRCA2; when performing lung cancer simulations: Male: and Female:) followed by their  para‐
       meter specifications:

       o      for breast cancer simulations: the probability that the carrier is observed;

       o      the lifetime risk: three parameters specifying a probability;

       o      the mean age: three parameters specifying the mean age,;

       o      the standard deviation used when computing the risk of getting a tumor. As this standard deviation is used in the denominator of expressions it must be larger than zero.

       The lifetime risk, mean age and standard deviation parameters may optionally be followed by the standard deviation (spread) and distribution used to vary the probability when spread: true is spec‐
       ified;

       The default configuration file contains these specifications:

           Male:
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .22   .005    Normal
               meanAge:            72.48  1.08     Normal
               stdDev:              9.28  1.62     Normal

           Female:
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .20   .004    Normal
               meanAge:            69.62  1.49     Normal
               stdDev:              9.73  1.83     Normal

           Breast:
               probability:    1
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .226  .0053   Normal
               meanAge:            72.9    .552    Normal
               stdDev:             21.1

           BRCA1:
               probability:    0
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .96
               meanAge:            53.9
               stdDev:             16.51

            BRCA2:
               probability:    0
               #                   value   spread  distr.
               lifetimeRisk:         .96
               meanAge:            53.9
               stdDev:             16.51

       Instead  of  specifying the parameters of a distribution, a riskTable can also be used. If a riskTable is specified at a category (i.e., Male: .. BRCA2:) then the lifetimeRisk, meanAge, and stdDev
       parameters are ignored. A riskTable specification contains pairs of values. The first value of a pair specifies an age, the second value the probability of a tumor developing until that age.  Both
       ages and probabilities must be cumulative and at least two pairs must be specified.

       Unless specified in the riskTable specification itself simrisc adds a pair 0, .00 at the beginning, and an age specification 100 at the end. Its cumulative tumor probability is computed using lin‐
       ear  extrapolation  of the two age values before age 100, using a maximum value of 1.00.  For ages in between pairs of age values linear interpolation is used, using the surrounding age specifica‐
       tions. Here is a (fictitious) example of a riskTable specification in the Male: category:

           Male:
               riskTable:
                   40 .01      50 .1       55 .15      60 .22
                   65 .55      70 .62      75 .67

       Survival: (opt.)

       For breast cancer simulations four types of survival parameters must be specified. Each type (a..d) specifies a mean, and (optionally) a spread and distribution (which are used when  spread:  true
       has been specified). The default configuration file specifies:

           #              value        spread      dist:
           type:  a        .00004475   .000004392  Normal
                  b       1.85867      .0420       Normal
                  c       -.271        .0101       Normal
                  d       2.0167       .0366       Normal
                  e       1.00         .01         Normal

       Optionally, each line may start with a type: specification, which is required for the first specification line.

       The  e parameters can be used to estimate relative survival if not enough data are available (and can reflect the quality of care). The value 1 indicates that enough data are available to estimate
       survival using the a to d parameters.  If not enough data are available the e parameter can be used to adjust the survival estimate to correct the use of the a to f parameters to the quality level
       of the medical care relative to a country for which the a to d parameters are available. E.g., in Dutch breast cancer research studying the survival in Indonesia the value 0.9 was used since using
       that factor in combination with the provided a to d parameter values the correct survival probabilities for Indonesia were obtained.

       When performing breast cancer simulations TNM indices (cf. the description of the S3 table below) are also determined. With breast cancer simulations the second TNM value  is  always  0,  and  the
       first TNM value is, as with table S3, determined by the tumor’s diameter. The default configuration file contains the following bc: specification (see also option --tnm):

           #  BC TNM categories thru (<=) diameters (mm):
           bc:        20  50   *
           #  TNM:    T1  T2  T3

       (cf.  https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/stages-types-grades/tnm-staging).

       For  lung  cancer simulations table S4 is used to determine the a..e parameters. Table S4 contains four categories (lung0..lung3) defining these a..e parameters, where (for a known cancer’s diame‐
       ter) the category is randomly determined using table S3 (see below).

       Table S4 is appended to the breast cancer specifications. The default configuration file contains the following specifications of table S4:

          # table S4: 4 columns per a..d parameter
          # lungX: X is table S4’s column index
          lung0: a        .00143      .00095      Normal
                 b       1.84559      .33748      Normal
                 c       -.22794      .07823      Normal
                 d       1.06799      .16226      Normal
                 e       1.00         .01         Normal

          lung1: a        .01530      .00381      Normal
                 b       1.69434      .10979      Normal
                 c       -.19358      .02105      Normal
                 d        .66690      .03869      Normal
                 e       1.00         .01         Normal

          lung2: a        .78600      .29815      Normal
                 b        .69791      .05425      Normal
                 c        .0          .0          Normal
                 d        .0          .0          Normal
                 e       1.00         .01         Normal

          lung3: a       1.25148      .32305      Normal
                 b        .77852      .34149      Normal
                 c        .0          .0          Normal
                 d        .0          .0          Normal
                 e       1.00         .01         Normal

       Optionally, each subsequent line following the first lung0: .. lung3: line may repeat its lung1: .. lung3: label.

       S3: (opt.)

       With lung cancer specifications tables S3 and S4 are used to determine the survival parameters. The tumor’s diameter determines the row of table S3, and then its column is randomly determined  us‐
       ing the probabilities listed in S3’s rows. For each row the probabilities must sum to 1. Once the S3 column has been determined the column index which of the lungX: specifications is used. The row
       and column indices are 0-based. E.g., if a tumor diameter is 24, then row 2 (diameter <= 30) is selected. Then, if the random value is .630, column 1 is used (column N1-3,M0).  Whenever a tumor is
       present these pairs of indices are reported in the comma-separated data file in the column marked as TNM, using an entry like 2,1.

       The default configuration file contains the following table S3:

           S3:
              #      diameter (mm)
              # T-row    <=       N0,M0   N1-3,M0   N1-3,M1a-b   N0-3M1c
              prob:      10:       .756    .157      .048        .039       # T1a,b
                         20:       .703    .197      .055        .045       # T1b
                         30:       .559    .267      .095        .078       # T1c
                         50:       .345    .351      .167        .137       # T2a,b
                         70:       .196    .408      .218        .178       # T3
                          *:       .187    .347      .256        .210       # T4

       Optionally, each line may start with a prob: specification, which is required for the first specification line.
       (cf.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667005421000491 and Table 1 of its appendix: https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2667005421000491-mmc1.pdf)

BETA DISTRIBUTIONS
       Values  generated  from  Beta  distributions  range  between  0  and  1  (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution). The Beta distribution is computed using two Gamma distributions (cf.
       https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/datasets/techrep/tr03tb1/tr03tb1/node24.html, https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/502146/how-does-numpy-generate-samples-from-a-beta-distribution):

           gamma1 = Gamma(aParam, 1)
           Beta(aParam, bParam) = gamma1 / (gamma1 + Gamma(bParam, 1))

       When using lung cancer simulations the 95% confidence interval (CI) for male cases ranges from .15 to .70, with a mean value of .32, and for women ranging from .94 to 2.10 with  a  mean  value  of
       1.40.

       The  male  and  female  CI  ranges  are  transformed to .025 to .975 ranges using linear transformations. To transform values x from the male range to the .025 to .975 range the transformation y =
       1.72727 * x - .234091 is used, and to transform back the transformation (y + .234091) / 1.72727 is used.  For the female CI the transformations are y = .818966 * x - .744828 and (y  +  .744828)  /
       .818966.

       The  aParam  and bParam values are determined by first generating 1000 values so that their CI span the range 0.025 to .975, with a mean value of 0.318635 (for male cases) and 0.401724 (for female
       cases). Next the parameters of the corresponding beta distribution were estimated using maximum likelihood fitting, resulting in aParam = 2.664237 and bParam = 5.184883 for the  distribution  used
       with male lungcancer simulations, and aParam = 3.366115 and bParam = 4.813548 for the distribution used with female lungcancer simulations.

       The default configuration file shows these values at the Beir7 beta parameters.

PARAMETER RESPECIFICATION
       Parameters  can  be respecified by defining a separate parameter configuration file or by providing alternate parameter specifications in Analysis: sections of the program’s input file, or by pro‐
       viding alternative parameter specifications as command-line arguments (cf. the simrisc(1) man-page)

FILES
       Configuration files

       o      ~/.config/simrisc: the default location of the program’s configuration file;

       o      the simrisc distribution archive contains the default configuration file as simrisc-VERSION/stdconfig/simrisc, where VERSION is replaced by simrisc’s actual release version;

       o      when installing simrisc using Linux distribution archives (e.g., .deb files) the default configuration file is commonly available as /usr/shared/doc/simrisc/simrisc.gz
