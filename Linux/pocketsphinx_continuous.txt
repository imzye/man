NAME
       pocketsphinx_continuous - Run speech recognition in continuous listening mode

SYNOPSIS
       pocketsphinx_continuous [-infile filename.wav ] [ -inmic yes ] [ options ]...

DESCRIPTION
       This program opens the audio device or a file and waits for speech.  When it detects an utterance, it performs speech recognition on it.

       To record from microphone and decode use

       -inmic yes

       To decode a 16kHz 16-bit mono WAV file use

       -infile filename.wav

       You can also specify -lm or -fsg or -kws depending on whether you are using a statistical language model or a finite-state grammar or look for a keyphase.
