NAME
       Text::BibTeX::Validate::Warning - validaton warning class

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::BibTeX::Validate::Warning;

           my $warning = Text::BibTeX::Validate::Warning->new(
               'value \'%(value)s\' is better written as \'%(suggestion)s\'',
               {
                   field => 'month',
                   value => '1',
                   suggestion => 'Jan',
               }
           );
           print STDERR "$warning\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Text::BibTeX::Validate::Warning is used to store the content of validation warning (as emitted by Text::BibTeX::Validate) in a structured way.  Overloads are defined to stringify and to compare
       instances of the class.

METHODS
   new( $message, $fields )
       Takes Text::sprintfn-compatible template and a hash with the values for replacement in the template. Three field names are reserved and used as prefixes for messages if defined: "file" for the
       name of a file, "key" for BibTeX key and "field" for BibTeX field name. Field "suggestion" is also somewhat special, as Text::BibTeX::Validate may use its value to replace the original in an
       attempt to clean up the BibTeX entry.

   fields()
       Returns an array of fields defined in the instance in any order.

   get( $field )
       Returns value of a field.

   set( $field, $value )
       Sets a new value for a field. Returns the old value.

   delete( $field )
       Unsets value for a field. Returns the old value.

   to_string()
       Return a string representing the warning.
