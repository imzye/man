NAME
       vanessa_socket_pipe - Trivial TCP/IP pipe based on libvanessa_socket

SYNOPSIS
       vanessa_socket_pipe [options]

DESCRIPTION
       A  TCP/IP  pipe is a user space programme that listens for TCP/IP connections on port on the local host and when a client connects makes a connection to a TCP port, possibly on another host. Once both
       connections are established data sent on one connection is relayed to the other, hence forming a bi-directional pipe.

       Uses include enabling connections to specific ports on hosts behind a packet filter.

       This code is intended primarily as an example of how many of the features of libvanessa_socket work.

OPTIONS
       -c|--connection_limit:
              Maximum number of connections to accept simultaneously. A value of zero sets no limit on the number of simultaneous connections.  (default 0)

       -d|--debug:
              Turn on verbose debuging to stderr.

       -h|--help:
              Display this message.

       -L|--listen_port:
              Port to listen on. (mandatory)

       -l|--listen_host:
              Address to listen on. May be a hostname or an IP address.  If not defined then listen on all local addresses.

       -n|--no_lookup:
              Turn off lookup of hostnames and portnames. That is, hosts must be given as IP addresses and ports must be given as numbers.

       -O|--outgoing_port:
              Define a port to connect to. If not specified -l|--listen_port will be used.

       -o|--outgoing_host:
              Define host to connect to.  May be a hostname or an IP address. (mandatory)

       -q|--quiet:
              Only log errors. Overriden by -d|--debug.

       -t|--timeout:
              Idle timeout in seconds.  Value of zero sets infinite timeout.  (default 1800)

       Notes: Default value for binary flags is off.
              -L|--listen_port and -o|--outgoing_host must be defined.
