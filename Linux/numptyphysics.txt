NAME
       numptyphysics - Crayon-based physics puzzle game

SYNOPSIS
       numptyphysics

DESCRIPTION
       Numpty  Physics  is a Crayon-drawing puzzle game in the spirit of Crayon Physics using the same excellent Box2D engine. It melds cute schoolbook-style graphics with a kind of realistic physics en‐
       gine. It includes a built-in editor so that you may build (and submit) your own levels.

       A summary of the keys supported is included below.

PLAY KEYS
       stylus              draw a new stroke

       space or enter      pause/unpause physics

       esc or backspace    undo last stroke

       q                   quit

       r or up             reset level to initial state

       n or right          skip to next level

       p or left           go to previous level

       e or fullscreen     edit mode

       Hints:

       Each stroke is like a rigid piece of wire with a mass proportional to its length. A closed stroke is just a wire bent into a shape, it has no substance apart from its perimeter.

       The ends of a strokes can (and will) join onto other strokes when drawn near enough to another stroke. These joints are pivots so you can use this to build levers, pendulums and  other  mechanical
       wonders.

       Jointed strokes don't collide with each other. Join both ends to make a rigid structure

       Play bugs: goal item does not respawn if lost.

EDITOR KEYS
       Keys: (as per play mode plus the following)

       e or fullscreen          leave edit mode

       s or menu                save to ~/.numptyphysics/L99_saved.nph

       zoom-minus + stylus      delete stroke at point

       zoom-plus + stylus       drag stroke at point

       Hints:

       It's handy to pause the physics when making a new level though this is by no means necessary. Sometimes it is handy to let the physics run for a little bit just to let the items settle down.

       From the editor palette you can choose the crayon colour and then additional properties such as:

           * ground (earth arrow) - stroke is fixed in place.
           * sleeping (Zzz) - stroke is not subject to physics until bumped by something else.
           * decorator (dashed D) - stroke is not part of the physical world. eg: tutorial text.

       You should make sure that your level has at least one red item (player token) and at least one yellow item (goal item).

       Token strokes will only join to other token strokes. Goal strokes will only join to goal strokes. Other strokes will happily join to any non-token non-goal strokes.

       If this is your first time, you may need to restart the game for your saved L99 to show up.

       If you wish to be clever, edit the level file directly - it's just a simple text format.

       Editor bugs: There is not yet any provision to name your level but you can just rename the file to anything.
