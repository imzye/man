NAME
       Net::LDAPapi - Perl5 Module Supporting LDAP API

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::LDAPapi;

         See individual items and Example Programs for Usage

DESCRIPTION
         This module allows Perl programmers to access and manipulate an LDAP
         based Directory.

         Versions beginning with 1.40 support both the original "C API" and
         new "Perl OO" style interface methods.  With version 1.42, I've added
         named arguments.

THE INTIAL CONNECTION
         All connections to the LDAP server are started by creating a new
         "blessed object" in the Net::LDAPapi class.  This can be done quite
         easily by the following type of statement.

         $ld = new Net::LDAPapi($hostname);

         Where $hostname is the name of your LDAP server.  If you are not using
         the standard LDAP port (389), you will also need to supply the
         portnumber.

         $ld = new Net::LDAPapi($hostname, 15555);

         The new method can also be called with named arguments.

         $ld = new Net::LDAPapi(-host=>$hostname, -port=>15389);

         Instead of the above mentioned argumens -url can be used in the
         following form

         $ld = new Net::LDAPapi(-url=>"ldap://host:port");

         Setting -debug=>"TRUE" will enable more verbose error messages.

         Note that with named arguments, the order of the arguments is
         insignificant.

CONTROLS
         In LDAP v3 controls are an additional piece of data, which can be
         submitted with most of the requests to the server and returned back
         attached to the result.  Controls, passed to the call, are separated
         in two types.  The client side controls, which are not passed to the
         server and are of not much use.  They are denoted by -cctrls named
         parameter.  The server side controls, denoted by -sctrls named
         parameter are actually passed to the server and may affect its
         operation or returned results.  Each entry of the result may have
         controls attached to it as well ( see parse_entry(...) call ).

         -cctrls and -sctrls must be reference to array of controls.

         To create control call create_control(...) method. Bellow is an
         example of creating valsort control.

         my $asn = Convert::ASN1->new;
         $asn->prepare('SEQUENCE { b BOOLEAN }');
         my $berval = $asn->encode(b=>1); # or 1

         my $ctrl =
           $ld->create_control(-oid=>Net::LDAPapi::LDAP_CONTROL_VALSORT,
                               -berval=>$berval,
                               -critical=>Net::LDAPapi::CRITICAL);

         The control is to be freed by calling free_control($ctrl).

         If contol is attached to results entry, it can be retrieved by
         calling parse_result($entry). If no entry is passed to
         parse_result(...) then current entry is used. It returns hash
         with following keys

         Key           Value
         -------------------
         matcheddn     string
         errmsg        string
         referrals     array reference
         serverctrls   array reference

         You can look into content of the control by using get_contol_XXX
         functions like this:

         local %parsed = $ld->parse_result($entry);
         local $serverctrls = $parsed{"serverctrls"};
         local @sctrls = @$serverctrls;
         if( scalar(@sctrls) > 0 ) {
           foreach $ctrl (@sctrls) {
             print "\nreceived control\n";
             print "oid = ".$ld->get_control_oid($ctrl)."\n";
             print "berval = ".$ld->get_control_berval($ctrl)."\n";
             print "critical = ".$ld->get_control_critical($ctrl)."\n";
           }
         }

BINDING
         After creating a connection to the LDAP server, you may need to
         bind to the server prior to performing any LDAP related functions.
         This can be done with the 'bind' methods.

         An anonymous bind can be performed without arguments:

         $status = $ld->bind_s;

         A simple bind can be performed by specifying the DN and PASSWORD of
         the user you are authenticating as:

         $status = $ld->bind_s($dn, $password);

         Note that if $password above was "", you would be doing a reference
         bind, which would return success even if the password in the
         directory was non-null.  Thus if you were using the bind to check a
         password entered with one in the directory, you should first check
         to see if $password was NULL.

         To perform SASL bind fill in appropriate parameters calling
         sasl_params(...) and call

         $status = $ld->bind_s(-type=>LDAP_AUTH_SASL)

         Bellow is an example of GSSAPI K5 bind parameters.

         $ld->sasl_parms(-mech=>"GSSAPI", -realm=>"domain.name.com",
                         -authzid=>"",    -secprops=>"",
                         -flags=>LDAP_SASL_QUIET);

         For all of the above operations, you could compare $status to
         LDAP_SUCCESS to see if the operation was successful.

         Additionally, you could use 'bind' rather than 'bind_s' if you wanted
         to use the Asynchronous LDAP routines.  The asynchronous routines
         would return a MSGID rather than a status.  To find the status of an
         Asynchronous bind, you would need to first obtain the result with a
         call to $ld->result.  See the entry for result later in the man page,
         as well as the 'ldapwalk.pl' example for further information on
         obtaining results from Asynchronous operations.

         The bind operations can also accept named arguments.

         $status = $ld->bind_s(-dn=>$dn,
                               -password=>$password,
                               -type=>LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE);

         As with all other commands that support named arguments, the order of
         the arguments makes no difference.

GENERATING AN ADD/MODIFY HASH
         For the add and modify routines you will need to generate
         a list of attributes and values.

         You will do this by creating a HASH table.  Each attribute in the
         hash contains associated values.  These values can be one of three
         things.

           - SCALAR VALUE    (ex. "Clayton Donley")
           - ARRAY REFERENCE (ex. ["Clayton Donley","Clay Donley"])
           - HASH REFERENCE  (ex. {"r",["Clayton Donley"]}
                note:  the value inside the HASH REFERENCE must currently
                    be an ARRAY REFERENCE.

         The key inside the HASH REFERENCE must be one of the following for a
         modify operation:
           - "a" for LDAP_MOD_ADD (Add these values to the attribute)
           - "r" for LDAP_MOD_REPLACE (Replace these values in the attribute)
           - "d" for LDAP_MOD_DELETE (Delete these values from the attribute)

         Additionally, in add and modify operations, you may specify "b" if the
         attributes you are adding are BINARY (ex. "rb" to replace binary).

         Currently, it is only possible to do one operation per add/modify
         operation, meaning you can't do something like:

            {"d",["Clayton"],"a",["Clay"]}   <-- WRONG!

         Using any combination of the above value types, you can do things like:

         %ldap_modifications = (
            "cn", "Clayton Donley",                    # Replace 'cn' values
            "givenname", ["Clayton","Clay"],           # Replace 'givenname' values
            "mail", {"a",["donley\@cig.mcel.mot.com"],  #Add 'mail' values
            "jpegphoto", {"rb",[$jpegphotodata]},      # Replace Binary jpegPhoto
         );

         Then remember to call the add or modify operations with a REFERENCE to
         this HASH.  Something like:

         $ld->modify_s($modify_dn,\%ldap_modifications);

GETTING/SETTING LDAP INTERNAL VALUES
         The following methods exist to obtain internal values within a
         Net::LDAPapi object:

         o errno - The last error-number returned by the LDAP library for this
           connection.
                 ex:  print "Error Number: " . $ld->errno . "\n";

         o errstring - The string equivalent of 'errno'.
                 ex:  print "Error: " . $ld->errstring . "\n";

         o ld - Reference to the actual internal LDAP structure.  Only useful if
           you needed to obtain this pointer for use in non-OO routines.
                 ex:  $ldptr = $ld->ld;

         o entry - Reference to the current entry.  Not typically needed, but method
           supplied, just in case.
                 ex:  $entry = $ld->entry;

         o msgid - Get msgid from an LDAP Result.
                 ex:  $msgid = $ld->msgid;  #  msgid of current result
                 ex:  $msgid = $ld->msgid($result) # msgid of $result

         o msgtype - Get msgtype from an LDAP Result.
             ex:  $msgtype = $ld->msgtype;  # msgtype of current result
                 ex:  $msgtype = $ld->msgtype($result) # msgtype of $result

         These methods are only useful for GETTING internal information, not setting
         it.  No methods are currently available for SETTING these internal values.

GETTING AND SETTING LDAP SESSION OPTIONS
         The get_option and set_option methods can be used to get and set LDAP
         session options.

         The following LDAP options can be set or gotten with these methods:
           LDAP_OPT_DEREF - Dereference
           LDAP_OPT_SIZELIMIT - Maximum Number of Entries to Return
           LDAP_OPT_TIMELIMIT - Timeout for LDAP Operations
           LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS - Follow Referrals

         For both get and set operations, the first argument is the relivant
         option.  In get, the second argument is a reference to a scalar variable
         that will contain the current value of the option.  In set, the second
         argument is the value at which to set this option.

         Examples:
           $ld->set_option(LDAP_OPT_SIZELIMIT,50);
           $ld->get_option(LDAP_OPT_SIZELIMIT,\$size);

         When setting LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS, the second argument is either LDAP_OPT_ON
         or LDAP_OPT_OFF.  Other options require a number.

         Both get_option and set_option return 0 on success and non-zero otherwise.

SSL SUPPORT
         When compiled with the Mozilla SDK, this module now supports SSL.
         I do not have an SSL capable server, but I'm told this works.  The
         functions available are:

         o ssl - Turn on SSL for this connection.
           Install I/O routines to make SSL over LDAP possible
         o ssl_client_init($certdbpath,$certdbhandle)
           Initialize the secure parts (called only once)

         Example:
           $ld = new Net::LDAPapi("host",LDAPS_PORT);
           $ld->ssl_client_init($certdbpath,$certdbhandle);
           $ld->ssl;

SETTING REBIND PROCESS
         As of version 1.42, rebinding now works properly.

         The set_rebind_proc method is used to set a PERL function to supply DN,
         PASSWORD, and AUTHTYPE for use when the server rebinds (for referals,
         etc...).

         Usage should be something like:
           $rebind_ref = \&my_rebind_proc;
           $ld->set_rebind_proc($rebind_ref);

         You can then create the procedure specified.  It should return 3 values.

         Example:
           sub my_rebind_proc
           {
              return($dn,$pass,LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE);
           }

EXTENDED OPERATIONS
         Extended operations are supported.

         The extended_operation and extended_operation_s methods are used to
         invoke extended operations.

         Example (WHOAMI):

           %result = ();

           if ($ld->extended_operation_s(-oid => "1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.3", -result => \%result) != LDAP_SUCCESS)
           {
             $ld->perror("ldap_extended_operation_s");
             exit -1;
           }

         Note that WHOAMI is already natively implemented via whoami and whoami_s
         methods.

SUPPORTED METHODS
       abandon MSGID SCTRLS CCTRLS
             This cancels an asynchronous LDAP operation that has not completed.  It
             returns an LDAP STATUS code upon completion.

             Example:

               $status = ldap_abandon($ld, $msgid); # XXX fix this

       add DN ATTR SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Begins an an asynchronous LDAP Add operation.  It returns a MSGID or undef
             upon completion.

             Example:

               %attributes = (
                  "cn", ["Clayton Donley","Clay Donley"] #Add Multivalue cn
                  "sn", "Donley",                #Add sn
                  "telephoneNumber", "+86-10-65551234",  #Add telephoneNumber
                  "objectClass", ["person","organizationalPerson"],
                                   # Add Multivalue objectClass
                  "jpegphoto", {"b",[$jpegphoto]},  # Add Binary jpegphoto
               );

               $entrydn = "cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US";

               $msgid = $ld->add($entrydn, \%attributes);

             Note that in most cases, you will need to be bound to the LDAP server
             as an administrator in order to add users.

       add_s DN ATTR SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Synchronous version of the 'add' method.  Arguments are identical
             to the 'add' method, but this operation returns an LDAP STATUS,
             not a MSGID.

             Example:

               $ld->add_s($entrydn, \%attributes);

             See the section on creating the modify structure for more information
             on populating the ATTRIBUTES field for Add and Modify operations.

       bind DN PASSWORD TYPE SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Asynchronous method for binding to the LDAP server.  It returns a
             MSGID.

             Examples:

               $msgid = $ld->bind;
               $msgid = $ld->bind("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US", "abc123");

       bind_s DN PASSWORD TYPE SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Synchronous method for binding to the LDAP server.  It returns
             an LDAP STATUS.

             Examples:

               $status = $ld->bind_s;
               $status = $ld->bind_s("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US", "abc123");

       compare DN ATTR VALUE SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Asynchronous method for comparing a value with the value contained
             within DN.  Returns a MSGID or undef.

             Example:

               $msgid = $ld->compare("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US", \
                   $type, $value);

       compare_s DN ATTR VALUE SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Synchronous method for comparing a value with the value contained
             within DN.  Returns an LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE, LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE or an error code.

             Example:

               $status = $ld->compare_s("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US", \
                   $type, $value);

       count_entries
             Returns the number of entries in an LDAP result chain.

             Example:

               $number = $ld->count_entries;

       count_references MSG
             Return number of references in a given/current message.

             Example:

               $number = $ld->count_references

       delete DN
             Asynchronous method to delete DN.  Returns a MSGID or -1 if error.

             Example:

               $msgid = $ld->delete("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US");

       delete_s DN
             Synchronous method to delete DN.  Returns an LDAP STATUS.

             Example:

               $status = $ld->delete_s("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US");

       dn2ufn DN
             Converts a Distinguished Name (DN) to a User Friendly Name (UFN).
             Returns a string with the UFN.

             Since this operation doesn't require an LDAP object to work, you
             could technically access the function directly as 'ldap_dn2ufn' rather
             that the object oriented form.

             Example:

               $ufn = $ld->dn2ufn("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US");

       explode_dn DN NOTYPES
             Splits the DN into an array comtaining the separate components of
             the DN.  Returns an Array.  NOTYPES is a 1 to remove attribute
             types and 0 to retain attribute types.

             Can also be accessed directly as 'ldap_explode_dn' if no session is
             initialized and you don't want the object oriented form.

             In OpenLDAP this call is depricated.

             Example:

               @components = $ld->explode_dn($dn, 0);

       explode_rdn RDN NOTYPES
             Same as explode_dn, except that the first argument is a
             Relative Distinguished Name.  NOTYPES is a 1 to remove attribute
             types and 0 to retain attribute types.  Returns an array with
             each component.

             Can also be accessed directly as 'ldap_explode_rdn' if no session is
             initialized and you don't want the object oriented form.

             In OpenLDAP this call is depricated.

             Example:

               @components = $ld->explode_rdn($rdn, 0);

       extended_operation OID BERVAL SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Asynchronous method for invoking an extended operation.

             Returns a non-negative MSGID upon success.

             Examples:

               $msgid = $ld->extended_operation("1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.3");

       extended_operation_s OID BERVAL SCTRLS CCTRLS RESULT
             Synchronous method for invoking an extended operation.

             Returns LDAP_SUCCESS upon success.

             Examples:

               $status = $ld->extended_operation_s(-oid => "1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.3", \
                   -result => \%result);

       first_attribute
             Returns pointer to first attribute name found in the current entry.
             Note that this only returning attribute names (ex: cn, mail, etc...).
             Returns a string with the attribute name.

             Returns an empty string when no attributes are available.

             Example:

               $attr = $ld->first_attribute;

       first_entry
             Sets internal pointer to the first entry in a chain of results.  Returns
             an empty string when no entries are available.

             Example:

               $entry = $ld->first_entry;

       first_message
              Return the first message in a chain of result returned by the search
              operation. LDAP search operations return LDAPMessage, which is a head
              in chain of messages accessable to the user. Not all all of them are
              entries though. Type of the message can be obtained by calling
              msgtype(...) function.

       get_all_entries RESULT
             Returns result of the search operation in the following format
               (HASH)
               dn -> (HASH)
                     key -> (ARRAY)

             Example:
               my $all_entries_ref = $ld->get_all_entries;
               my %all_entries = %$all_entries_ref;

               foreach (keys %all_entries) {
                   print "<$_> -> <".$all_entries{$_}.">\n";
                   $entry = $all_entries{$_};

                   local %entry_h = %$entry;
                   foreach $k (keys %entry_h) {
                       $values = $entry_h{$k};

                       print "  <$k> ->\n";
                       foreach $val (@$values) {
                           print "     <$val>\n";
                       }
                   }
               }

       get_dn MSG
             Returns a string containing the DN for the specified message or an
             empty string if an error occurs. If no message is specified then
             then default entry is used.

             Example:

               $dn = $ld->get_dn;

       get_entry_controls MSG
             Returns an array of controls returned with the given entry. If not MSG
             is given as a paramater then current message/entry is used.

             Example:

               my @sctrls = $ld->get_entry_controls($msg);
               foreach $ctrl (@sctrls) {
                   print "control oid is ".$self->get_control_oid($ctrl)."\n";
               }

       get_values ATTR
             Obtain a list of all values associated with a given attribute.
             Returns an empty list if none are available.

             Example:

               @values = $ld->get_values("cn");

             This would put all the 'cn' values for $entry into the array @values.

       get_values_len ATTR
             Retrieves a set of binary values for the specified attribute.

             Example:

               @values = $ld->get_values_len("jpegphoto");

             This would put all the 'jpegphoto' values for $entry into the array @values.
             These could then be written to a file, or further processed.

       is_ldap_url URL
             Checks to see if a specified URL is a valid LDAP Url.  Returns 0 on false
             and 1 on true.

             Example:

               $isurl = $ld->is_ldap_url("ldap://x500.my.org/o=Org,c=US");

       listen_for_changes BASEDN SCOPE FILTER ATTRS ATTRSONLY TIMEOUT SIZELIMIT COOKIE
             Experimental function which implements syncrepl API in
             refreshAndPersist mode. All but one arguments are the same as in search
             function. Argument 'cookie' is the special one here. It must be specified
             and is a file name in which cookie is to be stored. On a subsequent
             restart of the seach only the newer results will be returned than those
             indicated by the stored cookie. To refresh all entries, one would have to
             remove that file.

             This function is to be used in conjunction with next_changed_entries(...),
             there you will also find example of its usage.

       msgfree
             Frees the current LDAP result.  Returns the type of message freed.

             Example:

               $type = $ld->msgfree;

       msgtype MSG
             Returns the numeric id of a given message. If no MSG is given as a parameter
             then current message is used. Following types are recognized: LDAP_RES_BIND,
             LDAP_RES_SEARCH_ENTRY, LDAP_RES_SEARCH_REFERENCE, LDAP_RES_SEARCH_RESULT,
             LDAP_RES_MODIFY, LDAP_RES_ADD, LDAP_RES_DELETE, LDAP_RES_MODDN,
             LDAP_RES_COMPARE, LDAP_RES_EXTENDED, LDAP_RES_INTERMEDIATE, LDAP_RES_ANY,
             LDAP_RES_UNSOLICITED.

             Example:

               $type = $ld->msgtype

       msgtype2str TYPE
             Returns string representation of a given numeric message type.

             Example:
               print "type = ".$ld->msgtype2str($ld->msgtype)."\n";

       modify DN MOD
             Asynchronous method to modify an LDAP entry.  DN is the DN to
             modify and MOD contains a hash-table of attributes and values.  If
             multiple values need to be passed for a specific attribute, a
             reference to an array must be passed.

             Returns the MSGID of the modify operation.

             Example:

               %mods = (
                 "telephoneNumber", "",     #remove telephoneNumber
                 "sn", "Test",              #set SN to TEST
                 "mail", ["me\@abc123.com","me\@second-home.com"],  #set multivalue 'mail'
                 "pager", {"a",["1234567"]},  #Add a Pager Value
                 "jpegphoto", {"rb",[$jpegphoto]},  # Replace Binary jpegphoto
               );

               $msgid = $ld->modify($entrydn,\%mods);

             The above would remove the telephoneNumber attribute from the entry
             and replace the "sn" attribute with "Test".  The value in the "mail"
             attribute for this entry would be replaced with both addresses
             specified in @mail.  The "jpegphoto" attribute would be replaced with
             the binary data in $jpegphoto.

       modify_s DN MOD
             Synchronous version of modify method.  Returns an LDAP STATUS.  See the
             modify method for notes and examples of populating the MOD
             parameter.

             Example:

               $status = $ld->modify_s($entrydn,\%mods);

       modrdn2 DN NEWRDN DELETE
             No longer available. Use function 'rename'.

       modrdn2_s DN NEWRDN DELETE
             No longer available. Use function 'rename_s'.

       next_attribute
             Similar to first_attribute, but obtains next attribute.
             Returns a string comtaining the attribute name.  An empty string
             is returned when no further attributes exist.

             Example:

               $attr = $ld->next_attribute;

       next_changed_entries MSGID ALL TIMEOUT
            This function is too be used together with listen_for_changes(...) (see above).
            It returns an array of Entries, which has just changed. Each element in this
            array is a hash reference with two key value pairs, 'entry' which contains usual
            entry and 'state' which contain one of the following strings 'present', 'add',
            'modify' or 'delete'.

            Example:

               my $msgid = $ld->listen_for_changes('', LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(cn=Dm*)", NULL, NULL,
                                               NULL, NULL, $cookie);

               while(1) {
                   while( @entries = $ld->next_changed_entries($msgid, 0, -1) ) {
                       foreach $entry (@entries) {
                           print "entry dn is <".$ld->get_dn($entry->{'entry'})."> ".
                               $entry->{'state'}."\n";
                       }
                   }
               }

       next_entry
             Moves internal pointer to the next entry in a chain of search results.

             Example:

               $entry = $ld->next_entry;

       next_message
             Moves internal pointer to the next message in a chain of search results.

             Example:

               $msg = $ld->next_message;

       parse_result MSG FREEMSG
             This function is used to retrieve auxiliary data associated with the
             message. The return value is a hashtable containing following kevalue
             pairs.
               'errcode'     -> numeric
               'matcheddn'   -> string
               'errmsg'      -> string
               'referrals'   -> array reference
               'serverctrls' -> array reference

             The FREEMSG parameter determines whether the parsed message is freed
             or not after the extraction. Any non-zero value will make it free the
             message. The msgfree() routine can also be used to free the message
             later.

       perror MSG
             If an error occurs while performing an LDAP function, this procedure
             will display it.  You can also use the err and errstring methods to
             manipulate the error number and error string in other ways.

             Note that this function does NOT terminate your program.  You would
             need to do any cleanup work on your own.

             Example:

               $ld->perror("add_s");

       rename DN NEWRDN NEWSUPER DELETE SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Asynchronous method to change the name of an entry. NEWSUPER is a new
             parent (superior entry).  If set to NULL then only the RDN is changed.
             Set DELETE to non-zero if you wish to remove the attribute values from the
             old name.  Returns a MSGID.

             Example:

               $msgid = $ld->rename("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US", \
                   "cn=Clay Donley", NULL, 0);

       rename_s DN NEWRDN NEWSUPER DELETE SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Synchronous method to change the name of an entry. NEWSUPER is a new
             parent (superior entry).  If set to NULL then only the RDN is changed.
             Set DELETE to non-zero if you wish to remove the attribute values from the
             old name.  Returns a LDAP STATUS.

             Example:

               $status = $ld->rename("cn=Clayton Donley, o=Motorola, c=US", \
                   "cn=Clay Donley", NULL, 0);

       result MSGID ALL TIMEOUT
             Retrieves the result of an operation initiated using an asynchronous LDAP
             call.  It calls internally ldap_result function.  Returns LDAP message or
             undef if error. Return value of ldap_result call stored in $ld->{"status"}
             and is set -1 if something wrong happened, 0 if specified timeout was
             exceeded or type of the returned message.

             MSGID is the MSGID returned by the Asynchronous LDAP call.  Set ALL to
             0 to receive entries as they arrive, or non-zero to receive all entries
             before returning.  Set TIMEOUT to the number of seconds to wait for the
             result, or -1 for no timeout.

             Example:

               $entry = $ld->result($msgid, 0, 1);
               print "msgtype = ".$ld->msgtype2str($ld->{"status"})."\n";

       result_entry
             This function is a shortcut for moving pointer along the chain of entries
             in the result. It is used instead of first_entry and next_entry functions.

             Example
               while( $entry = $ld->result_entry ) {
                   print "dn = ".$ld->get_dn($entry)."\n";
               }

       result_message
             This function is a shortcut for moving pointer along the chain of messages
             in the result. It is used instead of first_message and next_message functions.

             Example
               while( $msg = $ld->result_message ) {
                   $msgtype = $self->msgtype($msg);
               }

       search BASE SCOPE FILTER ATTRS ATTRSONLY
             Begins an asynchronous LDAP search.  Returns a MSGID or -1 if an
             error occurs.  BASE is the base object for the search operation.
             FILTER is a string containing an LDAP search filter.  ATTRS is a
             reference to an array containing the attributes to return.  An
             empty array would return all attributes.  ATTRSONLY set to non-zero
             will only obtain the attribute types without values.

             SCOPE is one of the following:
                   LDAP_SCOPE_BASE
                   LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL
                   LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE

             Example:

               @attrs = ("cn","sn");    # Return specific attributes
               @attrs = ();             # Return all Attributes

               $msgid = $ld->search("o=Motorola, c=US", LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, \
                   "(sn=Donley), \@attrs, 0);

       search_s BASE SCOPE FILTER ATTRS ATTRSONLY (rewrite XXX)
             Performs a synchronous LDAP search.  Returns an LDAP STATUS.  BASE
             is the base object for the search operation.  FILTER is a string
             containing an LDAP search filter.  ATTRS is a reference to an array
             containing the attributes to return.  An empty array would return all
             attributes.  ATTRSONLY set to non-zero will only obtain the attribute
             types without values.

             SCOPE is one of the following:
                   LDAP_SCOPE_BASE
                   LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL
                   LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE

             Example:

               @attrs = ("cn","sn");    # Return specific attributes
               @attrs = ();             # Return all attributes

               $status = $ld->search_s("o=Motorola, c=US",LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, \
                   "(sn=Donley)",\@attrs,0);

       search_st BASE SCOPE FILTER ATTRS ATTRSONLY TIMEOUT (rewrite/remove XXX)
             Performs a synchronous LDAP search with a TIMEOUT.  See search_s
             for a description of parameters.  Returns an LDAP STATUS.  Results are
             put into RESULTS.  TIMEOUT is a number of seconds to wait before giving
             up, or -1 for no timeout.

             Example:

               $status = $ld->search_st("o=Motorola, c=US",LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, \
                   "(sn=Donley),[],0,3);

       unbind SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Unbind LDAP connection with specified SESSION handler.

             Example:

               $ld->unbind;

       url_parse URL
             Parses an LDAP URL into separate components.  Returns a HASH reference
             with the following keys, if they exist in the URL:

             host      - LDAP Host
             port      - LDAP Port
             dn        - LDAP Base DN
             attr      - LDAP Attributes to Return (ARRAY Reference)
             filter    - LDAP Search Filter
             scope     - LDAP Search Scope
             options   - Mozilla key specifying LDAP over SSL

             Example:

               $urlref = $ld->url_parse("ldap://ldap.my.org/o=My,c=US");

       url_search URL ATTRSONLY
             Perform an asynchronous search using an LDAP URL.  URL is the LDAP
             URL to search on.  ATTRSONLY determines whether we are returning
             the values for each attribute (0) or only returning the attribute
             names (1).  Results are retrieved and parsed identically to a call
             to the search method.

             Returns a non-negative MSGID upon success.

             Example:

               $msgid = $ld->url_search($my_ldap_url, 0);

       url_search_s URL ATTRSONLY
             Synchronous version of the url_search method.  Results are retrieved
             and parsed identically to a call to the search_s method.

             Returns LDAP_SUCCESS upon success.

             Example:

               $status = $ld->url_search_s($my_ldap_url, 0);

       url_search_st URL ATTRSONLY TIMEOUT
             Similar to the url_search_s method, except that it allows a timeout
             to be specified.  The timeout is specified as seconds.  A timeout of
             0 specifies an unlimited timeout.  Results are retrieved and parsed
             identically to a call to the search_st method.

             Returns LDAP_SUCCESS upon success.

             Example:

               $status = $ld->url_search_s($my_ldap_url,0,2);

       whoami SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Asynchronous method for invoking an LDAP whoami extended operation.

             Returns a non-negative MSGID upon success.

             Examples:

               $msgid = $ld->whoami();

       whoami_s AUTHZID SCTRLS CCTRLS
             Synchronous method for invoking an LDAP whoami extended operation.

             Returns LDAP_SUCCESS upon success.

             Examples:

               $status = $ld->whoami_s(\$authzid);
