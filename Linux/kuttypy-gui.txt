NAME
       kuttypy-gui - graphic user interface to interact with KuttyPy

DESCRIPTION
       kuttypy-gui is a program that interacts with the KuttyPy board.

       KuttyPy is a USB interfaced board that gives you an option to do such things like to switch a light bulb, rotate a motor or measure a temperature under software control, in pure Python.

       Playing with LEDs, motors, switches etc. is the primary objective of this hardware, but the experience gained in manipulating the 32 Input/Output pins of this board will gradually make you
       familiar with the ATMega32 micro-controller.
