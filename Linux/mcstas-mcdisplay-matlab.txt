NAME
       mcdisplay-matlab - mcstas Graphical display of simulations using Matlab/Octave

SYNOPSIS
       mcdisplay-matlab [-hom] [-png|-jpg|-fig|-eps|-pdf|-tif] [–inspect=COMP] INSTR name=value...

DESCRIPTION
       The  mcdisplay-matlab  front-end is a graphical debugging tool.  It presents a schematic drawing of the instrument definition, showing the position of the components and the paths of the simulated
       neutrons through the instrument.  It is thus very useful for debugging a simulation, for example to spot components in the wrong position or to find out where neutrons are getting  lost.   To  use
       the mcdisplay-matlab front-end with a simulation, run it as follows: mcdisplay INSTR args... where INSTR is the name of either the instrument source INSTR.instr or the simulation program INSTR.out
       generated with mcstas, and args are the normal command line arguments for the simulation, as for mcrun.  The -h option will list valid options.

       The  default  plotting  backend is mxdisplay-pyqtgraph, but there exists a number of additional plotters such as mxdisplay-matplotlib, mxdisplay-webgl-classic (using WebGL), mxdisplay-webgl (using
       WebGL and NodeJS), mxdisplay-matlab (using Matlab or Octave).  This is the Matlab/Octave plotting tool.

OPTIONS
       INSTR  Displays the given mcstas 3D model with its defaults/current parameters.

       name1=value1 ...
              Displays the given mcstas model with given parameters.

       -n N, –ncount N
              Number of particles to simulate

       [-png|-jpg|-fig|-eps|-pdf|-tif]
              Same as above, and specifies an output file format to generate.  Possible save_as are -png -pdf -fig -tif -jpg -eps

       –inspect=COMP
              Same as above, and only plot component names that match COMP, given as a single component word for partial match, such as Monitor a component interval such as Monok:Sample or 2:10 or 2:end

       -m     Explicitely request to use Matlab

       -o     Explicitely request to use Octave
