NAME
       apriboot - rewrite disc boot sector, converting between Apricot and PCDOS

SYNOPSIS
       apriboot [-format FORMAT] [-type TYPE] [-side SIDE] [-comp COMP] [-retry COUNT] [-pcdos] [-apricot] DISKIMAGE [DSKIMAGE...]
DESCRIPTION
       Apriboot rewrites the boot sector of the selected disc (or image), converting it between standard PCDOS format and the format used by the Apricot PC / Xi / F-series computers.

OPTIONS
       -type TYPE
              Determines which driver is to be used.

       -retry COUNT
              Set the number of times to attempt to read the disc in case of error.

       -comp COMP
              Select the compression method used on the source disc image file (has no effect when reading a floppy disc).

       -side SIDE
              Determines which side (0 or 1) of the disc (image) is to be identified.

       -format FORMAT
              Selects a fixed format. Should not be necessary.

       -apricot
              Forces the program to convert to Apricot format; if the boot sector is already in Apricot format, does nothing.

       -pcdos Forces  the program to convert to PCDOS format; if the boot sector is already in PCDOS format, does nothing. If neither -pcdos nor -apricot is supplied, the boot sector will be set to the oppo‐
              site of whatever is currently in use.
