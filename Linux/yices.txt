NAME
       yices - the Yices SMT solver for the Yices language

SYNOPSIS
       yices [ options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Runs the Yices SMT solver. The input must be in the Yices specification language. If no file is given, Yices reads commands from standard input.

OPTIONS
       --version, -V
              Display version and exit.

       --help, -h
              Display a short help summary.

       --verbosity=level, -v level
              Set the verbosity level (default = 0).

       --logic=name
              Configure Yices for a specific logic.

              The name must be either an SMT-LIB logic name (e.g., QF_UFLIA) or the special symbol NONE to select propositional logic.

       --arith-solver=solver
              Select the arithmetic solver.

              The solver may be either simplex or floyd-warshall or auto.  This option is ignored unless the logic is either QF_RDL or QF_IDL.

       --mode=mode
              Select the usage mode.

              The mode maybe one-shot or multi-checks or interactive or push-pop or ef.

              •   one-shot: only one call to (check) is allowed.  No assertions are allowed after (check).  Commands (push) and (pop) are not supported.

              •   multi-checks: several calls (check) are allowed.  Adding assertions after check is allowed.  Commands (push) and (pop) are not supported.

              •   push-pop: like multi-check but with support for (push) and (pop).

              •   interactive: like push-pop.  In addition, Yices restores the context to a clean state if (check) is interrupted.

              •   ef: enable the exist-forall solver, that is, command (ef-solve) can be used.  This is like one-shot in that only one call to (ef-solve) is allowed.

              The default mode is push-pop.

       --mcsat
              Force use of the MCSAT solver.

       --print-success
              Print ok after every command that would otherwise execute silently.
