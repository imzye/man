RXECHO(8)                Linux System Managers Manual                RXECHO(8)

NAME
       rxecho - Route AX.25 packets between ports transparently.

SYNOPSIS
       rxecho [-l] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Rxecho  copies  AX.25  frames between interfaces without altering their
       contents. The purpose of this utility is to  allow  other  AX.25  aware
       programs/computers  to  share  the same AX.25 ports as the Linux kernel
       AX.25 code. It could be used to route packets out onto  another  serial
       port  to  allow another machine running DOS based programs to share the
       same radio ports as the Linux machine, or it could  route  packets  out
       onto a pseudo-tty to another application on the same machine. The copy‐
       ing could even be to another radio port.

       The copying of the packets is controlled by a configuration  file  rxe‐
       cho.conf(5), which can be set up to selectively copy packets.

OPTIONS
       -l        Enables  logging  of errors to the system log, the default is
                 off.

       -v        Display the version.
