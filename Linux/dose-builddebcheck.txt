NAME
       dose-builddebcheck - Check if a package can be built on a Debian system

SYNOPSIS
       dose-builddebcheck  --deb-native-arch=name [options] binary-repositories source-repository

DESCRIPTION
       dose-builddebcheck  determines,  for  a  set  of  debian  source package control stanzas, called the source repository, whether a build environment for the packages of the source repository can be
       installed on the specified native architecture by using packages from the binary repository. For this, only package meta-information is taken into account: build-dependencies  and  build-conflicts
       in  the  source  package,  and inter-package relationsships expressed in the binary repository. The constraint solving algorithm is complete, that is it finds a solution whenever there exists one,
       even for multiple disjunctive dependencies and deep package conflicts.  This problem is computationally infeasible in theory (that is, NP-complete), but can be solved very efficiently for  package
       repositories  that  actually  occur  in  practice.  Installability  of binary packages is analyzed according to their Depends, Conflicts, and Provides fields with their meaning as of Debian policy
       version 3.9.0. Pre-depends are treated like Depends, and Breaks are treated like Conflicts.

INPUT FORMAT
       The binary-repositories argument is a list of filenames containing stanzas in the format of deb-control(5), separated by one blank line. For instance, the Packages  files  as  found  on  a  Debian
       mirror server, or in the directory /var/lib/apt/lists/ of a Debian system, are suitable. The source-repository argument is the name of a file containing debian source control stanzas, separated by
       one  blank  line.  For  instance,  the  Sources  files as found on a Debian mirror server, or in the directory /var/lib/apt/lists/ of a Debian system, are suitable. binary-repositories and source-
       repository can be passed in compresssed format (.gz , .bz2).

       Multi-arch annotations are correctly considered by dose-builddebcheck. Packages whose's architecture is neither the native architecture nor in the list of foreign  architectures  (see  below)  are
       ignored.  Here, native and foreign refers at the same time to the architecture on which the compilation will be run, and to the host architecture of the compilation. Cross-compilation is supported
       by specifying the host architecture.

OPTIONS
   MISC OPTIONS
       --version
               Show program's version and exit.

       -h, --help
               This option displays the help message.

       -v, --verbose
               Enable info / warnings / debug messages. This option may be repeated up to three times in order to increase verbosity.

       --progress
               Print progress bars.

       --timers
               Print timing information.

       --quiet Do no print any messages.

   DISTCHECK OPTIONS
       -e, --explain
               Give explanations. If used together with --failures then the explanation consists of dependency chains leading to a conflict or a dependency on a missing package.  If  used  together  with
               --successes then the explanation consists of an installation set.

       -m, --explain-minimal
               For  all packages P that are found installable, and when used in conjunction with --successes, prints a reduced installation set containing only those packages in the dependency cone of P.
               When used with Debian repositories, all essential packages and their dependencies that are not in the cone of P are omitted.  When used in conjunction with --failures, and  --explain,  all
               dependencies chains are not printed.

       -c, --explain-condense
               Compress explanation graph

       -f --failures
               Only show broken packages that fail the installability check.

       -s --successes
               Only show packages that do not fail the installability check.

       --summary
               Gives a more detailed summary of the findings.

   INPUT OPTIONS
       --checkonly package [,package] ...
               Takes  a  comma-separated  list  of  package  names,  each  of  them  possibly  with  a version constraint, as argument. The foreground is constituted of all packages that match any of the
               expressions, all other packages are pushed into the background. The initial distinction between foreground and background is ignored. This option must not be combined with --coinst.

               Example: --checkonly "libc6 , 2ping (= 1.2.3-1)"

       --latest n
               Consider only the latest -n most recent versions of each package, older versions of packages are ignored.

   OUTPUT OPTIONS
       -o, --outfile= file
               Send output to file.

       -d, --outdir= directory
               Set the output directory (default current directory).

       --dot   Save the explanation graph (one for each package) in dot format.

       --dump=file
               Dump the cudf file.

   DEBIAN OPTIONS
       --deb-native-arch=name
               Specify the native architecture. This argument is mandatory.

       --deb-host-arch=name...
               Specify the host architecture.

       --deb-foreign-archs=name [,name] ...
               Specify a comma-separated list of foreign architectures. The default is an empty list of foreign architectures. If --deb-host-arch is set, it is used as an implicit foreign architecture.

       --deb-ignore-essential
               Do not consider essential packages as part of the installation problem.  By default all essential package are considered as part of the installation problem for all  packages,  that  is  a
               package is installable if and only if it is co-installable with all essential packages. This option allows the user to test the installability with no essential packages installed.

       --deb-builds-from
               Add builds-from relationship of binary packages on source packages as dependency. This allows one to create graphs for bootstrapping purposes.

       --deb-tupletable=file
               Path to an architecture tuple table like /usr/share/dpkg/tupletable

       --deb-cputable=file
               Path to a cpu table like /usr/share/dpkg/cputable

       --deb-defaulted-m-a-foreign
               Convert Arch:all packages to Multi-Arch: foreign

       --deb-drop-b-d-indep
               Drop Build-Indep dependencies

       --deb-drop-b-d-arch
               Drop Build-Arch dependencies

       --deb-include-extra-source
               Include packages with Extra-Source-Only:yes (dropped by default)

       -P, --deb-profiles=name[,name...]
               Comma separated list of activated build profiles.

       --deb-emulate-sbuild
               Replicate sbuild behaviour to only keep the first alternative of build dependencies.

EXIT CODES
       Exit codes 0-63 indicate a normal termination of the program, codes 64-127 indicate abnormal termination of the program (such as parse errors, I/O errors).

       In case of normal program termination:

       - exit code 0 indicates that all foreground packages are found installable;

       - exit code 1 indicates that at least one foreground package is found uninstallable.

EXAMPLE
       Compute the list of source packages in Sources for which it is not possible to install a build environment on i386, assuming that the binary packages described in file Packages are available:

        dose-builddebcheck -v -f -e --deb-native-arch=amd64 \
        /var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_binary-amd64_Packages\
        /var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_source_Sources

       Compute  the  list  of source packages for armel in Sources for which it is not possible to install a mix build environment on amd64 plus armel, assuming that the binary packages described in file
       Packages are available:

        deb-builddebcheck --failures --successes --deb-native-arch=amd64 \
        --deb-foreign-archs=armel,linux-any --deb-host-arch=armel \
        DebianPackages/Sid-amd64-armel-Packages-050812.bz2
        DebianPackages/Sid-Sources-single-version-050812.bz2

AUTHOR
       The current version has been rewritten on the basis of the dose3 library by Pietro Abate; it replaces an earlier version that was  simply a wrapper for edos-distcheck.
