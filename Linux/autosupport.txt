NAME
       autosupport — interactive script to provide Digium[tm]'s support with information

SYNOPSIS
       autosupport [OPTION] [prefix]

DESCRIPTION
       autosupport  is  a script that is normally run by a user contacting Digium's Technical Support to automate gathering support information. It will probe the system for some run-time and system informa‐
       tion, and generate a backup of Asterisk related configuration. An optional parameter for a prefix may be specified which is typically used to specify a Digium Technical Support Ticket ID.

       The script requires root privileges to run, and writes all output in the home directory of the user running the script. For the purposes of this document, this will be referred  to  as  /root/  hence‐
       forth.

       The  system  information is written to /root/digiuminfo.txt and the backup of configuration (and the system information file) are written to a tarball in /root/ with a base name of digium-info. A Date
       Stamp will be appended, and if specified the optional parameter will be a prefix. The tarball at least is expected to be attached to a support ticket with Digium.

OPTIONS
   Arguments:
       prefix         Used to prefix the file names. Typically a Digium Technical Support Ticket ID

   Options:
       -n, --non-interactive    Run without requiring user input

       -h, --help               Show help about options

FILES
       /root/digiuminfo.txt
       /root/digium-info_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
