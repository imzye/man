NAME
       pmpython - run a python script using a preferred python variant

SYNOPSIS
       pmpython [python-args-and-script]

DESCRIPTION
       pmpython  provides  a  way  to  run python scripts using a customisable
       python interpreter, rather than embedding the name of a particular ver‐
       sion of python into each script.

       This  can  be useful as it allows version-independent python code to be
       run anywhere.  All python modules shipped with PCP support versions 2.6
       and  later  (in  the python2 series), and 3.3 and later (in the python3
       release series).

       Due to python monitoring and collecting scripts being relatively simple
       in PCP (not requiring new modules, language features, etc), it has been
       possible to ensure they work for all of the above python versions.

       However, the name of the python interpreter is  not  always  the  same,
       thus,  it is common for PCP python scripts to use a “shebang” line that
       launches the python interpreter indirectly as follows:

          #!/usr/bin/env pmpython

       env(1) is used to find the correct path  for  the  pmpython  executable
       from the user's $PATH.

       By  default  the  name  of the python interpreter is found from the the
       value of $PCP_PYTHON_PROG from  the  environment  (if  set)  else  from
       /etc/pcp.conf.  The latter is the more typical case where this value is
       based on some heuristics about the platform at the time the  PCP  pack‐
       ages were build and favour the use of python3 in all recent releases of
       PCP (for those platforms that support it).

       This allows an appropriate name to be used for the  python  interpreter
       instead  of  a hard-coded python version name, while still allowing the
       user to override the python interpreter as follows:

          $ PCP_PYTHON_PROG=python3 pmpython --version
          Python 3.4.2
          $ PCP_PYTHON_PROG=python2 pmpython --version
          Python 2.7.9

       This is convenient for shipping identical  scripts  on  multiple  plat‐
       forms,  and  for  testing different python versions with the one script
       (e.g. in the case where multiple  versions  of  python  are  installed,
       PCP_PYTHON_PROG  can  be  set  in the local environment to override the
       global setting).

       pmpython is a replacement for an earlier tool  with  similar  function,
       namely pcp-python(1).

PCP ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the
       file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installation,  the  file
       /etc/pcp.conf  contains  the  local  values  for  these variables.  The
       $PCP_CONF variable may be used to specify an alternative  configuration
       file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
