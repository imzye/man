NAME
       germinate-pkg-diff — compare seeds against currently installed packages

SYNOPSIS
       germinate-pkg-diff [-l file] [-m {i|r|d}] [-a arch] [seeds]

DESCRIPTION
       germinate-pkg-diff  compares  the  expansion of a list of seed packages against the set of packages installed on the current system.  When constructing seeds for a software distribution, it can be
       used to iteratively find packages installed on developers' systems that should be included in the seeds.

       A list of seeds against which to compare may be supplied as non-option arguments.  Seeds from which they inherit will be added automatically.  The default is ‘desktop’.

OPTIONS
       -l, --list file
             Read the list of currently installed packages from file.  The default is to read the output of dpkg --get-selections, and any supplied file should be in the same format.

       -m, --mode {i|r|d}
             Set the output mode as follows:

             i     Show the dpkg selections needed to install just these seeds.  List unseeded but installed files as “deinstall”, and seeded but uninstalled files as “install”.

             r     List unseeded but installed files as “install”, and seeded but uninstalled files as “deinstall”.

             d     Show the differences between the packages specified by the seeds and the list of installed packages, in a somewhat diff-like format.

       -S, --seed-source source,...
             Fetch seeds from the specified sources.  The default is https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/seeds/.

       -s, --seed-dist dist
             Fetch seeds for distribution dist.  The default is ubuntu.questing.

       -d, --dist dist,...
             Operate on the specified distributions.  The default is questing.  Listing multiple distributions may be useful, for example, when examining both a released distribution and its security up‐
             dates.

       -a, --arch arch
             Operate on architecture arch.  The default is amd64.

BUGS
       --mode r is useless as dpkg --set-selections input.
