NAME
       saga_cmd - command-line interface to the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses

SYNOPSIS
       saga_cmd [-d, --docs]

       saga_cmd [-b, --batch]

       saga_cmd [-h, --help]

       saga_cmd [-f, --flags][=qrsilpxo][-s, --story][=#][-c, --cores][=#] LIBRARY [MODULE] <module specific options...>

       saga_cmd [-f, --flags][=qrsilpxo][-s, --story][=#][-c, --cores][=#] SCRIPT

DESCRIPTION
       SAGA GIS (System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis) is a free and open source geographic information system used for editing and analysing spatial data. It includes a large number of modules for
       the analysis of vector, table, grid and image data.

       The SAGA command line interpreter is particularly useful for the processing of complex work flows by defining a series of subsequent tool calls in a script file. Calling saga_cmd with the option '-b'
       or '--batch' will create an example of a DOS batch script file, which might be a good starting point for the implementation of your own specific work flows.

       When run without arguments, the module libraries in the current module library are listed. By default this is the directory which was set at installtion (/usr/lib/saga). This can be overwritten by
       setting the environment variable SAGA_MLB.

OPTIONS
       [SAGA_MLB=dirname]
               Module libraries are expected to be located in the directory that is specified by the environment variable 'SAGA_MLB'. If this is not found the module installation directory (/usr/lib/saga)
               will be searched for instead.

       LIBRARY [MODULE] [MODULE OPTIONS]
               Specify the library (ie ta_morphometry) and the module (number or name). If no module is specified the different modules of a library are listed.

       -h, --help
               Display help and exit

       -d, --docs
               Create tool documentation in the current working directory

       -b, --batch
               Create batch file examples in the current working directory

       -c, --cores
               Number of physical processors to use for computation

       -f, --flags
               Various flags for general usage [qrsilpxo]

               q No progress report
               r No messages report
               s Silent mode (no progress and no messages report)
               i Allow user interaction
               l Load translation dictionary
               p Load projections dictionary
               x Use XML markups for synopses and messages
               o Load old style naming

EXAMPLE
       export SAGA_MLB=/usr/lib/saga

       saga_cmd ta_morphometry "Local Morphometry" -ELEVATION dem.sgrd -SLOPE slope.sgrd -ASPECT aspect.sgrd -METHOD 1

       Multiple input files can be specified by separating them by a semicolon (;).

       saga_cmd libgrid_tools Merging -GRIDS test1.sgrd\;test2.sgrd -GRID_TARGET merged.sgrd
