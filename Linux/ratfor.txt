NAME
       ratfor - ratfor preprocessor for fortran77

SYNOPSIS
       ratfor [-l n] [-C] [-o output] [-s type] input

PARAMETERS
       -l n   user sets starting label n

       -o output
              specify output file, otherwise it is stdout

       -C     keep comments in (useful for compiler directives)

       -s type
              specify element type of array used for strings, by default integer

DESCRIPTION
       Ratfor has the following syntax:

       prog:   stat
               prog stat

       stat:   if (...) stat
               if (...) stat else stat
               while (...) stat
               repeat stat
               repeat stat until (...)
               for (...;...;...) stat
               do ... stat
               switch (intexpr) { case val[,val]: stmt ... default: stmt }
               break n
               next n
               return (...)
               digits stat
               { prog }  or  [ prog ]  or  $( prog $)
               anything unrecognizable

       where  stat is any Fortran or Ratfor statement, and intexpr is an expression that resolves into an integer value.  A statement is terminated by an end-of-line or a semicolon.  The following trans‐
       lations are also performed.

               <       .lt.    <=      .le.
               ==      .eq.
               !=      .ne.    ^=      .ne.    ~=      .ne.
               >=      .ge.    >       .gt.
               |       .or.    &       .and.
               !       .not.   ^       .not.   ~       .not.

       Integer constants in bases other that decimal may be specified as n%dddd...  where n is a decimal number indicating the base and dddd...  are digits in that base.  For bases > 10, letters are used
       for digits above 9.  Examples:  8%77, 16%2ff, 2%0010011.  The number is converted the equivalent decimal value using multiplication; this may cause sign problems if the number has too many digits.

       String literals ("..." or '...') can be continued across line boundaries by ending the line to be continued with an underline.  The underline is not included  as  part  of  the  literal.   Leading
       blanks and tabs on the next line are ignored; this facilitates consistent indentation.

               include file

       will include the named file in the input.

               define (name,value)     or
               define name value

       defines  name  as  a  symbolic  parameter  with  the indicated value.  Names of symbolic parameters may contain letters, digits, periods, and underline character but must begin with a letter (e.g.
       B.FLAG).  Upper case is not equivalent to lower case in parameter names.

               string name "character string"          or
               string name(size) "character string"

       defines name to be an integer array long enough to accomodate the ascii codes for the given character string, one per word.  The last word of name is initialized to the symbolic parameter EOS, and
       indicates the end of string.

LIMITATIONS
       The file parameter to the include directive must be no more than 62 characters in length, or 60 characters if it is a quoted string.

       The program must ensure that EOS is defined before using the string directive.

       The string directive produces an array declaration followed by a data statement. A series of string directives (separated by optional semicolons and newlines only)  will  produce  all  their  data
       statements  at  the end of the series.  If you are using an old Fortran compiler that does not tolerate intermixture of declarations and other statements, then your string directives must be care‐
       fully arranged at the end of the rest of your other declarations to avoid violating this constraint.

       IMPLICIT UNDEFINED and IMPLICIT NONE directives are incompatible with the Ratfor switch statement. This is because the Ratfor switch statement produces a new integer variable to contain the  value
       of the switched-upon expression.
