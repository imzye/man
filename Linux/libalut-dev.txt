NAME
       freealut-config - script to get information about the installed version of freealut

SYNOPSIS
       freealut-config [ --prefix= DIR] [ --exec-prefix= DIR] [ --version ] [ --libs ] [ --cflags ]

DESCRIPTION
       freealut-config is a tool that is used to configure and determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs, libraries, and plugins that use freealut.

       The use of freealut-config is deprecated. The more generic tool pkg-config should be used instead.

OPTIONS
       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program or library that uses freealut.

       --exec-prefix=DIR
              If  specified, use DIR instead of the installation exec prefix that freealut was build with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified be‐
              fore any of the --cflags and --libs options.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program or library that uses freealut.

       --prefix=DIR
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that freealut was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option is  also  used  for  the
              exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified.  This option must be specified before any of the --cflags and --libs options.

       --version
              Prints the currently installed version of freealut on standard output.

EXAMPLES
       gcc -o main.o $(freealut-config --cflags) -c main.c
              is how you might use freealut-config to compile a C source file for an executable program.

       gcc -o my_app $(freealut-config --libs) main.o util.o
              is how you might use freealut-config to link compiled objects into an executable program.
