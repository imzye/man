NAME
       gramofile - Sample and process analog recordings

SYNOPSIS
       gramofile

DESCRIPTION
       GramoFile provides an interactive, integrated front end to sample audio data from gramophone records or similar sources, to analyse and enhance them.  While being text-based, it uses a menu system
       that  yields easy access to individual functions.  Highlights include a mode for automatic detection and splitting of single tracks from a larger recording, and several filters to reduce ticks and
       other noise in the audio data.  An integrated help system offers context sensitive information.

OTHER INFO
       The official GramoFile web page is located at http://www.opensourcepartners.nl/~costar/gramofile.  Technical details on some  of  the  filters  can  be  found  in  the  documentation  accompanying
       GramoFile, usually located in /usr/share/doc/gramofile/.

KNOWN BUGS
       This man page had better contain less marketing speak, but some actual information on use of the program.
