NAME
       zephyrd - Zephyr server daemon

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/zephyrd [ -d ]

DESCRIPTION
       zephyrd is the central server for the Zephyr Notification System.  It maintains a location database of all currently logged-in users, and a subscription database for each user's Zephyr clients.

       zephyrd communicates with daemons running on other Zephyr server hosts, to provide a reliable service.

       While running, any unusual conditions are recorded via syslog(3) to facility local6 at various levels.  The -d option enables logging of additional debugging information.

       When  a  zephyrd  is executed, it requests a list of server machines from Hesiod and initializes its state from any zephyrds executing on the other known servers.  This initialization is only per‐
       formed after the zephyrds have authenticated themselves to each other via Kerberos.  The server then enters a dispatch loop, servicing requests from clients and other servers.

SIGNALS
       SIGUSR1 enables logging of additional debugging information.
       SIGUSR2 disables the logging of additional debugging information.
       SIGHUP causes zephyrd to re-read the default subscription file and to re-query Hesiod about valid peers.  Any peers which are not responding and no longer mentioned  in  Hesiod  are  flushed;  any
       peers not previously named by Hesiod are added.
       SIGINT and SIGTERM cause zephyrd to gracefully shut down.
       SIGFPE causes zephyrd to dump the location and subscription databases to /var/tmp/zephyr.db in an ASCII format.

ACCESS CONTROL
       Certain notice classes are restricted by the Zephyr server.  Each such class has access control lists enumerating who may transmit (xmt-*.acl) or subscribe to that particular class.  Subscriptions
       may  be  restricted  either absolutely (sub-*.acl files), or by instance restrictions.  iws-*.acl files control subscriptions to wildcarded instances.  iui-*.acl files control subscriptions to in‐
       stances which are not the Kerberos principal identity of the subscriber.  If an access control list of a given type is absent, there is no restriction of that type on the class,  except  that  any
       notices of the class must be authenticated.  The class registry lists all classes which are restricted.

BUGS
       The current implementation of the Zephyr server (zephyrd(8)) makes no distinction between realm-announced, net-visible and net-announced exposure levels.
