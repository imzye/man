           gmic [command1 [arg1_1,arg1_2,..]] .. [commandN [argN_1,argN_2,..]]

         gmic is the open-source interpreter of the G'MIC language, a script-based programming language
         dedicated to the design of possibly complex image processing pipelines and operators.
         It can be used to convert, manipulate, filter and visualize image datasets made of one or several
         1D/2D or 3D multi-spectral images.
         This reference documentation describes all the technical aspects of the G'MIC framework, in its
         current version 2.9.4.
         As a starting point, you may want to visit our detailed tutorial pages, at:
         https://gmic.eu/tutorial/

         2. Overall Context
            ---------------

         * At any time, G'MIC manages one list of numbered (and optionally named) pixel-based images,
         entirely stored in computer memory (uncompressed).

         * The first image of the list has index '0' and is denoted by '[0]'. The second image of the list
         is denoted by '[1]', the third by '[2]' and so on.

         * Negative indices are treated in a periodic way: '[-1]' refers to the last image of the list,
         '[-2]' to the penultimate one, etc. Thus, if the list has 4 images, '[1]' and '[-3]' both designate
         the second image of the list.

         * A named image may be also indicated by '[name]', if 'name' uses the character set [a-zA-Z0-9_]
         and does not start with a number. Image names can be set or reassigned at any moment during the
         processing pipeline (see command name for this purpose).

         * G'MIC defines a set of various commands and substitution mechanisms to allow the design of
         complex pipelines and operators managing this list of images, in a very flexible way: You can
         insert or remove images in the list, rearrange image order, process images (individually or
         grouped), merge image data together, display and output image files, etc.

         * Such a pipeline can define a new custom G'MIC command (stored in a user command file), and
         re-used afterwards as a regular command, in a larger pipeline if necessary.

         3. Image Definition and Terminology
            --------------------------------

         * In G'MIC, each image is modeled as a 1D, 2D, 3D or 4D array of scalar values, uniformly
         discretized on a rectangular/parallelepipedic domain.

         * The four dimensions of this array are respectively denoted by:

           - width, the number of image columns (size along the x-axis).
           - height, the number of image rows (size along the y-axis).
           - depth, the number of image slices (size along the z-axis). The depth is equal to '1' for
         usual color or grayscale 2D images.
           - spectrum, the number of image channels (size along the c-axis). The spectrum is
         respectively equal to '3' and '4' for usual RGB and RGBA color images.
         * There are no hard limitations on the size of the image along each dimension. For instance, the
         number of image slices or channels can be of arbitrary size within the limits of the available
         memory.

         * The width, height and depth of an image are considered as spatial dimensions, while the
         spectrum has a multi-spectral meaning. Thus, a 4D image in G'MIC should be most often regarded as
         a 3D dataset of multi-spectral voxels. Most of the G'MIC commands will stick with this idea (e.g.
         command blur blurs images only along the spatial xyz-axes).

         * G'MIC stores all the image data as buffers of float values (32 bits, value range
         '[-3.4E38,+3.4E38]'. It performs all its image processing operations with floating point numbers.
         Each image pixel takes then 32bits/channel (except if double-precision buffers have been enabled
         during the compilation of the software, in which case 64bits/channel can be the default).

         * Considering float-valued pixels ensure to keep the numerical precision when executing image
         processing pipelines. For image input/output operations, you may want to prescribe the image
         datatype to be different than float (like bool, char, int, etc.). This is possible by
         specifying it as a file option when using I/O commands. (see section Input/Output Properties to
         learn more about file options).

         4. Items of a Processing Pipeline
            ------------------------------

         * In G'MIC, an image processing pipeline is described as a sequence of items separated by the space
         character. Such items are interpreted and executed from the left to the right. For instance, the
         expression:

           filename.jpg blur 3,0 sharpen 10 resize 200%,200% output file_out.jpg

         defines a valid pipeline composed of nine G'MIC items.
         * Each G'MIC item is a string that is either a command, a list of command arguments, a
         filename or a special input string.

         * Escape characters '\fR' and double quotes '"' can be used to define items containing spaces or
         other special characters. For instance, the two strings single item and "single item" both
         define the same single item, with a space in it.

         5. Input Data Items
            ----------------

         * If a specified G'MIC item appears to be an existing filename, the corresponding image data are
         loaded and inserted at the end of the image list (which is equivalent to the use of `input
         filename`).

         * Special filenames - and -.ext stand for the standard input/output streams, optionally forced
         to be in a specific 'ext' file format (e.g. -.jpg or -.png).

         * The following special input strings may be used as G'MIC items to create and insert new images
         with prescribed values, at the end of the image list:

           - '[selection]' or '[selection]xN': Insert 1 or N copies of already existing images. 'selection'
         may represent one or several images (see section Command Items and Selections to learn more
         about selections).
           - 'width[%],_height[%],_depth[%],_spectrum[%],_values[xN]': Insert one or N images with specified
         size and values (adding '%' to a dimension means "percentage of the size along the same axis",
         taken from the last image '[-1]'). Any specified dimension can be also written as '[image]', and is
         then set to the size (along the same axis) of the existing specified image '[image]'. 'values' can
         be either a sequence of numbers separated by commas ',', or a mathematical expression, as e.g. in
         input item '256,256,1,3,[x,y,128]' which creates a 256x256 RGB color image with a spatial shading
         on the red and green channels. (see section Mathematical Expressions to learn more about
         mathematical expressions).
           - '(v1,v2,..)[xN]': Insert one or N new images from specified prescribed values. Value
         separator inside parentheses can be ',' (column separator), ';' (row separator), '/' (slice
         separator) or '^' (channel separator). For instance, expression '(1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9)' creates a 3x3
         matrix (scalar image), with values running from 1 to 9.
           - '('string'[:delimiter])[xN]': Insert one or N new images from specified string, by filling the
         images with the character codes composing the string. When specified, 'delimiter' tells about the
         main orientation of the image. Delimiter can be 'x' (eq. to ',' which is the default), 'y' (eq. to
         ';'), 'z' (eq. to '/') or 'c' (eq. to '^'). When specified delimiter is ',', ';', '/' or '^', the
         expression is actually equivalent to '({'string'[:delimiter]})[xN]' (see section ''Substitution
         Rules'' for more information on the syntax).
           - '0[xN]': Insert one or N new empty images, containing no pixel data. Empty images are used
         only in rare occasions.
         * Input item 'name=value' declares a new variable 'name', or assign a new string value to an
         existing variable. Variable names must use the character set [a-zA-Z0-9_] and cannot start with a
         number.

         * A variable definition is always local to the current command except when it starts by the
         underscore character '_'. In that case, it becomes also accessible by any command invoked outside
         the current command scope (global variable).

         * If a variable name starts with two underscores __, the global variable is also shared among
         different threads and can be read/set by commands running in parallel (see command parallel for
         this purpose). Otherwise, it remains local to the thread that defined it.

         * Numerical variables can be updated with the use of these special operators: '+=' (addition), '-='
         (subtraction), '*=' (multiplication), '/=' (division), '%=' (modulo), '&=' (bitwise and), '|='
         (bitwise or), '^=' (power), '<<=' and '>>' (bitwise left and right shifts). For instance, 'foo=1'
         'foo+=3'.

         * Input item 'name.=string' concatenates specified string to the end of variable 'name'.

         * Multiple variable assignments and updates are allowed, with expressions:
         'name1,name2,...,nameN=value' or 'name1,name2,...,nameN=value1,value2,...,valueN' where assignment
         operator '=' can be replaced by one of the allowed operators (e.g. '+=').

         * Variables usually store numbers or strings. Use command 'store' to assign variables from image
         data (and syntax input $variable to bring them back on the image list afterwards).

         6. Command Items and Selections
            ----------------------------

         * A G'MIC item that is not a filename nor a special input string designates a 'command' most of the
         time. Generally, commands perform image processing operations on one or several available images of
         the list.

         * Reccurent commands have two equivalent names ('regular' and 'short'). For instance, command names
         'resize' and 'r' refer to the same image resizing action.

         * A G'MIC command may have mandatory or optional arguments. Command arguments must be specified
         in the next item on the command line. Commas ',' are used to separate multiple arguments of a
         single command, when required.

         * The execution of a G'MIC command may be restricted only to a subset of the image list, by
         appending '[selection]' to the command name. Examples of valid syntaxes for 'selection' are:

           - 'command[-2]': Apply command only on the penultimate image '[-2]' of the list.
           - 'command[0,1,3]': Apply command only on images '[0]', '[1]' and '[3]'.
           - 'command[3-6]': Apply command only on images '[3]' to '[6]' (i.e, '[3]', '[4]', '[5]' and
         '[6]').
           - 'command[50%-100%]': Apply command only on the second half of the image list.
           - 'command[0,-4--1]': Apply command only on the first image and the last four images.
           - 'command[0-9:3]': Apply command only on images '[0]' to '[9]', with a step of 3 (i.e. on images
         '[0]', '[3]', '[6]' and '[9]').
           - 'command[0-9:25%]': Apply command only on images '[0]' to '[9]', with a step of 25% (i.e. on
         images '[0]', '[3]', '[6]' and '[9]').
           - 'command[0--1:2]': Apply command only on images of the list with even indices.
           - 'command[0,2-4,50%--1]': Apply command on images '[0]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]' and on the second
         half of the image list.
           - 'command[^0,1]': Apply command on all images except the first two.
           - 'command[name1,name2]': Apply command on named images 'name1' and 'name2'.
         * Indices in selections are always sorted in increasing order, and duplicate indices are discarded.
         For instance, selections '[3-1,1-3]' and '[1,1,1,3,2]' are both equivalent to '[1-3]'. If you want
         to repeat a single command multiple times on an image, use a 'repeat..done' loop instead. Inverting
         the order of images for a command is achieved by explicitly inverting the order of the images in
         the list, with command 'reverse[selection]'.

         * Command selections '[-1]', '[-2]' and '[-3]' are so often used they have their own shortcuts,
         respectively '.', '..' and '...'. For instance, command 'blur..' is equivalent to 'blur[-2]'. These
         shortcuts work also when specifying command arguments.

         * G'MIC commands invoked without '[selection]' are applied on all images of the list, i.e. the
         default selection is '[0--1]' (except for command 'input' whose default selection is '[-1]'').

         * Prepending a single hyphen '-' to a G'MIC command is allowed. This may be useful to recognize
         command items more easily in a one-liner pipeline (typically invoked from a shell).

         * A G'MIC command prepended with a plus sign '+' does not act in-place but inserts its result
         as one or several new images at the end of the image list.

         * There are two different types of commands that can be run by the G'MIC interpreter:

           - Built-in commands are the hard-coded functionalities in the interpreter core. They are thus
         compiled as binary code and run fast, most of the time. Omitting an argument when invoking a
         built-in command is not permitted, except if all following arguments are also omitted. For
         instance, invoking 'plasma 10,,5' is invalid but 'plasma 10' is correct.
           - Custom commands, are defined as G'MIC pipelines of built-in or other custom commands. They
         are parsed by the G'MIC interpreter, and thus run a bit slower than built-in commands. Omitting
         arguments when invoking a custom command is permitted. For instance, expressions flower ,,,100,,2
         or flower , are correct.
         * Most of the existing commands in G'MIC are actually defined as custom commands.

         * A user can easily add its own custom commands to the G'MIC interpreter (see section  ''Adding
         Custom Commands'' for more details). New built-in commands cannot be added (unless you modify the
         G'MIC interpreter source code and recompile it).

         7. Input/Output Properties
            -----------------------

         * G'MIC is able to read/write most of the classical image file formats, including:

           - 2D grayscale/color files: .png, .jpeg, .gif, .pnm, .tif, .bmp, ...
           - 3D volumetric files: .dcm, .hdr, .nii, .pan, .inr, .pnk, ...
           - Video files: .mpeg, .avi, .mov, .ogg, .flv, ...
           - Generic text or binary data files: .gmz, .cimg, .cimgz, .dlm, .asc, .pfm, .raw,
         .txt, .h.
           - 3D object files: .off
         * When dealing with color images, G'MIC generally reads, writes and displays data using the usual
         sRGB color space.

         * G'MIC is able to manage 3D objects that may be read from files or generated by G'MIC
         commands. A 3D object is stored as a one-column scalar image containing the object data, in the
         following order: { magic_number; sizes; vertices; primitives; colors; opacities }. These 3D
         representations can be then processed as regular images (see command split3d for accessing each
         of these 3D object data separately).

         * Be aware that usual file formats may be sometimes not adapted to store all the available image
         data, since G'MIC uses float-valued image buffers. For instance, saving an image that was initially
         loaded as a 16bits/channel image, as a .jpg file will result in a loss of information. Use the
         G'MIC-specific file extension .gmz to ensure that all data precision is preserved when saving
         images.

         * Sometimes, file options may/must be set for file formats:

           - Video files: Only sub-frames of an image sequence may be loaded, using the input expression
         'filename.ext,[first_frame[,last_frame[,step]]]'. Set 'last_frame==-1' to tell it must be the last
         frame of the video. Set 'step' to '0' to force an opened video file to be opened/closed. Output
         framerate and codec can be also set by using the output expression
         'filename.avi,_fps,_codec,_keep_open' where 'keep_open' can be { 0 | 1 }. 'codec' is a 4-char
         string (see http://www.fourcc.org/codecs.php ) or '0' for the default codec. 'keep_open' tells if
         the output video file must be kept open for appending new frames afterwards.
           - .cimg[z] files: Only crops and sub-images of .cimg files can be loaded, using the input
         expressions 'filename.cimg,N0,N1', 'filename.cimg,N0,N1,x0,x1', 'filename.cimg,N0,N1,x0,y0,x1,y1',
         'filename.cimg,N0,N1,x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1' or 'filename.cimg,N0,N1,x0,y0,z0,c0,x1,y1,z1,c1'.
         Specifying '-1' for one coordinates stands for the maximum possible value. Output expression
         'filename.cimg[z][,datatype]' can be used to force the output pixel type. 'datatype' can be { auto
         | uchar | char | ushort | short | uint | int | uint64 | int64 | float | double }.
           - .raw binary files: Image dimensions and input pixel type may be specified when loading
         .raw files with input expression 'filename.raw[,datatype][,width][,height[,depth[,dim[,offset]]]]]
         '. If no dimensions are specified, the resulting image is a one-column vector with maximum possible
         height. Pixel type can also be specified with the output expression 'filename.raw[,datatype]'.
         'datatype' can be the same as for .cimg[z] files.
           - .yuv files: Image dimensions must be specified when loading, and only sub-frames of an
         image sequence may be loaded, using the input expression 'filename.yuv,width,height[,chroma_subsampl
         ing[,first_frame[,last_frame[,step]]]'. 'chroma_subsampling' can be { 420 | 422 | 444 }. When
         saving, chroma subsampling mode can be specified with output expression
         'filename.yuv[,chroma_subsampling]'.
           - .tiff files: Only sub-images of multi-pages tiff files can be loaded, using the input
         expression 'filename.tif,_first_frame,_last_frame,_step'. Output expression
         'filename.tiff,_datatype,_compression,_force_multipage,_use_bigtiff' can be used to specify the
         output pixel type, as well as the compression method. 'datatype' can be the same as for .cimg[z]
         files. 'compression' can be  { none (default) | lzw | jpeg }. 'force_multipage' can be { 0=no
         (default) | 1=yes }. 'use_bigtiff' can be { 0=no | 1=yes (default) }.
           - .gif files: Animated gif files can be saved, using the input expression
         'filename.gif,fps>0,nb_loops'. Specify 'nb_loops=0' to get an infinite number of animation loops
         (this is the default behavior).
           - .jpeg files: The output quality may be specified (in %), using the output expression
         'filename.jpg,30' (here, to get a 30% quality output). '100' is the default.
           - .mnc files: The output header can set from another file, using the output expression
         'filename.mnc,header_template.mnc'.
           - .pan, .cpp, .hpp, .c and .h files: The output datatype can be selected with
         output expression 'filename[,datatype]'. 'datatype' can be the same as for .cimg[z] files.
           - .gmic files: These filenames are assumed to be G'MIC custom commands files. Loading such
         a file will add the commands it defines to the interpreter. Debug information can be
         enabled/disabled by the input expression 'filename.gmic[,add_debug_info' where 'debug_info' can be
         { 0=false | 1=true }.
           - Inserting 'ext:' on the beginning of a filename (e.g. 'jpg:filename') forces G'MIC to
         read/write the file as it would have been done if it had the specified extension .ext.
         * Some input/output formats and options may not be supported, depending on the configuration flags
         that have been set during the build of the G'MIC software.

         8. Substitution Rules
            ------------------

         * G'MIC items containing '$' or '{}' are substituted before being interpreted. Use these
         substituting expressions to access various data from the interpreter environment.

         * '$name' and '${name}' are both substituted by the value of the specified named variable (set
         previously by the item 'name=value'). If this variable has not been already set, the expression is
         substituted by the highest positive index of the named image '[name]'. If no image has this name,
         the expression is substituted by the value of the OS environment variable with same name (it may be
         thus an empty string if it is not defined).

         * The following reserved variables are predefined by the G'MIC interpreter:

           - '$!': The current number of images in the list.
           - '$>' and '$<': The increasing/decreasing index of the latest (currently running)
         'repeat...done' loop. '$>' goes from 0 (first loop iteration) to nb_iterations - 1 (last
         iteration). '$<' does the opposite.
           - '$/': The current call stack. Stack items are separated by slashes '/'.
           - '$|': The current value (expressed in seconds) of a millisecond precision timer.
           - '$^': The current verbosity level.
           - '$_cpus': The number of computation cores available on your machine.
           - '$_pid': The current process identifier, as an integer.
           - '$_prerelease': For pre-releases, the date of the pre-release as yymmdd. For stable releases,
         this variable is set to 0.
           - '$_version': A 3-digits number telling about the current version of the G'MIC interpreter
         (e.g. '294').
           - '$_host': A string telling about the host running the G'MIC interpreter (e.g. cli or gimp).
           - '$_vt100': Set to 1 if colored text output is allowed on the console. Otherwise, set to 0.
           - '$_path_rc': The path to the G'MIC folder used to store configuration files (its value is
         OS-dependent).
           - '$_path_user': The path to the G'MIC user file .gmic or user.gmic (its value is
         OS-dependent).
           - '$_path_commands': A list of all imported command files (stored as a list-valued variable).
         * '$$name' and '$${name}' are both substituted by the G'MIC script code of the specified named
         custom command, or by an empty string if no custom command with specified name exists.

         * '${"-pipeline"}' is substituted by the status value after the execution of the specified
         G'MIC pipeline (see command status). Expression '${}' thus stands for the current status value.

         * '{``string}' (starting with two backquotes) is substituted by a double-quoted version of the
         specified string.

         * '{/string}' is substituted by the escaped version of the specified string.

         * '{'string'[:delimiter]}' (between single quotes) is substituted by the sequence of character
         codes that composes the specified string, separated by specified delimiter. Possible delimiters are
         ',' (default), ';', '/', '^' or ' '. For instance, item '{'foo'}' is substituted by '102,111,111'
         and '{'foo':;}' by '102;111;111'.

         * '{image,feature[:delimiter]}' is substituted by a specific feature of the image '[image]'.
         'image' can be either an image number or an image name. It can be also eluded, in which case, the
         last image '[-1]' of the list is considered for the requested feature. Specified 'feature' can be
         one of:

           - 'b': The image basename (i.e. filename without the folder path nor extension).
           - 'f': The image folder name.
           - 'n': The image name or filename (if the image has been read from a file).
           - 't': The text string from the image values regarded as character codes.
           - 'x': The image extension (i.e the characters after the last . in the image name).
           - '^': The sequence of all image values, separated by commas ,.
           - '@subset': The sequence of image values corresponding to the specified subset, and separated by
         commas ,.
           - Any other 'feature' is considered as a mathematical expression associated to the image
         '[image]' and is substituted by the result of its evaluation (float value). For instance,
         expression '{0,w+h}' is substituted by the sum of the width and height of the first image (see
         section Mathematical Expressions for more details). If a mathematical expression starts with an
         underscore _, the resulting value is truncated to a readable format. For instance, item '{_pi}'
         is substituted by '3.14159' (while '{pi}' is substituted by '3.141592653589793').
           - A 'feature' delimited by backquotes is replaced by a string whose character codes correspond to
         the list of values resulting from the evaluation of the specified mathematical expression. For
         instance, item '{[102,111,111]}' is substituted by 'foo' and item '{vector8(65)}' by 'AAAAAAAA'.
         * '{*}' is substituted by the visibility state of the instant display window '#0]' (can be {
         0=closed | 1=visible }.

         * '{*[index],feature1,...,featureN[:delimiter]}' is substituted by a specific set of features of
         the instant display window '#0' (or '#index', if specified). Requested 'features' can be:

           - 'w': display width (i.e. width of the display area managed by the window).
           - 'h': display height (i.e. height of the display area managed by the window).
           - 'wh': display width x display height.
           - 'd': window width (i.e. width of the window widget).
           - 'e': window height (i.e. height of the window widget).
           - 'de': window width x window height.
           - 'u': screen width (actually independent on the window size).
           - 'v': screen height (actually independent on the window size).
           - 'uv': screen width x screen height.
           - 'n': current normalization type of the instant display.
           - 't': window title of the instant display.
           - 'x': X-coordinate of the mouse position (or -1, if outside the display area).
           - 'y': Y-coordinate of the mouse position (or -1, if outside the display area).
           - 'b': state of the mouse buttons { 1=left-but. | 2=right-but. | 4=middle-but. }.
           - 'o': state of the mouse wheel.
           - 'k': decimal code of the pressed key if any, 0 otherwise.
           - 'c': boolean (0 or 1) telling if the instant display has been closed recently.
           - 'r': boolean telling if the instant display has been resized recently.
           - 'm': boolean telling if the instant display has been moved recently.
           - Any other 'feature' stands for a keycode name (in capital letters), and is substituted by a
         boolean describing the current key state { 0=pressed | 1=released }.
           - You can also prepend a hyphen '-' to a 'feature' (that supports it) to flush the corresponding
         event immediately after reading its state (works for keys, mouse and window events).
         * Item substitution is never performed in items between double quotes. One must break the
         quotes to enable substitution if needed, as in '"3+8 kg = "{3+8}" kg"'. Using double quotes is then
         a convenient way to disable the substitutions mechanism in items, when necessary.

         * One can also disable the substitution mechanism on items outside double quotes, by escaping the
         {, } or $ characters, as in 3+4 doesn't evaluate.

         9. Mathematical Expressions
            ------------------------

         * G'MIC has an embedded mathematical parser, used to evaluate (possibly complex) math
         expressions specified inside braces '{}', or formulas in commands that may take one as an argument
         (e.g. 'fill').

         * When the context allows it, a formula is evaluated for each pixel of the selected images
         (e.g. 'fill').

         * A math expression may return a scalar or a vector-valued result (with a fixed number of
         components).

         The mathematical parser understands the following set of functions, operators and variables:

         # Usual operators:

         '||' (logical or), '&&' (logical and), '|' (bitwise or), '&' (bitwise and), '!=', '==', '<=', '>=',
         '<', '>', '<<' (left bitwise shift), '>>' (right bitwise shift), '-', '+', '*', '/', '%' (modulo),
         '^' (power), '!' (logical not), '~' (bitwise not), '++', '--', '+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '%=', '&=',
         '|=', '^=', '>>', '<<=' (in-place operators).

         # Usual math functions:

         'abs()', 'acos()', 'acosh()', 'arg()', 'arg0()', 'argkth()', 'argmax()', 'argmaxabs()', 'argmin()',
         'argminabs()', 'asin()', 'asinh()', 'atan()', 'atan2()', 'atanh()', 'avg()', 'bool()', 'cbrt()',

         'narg()', 'prod()', 'rol()' (left bit rotation), 'ror()' (right bit rotation), 'round()', 'sign()',
         'sin()', 'sinc()', 'sinh()', 'sqrt()', 'std()', 'srand(_seed)', 'sum()', 'tan()', 'tanh()',
         'var()', 'xor()'.
         * 'atan2(y,x)' is the version of 'atan()' with two arguments 'y' and 'x' (as in C/C++).

         * 'permut(k,n,with_order)' computes the number of permutations of 'k' objects from a set of 'n'
         objects.

         * 'gauss(x,_sigma,_is_normalized)' returns exp(-x^2/(2*s^2))/(is_normalized?sqrt(2*pi*sigma^2):1).

         * 'cut(value,min,max)' returns 'value' if it is in range '[min,max]', or 'min' or 'max' otherwise.

         * 'narg(a_1,...,a_N)' returns the number of specified arguments (here, 'N').

         * 'arg(i,a_1,..,a_N)' returns the i-th argument 'a_i'.

         * 'isnum()', 'isnan()', 'isinf()', 'isint()', 'isbool()' test the type of the given number or
         expression, and return '0' (false) or '1' (true).

         * 'isfile('path')' (resp. 'isdir('path')') returns '0' (false) or '1' (true) whether its string
         argument is a path to an existing file (resp. to a directory) or not.

         * 'isin(v,a_1,...,a_n)' returns '0' (false) or '1' (true) whether the first value 'v' appears in
         the set of other values 'a_i'.

         * 'inrange(value,m,M,include_m,include_M)' returns '0' (false) or '1' (true) whether the specified
         value lies in range '[m,M]' or not ('include_m' and 'includeM' tells how boundaries 'm' and 'M' are
         considered).

         * 'argkth()', 'argmin()', 'argmax()', 'argminabs()', 'argmaxabs()'', 'avg()', 'kth()', 'min()',
         'max()', 'minabs()', 'maxabs()', 'med()', 'prod()', 'std()', 'sum()' and 'var()' can be called with
         an arbitrary number of scalar/vector arguments.

         * 'vargkth()', 'vargmin()', 'vargmax()', 'vargminabs()', 'vargmaxabs()', 'vavg()', 'vkth()',
         'vmin()', 'vmax()', 'vminabs()', 'vmaxabs()', 'vmed()', 'vprod()', 'vstd()', 'vsum()' and 'vvar()'
         are the versions of the previous function with vector-valued arguments.

         * 'round(value,rounding_value,direction)' returns a rounded value. 'direction' can be {
         -1=to-lowest | 0=to-nearest | 1=to-highest }.

         * 'lerp(a,b,t)' returns 'a*(1-t) + b*t'.

         * 'swap(a,b)' swaps the values of the given arguments.

         # Variable names:

         Variable names below are pre-defined. They can be overridden.
         * 'l': length of the associated list of images.

         * 'k': index of the associated image, in '[0,l-1]'.

         * 'w': width of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'h': height of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'd': depth of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 's': spectrum of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'r': shared state of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'wh': shortcut for width x height.

         * 'whd': shortcut for width x height x depth.

         * 'whds': shortcut for width x height x depth x spectrum (i.e. number of image values).

         * 'im', 'iM', 'ia', 'iv', 'is', 'ip', 'ic', 'in': Respectively the minimum, maximum, average,
         variance, sum, product, median value and L2-norm of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'xm', 'ym', 'zm', 'cm': The pixel coordinates of the minimum value in the associated image, if
         any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'xM', 'yM', 'zM', 'cM': The pixel coordinates of the maximum value in the associated image, if
         any ('0' otherwise).

         * All these variables are considered as constant values by the math parser (for optimization
         purposes) which is indeed the case most of the time. Anyway, this might not be the case, if
         function 'resize(#ind,..)' is used in the math expression. If so, it is safer to invoke functions
         'l()', 'w(_#ind)', 'h(_#ind)', ... 's(_#ind)' and 'in(_#ind)' instead of the corresponding named
         variables.

         * 'i': current processed pixel value (i.e. value located at (x,y,z,c)) in the associated image,
         if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'iN': N-th channel value of current processed pixel (i.e. value located at (x,y,z,N) in the
         associated image, if any ('0' otherwise). 'N' must be an integer in range '[0,9]'.

         * 'R', 'G', 'B' and 'A' are equivalent to 'i0', 'i1', 'i2' and 'i3' respectively.

         * 'I': current vector-valued processed pixel in the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise). The
         number of vector components is equal to the number of image channels (e.g. 'I' = [ R,G,B ] for a
         RGB image).

         * You may add '#ind' to any of the variable name above to retrieve the information for any numbered
         image '[ind]' of the list (when this makes sense). For instance 'ia#0' denotes the average value of
         the first image of the list).

         * 'x': current processed column of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'y': current processed row of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'z': current processed slice of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 'c': current processed channel of the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise).

         * 't': thread id when an expression is evaluated with multiple threads ('0' means __master
         thread__).

         * 'e': value of e, i.e. 2.71828....

         * 'pi': value of pi, i.e. 3.1415926....

         * 'u': a random value between '[0,1]', following a uniform distribution.

         * 'g': a random value, following a gaussian distribution of variance 1 (roughly in '[-6,6]').

         * 'interpolation': value of the default interpolation mode used when reading pixel values with the
         pixel access operators (i.e. when the interpolation argument is not explicitly specified, see below
         for more details on pixel access operators). Its initial default value is '0'.

         * 'boundary': value of the default boundary conditions used when reading pixel values with the
         pixel access operators (i.e. when the boundary condition argument is not explicitly specified, see
         below for more details on pixel access operators). Its initial default value is '0'.

         # Vector calculus:

         Most operators are also able to work with vector-valued elements.
         * '[a0,a1,...,aN-1]' defines a 'N'-dimensional vector with scalar coefficients 'ak'.

         * 'vectorN(a0,a1,,...,aN-1)' does the same, with the 'ak' being repeated periodically if only a few
         are specified.

         * 'vector(#N,a0,a1,,...,aN-1)' does the same, and can be used for any constant expression 'N'.

         * In previous expressions, the 'ak' can be vectors themselves, to be concatenated into a single
         vector.

         * The scalar element 'ak' of a vector 'X' is retrieved by 'X[k]'.

         * The sub-vector '[X[p],X[p+s]...X[p+s*(q-1)]]' (of size 'q') of a vector 'X' is retrieved by
         'X[p,q,s]'.

         * 'expr('formula',_w,_h,_d,_s)' outputs a vector of size 'w*h*d*s' with values generated from the
         specified formula, as if one were filling an image with dimensions '(w,h,d,s)'.

         * Equality/inequality comparisons between two vectors is done with operators '==' and '!='.

         * Some vector-specific functions can be used on vector values: 'cross(X,Y)' (cross product),
         'dot(X,Y)' (dot product), 'size(X)' (vector dimension), 'sort(X,_is_increasing,_nb_elts,_size_elt)'
         (sorted values), 'reverse(A)' (reverse order of components),
         'shift(A,_length,_boundary_conditions)' and 'same(A,B,_nb_vals,_is_case_sensitive)' (vector
         equality test).

         * Function 'normP(u1,...,un)' computes the LP-norm of the specified vector ('P' being an `unsigned
         integer` constant or 'inf'). If 'P' is omitted, the L2 norm is calculated.

         * Function 'resize(A,size,_interpolation,_boundary_conditions)' returns a resized version of a
         vector 'A' with specified interpolation mode. 'interpolation' can be { -1=none (memory content) |
         0=none | 1=nearest | 2=average | 3=linear | 4=grid | 5=bicubic | 6=lanczos }, and
         'boundary_conditions' can be { 0=dirichlet | 1=neumann | 2=periodic | 3=mirror }.

         * Function 'find(A,B,_starting_index,_search_step)' returns the index where sub-vector 'B' appears
         in vector 'A', (or '-1' if 'B' is not contained in 'A'). Argument 'A' can be also replaced by an
         image index '#ind'.

         * A 2-dimensional vector may be seen as a complex number and used in those particular
         functions/operators: '**' (complex multiplication), '//' (complex division), '^^' (complex
         exponentiation), '**=' (complex self-multiplication), '//=' (complex self-division), '^^=' (complex
         self-exponentiation), 'cabs()' (complex modulus), 'carg()' (complex argument), 'cconj()' (complex
         conjugate), 'cexp()' (complex exponential), 'clog()' (complex logarithm),  'ccos()' (complex
         cosine), 'csin()' (complex sine), 'ctan()' (complex tangent), 'ccosh()' (complex hyperpolic
         cosine), 'csinh()' (complex hyperbolic sine) and 'ctanh()' (complex hyperbolic tangent).

         * A MN-dimensional vector may be seen as a M x N matrix and used in those particular
         functions/operators: '*' (matrix-vector multiplication), 'det(A)' (determinant), 'diag(V)'
         (diagonal matrix from a vector), 'eig(A)' (eigenvalues/eigenvectors), 'eye(n)' (n x n identity
         matrix), 'invert(A,_solver)' (matrix inverse), 'mul(A,B,_nb_colsB)' (matrix-matrix multiplication),
         'pseudoinvert(A,_nb_colsA,_solver)', 'rot(u,v,w,angle)' (3D rotation matrix), 'rot(angle)' (2D
         rotation matrix), 'solve(A,B,_nb_colsB)' (solver of linear system A.X = B), 'svd(A,_nb_colsA)'
         (singular value decomposition), 'trace(A)' (matrix trace) and 'transpose(A,nb_colsA)' (matrix
         transpose). Argument 'nb_colsB' may be omitted if it is equal to 1.

         * 'mproj(S,nb_colsS,D,nb_colsD,method,max_iter,max_residual)' projects a matrix 'S' onto a
         dictionary (matrix) 'D'. Equivalent to command mproj but inside the math evaluator.

         * Specifying a vector-valued math expression as an argument of a command that operates on image
         values (e.g. 'fill') modifies the whole spectrum range of the processed image(s), for each spatial
         coordinates (x,y,z). The command does not loop over the c-axis in this case.

         # String manipulation:

         Character strings are defined and managed as vectors objects. Dedicated functions and initializers
         to manage strings are:
         * ['string'] and 'string' define a vector whose values are the character codes of the specified
         character string (e.g. 'foo' is equal to [ 102,111,111 ]).

         * _'character' returns the (scalar) byte code of the specified character (e.g. _'A' is equal to
         '65').

         * A special case happens for empty strings: Values of both expressions [''] and '' are '0'.

         * Functions 'lowercase()' and 'uppercase()' return string with all string characters lowercased or
         uppercased.

         * Function 'stov(str,_starting_index,_is_strict)' parses specified string 'str' and returns the
         value contained in it.

         * Function 'vtos(expr,_nb_digits,_siz)' returns a vector of size 'siz' which contains the character
         representation of values described by expression 'expr'. 'nb_digits' can be { -1=auto-reduced |
         0=all | >0=max number of digits }.

         * Function 'echo(str1,str2,...,strN)' prints the concatenation of given string arguments on the
         console.

         * Function 'string(_#siz,str1,str2,...,strN)' generates a vector corresponding to the concatenation
         of given string/number arguments.

         # Special operators:

         * ';': expression separator. The returned value is always the last encountered expression. For
         instance expression '1;2;pi' is evaluated as 'pi'.

         * '=': variable assignment. Variables in mathematical parser can only refer to numerical values
         (vectors or scalars). Variable names are case-sensitive. Use this operator in conjunction with ';'
         to define more complex evaluable expressions, such as

           t = cos(x); 3*t^2 + 2*t + 1

         These variables remain local to the mathematical parser and cannot be accessed outside the
         evaluated expression.

         * Variables defined in math parser may have a constant property, by specifying keyword 'const'
         before the variable name (e.g. 'const foo = pi/4;'). The value set to such a variable must be
         indeed a constant scalar. Constant variables allows certain types of optimizations in the math
         JIT compiler.

         # Specific functions:

         * 'u(max)' or 'u(min,max)': return a random value between '[0,max]' or '[min,max]', following a
         uniform distribution.

         * 'f2ui(value)' and 'ui2f(value)': Convert a large unsigned integer as a negative floating point
         value (and vice-versa), so that 32bits floats can be used to store large integers while keeping a
         unitary precision.

         * 'i(_a,_b,_c,_d,_interpolation_type,_boundary_conditions)': return the value of the pixel located
         at position (a,b,c,d) in the associated image, if any ('0' otherwise). 'interpolation_type' can
         be { 0=nearest neighbor | 1=linear | 2=cubic }. 'boundary_conditions' can be { 0=dirichlet |
         1=neumann | 2=periodic | 3=mirror }. Omitted coordinates are replaced by their default values which
         are respectively 'x', 'y', 'z', 'c', 'interpolation' and 'boundary'. For instance command

           fill 0.5*(i(x+1)-i(x-1))

          will estimate the X-derivative of an image with a classical finite difference scheme.

         * 'j(_dx,_dy,_dz,_dc,_interpolation_type,_boundary_conditions)' does the same for the pixel located
         at position (x+dx,y+dy,z+dz,c+dc) (pixel access relative to the current coordinates).

         * 'i[offset,_boundary_conditions]' returns the value of the pixel located at specified 'offset' in
         the associated image buffer (or '0' if offset is out-of-bounds).

         * 'j[offset,_boundary_conditions]' does the same for an offset relative to the current pixel
         coordinates (x,y,z,c).

         * 'i(#ind,_x,_y,_z,_c,_interpolation,_boundary_conditions)',
         'j(#ind,_dx,_dy,_dz,_dc,_interpolation,_boundary_conditions)',
         'i[#ind,offset,_boundary_conditions]' and 'i[offset,_boundary_conditions]' are similar expressions
         used to access pixel values for any numbered image '[ind]' of the list.

         * 'I/J[offset,_boundary_conditions]' and 'I/J(#ind,_x,_y,_z,_interpolation,_boundary_conditions)'
         do the same as 'i/j[offset,_boundary_conditions]' and 'i/j(#ind,_x,_y,_z,_c,_interpolation,_boundary
         _conditions)' but return a vector instead of a scalar (e.g. a vector [ R,G,B ] for a pixel at
         (a,b,c) in a color image).

         * 'crop(_#ind,_x,_y,_z,_c,_dx,_dy,_dz,_dc,_boundary_conditions)' returns a vector whose values come
         from the cropped region of image '[ind]' (or from default image selected if 'ind' is not
         specified). Cropped region starts from point (x,y,z,c) and has a size of dx x dy x dz x dc.
         Arguments for coordinates and sizes can be omitted if they are not ambiguous (e.g.
         'crop(#ind,x,y,dx,dy)' is a valid invocation of this function).

         * 'draw(_#ind,S,x,y,z,c,dx,_dy,_dz,_dc,_opacity,_M,_max_M)' draws a sprite 'S' in image '[ind]' (or
         in default image selected if 'ind' is not specified) at coordinates (x,y,z,c). The size of the
         sprite dx x dy x dz x dc must be specified. You can also specify a corresponding opacity mask 'M'
         if its size matches 'S'.

         * 'polygon(_#ind,nb_vertices,coords,_opacity,_color)' draws a filled polygon in image '[ind]' (or
         in default image selected if 'ind' is not specified) at specified coordinates. It draws a single
         line if 'nb_vertices' is set to 2.

         * 'polygon(_#ind,-nb_vertices,coords,_opacity,_pattern,_color)' draws a outlined polygon in image
         '[ind]' (or in default image selected if 'ind' is not specified) at specified coordinates and with
         specified line pattern. It draws a single line if 'nb_vertices' is set to 2.

         * 'ellipse(_#ind,xc,yc,radius1,_radius2,_angle,_opacity,_color)' draws a filled ellipse in image
         '[ind]' (or in default image selected if 'ind' is not specified) with specified coordinates.

         * 'ellipse(_#ind,xc,yc,-radius1,-_radius2,_angle,_opacity,_pattern,_color)' draws an outlined
         ellipse in image '[ind]' (or in default image selected if 'ind' is not specified).

         * 'resize(#ind,w,_h,_d,_s,_interp,_boundary_conditions,_cx,_cy,_cz,_cc)' resizes an image of the
         associated list with specified dimension and interpolation method. When using this function, you
         should consider retrieving the (non-constant) image dimensions using the dynamic functions
         'w(_#ind)', 'h(_#ind)', 'd(_#ind)', 's(_#ind)', 'wh(_#ind)', 'whd(_#ind)' and 'whds(_#ind)' instead
         of the corresponding constant variables.

         * 'if(condition,expr_then,_expr_else)': return value of 'expr_then' or 'expr_else', depending on
         the value of 'condition' { 0=false | other=true }. 'expr_else' can be omitted in which case '0' is
         returned if the condition does not hold. Using the ternary operator
         'condition?expr_then[:expr_else]' gives an equivalent expression. For instance, G'MIC commands

           fill if(x%10==0,255,i)

          and

           fill x%10?i:255

          both draw blank vertical lines on every 10th column of an image.

         * 'do(expression,_condition)' repeats the evaluation of 'expression' until 'condition' vanishes (or
         until 'expression' vanishes if no 'condition' is specified). For instance, the expression:

           if(N<2,N,n=N-1;F0=0;F1=1;do(F2=F0+F1;F0=F1;F1=F2,n=n-1))

          returns the N-th value of the Fibonacci sequence, for 'N>=0' (e.g., '46368' for 'N=24').
         'do(expression,condition)' always evaluates the specified expression at least once, then check for
         the loop condition. When done, it returns the last value of 'expression'.

         * 'for(init,condition,_procedure,body)' first evaluates the expression 'init', then iteratively
         evaluates 'body' (followed by 'procedure' if specified) while 'condition' holds (i.e. not zero). It
         may happen that no iterations are done, in which case the function returns 'nan'. Otherwise, it
         returns the last value of 'body'. For instance, the expression:

           if(N<2,N,for(n=N;F0=0;F1=1,n=n-1,F2=F0+F1;F0=F1;F1=F2))

          returns the 'N'-th value of the Fibonacci sequence, for 'N>=0' (e.g., '46368' for 'N=24').

         * 'while(condition,expression)' is exactly the same as 'for(init,condition,expression)' without the
         specification of an initializing expression.

         * 'break()' and 'continue()' respectively breaks and continues the current running bloc (loop, init
         or main environment).

         * 'fsize('filename')' returns the size of the specified 'filename' (or '-1' if file does not exist).

         * 'date(attr,'path')' returns the date attribute for the given 'path' (file or directory), with
         'attr' being { 0=year | 1=month | 2=day | 3=day of week | 4=hour | 5=minute | 6=second }, or a
         vector of those values.

         * 'date(_attr)' returns the specified attribute for the current (locale) date (attributes being {
         0...6=same meaning as above | 7=milliseconds }).

         * 'print(expr1,expr2,...)' or 'print(#ind)' prints the value of the specified expressions (or image
         information) on the console, and returns the value of the last expression (or 'nan' in case of an
         image). Function 'prints(expr)' also prints the string composed of the character codes defined by
         the vector-valued expression (e.g. 'prints('Hello')').

         * 'debug(expression)' prints detailed debug info about the sequence of operations done by the math
         parser to evaluate the expression (and returns its value).

         * 'display(_X,_w,_h,_d,_s)' or 'display(#ind)' display the contents of the vector 'X' (or specified
         image) and wait for user events. if no arguments are provided, a memory snapshot of the math parser
         environment is displayed instead.

         * 'begin(expression)' and 'end(expression)' evaluates the specified expressions only once,
         respectively at the beginning and end of the evaluation procedure, and this, even when multiple
         evaluations are required (e.g. in 'fill ">begin(foo = 0); ++foo"').

         * 'copy(dest,src,_nb_elts,_inc_d,_inc_s,_opacity)' copies an entire memory block of 'nb_elts'
         elements starting from a source value 'src' to a specified destination 'dest', with increments
         defined by 'inc_d' and 'inc_s' respectively for the destination and source pointers.

         * 'stats(_#ind)' returns the statistics vector of the running image '[ind]', i.e the vector `[
         im,iM,ia,iv,xm,ym,zm,cm,xM,yM,zM,cM,is,ip ]` (14 values).

         * 'ref(expr,a)' references specified expression 'expr' as variable name 'a'.

         * 'unref(a,b,...)' destroys references to the named variable given as arguments.

         * 'breakpoint()' inserts a possible computation breakpoint (useless with the cli interface).

         * '_(expr)' just ignores its arguments (useful for inserting inline comments in math expressions).

         * 'run('pipeline')' executes the specified G'MIC pipeline as if it was called outside the currently
         evaluated expression.

         * 'store(A,'varname',_w,_h,_d,_s,_is_compressed)' transfers the data of vector 'A' as a `w x h x d
         x s` image to the G'MIC variable '$varname'. Thus, the data becomes available outside the math
         expression (that is equivalent to using the regular command 'store', but directly in the math
         expression).

         * 'get('variable_name',_size,_to_numbers)' returns the value of the specified variable, as a vector
         of 'size' values, or as a scalar (if 'size' is zero or not specified).

         * 'name(_#ind,size)' returns a vector of size 'size', whose values are the characters codes of the
         name of image '[ind]' (or default image selected if 'ind' is not specified).

         * 'correlate(I,wI,hI,dI,sI,K,wK,hK,dK,sK,_boundary_conditions,_is_normalized,_channel_mode,_xcenter,
         _ycenter,_zcenter,_xstart,_ystart,_zstart,_xend,_yend,_zend,_xstride,_ystride,_zstride,_xdilation,_y
         dilation,_zdilation)' returns the correlation, unrolled as a vector, of the `wI x hI x dI x
         sI-sized image 'I' with the wK x hK x dK x sK`-sized kernel 'K' (the meaning of the other
         arguments are the same as in command 'correlate'). Similar function 'convolve(...)' is also defined
         for computing the convolution between 'I' and 'K'.

         # User-defined macros:

         * Custom macro functions can be defined in a math expression, using the assignment operator '=',
         e.g.

           foo(x,y) = cos(x + y); result = foo(1,2) + foo(2,3)

         * Trying to override a built-in function (e.g. 'abs()') has no effect.

         * Overloading macros with different number of arguments is possible. Re-defining a previously
         defined macro with the same number of arguments discards its previous definition.

         * Macro functions are indeed processed as macros by the mathematical evaluator. You should
         avoid invoking them with arguments that are themselves results of assignments or self-operations.
         For instance,

           foo(x) = x + x; z = 0; foo(++z)

          returns '4' rather than expected value '2'.

         * When substituted, macro arguments are placed inside parentheses, except if a number sign '#' is
         located just before or after the argument name. For instance, expression

           foo(x,y) = x*y; foo(1+2,3)

          returns '9' (being substituted as '(1+2)*(3)'), while expression

           foo(x,y) = x#*y#; foo(1+2,3)

          returns '7' (being substituted as '1+2*3').

         * Number signs appearing between macro arguments function actually count for empty separators.
         They may be used to force the substitution of macro arguments in unusual places, e.g. as in

           str(N) = ['I like N#'];

         # Multi-threaded and in-place evaluation:

         * If your image data are large enough and you have several CPUs available, it is likely that the
         math expression passed to a 'fill', 'eval' or 'input' commands is evaluated in parallel, using
         multiple computation threads.

         * Starting an expression with ':' or '*' forces the evaluations required for an image to be run in
         parallel, even if the amount of data to process is small (beware, it may be slower to evaluate in
         this case!). Specify ':' (rather than '*') to avoid possible image copy done before evaluating the
         expression (this saves memory, but do this only if you are sure this step is not required!)

         * If the specified expression starts with '>' or '<', the pixel access operators 'i()', 'i[]',
         'j()' and 'j[]' return values of the image being currently modified, in forward ('>') or backward
         ('<') order. The multi-threading evaluation of the expression is disabled in this case.

         * Function 'critical(expr)' forces the execution of the given expression in a single thread at a
         time.

         * 'begin_t(expr)' and 'end_t(expr)' evaluates the specified expression once for each running thread
         (so possibly several times) at the beginning and the end of the evaluation procedure.

         * 'merge(variable,operator)' tells to merge the local variable value computed by threads, with the
         specified operator, when all threads have finished computing.

         * Expressions 'i(_#ind,x,_y,_z,_c)=value', 'j(_#ind,x,_y,_z,_c)=value', 'i[_#ind,offset]=value' and
         'j[_#ind,offset]=value' set a pixel value at a different location than the running one in the image
         '[ind]' (or in the associated image if argument '#ind' is omitted), either with global
         coordinates/offsets (with 'i(...)' and 'i[...]'), or relatively to the current position (x,y,z,c)
         (with 'j(...)' and 'j[...]'). These expressions always return 'value'.

         * The last image of the list is always associated to the evaluations of 'expressions', e.g. G'MIC
         sequence

           256,128 fill {w}

          will create a 256x128 image filled with value 256.

         10. Image and Data Viewers
             ----------------------

         * G'MIC has some very handy embedded visualization modules, for 1D signals (command 'plot'),
         1D/2D/3D images (command 'display') and 3D vector objects (command 'display3d'). It manages
         interactive views of the selected image data.

         11. Adding Custom Commands
             ----------------------

         * New custom commands can be added by the user, through the use of G'MIC custom commands files.

         * A command file is a simple text file, where each line starts either by

           command_name: command_definition

          or

           command_definition (continuation)

         * At startup, G'MIC automatically includes user's command file '$HOME/.gmic' (on Unix) or
         '%APPDATA%/user.gmic' (on Windows). The CLI tool 'gmic' automatically runs the command
         'cli_start' if defined.

         * Custom command names must use character set [a-zA-Z0-9_] and cannot start with a number.

         * Any '# comment' expression found in a custom commands file is discarded by the G'MIC parser,
         wherever it is located in a line.

         * In a custom command, the following '$-expressions' are recognized and substituted:

           - '$*' is substituted by a copy of the specified string of arguments.
           - '$"*"' is substituted by a copy of the specified string of arguments, each being double-quoted.
           - '$#' is substituted by the maximum index of known arguments (either specified by the user or
         set to a default value in the custom command).
           - '$[]' is substituted by the list of selected image indices that have been specified in the
         command invocation.
           - '$?' is substituted by a printable version of '$[]' to be used in command descriptions.
           - '$i' and '${i}' are both substituted by the i-th specified argument. Negative indices such as
         '${-j}' are allowed and refer to the j-th latest argument. '$0' is substituted by the custom
         command name.
           - '${i=default}' is substituted by the value of '$i' (if defined) or by its new value set to
         'default' otherwise ('default' may be a $-expression as well).
           - '${subset}' is substituted by the argument values (separated by commas ',') of a specified
         argument subset. For instance expression '${2--2}' is substituted by all specified command
         arguments except the first and the last one. Expression '${^0}' is then substituted by all
         arguments of the invoked command (eq. to '$*' if all arguments have been indeed specified).
           - '$=var' is substituted by the set of instructions that will assign each argument '$i' to the
         named variable 'var$i' (for i in '[0...$#]'. This is particularly useful when a custom command want
         to manage variable numbers of arguments. Variables names must use character set [a-zA-Z0-9_] and
         cannot start with a number.
         * These particular $-expressions for custom commands are always substituted, even in
         double-quoted items or when the dollar sign '$' is escaped with a backslash 'fR'. To avoid
         substitution, place an empty double quoted string just after the '$' (as in '$""1').

         * Specifying arguments may be skipped when invoking a custom command, by replacing them by commas
         ',' as in expression

           flower ,,3

          Omitted arguments are set to their default values, which must be thus explicitly defined in the
         code of the corresponding custom command (using default argument expressions as '${1=default}').

         * If one numbered argument required by a custom command misses a value, an error is thrown by the
         G'MIC interpreter.

         12. List of Commands
             ----------------

         All available G'MIC commands are listed below, by categories. An argument specified between '[]' or
         starting by '_' is optional except when standing for an existing image '[image]', where 'image' can
         be either an index number or an image name. In this case, the '[]' characters are mandatory when
         writing the item. Note that all images that serve as illustrations in this reference documentation
         are normalized in range [0,255] before being displayed. You may need to do this explicitly
         (command 'normalize 0,255') if you want to save and view images with the same aspect than those
         illustrated in the example codes.

         12.1. Global Options
               --------------

         debug (+):

           Activate debug mode.
           When activated, the G'MIC interpreter becomes very verbose and outputs additional log
           messages about its internal state on the standard output (stdout).
           This option is useful for developers or to report possible bugs of the interpreter.

         h:
             Shortcut for command 'help'.

         help:
             command |
             (no arg)

           Display help (optionally for specified command only) and exit.
           (equivalent to shortcut command 'h').

         version:

           Display current version number on stdout.

         12.2. Input / Output
               --------------

         camera (+):
             _camera_index>=0,_nb_frames>0,_skip_frames>=0,_capture_width>=0,_capture_height>=0

           Insert one or several frames from specified camera.
           When 'nb_frames==0', the camera stream is released instead of capturing new images.

           Default values: 'camera_index=0' (default camera), 'nb_frames=1', 'skip_frames=0' and
             'capture_width=capture_height=0' (default size).

         clut:
             "clut_name",_resolution>0,_cut_and_round={ 0=no | 1=yes }

           Insert one of the 862 pre-defined CLUTs at the end of the image list.
           'clut_name' can be { 2-strip-process | 60s | 60s_faded | 60s_faded_alt | action_magenta_01 |
           action_red_01 | adventure_1453 | agfa_apx_100 | agfa_apx_25 | agfa_precisa_100 |

           Imported commands are available directly after the 'command' invocation.

           Default value: 'add_debug_info=1'.

           Example: [#1] image.jpg command "foo : mirror y deform $""1" +foo[0] 5 +foo[0] 15

         cursor (+):
             _mode = { 0=hide | 1=show }

           Insert images from parent context of a custom command or a local environment.
           Command selection (if any) stands for a selection of images in the parent context.
           By default (adaptive shared state), selected images are inserted in a shared state if they do not
           belong
           to the context (selection) of the current custom command or local environment as well.
           Typical use of command 'pass' concerns the design of custom commands that take images as arguments.
           This commands return the list of corresponding indices in the status.

           Default value: 'shared_state=2'.

           Example: [#1] command "average : pass$""1 add[^-1] [-1] remove[-1] div 2" sample ? +mirror y       +average[0] [1]

             feature_type,_X[%]>=0,_Y[%]>=0,_Z[%]>=0,_exit_on_anykey={ 0 | 1 },_is_deep_selection={ 0 | 1 }

           Interactively select a feature from selected images (use the instant display window [0] if opened).
           'feature_type' can be { 0=point | 1=segment | 2=rectangle | 3=ellipse }.
           Arguments 'X','Y','Z' determine the initial selection view, for 3D volumetric images.
           The retrieved feature is returned as a 3D vector (if 'feature_type==0') or as a 6d vector
           (if 'feature_type!=0') containing the feature coordinates.

           'datatype' can be { auto | uchar | char | ushort | short | uint | int | uint64 | int64 | float |
           double }.
           Specify 'datatype' if all selected images have a range of values constrained to a particular
           datatype,
           in order to minimize the memory footprint.
           The resulting image has only integers values in [0,255] and can then be saved as a raw image of
           unsigned chars (doing so will output a valid .cimg[z] or .gmz file).
           If 'store_names' is set to '1', serialization uses the .gmz format to store data in memory
           (otherwise the .cimg[z] format).

           Default values: 'datatype=auto', 'is_compressed=1' and 'store_names=1'.

           (except if the prepended variant of the command '+store[selection]' is used).
           If a single variable name is specified, all images of the selection are assigned
           to the named variable. Otherwise, there must be as many variable names as images
           in the selection, and each selected image is assigned to each specified named variable.
           Use command 'input $variable' to bring the stored images back in the list.

           If 'width' or 'height' is set to -1, the corresponding dimension is adjusted to the window
           or image size.
           Specify 'pos_x' and 'pos_y' arguments only if the window has to be moved to the specified
           coordinates. Otherwise, they can be avoided.
           'width'=0 or 'height'=0 closes the instant display window.
           'normalization' can be { -1=keep same | 0=none | 1=always | 2=1st-time | 3=auto }.
           'fullscreen' can be { -1=keep same | 0=no | 1=yes }.
           You can manage up to 10 different instant display windows by using the numbered variants
           'w0' (default, eq. to 'w'),'w1',...,'w9' of the command 'w'.
           Invoke 'window' with no selection to make the window visible, if is has been closed by the user.

           3=mirror }.
           * When 'interpolation=={ 3 | 5 | 6 }', 'boundary_conditions' can be { 0=none | 1=neumann }.
           'ax,ay,az,ac' set the centering along each axis when 'interpolation=0 or 4'

           Try to randomly pack as many sprites as possible onto the 'empty' areas of an image.
           Sprites can be eventually rotated and scaled during the packing process.
           First selected image is the canvas that will be filled with the sprites.
           Its last channel must be a binary mask whose zero values represent potential locations for drawing
           the sprites.
           All other selected images represent the sprites considered for packing.

           component).
           The order of sprite packing follows the order of specified sprites in the image list.
           Sprite packing is done on random locations and iteratively with decreasing scales.
           'nb_scales' sets the number of decreasing scales considered for all specified sprites to be packed.
           'min_scale' (in %) sets the minimal size considered for packing (specified as a percentage of the
           original sprite size).
           'spacing' can be positive or negative.

           Find best matching projection of selected matrices onto the span of an over-complete
           dictionary D, using the orthogonal projection or Matching Pursuit algorithm.
           Selected images are 2D-matrices in which each column represent a signal to project.
           '[dictionary]' is a matrix in which each column is an element of the dictionary D.
           'method' tells what projection algorithm must be applied. It can be:
              - 0 = orthogonal projection (least-squares solution using LU-based solver).
              - 1 = matching pursuit.
              - 2 = matching pursuit, with a single orthogonal projection step at the end.
              - >=3 = orthogonal matching pursuit where an orthogonal projection step is performed
                      every 'method-2' iterations.
           'max_iter' sets the max number of iterations processed for each signal.
           If set to '0' (default), 'max_iter' is equal to the number of columns in D.
           (only meaningful for matching pursuit and its variants).
           'max_residual' gives a stopping criterion on signal reconstruction accuracy.
           (only meaningful for matching pursuit and its variants).
           For each selected image, the result is returned as a matrix W
           whose columns correspond to the weights associated to each column of D,
           such that the matrix product D*W is an approximation of the input matrix.

           Default values: 'method=0', 'max_iter=0' and 'max_residual=1e-6'.

         eval (+):
             expression

           Evaluate specified math expression.
           * If no command selection is specified, the expression is evaluated once and its result is set to

         noarg (+):

           Used in a custom command, 'noarg' tells the command that its argument list have not been used
           finally, and so they must be evaluated next in the G'MIC pipeline, just as if the custom
           command takes no arguments at all.

         13. Examples of Use
             ---------------

         gmic is a generic image processing tool which can be used in a wide variety of situations. The
         few examples below illustrate possible uses of this tool:

         ## View a list of images:

           $ gmic file1.bmp file2.jpeg

         ## Convert an image file:

           $ gmic input.bmp output output.jpg

         ## Create a volumetric image from a movie sequence:

           $ gmic input.mpg append z output output.hdr

         ## Compute image gradient norm:

           $ gmic input.bmp gradient_norm

         ## Denoise a color image:

           $ gmic image.jpg denoise 30,10 output denoised.jpg

         ## Compose two images using overlay layer blending:

           $ gmic image1.jpg image2.jpg blend overlay output blended.jpg

         ## Evaluate a mathematical expression:

           $ gmic echo "cos(pi/4)^2+sin(pi/4)^2={cos(pi/4)^2+sin(pi/4)^2}"

         ## Plot a 2D function:

           $ gmic 1000,1,1,2 fill "X=3*(x-500)/500;X^2*sin(3*X^2)+if(c==0,u(0,-1),cos(X*10))" plot

         ## Plot a 3D elevated function in random colors:

           $ gmic 128,128,1,3,"u(0,255)" plasma 10,3 blur 4 sharpen 10000 elevation3d[-1]
         "'X=(x-64)/6;Y=(y-64)/6;100*exp(-(X^2+Y^2)/30)*abs(cos(X)*sin(Y))'"

         ## Plot the isosurface of a 3D volume:

           $ gmic mode3d 5 moded3d 5 double3d 0 isosurface3d "'x^2+y^2+abs(z)^abs(4*cos(x*y*z*3))'",3

         ## Render a G'MIC 3D logo:

           $ gmic 0 text G´MIC,0,0,53,1,1,1,1 expand_xy 10,0 blur 1 normalize 0,100 +plasma 0.4 add blur 1
         elevation3d -0.1 moded3d 4

         ## Generate a 3D ring of torii:

           $ gmic repeat 20 torus3d 15,2 color3d[-1] "{u(60,255)},{u(60,255)},{u(60,255)}" *3d[-1] 0.5,1 if
         "{$>%2}" rotate3d[-1] 0,1,0,90 fi add3d[-1] 70 add3d rotate3d 0,0,1,18 done moded3d 3 mode3d 5
         double3d 0

         ## Create a vase from a 3D isosurface:

           $ gmic moded3d 4 isosurface3d "'x^2+2*abs(y/2)*sin(2*y)^2+z^2-3',0" sphere3d 1.5 sub3d[-1] 0,5
         plane3d 15,15 rotate3d[-1] 1,0,0,90 center3d[-1] add3d[-1] 0,3.2 color3d[-1] 180,150,255
         color3d[-2] 128,255,0 color3d[-3] 255,128,0 add3d

         ## Display filtered webcam stream:

           $ gmic apply_camera

         ## Launch a set of interactive demos:
