NAME
       josm - Java OpenStreetMap Editor

SYNOPSIS
       josm

DESCRIPTION
       JOSM is an editor for OpenStreetMap written in Java 8.

       OpenStreetMap  is  a  project aimed squarely at creating and providing free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them. It allows you to view, edit and use geographical data in a
       collaborative way from anywhere on earth.  The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using
       them in creative, productive or unexpected ways.

       $HOME/.local/share/JOSM
              User data

       $HOME/.cache/JOSM
              Cache

       If the directory $HOME/.josm exists, all files are stored there.

JAVA PROPERTIES
       The following options can be set by using Java system properties (i.e. -Dkey=value passed to java, or specified inside JAVA_OPTS).

       josm.pref=<path>
              Set the JOSM preferences directory.

       josm.userdata=<path>
