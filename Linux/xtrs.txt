Name
       cassette - data cassette image manipulator for xtrs TRS-80 emulator

Synopsis
       cassette

Description
       To  control  the  emulated  cassette used by xtrs, a file called .cassette.ctl in the current directory keeps track of what file is currently “loaded” as the cassette tape and the current position
       within that file.  The cassette shell script provides a way to manipulate this file; typing “help” at its prompt shows its commands.  You may use this script to load  and  position  cassette  tape
       files.  The operation works very much like an actual tape recorder.

       This manual page also describes the image formats that the emulator supports and their limitations.
