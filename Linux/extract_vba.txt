NAME
       extract_vba - A utility to extract a VBA project from an Excel 2007+
       xlsm file.

DESCRIPTION
       This utility is used  to extract the VBA project binary from an Excel
       2007+ xlsm file. The VBA project can then be added to an
       Excel::Writer::XLSX file to enable it to have macros.

       An "xlsm" file is a version of an Excel "xlsx" file that contains an
       additional VBA project binary file. The "xlsm" file format is a
       collection of mainly XML files in a ZIP container.

       The extracted VBA project is an OLE Compound Document in binary format.
       It is named "vbaProject.bin" and is generally located in the "xl"
       directory of the "xlsm" file.

       See the "add_vba_project()" section of the  Excel::Writer::XLSX
       documentation for more details.

       Note: you can also extract the VBA project from an "xlsm" file using
       the standard Linux "unzip" command:

           unzip -j macro01.xlsm xl/vbaProject.bin

       On Windows you can use any suitable Unzip application.

SYNOPSIS
           $ extract_vba file.xlsm
           Extracted 'vbaProject.bin' successfully

           $ extract_vba -h # For help.

OPTIONS
       --help or -h
           Print the help documentation.
