DESCRIPTION
       Epigrass is a software for visualizing, analyzing and simulating of epidemic processes on geo-referenced networks.

       EpiGrass  can  interact  with the GRASS GIS from which it can obtain maps and other geo-referenced information. However, EpiGrass does not require an installation of the GRASS GIS for most of its fea‐
       tures.
