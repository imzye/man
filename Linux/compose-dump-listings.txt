NAME
       compose-dump-listings - dump package listings from a compose

SYNOPSIS
       compose-dump-listings [OPTIONS...]  COMPOSE

DESCRIPTION
       compose-dump-listings  outputs  JSON representation of package listings
       in a compose to stdout. You can specify which variant and/or  architec‐
       tures  you want dump. Also it's possible to filter by package architec‐
       ture.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       --arch=ARCH
              Dump only this architecture. Can be used multiple times.

              This  applies  to  tree  architectures,  so  it  is  actually  a
              basearch.

       --variant=VARIANT
              Dump only this variant. Can be used multiple times.

       --package-arch=ARCH
              Only  output  packages  with this architecture. This is actually
              the true architecture for which the package  was  built.  Source
              packages are never included.

EXIT CODE
       This  tool exits with status code of 0 on success and non-zero value on
       failure.
