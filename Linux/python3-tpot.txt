              INPUT_FILE

       A Python tool that automatically creates and optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.

   positional arguments:
       INPUT_FILE
              Data file to use in the TPOT optimization process.  Ensure that the class label column is labeled as "class".

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              Show this help message and exit.

       -is INPUT_SEPARATOR
              Character used to separate columns in the input file.

       -target TARGET_NAME
              Name of the target column in the input file.

       -mode {classification,regression}
              Whether TPOT is being used for a supervised classification or regression problem.

       -o OUTPUT_FILE
              File to export the code for the final optimized pipeline.

       -g GENERATIONS
              Number of iterations to run the pipeline optimization process. It must be a positive number or None. If None, the parameter max_time_mins must be  de‐
              fined  as  the  runtime  limit. Generally, TPOT will work better when you give it more generations (and therefore time) to optimize the pipeline. TPOT
              will evaluate POPULATION_SIZE + GENERATIONS x OFFSPRING_SIZE pipelines in total.

       -p POPULATION_SIZE
              Number of individuals to retain in the GP population every generation. Generally, TPOT will work better when you give it more individuals (and  there‐
              fore time) to optimize the pipeline. TPOT will evaluate POPULATION_SIZE + GENERATIONS x OFFSPRING_SIZE pipelines in total.

       -os OFFSPRING_SIZE
              Number of offspring to produce in each GP generation.  By default,OFFSPRING_SIZE = POPULATION_SIZE.

       -mr MUTATION_RATE
              GP mutation rate in the range [0.0, 1.0]. This tells the GP algorithm how many pipelines to apply random changes to every generation. We recommend us‐
              ing the default parameter unless you understand how the mutation rate affects GP algorithms.

       -xr CROSSOVER_RATE
              GP crossover rate in the range [0.0, 1.0]. This tells the GP algorithm how many pipelines to "breed" every generation. We recommend using the  default
              parameter unless you understand how the crossover rate affects GP algorithms.

       -scoring SCORING_FN
              Function  used  to evaluate the quality of a given pipeline for the problem. By default, accuracy is used for classification problems and mean squared
              error (mse) is used for regression problems. Note: If you wrote your own function, set this argument to mymodule.myfunctionand TPOT will  import  your
              module  and take the function from there.TPOT will assume the module can be imported from the current workdir.TPOT assumes that any function with "er‐
              ror" or "loss" in the name is meant to be minimized, whereas any other functions will be maximized. Offers the same options as cross_val_score:  accu‐
              racy,   adjusted_rand_score,   average_precision,   f1,   f1_macro,   f1_micro,   f1_samples,   f1_weighted,   neg_log_loss,  neg_mean_absolute_error,
              neg_mean_squared_error, neg_median_absolute_error, precision, precision_macro, precision_micro, precision_samples, precision_weighted, r2, recall, re‐
              call_macro, recall_micro, recall_samples, recall_weighted, roc_auc

       -cv NUM_CV_FOLDS
              Number of folds to evaluate each pipeline over in stratified k-fold cross-validation during the TPOT optimization process.

       -sub SUBSAMPLE
              Subsample  ratio of the training instance. Setting it to 0.5 means that TPOT will use a random subsample of half of training data for the pipeline op‐
              timization process.

       -njobs NUM_JOBS
              Number of CPUs for evaluating pipelines in parallel during the TPOT optimization process. Assigning this to -1 will use as many cores as available  on
              the computer. For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all CPUs but one are used.

       -maxtime MAX_TIME_MINS
              How  many  minutes  TPOT  has  to optimize the pipeline. If not None, this setting will allow TPOT to run until max_time_mins minutes elapsed and then
              stop. TPOT will stop earlier if generationsis set and all generations are already evaluated.

       -maxeval MAX_EVAL_MINS
              How many minutes TPOT has to evaluate a single pipeline. Setting this parameter to higher values will allow TPOT to explore more complex pipelines but
              will also allow TPOT to run longer.

       -s RANDOM_STATE
              Random  number  generator  seed for reproducibility. Set this seed if you want your TPOT run to be reproducible with the same seed and data set in the
              future.

       -config CONFIG_FILE
              Configuration file for customizing the operators and parameters that TPOT uses in the optimization process.  Must be a Python module containing a dict
              export named "tpot_config" or the name of built-in configuration.

       -template TEMPLATE
              Template of predefined pipeline structure. The option is for specifying a desired structurefor the machine learning pipeline evaluated in TPOT. So far
              this option only supportslinear pipeline structure. Each step in the pipeline should be a main class of operators(Selector, Transformer, Classifier or
              Regressor)  or  a specific operator(e.g.  SelectPercentile) defined in TPOT operator configuration. If one step is a main class,TPOT will randomly as‐
              sign all subclass operators (subclasses of SelectorMixin,TransformerMixin, ClassifierMixin or RegressorMixin in scikit-learn) to  that  step.Steps  in
              the  template  are  delimited  by "-", e.g.  "SelectPercentile-Transformer-Classifier".By default value of template is None, TPOT generates tree-based
              pipeline randomly.

       -memory MEMORY
              Path of a directory for pipeline caching or "auto" for using a temporary caching directory during the optimization  process.  If  supplied,  pipelines
              will cache each transformer after fitting them. This feature is used to avoid repeated computation by transformers within a pipeline if the parameters
              and input data are identical with another fitted pipeline during optimization process.

       -cf CHECKPOINT_FOLDER
              If supplied, a folder in which tpot will periodically save the best pipeline so far while optimizing. This is useful in multiple cases:  sudden  death
              before tpot could save an optimized pipeline, progress tracking, grabbing a pipeline while it's still optimizing etc.

       -es EARLY_STOP
              How  many  generations TPOT checks whether there is no improvement in optimization process. End optimization process if there is no improvement in the
              set number of generations.

       -v {0,1,2,3}
              How much information TPOT communicates while it is running: 0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = high, 3 = all. A setting of 2 or higher will add a progress bar
              during the optimization procedure.

       -log LOG
              Save progress content to a file

       --version
              Show the TPOT version number and exit.
