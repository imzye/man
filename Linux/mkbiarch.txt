NAME
       mkbiarch.py  -  make  a  multiple architecture Live boot disk image for
       USB, CF SSD or any disk from 2 architecturally different LiveCD ISO9660
       image files.

SYNOPSIS
       mkbiarch <LiveCDx86ISO>  <LiveCDx64ISO>  <MultipleArch Disk IMG File>

DESCRIPTION
       mkbiarch(8)  create  a  multiple architecture, bootable Live Disk image
       file (IMG) for use on USB or any disk (CF, SSD) from 2  LiveCD  ISO9660
       files of different architecture (ISO).

USAGE
       mkbiarch.py      Fedora-13-i686-Live.iso      Fedora-13-x86_64-Live.iso
       Fedora-13-MultiArch.img

       Then to write it /bin/dd if=Fedora-13-MultiArch.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M

       In the above example, mkbiarch.py  creates  Fedora-Multi-arch.img  from
       the two existing ISO9660 LiveCD image files.  The resulting image file,
       is written to a raw disk device using dd(1)

UNDER THE HOOD
       mkbiarch.py(8) first checks that the two ISO9660 image files exist.  It
       will  create  a blank file using dd(1) writing data from /dev/zero, the
       size of the two ISO9660 images files combined.  The blank file is  then
       bound via loopback using losetup(8) partitioned, and bound at an offset
       via loopback of 512 bytes, this second  loopback  device  is  formatted
       type  ext3 using mke2fs(8) This filesystem is mounted using mount(8) on
       a temporary directory. The two ISO9660 files are then mounted via loop‐
       back,  files are copied using shutil module in Python, from them to the
       newly formatted filesystem in the image file. Data is gathered from the
       ISO9660  image files from it's isolinux.cfg, after the files are copied
       the loopbacked  ISO9660  image  files  are  released.   extlinux(1)  is
       installed  to  the loopback mounted filesystem on the target image file
       and  an  extlinux.conf  is  written.  The  temporary  directories   are
       unmounted  using  umount(8)  and the looback devices are released.  The
       temporary directories are then  removed,  and  the  resulting  Multiple
       Architecture  Disk  Image  File  is moved using shutil to the specified
       location on the command line,  which  is  provided  as  argument  3  to
       mkbiarch.py
