NAME
       Convert::Ascii85 - Encoding and decoding of ascii85/base85 strings

SYNOPSIS
        use Convert::Ascii85;

        my $encoded = Convert::Ascii85::encode($data);
        my $decoded = Convert::Ascii85::decode($encoded);

        use Convert::Ascii85 qw(ascii85_encode ascii85_decode);

        my $encoded = ascii85_encode($data);
        my $decoded = ascii85_decode($encoded);

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the Ascii85 (also known as Base85) algorithm for encoding binary data as text. This is done by interpreting each group of four bytes as a 32-bit integer, which is then
       converted to a five-digit base-85 representation using the digits from ASCII 33 ("!") to 117 ("u").

       This is similar to MIME::Base64 but more space efficient: The overhead is only 1/4 of the original data (as opposed to 1/3 for Base64).

FUNCTIONS
       Convert::Ascii85::encode DATA
       Convert::Ascii85::encode DATA, OPTIONS
           Converts the bytes in DATA to Ascii85 and returns the resulting text string.  OPTIONS is a hash reference in which the following keys may be set:

           compress_zero => 0
               By default, four-byte chunks of null bytes ("\0\0\0\0") are converted to 'z' instead of '!!!!!'. This can be avoided by passing a false value for "compress_zero" in OPTIONS.

           compress_space => 1
               By default, four-byte chunks of spaces ('    ') are converted to '+<VdL'.  If you pass a true value for "compress_space" in OPTIONS, they will be converted to 'y' instead.

           This function may be exported as "ascii85_encode" into the caller's namespace.

       Convert::Ascii85::decode TEXT
           Converts the Ascii85-encoded TEXT back to bytes and returns the resulting byte string. Spaces and linebreaks in TEXT are ignored.

           This function may be exported as "ascii85_decode" into the caller's namespace.
