NAME
       esponja - Optimize HTML code.

SYNOPSIS
       esponja [options] files

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the esponja command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       Esponja  tries to optimize HTML markup. It is not tolerant against non-valid HTML files. If no file is given then it reads from standard input and writes to standard output. If at least on file is
       given then it operates by modifying these files.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options are included below.

       -u     Output html files at intermediate stages of the optimization.

       -v     Switch on verbose mode. Can be iterated to increase the verbosity.

       -n     Do not modify files. Instead, the output of processing file is written to file.esp. This option switches the -v on.

       -help, --help
              Show usage information.
