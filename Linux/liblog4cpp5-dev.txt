NAME
       log4cpp-config - script to get information about the installed version of log4cpp

SYNOPSIS
       log4cpp-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags] [LIBRARIES]

DESCRIPTION
       log4cpp-config is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use log4cpp.

OPTIONS
       log4cpp-config accepts the following options:

       LIBRARIES
               This argument is currently ignored as log4cpp as only one library.

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of log4cpp on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a log4cpp program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a log4cpp program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that log4cpp was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec
               prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified,  use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that log4cpp was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
