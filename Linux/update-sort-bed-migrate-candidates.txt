              The "update-sort-bed-migrate-candidates" utility recursively locates BED and Starch files in the specified parent directory and tests if they require  re-sorting  to  conform  to  the  updated,
              post-v2.4.20 "sort-bed" order.

              Files with the extensions starch, bstarch, gstarch, bed, or bed[g|G]raph in the parent directory are tested. Files without these extensions are ignored.

              If the "--non-recursive-search" option is added, this utility will only search within the specified parent directory, and go no deeper.

              This utility offers one of three (exclusive) actions for migration:

              1. Using "--write-list", files that require re-sorting can have their paths

              written to standard output, which can be written to a file to be processed later on, as desired.

              2. Using "--resort-immediately", qualifying files can be resorted immediately

              after all candidates are found, through a local, serial application of 'sort-bed'.

              3. Using "--resort-in-parallel-via-slurm", candidate files can be migrated by

              applying the 'update-sort-bed-slurm' script to resort in parallel on a computational cluster managed with a SLURM job scheduler.

              Note that one of these three options must be chosen, to perform the stated action, and only one option can be selected.

              When  using  "--resort-immediately"  or  "--resort-in-parallel-via-slurm", the resorted files will have the name of the original BED or Starch file. The original files will have their old name,
              with the ".backup" extension.

              Use the "--bedops-root-dir" option to specify the directory containing the BEDOPS toolkit binaries to be used for migration. You can provide more specific paths to  individual  binaries,  using
              the following options:

              Add  the  "--bedextract-path",  "--sort-bed-path",  "--unstarch-path", "--starch-path", "--starchcat-path", "--update-sort-bed-slurm", and/or "--update-sort-bed-starch-slurm" options to specify
              custom paths to versions of these tools, if desired. These values will be passed along to downstream helper scripts that use them.

       ---

              Suggestions:

              1. Add the "--dry-run" option to "--resort-immediately" or the

              "--resort-in-parallel-via-slurm" options to see the behavior before any filesystem actions are performed. Remove "--dry-run" to perform the specified work.

              2. If you use the resort-via-SLURM option, consider using "--slurm-memory",

              "--slurm-partition", "--slurm-workdir", "--slurm-output", and "--slurm-error" options to match the setup of your particular cluster environment and inputs.

              3. Add "--debug" option to log debug statements to get more detail about

              internal operation of update process.
