NAME
       git-sync - Sync local branch with remote branch

SYNOPSIS
       git sync [--soft] [ <remote> <branch> ]

DESCRIPTION
       Sync local branch with <remote>/<branch>.

       When  <remote>  and  <branch>  are  not  specified on the command line,
       upstream of local branch will be used by default.

       All changes and untracked files and directories will be removed  unless
       you add -s(--soft).

OPTIONS
       --soft or -s

       Add this flag if you want to preserve untracked files.

EXAMPLES
       Sync local branch with its upstream

           $ git sync

       Sync local branch with origin/master

           $ git sync origin master

       Sync without cleaning untracked files:

           $ git sync -s origin master
