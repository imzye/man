NAME
       nextcloudcmd - Command line Nextcloud client tool.

SYNOPSIS
       nextcloudcmd [OPTIONS...] sourcedir nextcloudurl

DESCRIPTION
       nextcloudcmd is the command line tool used for the nextCloud file synchronization desktop utility.

       Contrary  to the nextcloud(1) GUI client, nextcloudcmd only performs a single sync run and then exits. In so doing, nextcloudcmd replaces the ocsync binary used for the same purpose in earlier re‐
       leases.

       A sync run synchronizes a single local directory using a WebDAV share on a remote nextCloud server.

       To invoke the command line client, provide the local and the remote repository: The first parameter is the local directory. The second parameter is the server URL.

       NOTE:
          Prior to the 1.6 release of nextcloudcmd, the tool only accepted owncloud:// or ownclouds:// in place of http:// and https:// as a scheme. See Examples for details.

OPTIONS
       --path Overrides default remote root folder to a specific subfolder on the server(e.g.: /Documents would sync the Documents subfolder on the server)

       --user, -u <user>
              Use user as the login name.

       --password, -p <password>
              Use password as the password.

       -n     Use netrc(5) for login.

       --non-interactive
              Do not prompt for questions.

       --silent, --s
              Inhibits verbose log output.

       --trust
              Trust any SSL certificate, including invalid ones.

       --httpproxy http://[user@pass:]<server>:<port>
              Uses server as HTTP proxy.

       --exclude <file>
              Exclude list file

       --unsyncedfolders <file>
              File containing the list of unsynced folders (selective sync)

       --max-sync-retries <n>
              Retries maximum n times (defaults to 3)

       -h     Sync hidden files,do not ignore them

EXAMPLE
       To synchronize the nextCloud directory Music to the local directory media/music through a proxy listening on port 8080 on the gateway machine 192.168.178.1, the command line would be:

          $ nextcloudcmd --httpproxy http://192.168.178.1:8080 --path /Music \
                        $HOME/media/music \
                        https://server/nextcloud

       nextcloudcmd will enquire user name and password, unless they have been specified on the command line or -n (see netrc(5)) has been passed.

       Using the legacy scheme, it would be:

          $ nextcloudcmd --httpproxy http://192.168.178.1:8080 --path /Music \
                        $HOME/media/music \
                        ownclouds://server/nextcloud
