NAME
       davserver -WebDAV server implementation in Python 3

SYNOPSIS
       davserver OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
        PyWebDAV3 is a WebDAV server implementation in Python 3. It's aim is to provide a simple interface to webdav services to any application which needs it. It can be run as a daemon.

OPTIONS
       -c, --config
           Specify a file where configuration is specified. In this file you can specify options for a running server. For an example look at the config.ini in this directory.

       -D, --directory
           Directory where to serve data from. The user that runs this server must have permissions on that directory. NEVER run as root! Default directory is /tmp

       -H, --host
           Host where to listen on (default: localhost).

       -P, --port
           Port to bind server to (default: 8008).

       -u, --user
           Username for authentication.

       -p, --password
           Password for given user.

       -n, --noauth
           Pass parameter if server should not ask for authentication. This means that every user has access.

       -m, --mysql
           Pass this parameter if you want MySQL based authentication. If you want to use MySQL then the usage of a configuration file is mandatory.

       -J, --lockemu
           Activate experimental LOCK and UNLOCK mode (WebDAV Version 2). Currently know to work but needs more tests. Default is ON.

       -M, --nomime
           Deactivate mimetype sniffing. Sniffing is based on magic numbers detection but can be slow under heavy load. If you are experiencing speed problems try to use this parameter.

       -i, --icounter
           If you want to run multiple instances then you have to give each instance it own number so that logfiles and such can be identified. Default is 0.

       -d, --daemon ACTION
           Make server act like a daemon. That means that it is going to background mode. All messages are redirected to logfiles (default: /tmp/pydav.log and /tmp/pydav.err). You need to pass one of the
           following actions to this parameter, 'start' to start the daemon, 'stop' to stop the daemon, 'restart' to restart the server, or, 'status' to return the status of the server.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       -h, --help
           Show this screen.
