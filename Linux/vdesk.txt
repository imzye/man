NAME
       vdesk - virtual desktops for any window manager

SYNOPSIS
       vdesk DESKTOP [WINDOW-ID]

DESCRIPTION
       vdesk provides virtual desktops portably; it´s mainly useful for lightweight window managers that do not provide the functionality natively.

       Change to DESKTOP; if WINDOW-ID is specified then that window is moved to the specified DESKTOP.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.
