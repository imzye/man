NAME
       nbd-runner

DESCRIPTION
       nbd-runner is a daemon that handles the cmd requests from nbd-clid and the IO requests from nbd.ko in userspace for Gluster/Azblk/Ceph backstores.

SYNOPSIS
       nbd-runner [OPTION]

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help for nbd-runner command

       -t, --threads=<NUMBER>
              Specify the IO thread number for each mapped backstore, 1 as default

       -r, --rhost=<RUNNER_HOST>
              Specify the listening IP address for the RPC Control command requests from nbd-clid/nbd-cli side, such as create/delete/map/unmap/list commands, INADDR_ANY as default.

       -i, --ihost=<IO_HOST>
              Specify the listenning IP for the nbd-runner server to receive/reply the NBD device's IO operations(WRITE/READ/FLUSH/TRIM, etc), INADDR_ANY as default

       -G, --ghost=<IO_HOST>
              Specify the Gluster server IP for the volume to connect to, 'localhost' as default

       -u, --uid=<UID>
