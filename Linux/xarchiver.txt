NAME
       xarchiver - GTK+ front end for archive management

SYNOPSIS
       xarchiver [OPTION] [archive]

DESCRIPTION
       Xarchiver  is  a  lightweight,  desktop environment independent GTK+ front end for handling 7z, a (libraries), apk, AppImage, arj, bzip, bzip2, bzip3, cab, cb7, cbr, cbt, cbz, chm, compress, cpio,
       docx, epub, exe (self-extracting Windows archives), fbz, gzip, iso, jar, jsonlz4, lha, lrzip, lz4, lzip, lzma, lzop, mozlz4, odt, oxt, rar, rzip, snap, squashfs, tar, xpi,  xz,  zip,  zpaq,  zstd,
       tar.bz, tar.bz2, tar.bz3, tar.gz, tar.lrz, tar.lz, tar.lz4, tar.lzma, tar.lzo, tar.rz, tar.xz, tar.Z, tar.zst and (without their package managers) deb and rpm files.
       It  recognizes file types by their file signature (magic number), not by their extension, and uses various (de)compressor/(un)archiver command line programs at runtime. It allows to list, test and
       create archives, add and copy files to them, extract, delete, cut and drag files from them, edit files in them, and paste and drop files into them. Password protected 7z, arj, lrzip, rar  and  zip
       archives are supported and will be recognized.
