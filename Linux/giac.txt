NAME
       giac - computer algebra system

SYNOPSIS
       giac [options] files
       icas [options] files
       xcas  files
       cas_help  keyword

DESCRIPTION
       giac  is  an advanced symbolic and numeric calculator by Bernard Parisse. The console interface is named icas or equivalently giac The corresponding GUI program is called xcas.  These programs has ex‐
       tensive html documentation; One can also obtain some help about a keyword like this:

          0>> ?gcd
          Returns the greatest common divisor of 2 polynomials of several variables
          or of 2 integers or of 2 rationals.
          (Intg(a) or Poly),(Intg(b) or Poly)
          gcd(45,75);gcd(15/7,50/9);gcd(x^2-2*x+1,x^3-1);gcd(t^2-2*t+1,t^2+t-2);
          gcd((x^2-1)*(y^2-1)*z^2,x^3*y^3*z+(-(y^3))*z+x^3*z-z)
          lcm,euler,modgcd,ezgcd,psrgcd,heugcd,Gcd

OPTIONS
       --version
              Show version of program.

       --texmacs
              To call giac/icas from Texmacs

       --emacs
              To call giac/icas from Emacs

SEE ALSO
       The programs are documented fully by GIAC/XCAS manual in html format in /usr/share/giac/doc.

       C++ programers will find some informations about the giac library in the info manual.
