NAME
       sat - Salut à Toi's backend manager

SYNOPSIS
       sat [stop | debug | fg | status]

DESCRIPTION
       sat  is  Salut  à  Toi's core program.  It is used to launch and stop Salut à Toi's backend, which must be running in order to use any of the frontends; note
       that you don't have to run sat manually, it will be started whenever you launch one of the frontends.

       When invoked without argument, the backend is launched in background.  You can also call it with the following arguments:

       •   stop to stop the backend

       •   debug to start the backend in a debugger

       •   fg to start the backend in foreground

       •   status to check whether or not the backend is running

COMMON COMMANDS
       All of the frontends support commands starting with a slash, which are interpreted by the backend. To get the list of these commands, just type /help in  any
       chat window.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SAT_LOG_LEVEL
              debug, info, warning, error or critical (the default level is info)
