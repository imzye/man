NAME
       rampler - module for sampling genomic sequences

DESCRIPTION
       usage: rampler [options ...] <mode>

   <mode>
   subsample <sequences> <reference length> <coverage> [<coverage> ...]

       <sequences>

              input file in FASTA/FASTQ format (can be compressed with gzip) containing sequences to be subsampled

       <reference length>

              integer denoting length of the reference genome (or assembly) from which the sequences originate

       <coverage>

              integer denoting desired coverage of the subsampled sequences

   split <sequences> <chunk size>

       <sequences>

              input file in FASTA/FASTQ format (can be compressed with gzip) containing sequences which will be split into smaller chunks

       <chunk size>

              integer denoting the desired chunk size in bytes

OPTIONS

       -o, --out-directory

              default: current directory path in which sampled files will be created

       --version

              prints the version number

       -h, --help

              prints the usage
