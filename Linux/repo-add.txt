NAME
       repo-add - package database maintenance utility

SYNOPSIS
       repo-add [options] <path-to-db> <package> [<package> ...]

       repo-remove [options] <path-to-db> <packagename> [<packagename> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       repo-add and repo-remove are two scripts to help build a package database for packages built with makepkg(8) and installed with pacman(8).

       repo-add will update a package database by reading a built package file. Multiple packages to add can be specified on the command line.

       If a matching “.sig” file is found alongside a package file, the signature will automatically be embedded into the database.

       repo-remove will update a package database by removing the package name specified on the command line. Multiple packages to remove can be specified on the command line.

       A package database is a tar file, optionally compressed. Valid extensions are “.db” followed by an archive extension of “.tar”, “.tar.gz”, “.tar.bz2”, “.tar.xz”, or “.tar.Z”. The file does not need to
       exist, but all parent directories must exist.

COMMON OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
           Force this program to keep quiet and run silently except for warning and error messages.

       -s, --sign
           Generate a PGP signature file using GnuPG. This will execute gpg --detach-sign --use-agent on the generated database to generate a detached signature file, using the GPG agent if it is available.
           The signature file will be the entire filename of the database with a “.sig” extension.

       -k, --key <key>
           Specify a key to use when signing packages. Can also be specified using the GPGKEY environmental variable. If not specified in either location, the default key from the keyring will be used.

       -v, --verify
           Verify the PGP signature of the database before updating the database. If the signature is invalid, an error is produced and the update does not proceed.

       --nocolor
           Remove color from repo-add and repo-remove output.

REPO-ADD OPTIONS
       -n, --new
           Only add packages that are not already in the database. Warnings will be printed upon detection of existing packages, but they will not be re-added.

       -R, --remove
           Remove old package files from the disk when updating their entry in the database.

EXAMPLE
       repo-add foo.db.tar.xz <pkg1> [<pkg2> ...]

       This creates two separate databases; a smaller database “foo.db.tar.xz” used by pacman and a large database containing package file lists “foo.files.tar.xz” for use by other utilities. While pacman
       can use the large database (if renamed with a db.tar* extension), there is currently no additional benefit for the larger download.
