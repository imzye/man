ledmon.conf(5)                                                                    Intel(R) Enclosure LED Utilities Config                                                                    ledmon.conf(5)

NAME
       ledmon.conf - Configuration file for Intel(R) Enclosure LED Utilities.

DESCRIPTION
       The ledmon configuration file allows you to use advanced settings and functions of Intel(R) Enclosure LED Utilities. The global location of the configuration file is /etc/ledmon.conf. Instead of a
       global configuration file, you can specify a local config file using the -c option when running ledmon.

   SYNTAX
       One line should keep exactly one option and value in the configuration file in format: OPTION=VALUE. Any word that begins with a hash sign (#) starts a comment and that word together with the
       remainder of the line is ignored. Empty lines are allowed. Either single quotes (') or double quotes (") should not be used.

       Values are considered as truth: enabled, true, yes, 1.

       Values are considered as false: disabled, false, no, 0.

       See also the examples section.

   List of configurable options:
       EXCLUDELIST - Ledmon will exclude scanning controllers listed on excludelist.  When allowlist is also set in config file, the excludelist will be ignored.  The controllers should be separated by
       comma (,) character.  The XBD Extended Regular Expressions are supported.  The deprecated name of BLACKLIST is supported for backwards compatibility.  It will be removed in a future release.

       BLINK_ON_INIT - Related with RAID Initialization (resync), Verify (check) and Verify and Fix (repair) processes. If value is set to true - status LEDs of all member drives will blink with proper
       pattern if RAID volume is under sync process. If value is set to false, processes like init or verifications will not be reported by LEDs. The default value is true.

       BLINK_ON_MIGR - RAID can be migrated between some levels or strip sizes and the flag is related with this processes. Also RAID Grow operation will be reported along with this flag. If value is set
       to true - status LEDs of all member drives will blink with proper pattern if RAID volume is under reshape.  If value is set to false, listed actions will not be reported by LEDs. The default value
       is true.

       INTERVAL - The value is given in seconds. Defines time interval between ledmon sysfs scan. The minimum is 5 seconds the maximum is not specified. The default value is 10 seconds.

       LOG_LEVEL - Corresponds with --log-level flag from ledmon. Log level QUIET means no logging at all and ALL means to log everything. The default log level is WARNING. Acceptable values are: quiet,
       error, warning, info, debug, all.  Value also can be set by integer number - 0 means 'quiet' and 5 means 'all'.

       LOG_PATH - Sets a path to local log file. If this option is specified the global log file /var/log/ledmon.log is not used.

       RAID_MEMBERS_ONLY - If flag is set to true ledmon will limit monitoring only to drives that are RAID members. The default value is false.

       REBUILD_BLINK_ON_ALL - Flag is related with RAID rebuild process. When value is set to false - only the drive that the RAID is rebuilding to will be marked with appropriate LED pattern. If value
       is set to true all drives from RAID that is during rebuild will blink during this operation.

       ALLOWLIST - Ledmon will limit changing LED state to controllers listed on allowlist. If any allowlist is set, only devices from list will be scanned by ledmon. The controllers should be separated
       by comma (,) character.  The XBD Extended Regular Expressions are supported.  The deprecated name of WHITELIST is supported for backwards compatibility.  It will be removed in a future release.

EXAMPLES
   Excluding one controller from ledmon scans, changing log level and scans interval:
       LOG_LEVEL=all

       INTERVAL=5

       #Exclude disks from SATA controller

       EXCLUDELIST=/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:17.0

   Blink only on RAID members, blink on all disks during rebuild and ignore init phase:
       RAID_MEMBERS_ONLY=true

       BLINK_ON_INIT=false

       REBUILD_BLINK_ON_ALL=true
