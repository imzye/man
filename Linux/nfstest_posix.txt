TESTS
   access
       Verify POSIX API access() on files with different modes.

   chdir
       Verify POSIX API chdir() by changing to a newly created directory
       and then by changing back to the original directory.

   close
       Verify POSIX API close() works and that writing to a closed file
       descriptor returns an error.

   closedir
       Verify POSIX API closedir() works and that reading to a closed file
       descriptor returns an error.

   creat
       Verify POSIX API creat(path, mode) is equivalent to
       open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, mode). First test with a path
       that does not exist to verify the file was created and then test
       with a path that does exist to verify that the file is truncated.

   fcntl
       Verify the POSIX API fcntl() commands F_DUPFD, F_GETFD, F_SETFD,
       F_GETFL, F_SETFL, and FD_CLOEXEC. The F_DUPFD command is tested
       by performing operations on the original and dupped file descriptor
       to ensure they behave correctly. The F_GETFD and F_SETFD commands
       are tested by setting the FD_CLOEXEC flag and making sure it gets set.
       The F_GETFL and F_SETFL commands are tested by setting the O_APPEND
       flag and making sure it gets set.
       Run the test for both 'read' and 'write'.

   fdatasync
       Verify POSIX API fdatasync().

   fstat
       Verify POSIX API fstat() by checking the mode on a file and that
       it returns the expected structure members. Create a symlink and
       verify that fstat returns information about the link.

   fstatvfs
       Verify POSIX API fstatvfs() by making sure all the members of the
       structure are returned.

   fsync
       Verify POSIX API fsync().

   link
       Verify POSIX API link(src, dst) creates a link and updates
       st_ctime field for the file. Verify that link updates the
       st_ctime and st_mtime for the directory. Verify st_link count
       incremented by 1 for the file.

   lseek
       Verify POSIX API lseek() with different offsets and whence
       values including seeking past the end of the file.

   lstat
       Verify POSIX API lstat() by checking the mode on a file and that
       it returns the expected structure members. Create a symlink and
       verify that lstat returns information about the link.

   mkdir
       Verify POSIX API mkdir(). Verify that mkdir with a path of a symbolic
       link fails. Verify that the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the
       parent directory are updated.

   mmap
       Verify POSIX API mmap() by mapping a file and verifying I/O
       operations. Verify mmap followed by memory read of existing
       file works. Verify mmap followed by memory write to file works.

   munmap
       Verify POSIX API munmap() by mapping a file and then unmapping
       the file.

   opendir
       Verify POSIX API opendir() on a directory.

   read
       Verify POSIX API read() by reading data from a file. Verify that
       the st_atime of the file is updated after the read. Verify a read
       of 0 bytes returns 0.

   readdir
       Verify POSIX API readdir() on a directory.

   readlink
       Verify Test POSIX API readlink() by reading a symbolic link.

   rename
       Verify POSIX API rename() by renaming a file, directory, and a
       symbolic link. Verify that a rename from a file to a symbolic
       link will cause the symbolic link to be removed.

   rewinddir
       Verify POSIX API rewinddir() on a directory.

   rmdir
       Verify POSIX API rmdir() by removing a directory. Verify that the
       parent's st_ctime and st_mtime are updated.

   seekdir
       Verify POSIX API seekdir() on a directory.

   stat
       Verify POSIX API stat() by checking the mode on a file and that
       it returns the expected structure members. Create a symlink and
       verify that stat returns information about the file.

   statvfs
       Verify POSIX API statvfs() by making sure all the members of the
       structure are returned.

   symlink
       Verify POSIX API symlink() by creating a symbolic link and verify
       that the file type is slnk.

   sync
       Verify POSIX API sync().

   telldir
       Verify POSIX API telldir() on a directory.

   unlink
       Verify POSIX API unlink() by unlinking a file and verify that it
       was removed. Verify that the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the
       parent directory were updated. Then unlink a symbolic link and
       verify that the symbolic link was removed but not the referenced
       file. Then remove an opened file and verify that I/O still occurs
       to the file after the unlink and that the file gets removed when
       the file is closed. Create a file and then hard link to it so the
       link count is greater than 1. Unlink the hard file and verify that
       st_ctime field is updated.

   write
       Verify POSIX API write() by writing 0 bytes and verifying 0
       is returned. Write a pattern the file, seek +N, write another
       pattern, and close the file. Open the file and read in both
       written patterns and verify that it is the correct pattern.
       Read in the data from the hole in the file and verify that it is 0.

   open
       Verify POSIX API open() on a file. Verify file creation using
       the O_CREAT flag and verifying the file mode is set to the
       specified value. Verify the st_ctime and st_mtime are updated
       on the parent directory after the file was created. Verify open
       on existing file fails with the O_EXCL flag set. Verify write
       succeeds and read fails if file was open with O_WRONLY. Verify
       read succeeds and write fails if file was open with O_RDONLY.
       Verify that all writes with O_APPEND set are to the end of the file.
       Use O_DSYNC, O_RSYNC, and O_SYNC flags in open calls.
       Verify file open with O_CREAT and O_TRUNC set will truncate an
       existing file. Verify that it updates the file st_ctime and st_mtime.

   chmod
       Verify POSIX API chmod() on a file and directory by trying all valid
       combinations of modes. Verify that the st_ctime files is updated
       for both the file and directory.

EXAMPLES
       The only required option is --server
       $ nfstest_posix --server 192.168.0.11

NOTES
       The user id in the local host must have access to run commands as root using the 'sudo' command without the need for a password.
