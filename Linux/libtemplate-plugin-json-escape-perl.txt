NAME
       Template::Plugin::JSON::Escape - Adds a .json vmethod and a json filter.

SYNOPSIS
           [% USE JSON.Escape( pretty => 1 ) %];

           <script type="text/javascript">

               var foo = [% foo.json %];
               var bar = [% json_string | json %]

           </script>

           or read in JSON

           [% USE JSON.Escape %]
           [% data = JSON.Escape.json_decode(json) %]
           [% data.thing %]

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin allows you to embed JSON strings in HTML.  In the output, special characters such as "<" and "&" are escaped as "\uxxxx" to prevent XSS attacks.

       It also provides decoding function to keep compatibility with Template::Plugin::JSON.

FEATURES
   USE JSON.Escape
       Any options on the USE line are passed through to the JSON object, much like "to_json" in JSON.

   json vmethod
       A ".json" vmethod converts scalars, arrays and hashes into corresponding JSON strings.

           [% json_stuct = { foo => 42, bar => [ 1, 2, 3 ] } %]

           <script>
               var json = [% json_struct.json %];
           </script>

           <span onclick="doSomething([% json_struct.json %]);">

   json filter
       A "json" filter escapes "<", ">", "&", "+", "U+2028" and "U+2029" as "\uxxxx". In the attribute, you may just use an "html" filter.

           [% json_string = '{ "foo": 42, "bar": [ 1, 2, 3 ] }' %]

           <script>
               var json = [% json_string | json %];
           </script>

           <span onclick="doSomething([% json_string | html %]);">

   json_decode method
       A "json_decode" method allow you to convert from a JSON string into a corresponding data structure.

           [% SET json_struct = JSON.Escape.json_decode(json_string) %]
           [% json_struct.foo | html %]
