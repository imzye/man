DESCRIPTION
       trident  is  an  Xorg  driver for Trident video cards.  The driver is accelerated, and provides support for the following framebuffer depths: 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, and 24. Multi-head configurations are
       supported.  The XvImage extension is supported on TGUI96xx and greater cards.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The trident driver supports PCI,AGP and ISA video cards based on the following Trident chips:

       Blade       Blade3D, CyberBlade series i1, i7 (DSTN), i1, i1 (DSTN), Ai1, Ai1 (DSTN), CyberBlade/e4, CyberBladeXP, CyberBladeAi1/XP, BladeXP

       Image       3DImage975, 3DImage985, Cyber9520, Cyber9525, Cyber9397, Cyber9397DVD

       ProVidia    9682, 9685, Cyber9382, Cyber9385, Cyber9388

       TGUI        9440AGi, 9660, 9680

       ISA/VLBus   8900C, 8900D, 9000, 9200CXr, Cyber9320, 9400CXi, 9440AGi These cards have been ported but need further testing and may not work.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "SWCursor" "boolean"
              Enable or disable the SW cursor.  Default: off.

       Option "NoAccel" "boolean"
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is enabled.

       Option "PciRetry" "boolean"
              Enable or disable PCI retries.  Default: off.

       Option "CyberShadow" "boolean"
              For Cyber chipsets only, turn off shadow registers. If you only see a partial display - this may be the option for you. Default: on.

       Option "CyberStretch" "boolean"
              For Cyber chipsets only, turn on stretching. When the resolution is lower than the LCD's screen, this option will stretch the graphics mode to fill the entire LCD. Default: off.

       Option "ShadowFB" "boolean"
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default: off.

       Option "VideoKey" "integer"
              This sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.  Default: undefined.

       Option "TVChipset" "string"
              This sets the TV chipset. Options are CH7005 or VT1621.  Default: off.

       Option "TVSignal" "integer"
              This sets the TV signalling. Options are 0 for NTSC or 1 for PAL.  Default: undefined.

       Option "NoPciBurst" "boolean"
              Turn off PCI burst mode, PCI Bursting is on by default.  Default: off.

       Option "XvHsync" "integer"
              Override the default Horizontal-sync value for the Xv extension.  This is used to center the Xv image on the screen.  By default the values are assigned based on the video  card.   Default:
              0.

       Option "XvVsync" "integer"
              Override the default Vertical-sync value for the Xv extension.  This is used to center the Xv image on the screen.  By default the values are assigned based on the video card.  Default: 0.

       Option "XvBskew" "integer"
              Override  the  default Bottom skew value for the Xv extension.  This is used to extend the Xv image on the screen at the bottom.  By default the values are assigned based on the video card.
              Default: 0.

       Option "XvRskew" "integer"
              Override the default Right skew value for the Xv extension.  This is used to extend the Xv image on the screen at the right.  By default the values are assigned based  on  the  video  card.
              Default: 0.

       Option "Display" "string"
              Override the display.  Possible values are "CRT", "LCD" and "Dual".  Please note that this option is only experimentally.  Default: Use display active when X started.

       Option "Display1400" "boolean"
              Inform driver to expect 1400x1050 display instead of a 1280x1024.  Default: off.

       Option "GammaBrightness" "string"
              Set display gamma value and brightness. "string" is "gamma, brightness", where gamma is a floating point value greater than 0 and less or equal to 10. brightness is an integer value greater
              or  equal  to 0 and less than 128.  Default: gamma and brightness control is turned off.  Note: This is not supported on all chipsets.  Option "AccelMethod" "string" Choose acceleration ar‐
              chitecture, either "XAA" or "EXA".  XAA is the old (but stable) XFree86 based acceleration architecture.  EXA is a newer and simpler acceleration architecture designed to better  accelerate
              the X Render extension.  Default: "XAA".
