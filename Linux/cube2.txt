NAME
       cube2 - a 3D first-person shooter engine

SYNOPSIS
       cube2 [-d] [-wwidth] [-hheight] [-zdepth] [-bbpp] [-asamples] [-t] [-kdirectory] [-fshaderprecision]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cube2 command.

       cube2 is the client and map editor of the Cube2 engine.

OPTIONS
       -d     Run as a dedicated server and don't start the client.

       -wwidth
              Set window width in pixels.

       -hheight
              Set window height in pixels.

       -zdepth
              Set the z-buffer precision to depth in bits.

       -bbpp  Set the bits per pixel to bpp bits.

       -asamples
              Set Full Scene Antialiasing to samples samples.

       -t     Run in windowed mode.

       -kdirectory
              Adds directory to the list of paths, in which the engine searches for files.

       -fshaderprecision
              Set the precision quality. Values from 0 to 3 are allowed. 0 disabled shaders. The lower the value, the faster cube2 will run.

       -f     Don't use any shaders.
