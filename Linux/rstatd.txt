NAME
       rpc.rstatd — kernel statistics server

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/rpc.rstatd [INTERFACE]...

DESCRIPTION
       rpc.rstatd  is  a RPC daemon which collects performance statistics from kernel on serving machine.  This implementation for the Linux Operating System also returns the number of users logged in on
       the remote machine if the information is available.

       It also allows to specify which network interfaces to include in the packet count. If no interface names are specified packets from all interfaces besides the loopback interface are added up.

       The statistics are queried using rup(1) , perfmeter(1) , etc.  The rpc.rstatd daemon is normally invoked by inetd(8).

       rpc.rstatd uses an RPC protocol defined in /usr/include/rpcsvc/rstat.x.
