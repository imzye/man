NAME
       aspic - a line-art processor

SYNOPSIS

       aspic [<options>] [<source> [<destination>]]

DESCRIPTION

       Aspic  is  a program that processes a textual description of a line art graphic, converting it into a form that is suitable for inclusion in another document. The default output format is Encapsu‐
       lated PostScript, but there is also support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). For a full specification, see the reference manual. This man page contains only a description of  the  command  line
       interface.

       If no source or destination is given, Aspic reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output. If only an input file is given, the output file is the same name with its extension re‐
       placed  by .eps or .svg (or added if the input has no extension). A single hyphen character may be given as a file name to indicate the standard input or output streams. Error messages are written
       to the standard error stream.

OPTIONS

       -help     Give some help information and exit.

       -nv       Disable the use of Aspic variables (dollar is no longer special).

       -eps or -ps
                 Output is encapsulated PostScript. This is the default.

       -svg      Output is Scalar Vector Graphics (SVG).

       -tr       Translate certain characters (e.g. grave accent becomes opening quote).

       -v        Verify the Aspic version number, and exit.
