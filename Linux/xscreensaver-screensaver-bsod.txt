NAME
       bsod - Blue Screen of Death emulator

SYNOPSIS
       bsod [--display host:display.screen] [--foreground color] [--background color] [--window] [--root] [--window-id number][--mono] [--install] [--visual visual] [--delay seconds] [--fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The bsod program is the finest in personal computer emulation.

       bsod  steps through a set of screens, each one a recreation of a different failure mode of an operating system.  Systems depicted include Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT, MS-DOS, AmigaDOS 1.3,
       Linux, SCO UNIX, BSD UNIX, HPUX, Solaris, Tru64, VMS, HVX/GCOS6, IBM OS/390, OS/2, MacOS (MacsBug, Bomb, Sad Mac, and OSX), Atari ST, Apple ][+, VMware and NCD X Terminals.

OPTIONS
       bsod accepts the following options:

       --window
               Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       --root  Draw on the root window.

       --window-id number
               Draw on the specified window.

       --mono  If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.

       --install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       --delay delay
               The duration each crash-mode is displayed before selecting another.

       --only which
               Tell it to run only one mode, e.g., --only HPUX.

       --fps   Display the current frame rate and CPU load.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW
               The window ID to use with --root.

X RESOURCES
       Notable X resources supported include the following, which control which hacks are displayed and which aren't.  doWindows, doNT, doWin2K, doWin10, doRansomware, doAmiga, doMac, doMac1,  doMacsBug,
       doMacX, doSCO, doAtari, doBSD, doLinux, doSparcLinux, doHPPALinux, doBlitDamage, doSolaris, doHPUX, doApple2, doOS390, doTru64, doVMS, doMSDOS, doOS2, doHVX, doVMware, and doATM.  Each of these is
       a Boolean resource, they all default to true, except for doAtari, doBSD, doSparcLinux, and doHPPALinux, which are turned off by default, because they're really not all that interesting looking un‐
       less you're a fan of those systems.

       There are command-line options for all of these: e.g., --bsd, --no-bsd.  (Also note the --only option.)

BUGS
       Unlike the systems being simulated, bsod does not require a reboot after running.
