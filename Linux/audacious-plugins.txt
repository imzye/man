NAME
       sfinfo - display information about audio files

SYNOPSIS
       sfinfo file1 file2 ...

DESCRIPTION
       Given  one  or more input audio files, sfinfo displays information about the audio data and the sound file itself, like the file format, audio encoding, sam‐
       pling rate, or duration. The file format must be one of those supported by libaudiofile (currently AIFF, AIFF-compressed, SUN/NeXT audio, WAVE,  BICSF,  AVR,
       IFF/8SVX, and NIST SPHERE), an error is emitted otherwise.

SEE ALSO
       sfconvert(1).
