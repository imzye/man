DESCRIPTION
       nsnake is the classic snake game with textual interface.  You can play it at command-line and uses the nCurses library for graphics.  The rules are the same of any snake game:

       You control a hungry snake and the objective is to eat as many fruits you can.  Each fruit eaten increases your size.  The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

       The challenge is to earn the biggest score possible by eating as many fruits as you can.

       Controls and game settings can be changed through the in-game menus or by directly editing the settings file.
