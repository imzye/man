NAME
       catgirl — IRC client

DESCRIPTION
       catgirl(7) is a terminal IRC client.

       Screenshot: imagine, if you will, text on a screen, next to names in a selection of colours.

   Notable Features
       •   Tab complete: most recently seen or mentioned nicks are completed first.  Commas are inserted between multiple nicks.

       •   Prompt: the prompt clearly shows whether input will be interpreted as a command or sent as a message.

       •   Split scroll: keeps the latest messages in view while scrolling.

       •   URL detection: recent URLs from a particular user or matching a substring can be opened or copied.

       •   Nick coloring: color generation based on usernames remains stable across nick changes.  Mentions of users in messages are colored.

       •   Topic diffing: the modified portion of a channel topic change is highlighted.

       •   Ignore: visibility of filtered messages can be toggled.

       •   Security: on FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the restrict option enables tight sandboxing.  Sandboxing is always used on OpenBSD.

   Non-features
       •   Dynamic configuration: all configuration happens in a simple text file or on the command line.

       •   Multi-network: a terminal multiplexer such as screen(1) or tmux(1) (or just your regular terminal emulator tabs) can be used to connect catgirl to multiple networks.

       •   Reconnection: when the connection to the server is lost, catgirl exits.  It can be run in a loop or connected to a bouncer, such as pounce: https://git.causal.agency/pounce.

       •   CTCP: apart from ACTION, this protocol is useless at best and enables abuse at worst.

       •   Protocol coverage: IRCv3 extensions are implemented only where they contribute to the intended user experience.

       •   Cleartext IRC: TLS is now ubiquitous and certificates are easy to obtain.

INSTALLING
       catgirl requires ncurses and libtls, provided by either LibreTLS: https://git.causal.agency/libretls/about (for OpenSSL) or by LibreSSL.  It targets FreeBSD, OpenBSD, macOS and Linux.  catgirl and
       libtls may be packaged for your system.  Check the Repology pages for catgirl: https://repology.org/project/catgirl/versions and libretls: https://repology.org/project/libretls/versions.

             $ ./configure
             $ make all
             # make install

       Packagers are encouraged to patch in their own text macros in input.c.

       If  installing  libtls manually to /usr/local, for example, make sure /usr/local/lib appears in /etc/ld.so.conf or /etc/ld.so.conf.d/* and be sure to run ldconfig(8) once the library is installed.
       Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH for ./configure to find it.

             $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure

       The sandman wrapper is provided for macOS to stop and start catgirl on system sleep and wake.  To enable it, configure with:

             $ ./configure --enable-sandman
