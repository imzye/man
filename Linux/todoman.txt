DESCRIPTION
       Todoman is a simple, standards-based, cli todo (aka: task) manager. Todos are stored into icalendar files, which means you can sync them via CalDAV using, for example, vdirsyncer.

USAGE
       Todoman usage is CLI based (thought there are some TUI bits, and the intentions is to also provide a fully TUI-based interface).

       The default action is list, which outputs all tasks for all calendars, each with a semi-permanent unique id:

          1 [ ] !!! 2015-04-30 Close bank account @work (0%)
          2 [ ] !              Send minipimer back for warranty replacement @home (0%)
          3 [X]     2015-03-29 Buy soy milk @home (100%)
          4 [ ] !!             Fix the iPad's screen @home (0%)
          5 [ ] !!             Fix the Touchpad battery @work (0%)

       The columns, in order, are:

          • An id.

          • Whether the task has been completed or not.

          • An !!! indicating high priority, !! indicating medium priority, ! indicating low priority tasks.

          • The due date.

          • The task summary.

          • The list the todo is from; it will be hidden when filtering by one list, or if the database only contains a single list.

          • The completed percentage.

       The id is retained by todoman until the next time you run the flush command.

       To  operate  on a todo, the id is what's used to reference it. For example, to edit the Buy soy milk task from the example above, the proper command is todoman edit 3, or todoman undo 3 to un-mark
       the task as done.

       Editing tasks can only be done via the TUI interface for now, and cannot be done via the command line yet.

SYNCHRONIZATION
       If you want to synchronize your tasks, you'll need something that syncs via CalDAV. vdirsyncer is the recommended tool for this.

INTERACTIVE SHELL
       If you install click-repl, todoman gets a new command called repl, which launches an interactive shell with tab-completion.

INTEGRATIONS
       When attempting to integrate todoman into other systems or parse its output, you're advised to use the --porcelain flag, which will print all output in a pre-defined format that will remain stable
       regardless of user configuration or version.

       The format is JSON, with a single array containing each todo as a single entry (object). Fields will always be present; if a todo does not have a value for a given field, it  will  be  printed  as
       null.

       Fields MAY be added in future, but will never be removed.

   Conky
       Todoman  can be used with Conky  by using one of the shell execution variables.  Given the nature of pimutils utilities, there is no need to query new information every time conky updates so execi
       will be the best option most of the time.

       Adding ${execi 30 todo} inside the text section will display the output of the command and update it every 30 seconds.

       A working configuration can be found here.

SORTING
       The tasks can be sorted with the --sort argument. Sorting may be done according to the following fields:

          • description

          • location

          • status

          • summary

          • uid

          • rrule

          • percent_complete

          • priority

          • sequence

          • categories

          • completed_at

          • created_at

          • dtstamp

          • start

          • due

          • last_modified

       It is possible to prepend a - to a field to sort by that field in ascending order (by default they are sorted in descending order).

       Example:

          todo list --sort due,-priority

CONFIGURING
       You'll need to configure Todoman before the first usage, using its simple ini-like configuration file.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file should be placed in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/todoman/config.py. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config is most situations, so this will generally be ~/.config/todoman/config.py.

       cache_path
              The location of the cache file (an sqlite database). This file is used to store todo data and speed up execution/startup, and also contains the IDs for todos.  If the value  is  not  speci‐
              fied, a path relative to $XDG_CACHE_HOME will be used.  $XDG_CACHE_HOME generally resolves to ~/.cache/.

                 type   str

                 default
                        "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/todoman/cache.sqlite3"

       color  By  default todoman will disable colored output if stdout is not a TTY (value auto). Set to never to disable colored output entirely, or always to enable it regardless. This can be overrid‐
              den with the --color option.

                 type   str

                 default
                        "auto"

       date_format
              The date format used both for displaying dates, and parsing input dates. If this option is not specified the system locale's is used.

                 type   str

                 default
                        "%x"

       default_command
              When running todo with no commands, run this command.

                 type   str

                 default
                        "list"

       default_due
              The default difference (in hours) between new todo's due date and creation date. If not specified, the value is 24. If set to 0, the due date for new todos will not be set.

                 type   int

                 default
                        24

       default_list
              The default list for adding a todo. If you do not specify this option, you must use the --list / -l option every time you add a todo.

                 type   str

                 default
                        None

       default_priority
              The default priority of a task on creation.  Highest priority is 1, lowest priority is 10, and 0 means no priority at all.

                 type   int

                 default
                        None

       dt_separator
              The string used to separate date and time when displaying and parsing.

                 type   str

                 default
                        " "

       humanize
              If set to true, datetimes will be printed in human friendly formats like "tomorrow", "in one hour", "3 weeks ago", etc.

              If false, datetimes will be formatted using date_format and time_format.

                 type   bool

                 default
                        False

       path   A glob pattern matching the directories where your todos are located. This pattern will be expanded, and each matching directory (with any icalendar files) will be treated as a list.

                 type   str

                 default
                        None, this field is mandatory.

       startable
              If set to true, only show todos which are currently startable; these are todos which have a start date today, or some day in the past.  Todos with no start date are always  considered  cur‐
              rent. Incomplete todos (eg: partially-complete) are also included.

                 type   bool

                 default
                        False

       time_format
              The date format used both for displaying times, and parsing input times.

                 type   str

                 default
                        "%X"

SAMPLE CONFIGURATION
       The  below  example  should  serve  as a reference. It will read ics files from any directory inside ~/.local/share/calendars/, uses the ISO-8601 date format, and set the due date for new todos in
       48hs.

          # A glob expression which matches all directories relevant.
          path = "~/.local/share/calendars/*"
          date_format = "%Y-%m-%d"
          time_format = "%H:%M"
          default_list = "Personal"
          default_due = 48

COLOR AND DISPLAYNAME
       • You can set a color for each task list by creating a color file containing a color code in the hex format: #RRGGBB.

       • A file named displayname indicates how the task list should be named and is needed when there are multiple directories sharing a name, e.g.: when using multiple $CloudInstances. The  default  is
         the directory name.

       See also relevant documentation for the vdir format.

TIMEZONE
       Todoman will use the system-wide configured timezone. If this doesn't work for you, you _may_ override the timezone by specifying the TZ environment variable.

       For instruction on changing your system's timezone, consult your distribution's documentation.

CAVEATS
       Support for the percent-completed attribute is incomplete. Todoman can only mark todos as completed (100%), and will not reflect nor allow editing for values for percent > 0 ^ percent < 100.
