NAME
       mm-config - OSSP mm library configuration/build utility

VERSION
       OSSP mm 1.4.1 (10-Aug-2006)

SYNOPSIS
       mm-config [--help] [--version] [--cflags] [--ldflags] [--libs]

DESCRIPTION
       The  mm-config  program is a little helper utility for easy configuring and building applications based on the mm(3) library.  It can be used to query the C compiler and linker flags which are re‐
       quired to correctly compile and link the application against the mm(3) library.

OPTIONS
       mm-config accepts the following options:

       --help
           Prints the short usage information.

       --version
           Prints the version number and date of the installed mm(3) library.

       --cflags
           Prints the C compiler flags which are needed to compile the mm(3)-based application. The output is usually added to the "CFLAGS" variable of the applications "Makefile".

       --ldflags
           Prints the linker flags ("-L") which are needed to link the application with the mm(3) library. The output is usually added to the "LDFLAGS" variable of the applications "Makefile".

       --libs
           Prints the library flags ("-l") which are needed to link the application with the mm(3) library. The output is usually added to the "LIBS" variable of the applications "Makefile".

EXAMPLE
        CC=cc
        CFLAGS=-O `mm-config --cflags`
        LDFLAGS=`mm-config --ldflags`
        LIBS=-lm `mm-config --libs`

        all: foo
        foo: foo.o
            $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
        foo.o: foo.c
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
