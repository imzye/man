NAME
       pod2docbook - Convert POD data to DocBook SGML

SYNOPSIS
       pod2docbook [--help] [--doctype=article|chapter|section|refentry] [--title=title] [--spaces=# spaces per indent level] [--fix-double-quotes] [--no-header] [--base-id=idstring] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
       pod2docbook converts files from pod format (see perlpod) to DocBook 4.2 SGML (see <http://www.docbook.org/>).  The program itself is merely a driver for the Pod::2::DocBook class; if you're
       interested in details of pod-to-SGML translation see Pod::2::DocBook.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       [--help]
           Print usage and exit.

       [--doctype=article|chapter|section|refentry]
           Specifies the document type for the output file; the default is section.

       [--title=title]
           Specifies the document title.  The default is infile, if it is supplied, or empty string otherwise.

       [--spaces=# spaces per indent level]
           Specifies the number of spaces per indent level in the SGML output; the default is 2.

       [--fix-double-quotes]
           Replace pairs of double quotes in regular paragraphs with <quote> and </quote> (see Pod::2::DocBook for details).

       [--no-header]
           Omit the DOCTYPE line from the output.

       infile
           The name of the file from which to read pod source; if not supplied, STDIN is used for input.

       outfile
           The name of the file to which to write SGML; if not supplied, STDOUT is used for output.

       [--base-id=idstring]
           The  root  element  of  the  --doctype  will  have  the idstring set for attribute id.  The default is an input file name "cleaned up" to conform with XML restriction for characteds used in id
           strings. (SEE <http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-Name>)

AUTHOR
       Alligator  Descartes <descarte@symbolstone.org> wrote a module called Pod::2::DocBook, which was later maintained by Jan Iven <jan.iven@cern.ch>.  That module was based on the original pod2html by
       Tom Christiansen <tchrist@mox.perl.com>.

       Nandu Shah <nandu@zvolve.com> wrote Pod::DocBook, which is unrelated to the previous module (even though they both perform the same function). (<http://search.cpan.org/~nandu/Pod-DocBook-1.2/>)

       Jozef Kutej <jkutej@cpan.org> renamed the module to Pod::2::DocBook because Nandus version was buried in the CPAN archive as an "UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE".
