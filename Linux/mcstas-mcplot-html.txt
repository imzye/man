NAME
       mcplot-html - Plotting the results of a mcstas simulation in a browser

SYNOPSIS
       mcplot-html [-h] [-n] [-l] [–autosize] [–libpath [LIBPATH ...]] [-o OUTPUT] [simulation ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  front-end mcplot-html is a program that produces plots of all the monitors in a simulation, and it is thus useful to get a quick overview of the simulation results.  In the simplest case, the
       front-end is run simply by typing mcplot-html.  This will plot any simulation data stored in the current directory, which is where simulations store their results by  default.   If  the  --dir  or
       --file  options  have  been used, the name of the file or directory should be passed to mcplot-html, e.g. mcplot-html dir or mcplot-html file.  It is also possible to plot one single text (not bi‐
       nary) data file from a given monitor, passing its name to mcplot-html.  The -h option will list valid options.

       This is the web/html plotting tool (in browser).

OPTIONS
       -h, –help
              show this help message and exit

       -n, –nobrowse
              do not open a webbrowser viewer

       -l, –log
              enable logscale on plot

       –autosize
              expand to window size on load

       –libpath [LIBPATH ...]
              js lib files path

       -o OUTPUT, –output OUTPUT
              specify output file (.html extension)
