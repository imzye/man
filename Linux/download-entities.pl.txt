NAME
       download-entities - download and parse XML Entity definitions

SYNOPSIS
        $ perl download-entities.pl -i # interactive
        $ perl download-entities.pl > output-file.pm
        $ perl download-entities.pl output-file.pm

        # instead of http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/iso9573-2003/
        $ perl download-entities.pl http://my.server.com/entities.html

DESCRIPTION
       This script downloads the definitions of XML entities from
       http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/iso9573-2003/ or from whatever address
       you give it as an argument. The argument should be an URL (that
       LWP::UserAgent::get can access) pointing to a document with (absolute
       or relative) references to files ending with the ".ent" suffix. These
       files are expected to be DTD's with lines like

        <!ENTITY amp "&#38;" >

       The script parses these files and prints the perl module to the
       standard output. If you wish, you can give "file" as another argument
       to the script and it will then print it to "file".  You can also
       specify the output file in the environment variable "OUTPUT_FILE".

       The index and the output file are distinguished by the presence of
       "://" substring.  If you want to use a locally stored index file (the
       one with the .ent references), you can access it by saying

        perl download.pl file:///path/to/index.html

       Note that the script currently distinguishes between relative and
       absolute paths by looking at whether the href contains a "://"
       substring. This can lead to crashes when the links look like
       href="/path/file.ent".

       Also, the script assumes the links have exactly the format href="..." -
       with double quotes.

   Interactive download
       In case you run into problems downloading the documents, you can try to
       run the script with the "-i" or "--interactive" option. This will let
       you skip downloads or enter alternative URLs for individual documents.

       The interactive mode is also triggered when the "INTERACTIVE"
       environment variable is set to a true value (in Perl sense).

   Options
       Beside the "--interactive" option, this script also accepts the
       "--timeout" option. It specifies the timeout for LWP::UserAgent in
       seconds when downloading.  The same is controlled by the
       "DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT" environment variable. The defaule (180s) timeout is
       used when not specified.

        # 10 seconds timeout - croak on failure
        perl download-entities.pl --timeout 10 > XML/Entities/Data.pm
        # 5 seconds timeout - croak on failure
        DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=5 perl download-entities.pl > XML/Entities/Data.pm
        # 1 second timeout - ask on failure
        perl download-entities.pl --interactive --timeout 1 > XML/Entities/Data.pm

   Dependencies
       This script has dependencies that the "XML::Entities" module does not
       and are therefore not mentioned in the META.yml file. These are
       "LWP::UserAgent", "File::Basename" and "Fatal".
