NAME
       pto2mk - Create a Makefile for stitching

SYNOPSIS
       pto2mk [options] -o <output_makefile> -p <output_prefix> <project_file>

        Options:
         -p | --prefix     File path stub for rendered output
         -o | --output     Filename of generated Makefile
         -s | --platform   e.g. linux or MSWin32, defaults to current OS
         -h | --help       Outputs help documentation

DESCRIPTION
       pto2mk takes a hugin .pto project and generates a Makefile containing all the rules necessary for stitching.  The Makefile is typically not portable and contains OS and system specific commands.

       This tool is a perl version of the C++ pto2mk tool shipped with Hugin.  It is intended to test the capability of Panotools::Makefile, and is not intended to replace pto2mk in the future.
