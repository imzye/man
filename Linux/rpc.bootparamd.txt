NAME
     bootparamd — boot parameter server

SYNOPSIS
     rpc.bootparamd [-d] [-s] [-r router] [-f file]

DESCRIPTION
     bootparamd is a server process that provides information to diskless clients necessary for booting. It consults the /etc/bootparams file to find the information it needs.

     This version will allow the use of aliases on the hostname in the /etc/bootparams file. The returned hostname to the whoami request done by the booting client will be the name that appears in
     /etc/bootparams and not the canonical name. In this way you can keep the answer short enough so that machines that cannot handle long hostnames won't fail during boot.

OPTIONS
     -d      Display debugging information.

     -s      Log the debugging information to syslog.

     -r router
             The default router (a machine or an IP-address).  This defaults to the machine running the server.

     -f file
             The file to use as boot parameter file instead of /etc/bootparams.

FILES
     /etc/bootparams

BUGS
     You may find the syslog loggings too verbose.
