NAME
       dablin_gtk - GTK DAB/DAB+ receiver for Linux

SYNOPSIS
       dablin_gtk (options) [file]

DESCRIPTION
       DABlin  plays a DAB/DAB+ audio service – from a live transmission or from a stored ensemble recording (ETI-NI, or EDI AF with ETI). Both DAB (MP2) and DAB+ (AAC-LC, HE-AAC, HE-AAC v2) services are
       supported.

       The GTK GUI version in addition supports the data applications Dynamic Label and MOT Slideshow (if used by the selected service).
