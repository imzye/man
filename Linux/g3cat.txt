NAME
       g3cat - concatenate multiple g3 documents

SYNOPSIS
       g3cat [-l] [-a] g3-file1 ...

DESCRIPTION
       g3cat  concatenates  g3  files.  These can either be 'raw', that is, bitmaps packed according to the CCITT T.4 standard for one-dimensional bitmap encoding, or 'digifax' files, created by GNU's Ghost‐
       Script package with the digifax drivers. Its output is a concatenation of all the input files, in raw G3 format, with two white lines in between.

       If a - is given as input file, stdin is used.

       If the input data is malformed, a warning is printed to stderr, and the output file will have a blank line at this place.

OPTIONS
       -l     separate files with a one-pixel wide black line.

       -h <blank lines>
              specifies the number of blank lines g3cat should prepend to each page. Default is 0.

       -L <lines>
              limit length of output page to maximum <lines> lines.

SPECIAL-CASE OPTIONS
       -w <width>
              specifies the desired page width in pixels per line. Default is 1728 PELs, and this is mandatory if you want to send the fax to a standard fax machine.  If one of the input files doesn't  match
              this line width (for example because it was created by a broken G3 creator), a warning is printed, and the line width is transparently fixed.

       -a     byte-align the end-of-line codes (EOL) in the file. Every EOL will end at a byte boundary, that is, with a  01 byte.

       -p <pad>
              specifies a minimum number of bytes that each output line must be padded to.  Padding is done with 0-bits before the EOL code.

       -R     suppress output of end-of-page code (RTC).

Example
       The following example will put a header line on a given g3 page, 'page1' and put the result into 'page2':

       echo '$header' | pbmtext | pbm2g3 | g3cat - page1 >page2
