NAME
       VIBes-viewer - Visualizer for Intervals and Boxes

SYNOPSIS
       VIBes-viewer

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the VIBes-viewer command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU info(1) format; see below.

       VIBes  is  a visualization system that aims at providing people working with interval methods a way to display results (boxes, pavings), without worrying with GUI programming.  It provides drawing
       functions accessible from a lot of programming languages, without complex installation and library dependencies.  The main design goal of VIBes is to be cross-platform,  available  from  different
       programming languages, simple to set-up, easy to port to a new language.

       The  VIBes-viewer  command  is  the server side of VIBes and features viewing, annotating and exporting figures.  The VIBes API enables your program to communicate with the viewer in order to draw
       figures from different programming languages.
