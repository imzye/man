WHIRLPOOLSUM(1)                  User Commands                 WHIRLPOOLSUM(1)

NAME
       whirlpoolsum - compute and check WHIRLPOOL message digest

SYNOPSIS
       whirlpoolsum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print  or  check  WHIRLPOOL (512-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when
       FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read WHIRLPOOL sums from the FILEs and check them

       --tag  create a BSD-style checksum, always in binary mode

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

              Note: There is no difference between binary and text mode option
              on GNU system.

   The following three options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --quiet
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --strict
              with --check, exit non-zero for any invalid input

       --test invoke Whirlpool API test function and exit

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  sums  are  computed  as described in the official WHIRLPOOL specs.
       When checking, the input should be a former  output  of  this  program.
       The   default  mode   is  to  print  a line with checksum,  a character
       indicating input mode ('*' for binary, space for text),  and  name  for
       each FILE.
