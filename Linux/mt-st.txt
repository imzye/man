NAME
       stinit - initialize SCSI magnetic tape drives

SYNOPSIS
       stinit [-f conf-file] [-h] [-p] [-r] [-v] [devices...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the tape control program stinit can used to initialize SCSI tape drive modes at system startup, after loading the tape driver as module, or after introduction of new de‐
       vice  to  the SCSI subsystem at run-time. The initialization is performed by sending ioctl commands to the drive. The commands are defined in a text file that is indexed using the inquiry data the
       drive returns (manufacturer, device, revision). Values for all of the general and mode-specific SCSI tape parameters up to Linux version 2.6.0 can be initialized.

OPTIONS
       -f conf-file
              Specifies the name of the text file containing the definitions for different tape drive types. By default stinit tries to find the definition file /etc/stinit.def.

       -h     Print the usage information.

       -p     The definition file is parsed but no tape drive initialization is attempted. This option can be used for testing the integrity of a definition file after changes have been made.

       -r     Rewind every device being initialized.

       -v     The more -v options (currently up to two), the more verbose output.

       --version
              Print the program version.

THE DEVICES BEING INITIALIZED
       If the program is started without arguments, it tries to find all accessible SCSI tape devices and the device files for the different modes of the devices. The tape  drives  are  searched  in  the
       scanning order of the kernel and searching is stopped at the first non-existing tape. All of the found devices are initialized if a matching description is found from the parameter file. Note that
       a mode for a device is not initialized if the corresponding device file is not found even if a matching description for the mode exists. The non-rewind device is preferred over the auto-rewind de‐
       vice for each mode. If the directory /dev/tapes is found, the devfs filesystem is assumed to be mounted on /dev. Otherwise, the directories /dev/scsi and /dev are scanned for device files.

       SCSI  tape  drives can be initialized selectively using program arguments. A numeric argument specifies the number of the tape drive in the scanning order of the kernel. A file name specifies that
       the device corresponding to this name is to be initialized. If the file name is given without the directory specification, the program searches for the name in the device directories /dev/scsi and
       /dev.  Only full path names are supported with devfs.

THE CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file is a simple text file that contains descriptions of tape drives and the corresponding initialization parameters. The parameter definition blocks are delimited by {}.  Speci‐
       fication of the drive description is restarted after each parameter definition block.

       The drive descriptions and the parameter definitions consist of pairs name = value.  The value is either a numeric parameter, a string not containing blanks, or a quoted string. In case of  a  nu‐
       meric  parameter, the postfix k or M can be used to give the value in units of 1024 or 1024 * 1024, respectively. If the =value -part is omitted, the value "1" is used. If the character # is found
       from an input line, the rest of the line is discarded. This allows use of comments in the definition file. The following example contains definitions for one type of tape drives:

              # The XY dat
              manufacturer=XY-COMPANY model = "UVW DRIVE" {
              scsi2logical=1 # Common definitions for all modes
              can-bsr can-partitions auto-lock
              # Definition of modes
              mode1 blocksize=0 compression=1
              mode2 blocksize=1024 compression=1
              mode3 blocksize=0 compression=0
              mode4 blocksize = 1k compression=0 }

       The devices are identified using zero or more of the following keywords corresponding to the data returned by the tape device as response to the SCSI INQUIRY command. The matches  are  case-sensi‐
       tive and performed up to the length defined in the configuration file (permitting use of partial matches).

       manufacturer=
              This keyword specifies the string that must match the vendor identification returned by the device.

       model= This keyword defines the string that must match the product identification returned by the device.

       revision=
              This keyword matched the string that must match the product revision level returned by the device.

       All  of  the matching initializations are collected in the order they are defined in the file. This means that common parameters can be defined for all devices using zero keywords for a definition
       block. Another consequence is that, for instance, some parameters can be easily given different values for a specific firmware revision without repeating the parameters common to all revisions.

       The tape parameters are defined using the following keywords. More thorough description of the parameters can be found from the st(4) man page (not up to date when this is  written)  or  from  the
       file  drivers/scsi/README.st in the Linux kernel source tree. The keywords are matched using only the first characters. The part of the keywords not used in matching is enclosed by []. The numeric
       values may be specified either in decimal notation or hexadecimal notation (using the prefix 0x).

       drive-[buffering]=value
              The drive's buffering parameter is set to value.  This parameter if common for all modes.

       cleaning
              The cleaning request notifying parameter is set to value

       no-w[ait]
              The immediate mode is used with commands like rewind if value is non-zero (i.e., the driver does not wait for the command to finish).

       weof-n[o-wait]
              The immediate mode is used when writing filemarks if value is non-zero (i.e., the driver does not wait for the command to finish).

       mode=value
              This keyword starts definition of tape mode value.  The number of the mode must be between 1 and 4.

       disab[led]=value
              This mode is disabled for this device if value is non-zero. Can be used if some mode defined in a more general definition should be disabled by a more specific definition  for  some  device
              (for example, for a device with buggy firmware level).

       block[size]=value
              The default tape block size is set to value.  bytes. The block size zero means variable block mode.

       dens[ity]=value
              The tape density code is set to value.

       buff[ering]=value
              The buffered writes by the driver in fixed block mode are enabled if value is non-zero.

       async[-writes]=value
              Asynchronous writes by the driver are enabled if value is non-zero.

       read[-ahead]=value
              Read-ahead by the driver in fixed block mode is allowed if value is non-zero.

       two[-fms]=value
              Two filemarks are written when a file being written to is closed if value is non-zero. By default, one filemark is written.

       comp[ression]=value
              Compression  of  the  data by the drive is enabled if value is non-zero. Note that the tape driver can't enable compression for all drives that can compress data. Note also that some drives
              define compression using density codes.

       auto[-lock]=value
              The tape drive door is locked automatically when the device file is opened if value is non-zero.

       fast[-eom]=value
              The MTEOM command is performed using the SCSI command that spaces directly to the end of medium if value is non-zero. The drawback is that the file number in the status becomes invalid.  By
              default, spacing to end of medium is performed by spacing over filemarks until end of medium is detected and the file number remains valid.

       can-b[sr]=value
              Backspacing over records is used by the driver when repositioning the tape when read-ahead is enabled if value is non-zero.

       noblk[limits]=value
              The tape driver does not use the READ BLOCK LIMITS SCSI command when the device is being opened if value is non-zero. This is for the drives that do not support this SCSI command.

       can-p[artitions]=value
              The support for tape partitions is enabled if value is non-zero.

       scsi2[logical]=value
              Logical block addresses are used in the MTSEEK and MTIOCPOS commands if value is non-zero. The default is to use the device-specific addresses.

       sili=value
              If  value  is  non-zero, the SILI bit is set when reading in variable block mode. This may speed up reading blocks shorter than the read byte count. Set this only if you know that the drive
              supports SILI and the HBA reliably returns transfer residual byte counts. Requires kernel version >= 2.6.26.

       defs-for-w[rites]=value
              The parameters defining the tape format (density, block size, etc.)  are forced when writing starts at the beginning of a tape if value is non-zero. The default is to change  there  parame‐
              ters each time the device is opened at the beginning of a tape (or the mode is changed in the middle of a tape).

       sysv=value
              The System V tape semantics are used if value is non-zero. Otherwise the BSD semantics are used.

       timeout=value
              The normal timeout for the device is set to value seconds.

       long-time[out]=value
              The long timeout for the device is set to value seconds.

RETURN VALUE
       The  program  exits  with value one if the command line is incorrect, the definition file is not found, option -p is given and parsing the definition file fails, or defining one or more of the op‐
       tions fails when the tape number(s) are given on command line.

RESTRICTIONS
       With the exception of the -p option, the program can be used only by the superuser. This is because the program uses ioctls allowed only for the superuser.
