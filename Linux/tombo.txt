NAME
       tombo - identification of modified nucleotides from raw nanopore sequencing data

SYNOPSIS
       tombo [-h] [-v] {resquiggle,preprocess,filter,detect_modifications,text_output,build_model,plot} ...

DESCRIPTION
       Tombo is a suite of tools primarily for the identification of modified nucleotides from nanopore sequencing data.

       Tombo also provides tools for the analysis and visualization of raw nanopore signal.

Tombo command groups (additional help available within each command group):
       resquiggle
              Re-annotate raw signal with genomic alignment from existing basecalls.

       preprocess
              Pre-process nanopore reads for Tombo processing.

       filter Apply filter to Tombo index file for specified criterion.

       detect_modifications
              Perform statistical testing to detect non-standard nucleotides.

       text_output
              Output Tombo results in text files.

       build_model
              Create canonical and alternative base Tombo models.

       plot   Save plots to visualize raw nanopore signal or testing results.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --version
              show Tombo version and exit.
