NAME
       roard - RoarAudio sound server

SYNOPSIS
       roard [OPTIONS]...

DESCRIPTION
       roard  is  the  most  common  RoarAudio sound server.  The RoarAudio sound server is the central component in a RoarAudio setup.  It mixes up different audio
       streams from it's clients to send them to it's outputs. Such outputs include soundcards, monitoring clients, streaming servers and more.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       NOTE: This list is incomplete!

       --help Print some help text.

       --daemon
              Go into background after startup.

       --realtime
              Ask for higher priority. May be used multiple times.

       --memlock LEVEL
              Sets default memory locking level to LEVEL.

              Valid levels are:

              none   No memory is locked at all.

              low    Only very few (important) objects are locked in memory.

              medium Few (important) objects are locked in memory.

              high   Many objects are locked in memory.

              nearlyall
                     All known objects are locked in memory.

              nearlyallsys
                     All known objects are locked in memory but also pages provided by the system like stack and heap.

              allcur All currently used pages are locked in memory.

              all    All pages (including future allocated pages) are locked in memory.

              default
                     Use defaults (the default).

       A higher memlock level may result in memory allocations problems at runtime and even segfauls on some systems.  (VM killed  processes).  Check  your  current
       system limits before altering this value.

       --watchdog
              Enable watchdog. This will terminate the daemon if something bad happened and it halted.

       --watchdog-time TIME
              Set watchdog time to TIME (in ms).

       --pidfile PIDFILE
              Asks the server to use the given pidfile. This is recommended.

       --sysclocksync
              Messure exact audio clock frequency based on system time. obsolete.

SERVER INFO
       --location  LOC
              Sets lion-readable location of server.  Examples: livingroom, room 32

       --description  DESC
              Sets lion-readable description of server.  Examples: Stereo, UKW Transmitter

       --contact CONTACT
              Sets contact information for the server.

       --serial SERIAL
              Sets the serial number for this device or server.  This is normally only used by embedded systems.

       --uiurl UIURL
              Sets  the  URL of the user interface for this device or server.  This is normally only used by embedded systems.  It is common to set this to a URL of
              type HTTP but all protocols are considered valid. This includes ssh, telnet and others.

STARTUP AND SHUTDOWN
       --start
              Start a new server.

       --stop Stop the currently running server.  See also --shutdown.

       --restart
              Stop the currently running server and start up a new server.

       --shutdown
              Terminates the currently running server after last client has quit.  This is the most clean way to shutdown a running server as it does not  kick  any
              clients.  This option must not be confused with --terminate.

       --terminate
              Auto terminates the new server after last client has quit.  This option must not be confused with --shutdown.

       --script-postdown S
              Run script S after server shutdown.  The script is passed to a shell.  Any shell feature can be used within the string.

STANDBY MODE
       --standby
              Start in standby mode.

       --auto-standby
              Go into standby mode if no streams are active.

LOGGING
       --verbose
              Increment the verbosity level. Can be used multiple times.

       --log-syslog
              Log to syslog.

PLUGINS
       --plugin-load FILENAME
              Load the given plugin.

       --list-plugins
              List loaded plugins.

SECURITY
       --chroot DIR

              Sets GroupID to the audio group as specified via -G.

       --setuid
              Sets UserID to the audio user as specified via -U.

       -U USER
              Sets the user for the UNIX Domain Socket, (default: do not set) You need the permittions to change the UID (normally only root has).

AUTH OPTIONS

              idented
                     Used internally. Should not be used.

              conctl The client is only allowed to do some basic operations only affecting it's own connection.

              guest  Guest access (read only). The client may list resources but not alter them.

              user   Normal user. The client may create and alter most resources.

              pwruser
                     Power  User.  The  client  can create and alter all resources and do all operation but operations which would break the POSIX right system. The
                     user is not allowed to control the server itself like terminating it or alter (system) resources with the rights of the user runnung roard.

                     This is the access level a fully trusted user in a multi user setup should have.

              all    The client can do everything. This includes operations which may alter system resources (like files) with the rights of the user running roard.

                     This accesslevel should be given to the user in case of a single user setup or root or some administrator in a multi user setup.
