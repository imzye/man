CHECK-MODULE(1)             GNU Portability Library            CHECK-MODULE(1)

NAME
       check-module - program to check gnulib modules.

SYNOPSIS
       check-module [OPTIONS] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       The  GNU  portability  library is a macro system and C declarations and
       definitions for commonly-used API elements and abstracted system behav‐
       iors.  It can be used to improve portability and other functionality in
       your programs.

       check-module reads a module description file and  derives  the  set  of
       files  included  directly  by  any .c or .h file listed in the `Files:'
       section. First, it takes the union of all such sets for  any  dependent
       modules. Then, it compares that set with the set derived from the names
       listed in the various Files: sections.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.
