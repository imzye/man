NAME
       hp48cc — C to HP48 RPN compiler

SYNOPSIS
       hp48cc [-V] [-o file] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Hp48cc  is  a C-like compiler that translates input code into the HP48 RPN language.  The language recognized by the compiler is only a small subset of the C language with some non-standard exten‐
       sions.  However, the language is powerful enough to write complex programs simply.

       The options are as follows:

       -o      Set the output destination to file.

       -V      Print version information on standard output then exit.
