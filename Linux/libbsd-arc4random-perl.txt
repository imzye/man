NAME
       BSD::arc4random - Perl interface to the arc4 random number generator

SYNOPSIS
         use BSD::arc4random qw(:all);
         $v = arc4random();
         $v = arc4random_uniform($hz);
         if (!BSD::arc4random::have_kintf()) {
           $v = arc4random_addrandom("entropy to pass to the system");
         } else {
           $v = arc4random_pushb("entropy to pass to the system");
           $v = arc4random_pushk("entropy to pass to the kernel");
         }
         $s = arc4random_bytes(16, "entropy to pass to libc");
         arc4random_stir();
         $s = arc4random_bytes(16);
         print $RANDOM;

DESCRIPTION
       This set of functions maps the arc4random(3) family of libc functions into Perl code.  All functions listed below are ithreads-safe.  The internal XS functions are not, but you are not supposed to
       call them, either.

       On module load, perl's internal PRNG is re-seeded, as a bonus, using srand with an argument calculated from using arc4random_pushb on some entropy returned from rand's previous state.

   LOW-LEVEL FUNCTIONS
       arc4random()
           This function returns an unsigned 32-bit integer random value.

       arc4random_addrandom(pbuf)
           This function adds the entropy from pbuf into the libc pool and returns an unsigned 32-bit integer random value from it.

       arc4random_pushb(pbuf)
           This  function  first  pushes the pbuf argument to the kernel if possible, then the entropy returned by the kernel into the libc pool, then returns an unsigned 32-bit integer random value from
           it.

       arc4random_pushk(pbuf)
           This function first pushes the pbuf argument to the kernel if possible, then returns an unsigned 32-bit integer random value from the kernel.

           This function is deprecated. Use arc4random_pushb instead.

       arc4random_stir()
           This procedure attempts to retrieve new entropy from the kernel and add it to the libc pool.  Usually, this means you must have access to the urandom(4)  device;  create  it  inside  chroot(2)
           jails first if you use them.

       have_kintf()
           This constant function returns 1 if arc4random_pushb and/or arc4random_pushk actually call the kernel interfaces, 0 if they merely map to arc4random_addrandom instead.

   HIGH-LEVEL FUNCTIONS
       arc4random_bytes(num[, pbuf])
           This function returns a string containing as many random bytes as requested by the integral argument num.  An optional pbuf argument is passed to the system first.

       arc4random_uniform(upper_bound)
           Calculate a uniformly distributed random number less than upper_bound avoiding "modulo bias".

   PACKAGE VARIABLES
       $RANDOM
           The $RANDOM returns a random value in the range [0; 32767] on each read attempt and pushes any value it is assigned to the kernel.  It is tied at module load time.

       tie variable, 'BSD::arc4random'[, max]
           You  can  tie any scalar variable to this package; the max argument is the maximum number returned; if undefined, 0 or >= 0xFFFFFFFF, no bound is used, and values in the range [0; 2**32-1] are
           returned.  They will behave like $RANDOM.
