NAME
       grepseq - <optional description of the program>

SYNOPSIS
       grepseq [options] <pattern> <files ...>

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file. With the -v, --invert-match option (see below), count non-matching lines.

       -H, --with-filename
              Print the filename for each match.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and input files.

       -m NUM, --max-count=NUM
              Stop  reading  a  file  after  NUM matching lines. When the -c or --count option is also used, grepseq does not output a count greater than NUM. When the -v or --invert-match option is also
              used, grep stops after outputting NUM non-matching lines.

       -N, --names-only
              Search only sequence names. Cannot be used with -S.

       -S, --sequences-only
              Search only sequences. Cannot be used with -N.

       -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
