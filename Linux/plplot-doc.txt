NAME
       plcont - Contour plot

SYNOPSIS
       plcont(f, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel, pltr, pltr_data)

DESCRIPTION
       Draws a contour plot of the data in f[nx][ny], using the nlevel contour levels specified by clevel. Only the region of the matrix from kx to lx and from ky to ly is plotted out where all these in‐
       dex  ranges  are  interpreted  as one-based for historical reasons.  A transformation routine pointed to by pltr with a generic pointer pltr_data for additional data required by the transformation
       routine is used to map indices within the matrix to the world coordinates.

       Redacted form: plcont(f, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, pltr, pltr_data) where (see above discussion) the pltr, pltr_data callback arguments are sometimes replaced by a tr vector with 6 elements; xg  and
       yg vectors; or xg and yg matrices.

       This function is used in examples 9, 14, 16, and 22.

ARGUMENTS
       f (PLFLT_MATRIX(3plplot), input)
              A matrix containing data to be contoured.

       nx, ny (PLINT(3plplot), input)
              The dimensions of the matrix f.

       kx, lx (PLINT(3plplot), input)
              Range of x indices to consider where 0 <= kx-1 < lx-1 < nx.  Values of kx and lx are one-based rather than zero-based for historical backwards-compatibility reasons.

       ky, ly (PLINT(3plplot), input)
              Range of y indices to consider where 0 <= ky-1 < ly-1 < ny.  Values of ky and ly are one-based rather than zero-based for historical backwards-compatibility reasons.

       clevel (PLFLT_VECTOR(3plplot), input)
              A vector specifying the levels at which to draw contours.

       nlevel (PLINT(3plplot), input)
              Number of contour levels to draw.

       pltr (PLTRANSFORM_callback(3plplot), input)
              A  callback  function  that  defines the transformation between the zero-based indices of the matrix f and the world coordinates.For the C case, transformation functions are provided in the
              PLplot library: pltr0(3plplot) for the identity mapping, and pltr1(3plplot) and pltr2(3plplot) for arbitrary mappings respectively defined by vectors and matrices.  In addition, C  callback
              routines  for  the  transformation  can be supplied by the user such as the mypltr function in examples/c/x09c.c which provides a general linear transformation between index coordinates and
              world coordinates.For languages other than C you should consult the PLplot documentation for the details concerning how PLTRANSFORM_callback(3plplot) arguments are interfaced.  However,  in
              general,  a  particular pattern of callback-associated arguments such as a tr vector with 6 elements; xg and yg vectors; or xg and yg matrices are respectively interfaced to a linear-trans‐
              formation routine similar to the above mypltr function; pltr1(3plplot); and pltr2(3plplot). Furthermore, some of our more sophisticated bindings (see, e.g., the PLplot  documentation)  sup‐
              port  native  language callbacks for handling index to world-coordinate transformations.  Examples of these various approaches are given in examples/<language>x09*, examples/<language>x16*,
              examples/<language>x20*, examples/<language>x21*, and examples/<language>x22*, for all our supported languages.

       pltr_data (PLPointer(3plplot), input)
              Extra parameter to help pass information to pltr0(3plplot), pltr1(3plplot), pltr2(3plplot), or whatever callback routine that is externally supplied.
