NAME
       Seren - A simple VoIP program to create conferences from the terminal

SYNOPSIS
       seren [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       Seren is a simple VoIP program based on the Opus codec that allows you to create a voice conference from the terminal, with up to 10 participants, without having to register accounts, exchange emails,
       or add people to contact lists. All you need to join an existing conference is the host name or IP address of one of the participants.  Seren creates a dynamic peer-to-peer network of equivalent nodes
       which exchange text and audio data using a udp connection, and offers the user the ability to change the quality/bitrate on the fly, encrypt the traffic and record the calls.

       This manual page documents briefly the seren command. Please refer to the README file to get more information on how to use Seren.

OPTIONS
       A summary of command line options is included below.

       -h     Print help, showing a list of available command line options. The values in parentheses on the right are the default values.

       -v     Increment verbosity level.  -v enables verbose messages and -v -v enables verbose and debug messages.

       -L logfile
              Send log messages to logfile (default: $HOME/.seren/seren.log)

       -N     Disable ncurses interface and run Seren as a pure command line application.

       -t theme
              Set ncurses theme: 0-simple, 1-dark, 2-clear (default: 1).

       -n nick
              Set nickname (default: login name).

       -p port
              Set udp listening port (default: 8110).

       -b bitrate
              Set Opus encoding bitrate in bit/s (default: 16000).

       -C complexity
              Set  Opus  encoding  complexity.  The supported range is 0-10 inclusive with 10 representing the highest complexity.  Small values will make Seren run faster, at the expense of quality. You may
              want to lower this value if you are on a embedded system like the Raspberry Pi or if you notice that Seren is using up all your cpu time (default: 10).

       -d audiodev
              Set alsa playback audio device. If you get an error with the device hw:0,0 try prepending plug to the device name, es. plughw:0,0. If your system has pulseaudio installed, it should be possible
              to specify 'pulse' to use it.  (default: depends on how Seren was configured, see the output of -h option).

       -D audiodev
              Set alsa capture audio device. Useful if you want to use two different audio devices for playback and capture.  (default: same value specified for playback device)

       -c host[:port]
              Automatically call the specified host on startup.

       -a     Autoaccept calls. If this options is enabled Seren will accept every incoming call without asking the user first.

       -S     Disable STUN to retrieve the external IP address.

FILES
       $HOME/.seren/seren.log
              Log file.

       $HOME/.seren/seren.conf
              Configuration file.

       $HOME/.seren/history
              Command history file.

       $HOME/.seren/fifo_in
              Input  fifo:  accepts  raw  audio in 48000Hz/2ch/s16_le format. When fifos are enabled (using the /f command), writing to this fifo will make Seren mix this pcm audio signal with the one coming
              from the sound card. Useful if you want to transmit pre-recorded audio together with your own voice.

       $HOME/.seren/fifo_out
              Output fifo: provides raw audio in 48000Hz/2ch/s16_le format. When fifos are enabled (using the /f command), reading from this fifo will allow you to get the pcm audio signal of the  conference
              and pipe it to another process.
