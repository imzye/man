HWLOC-GATHER-CPUID(1)                hwloc               HWLOC-GATHER-CPUID(1)

NAME
       hwloc-gather-cpuid  -  Dumps  the  relevant  x86 cpuid values for later
       (possibly offline) usage

SYNOPSIS
       hwloc-gather-cpuid [options] [<outdir>]

OPTIONS
       -c <idx>
              Only gather cpuid values for logical processor whose OS/physical
              index is <idx>.

       -s --silent
              Do not show verbose messages.

       -h --help
              Display help message and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       hwloc-gather-cpuid  dumps all the relevant x86 cpuid values into subdi‐
       rectory cpuid of current directory, or in <outdir> if specified.

       These files can be used later to explore the machine topology  offline,
       for  instance  by  setting the environment variable HWLOC_CPUID_PATH to
       the directory containing all output files, and by forcing the x86 back‐
       end with HWLOC_COMPONENTS=x86,stop.

       The  directory  contents  may  also be submitted to hwloc developers to
       debug issues remotely.

       If - is used as <outdir>, the output is dumped to the standard  output,
       but a unique logical processor must have been given with -c.

       hwloc-gather-cpuid  is  a x86 specific tool, it cannot be used on other
       platforms.

       NOTE: hwloc-gather-cpuid gathers many hardware details about the  plat‐
       form.   Output  files  should not be posted on public lists or websites
       unless it is clear that they contain no sensitive information.

       NOTE: The output of hwloc-gather-cpuid is included in the tarball saved
       by hwloc-gather-topology on Linux/x86.

       NOTE: It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page
       before reading this man page.

EXAMPLES
       To store cpuid information of all logical  processors  of  the  current
       machine:

               $ hwloc-gather-cpuid
               Gathering in directory ./cpuid ...
               Gathering CPUID of PU P#0 in path ./hwloc-x86-cpuid/pu0 ...
               Gathering CPUID of PU P#1 in path ./hwloc-x86-cpuid/pu1 ...
               Gathering CPUID of PU P#2 in path ./hwloc-x86-cpuid/pu2 ...
               Gathering CPUID of PU P#3 in path ./hwloc-x86-cpuid/pu3 ...
               Summary written to ./cpuid/hwloc-cpuid-info

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  execution, hwloc-gather-cpuid will exit with the code
       0.

       hwloc-gather-cpuid will return nonzero exit status if any kind of error
       occurs,  such  as  (but  not  limited  to) failure to create the output
       files.
