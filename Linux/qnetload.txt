NAME
       qnetload - Graphically display network speed and usage

SYNOPSIS
       qnetload

DESCRIPTION
       Graphically display network speed and usage.

       -i, --interface=INTERFACE
              Display network INTERFACE. For example: eth0, wlan0. If unsure, do not specify.

              When running the interface can be changed by clicking on it. Right-click on the interface to list the available interfaces.

       -h, --help
              Display help for commandline options.

       -v, --version
              Display version information.

       --help-all
              Display help including Qt-specific options.

USING QNETLOAD
       Some features on qnetload might not obvious:

         • Click on the interface to change it.

         • Right-click anywhere on qnetload to display a contextual menu with the list of interfaces, the IP and the version. The most common interfaces are in bold (ethX, wlanX, etc.).

         • There are two buttons: pause the accumulative counter of Downloaded and Uploaded data and reset the counter. To reset the counters, click twice.

         • Clicking in the graph will display how much data has been downloaded and uploaded since the position of the click and a projection for the next hour's usage.

         • Hover the mouse pointer over any of the numbers to display the meaning of the value.

ORIGINAL IDEA FROM XNETLOAD
       qnetload has the same look and feel as xnetload, which is no longer maintained. The q in the name is because qnetload is implemented using the Qt libraries.

FILES
       ${HOME}/.config/qnetload/qnetload.conf
              The last-used interface is saved here. This will be used the next time qnetload is executed.

       /proc/net/dev
              This file, provided by the kernel, contains details of the network usage and is read by qnetload to provide the displayed data.
