NAME
       pommed - Apple laptops hotkeys event handler

SYNOPSIS
       pommed [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pommed daemon.

       pommed  is  a daemon handling the hotkeys found on the Apple laptops, like the MacBook Pro, MacBook and PowerBook laptops. These hotkeys control, through pommed, the LCD backlight level, the audio
       volume, the keyboard backlight level (only on the MacBook Pro and the latest PowerBook) and the CD/DVD drive ejection. Additionally, pommed monitors the ambient light sensors found on the  MacBook
       Pro and the latest PowerBook to automatically light up the keyboard backlight when the ambient light level gets too low.

       pommed can optionally support the Apple Remote Control, too (this option is disabled by default and only available for the MacBook Pro and MacBook).

       pommed accepts the following command-line options.

       -v     Print version information.

       -f     Run in the foreground, printing log messages to stdout.
