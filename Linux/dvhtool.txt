NAME
       dvhtool - Disk volume header manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       dvhtool --device devicename [ option ]

       dvhtool -d devicename [ option ]

DESCRIPTION
       dvhtool is a utility for displaying SGI disk partition and volume header information as well as for copying files to and from the volume header.

       It is similar to the IRIX(tm) utility of the same name, however the options and usage are quite different.  Also, the IRIX utility cannot display partition and boot file information.

       The  disk volume header includes the disk partition table and the volume directory.  The volume directory is an index to the files stored in the volume header part of the disk.  These files can be
       anything but are usually standalone programs (like sash, the SGI standalone shell).  The space available for files is usually limited to one, two or a few megabytes, this can only  be  changed  by
       repartitioning the disk with fx, the SGI disk formatting and partitioning tool or fdisk.

       You must be root to invoke dvhtool.  The device name can be /dev/sda for the first disk, /dev/sdb for the second, and so on.

       dvhtool will also work on a file image of a disk volume header.

       OPTIONS -d,  --device devicename Specify the volume header device name (or file image)

       --print-volume-header
              Show volume header data only

       --print-volume-directory
              Show volume table of contents

       --print-partitions
              Show partition data

       --print-all
              Equivalent to all three above options

       --vh-remove name
              Remove volhdr file name.

       --vh-to-unix name file
              Copy volhdr file name to Unix file file

       --unix-to-vh file name
              Copy Unix file file to volhdr as name
