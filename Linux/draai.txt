  NAME
      draai - manage playlists and play audio files

  SYNOPSIS
      draai [option [option ...]] command [track [track ...] | tracknumber [tracknumber ...]]

  DESCRIPTION
      Draai  is  a  wrapper around mpc, making playing music from the commandline more enjoyable. mpc is a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. Using draai, one can play an audiofile (ogg, mp3, flac,
      whatever your MPD offers), play all files in a predefined playlist, view details on current, past and future playing songs, skip to the next song, etc.

  GETTING STARTED
      Run "draai init" to get started using draai the way the author likes it. Then, open another terminal window and run e.g.  $ draai listall | dr_permutate | draai add; draai play to build  a  current
      playlist and start playing it.  Other ways of using draai are possible, see below.

  COMMANDS
      draai
        Play music: the files given as args and playlists passed via --playlist.
      watch
        Run watch(1) on "draai peek".
      init
        Start a bunch of X terminals setting up some draai jobs: tail, logtail, watch, syslog, ...
      guestlist
        Reschedule listed tracknumbers as upcoming tracks. Last arguments should be the positions of tracks to be put on the guestlist, not filenames.
      unguestlist
        Reschedule listed tracknumbers to end of playlist.
      insert
        Add file(s) (given either as args or on stdin) to playlist and schedule it as upcoming track. You probably want to have 'draai insert' read from a pipe fed by 'draai search'.
      move
        Move tracknumber to tracknumber given as last argument.
      zap
        Move tracknumber to position one and immediately start playing it. Typically used to deal with radiostations in playlist.
      search
        Search  for  substrings  in  all song tag types (artist, title, comment, filename, ...). Similar to 'mpc search any <query>'. You'll typically want to pipe this commands output to e.g. 'draai in‐
        sert'.
      tail
        Print information about track when it starts playing, similar to tail -f on a logfile.
      logtail
        Run tail(1) on system log file.
      list
        List current playlist.
      peek
        Show status of current song, and show upcoming $peek FIXME tracks.
      play
        Play music.
      syslog
        Send raw information from tail to syslog. You likely want to run "draai syslog" in the background.
      skip
        Skip this track, start playing the next one now.
      osjittisstil
        Run this if unwanted silence pops up during a playing session (for now, it runs draai --sloppy skip).
      delete
        Delete track(s) from current playlist. Last arguments should be _positions_ of tracks to be removed, not filename. If no position is given, deletes upcoming track from playlist.
      fastforward
        Seek forward in current track.
      crescendo
        Play louder.
      diminuendo
        Play softer.
      shuffle
        Shuffle the playlist. By default, this task is delegated to dr_unsort(1).  However, if draai runs in "sloppy" or in "native shuffle" mode, then mpc native shuffling is done (by calling "mpc shuf‐
        fle"). Draai runs in "sloppy" mode when the DR_SLOPPY environment variable is set, or when the --sloppy option is passed. Draai runs in "native shuffle" mode when the  DR_SHUFFLE_NATIVE  environ‐
        ment variable is set.
      listall
        List all files as served by music database.
      add
        Add file(s) (given either as args or on stdin) to playlist. You probably want to have 'draai add' read from a pipe fed by e.g. 'draai listall' or 'draai search'.
      quit
        quit

  OPTIONS
      --debug (debug), -d
        Be very verbose.
      --playlist (with playlistfile), -p
        Playlist file; option can be supplied more than once. To be used with command "draai".
      --noshuffle (no shuffle), {-S}
        Do not shuffle tracks and leave random mode untouched (default is: do shuffle and disable random mode). See also the script dr_unsort.
      --raw (raw), -r
        Print raw stuff, suitable for postprocessing (if combined with tail, peek or list).
      --sloppy (sloppy), -s
        Do not try hard to make everything sound smooth. If combined with skip: risk a squeak on old hardware.
      --time (with timespec), -t
        If combined with commands quit or draai: time at which to quit or start.

  EXAMPLES
      Schedule all tracks containing the string 'delia gone' in title, artist, comment or any other tag for playing, after current song has finished: draai search 'delia gone' | draai insert.

  ENVIRONMENT
      Run  grep  DR_ `which draai` to find out about environment variables honored by draai. It honors: booleans: DR_DEBUG, DR_SHUFFLE, DR_SHUFFLE_NATIVE, DR_TIMESTAMP, DR_RAW, DR_SLOPPY, DR_INIT_NCMPCPP
      and DR_INIT_WATCH ; strings: DR_WATCH ; integers: DR_CROSSFADE, DR_PEEK and DR_SEEK as well as DR_FADEOUT_STEP, DR_FADEOUT_REPEAT, and DR_FADEOUT_SLEEP and DR_VOLUME_STEP ; and some  more  strings:
      DR_SYSLOG_FILE, DR_SYSLOG_FACILITY and DR_SYSLOG_LEVEL . For now, see the draai code for what it all means.

  FILES, CONFIGURATION
      All  configuration  variables  (see  ENVIRONMENT)  can be set in ~/.draai/rc.  This rc-file is sourced as a shell script. If you'd like to set the syslog facility, set syslog_facility (overruled by
      DR_SYSLOG_FACILITY). If you'd like to set the watch programma, set watch (overruled by DR_WATCH).
