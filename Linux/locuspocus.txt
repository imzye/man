NAME
       locuspocus - calculate locus coordinates for the given gene annotation

SYNOPSIS
       locuspocus [options] gff3file1 [gff3file2 gff3file3 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Basic options:

       -d|--debug
              print detailed debugging messages to terminal (standard error)

       -h|--help
              print this help message and exit

       -v|--version
              print version number and exit

              iLocus parsing:

       -l|--delta: INT
              when parsing interval loci, use the following delta to extend gene loci and include potential regulatory regions; default is 500

       -s|--skipends
              when enumerating interval loci, exclude unannotated (and presumably incomplete) iLoci at either end of the sequence

       -e|--endsonly
              report only incomplete iLocus fragments at the unannotated ends of sequences (complement of --skipends)

       -y|--skipiiloci
              do not report intergenic iLoci

              Refinement options:

       -r|--refine
              by default genes are grouped in the same iLocus if they have any overlap; 'refine' mode allows for a more nuanced handling of overlapping genes

       -c|--cds
              use CDS rather than UTRs for determining gene overlap; implies 'refine' mode

       -m|--minoverlap: INT
              the minimum number of nucleotides two genes must overlap to be grouped in the same iLocus; default is 1

              Output options:

       -n|--namefmt: STR
              provide  a  printf-style format string to override the default ID format for newly created loci; default is 'locus%lu' (locus1, locus2, etc) for loci and 'iLocus%lu' (iLocus1, iLocus2, etc) for
              interval loci; note the format string should include a single %lu specifier to be filled in with a long unsigned integer value

       -i|--ilens: FILE
              create a file with the lengths of each intergenic iLocus

       -g|--genemap: FILE
              print a mapping from each gene annotation to its corresponding locus to the given file

       -o|--outfile: FILE
              name of file to which results will be written; default is terminal (standard output)

       -T|--retainids
              retain original feature IDs from input files; conflicts will arise if input contains duplicated ID values

       -t|--transmap: FILE
              print a mapping from each transcript annotation to its corresponding locus to the given file

       -V|--verbose
              include all locus subfeatures (genes, RNAs, etc) in the GFF3 output; default includes only locus features

              Input options:

       -f|--filter: TYPE
              comma-separated list of feature types to use in constructing loci/iLoci; default is 'gene'

       -p|--parent: CT:PT
              if a feature of type $CT exists without a parent, create a parent for this feature with type $PT; for example, mRNA:gene will create a gene feature as a parent for any top-level  mRNA  feature;
              this option can be specified multiple times

       -u|--pseudo
              correct erroneously labeled pseudogenes
