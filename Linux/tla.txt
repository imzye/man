NAME
       tla-gpg-check - GNU Arch revision signature checker

SYNOPSIS
       tla-gpg-check gpg_command="gpg_command"

DESCRIPTION
       Checks whether a revision is correctly signed. This is intended to be used in tla's signing hooks. It calls gpg_command on the standard input and makes sure only one signed message is given.

       Here is how to setup a simple automatic tla signature check:

       mkdir -p -m 700 ~/.arch-params/signing/
       echo 'tla-gpg-check gpg_command="gpg --verify-files -"' \
         > ~/.arch-params/signing/=default.check
       echo 'gpg --clearsign --use-agent' > ~/.arch-params/signing/=default
