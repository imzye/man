NAME
       owmon - Monitor for owserver settings and statistics

SYNOPSIS
       owmon -s owserver-tcp-port

DESCRIPTION
   1-Wire
       1-wire  is  a  wiring  protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector scheme where the data line can also provide
       power.

       Each device is uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage, contact, current), switches, timers
       and data loggers. More complex devices (like thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also 1-wire devices that have encryption included.

       The  1-wire scheme uses a single bus master and multiple slaves on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be individually discovered and addressed using their unique
       ID.

       Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB adapters.

   OWFS design
       OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique ID being the  directory,
       and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.

       Details  of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or control applica‐
       tions. There are some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the  fundamental  goal  has
       been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed.

   owserver
       owserver  (1)  is the backend component of the OWFS 1-wire bus control system.  owserver (1) arbitrates access to the bus from multiple client processes. The physical bus is usually connected to a se‐
       rial or USB port, and other processes connect to owserver (1) over network sockets (tcp port).

       Frontend clients include a filesystem representation: owfs (1) , and a webserver: owhttpd (1).  Direct language bindings are also available, e.g: owperl (3).

       There are also many light-weight clients that can only talk to owserver (1) and not to the 1-Wire bus directly. They include shell and multiple language modules (perl, Visual Basic, python,...)

   owserver protocol
       All the owserver (1) clients use the owserver protocol for communication. The owserver protocol is a well documented tcp/ip client/server protocol. Assigned the "well known port" default of 4304.

   owmon
       owmon (1) is connects to owserver (1) and displays the bus structure and contents of the interface, statistics and settings directories.

SPECIFIC OPTIONS
   -s
       TCP port or IPaddress:port for owserver
       The tcp port (IP:port) for the "upstream" owserver.

EXAMPLE
       If owserver (1) is started:
       owserver -p 4304 -d /dev/ttyS0
       owserver on tcp port 4304 and connects to a physical 1-wire bus on a serial port.

       You can monitor owserver (1) with
       owmon -s 4304 /

PLATFOMS
       owmon (1) is a pure Tcl/TK program and will run wherever Tcl/TK is available (Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Unix)
