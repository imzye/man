OPTIONS
       The FIRST argument CAN be a coordinate file in the TM (coord, Bohr) or
       Xmol (*.xyz, Ang.) format. If no such file is present as the first
       argument crest will automatically search for a file called “coord” in
       the TM format.

   General and technical options
       -v1
           Use the MF-MD-GC workflow. (OUTDATED)

       -v2
           Use the MTD-GC workflow. (OUTDATED)

       -v3 (or -v2i)
           Use the iMTD-GC workflow. [default]

       -v4
           Use the iMTD-sMTD workflow.

       -entropy
           The same workflow as with “-v4”, specialized for the calculation of
           conformational entropy.

       -xnam bin
           Specify name of the xtb(1) binary that should be used.

       -niceprint
           Progress bar printout for optimizations.

       -dry
           Perform a “dry run”. Only prints the settings that would be applied
           with the CMD input and stops the run before any calculations

       -T int
           Set total number of CPUs (threads) to be used. Parallel settings
           are then determined automatically for each step. If not set by
           “-T”, this number is read from the OMP_NUM_THREADS global variable.

   Calculation options
       -g string
           Use GBSA implicit solvent for solvent string.

       -alpb string
           Use ALPB implicit solvent for solvent string.

       -chrg int
           Set the molecules’ charge.

       -uhf int
           Set int=N alpha - N beta electrons

       -nozs
           Do not perform z-mat sorting. [default]

       -opt lev

       -gfn2
           Use GFN2-xTB. [default]

       -gff, -gfnff
           Use GFN-FF (requires xtb(1) 6.3 or newer). (For GFN-FF searches
           bond constraints are applied automatically.)

       -gfn2//gfnff
           GFN2-xTB//GFN-FF composite mode.

       Adding additional constraints to the calculations:

       The user is able to include additional constraints to ALL xtb(1)
       calculations that are conducted by CREST.

       -cinp file
           Read in a file containing the constraints. Constraints have to be
           in the same format as in xtb(1). (This was done previously via the

       -cbonds
           Define automatic bond constraints (set up from topology).

       -nocbonds
