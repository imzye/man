ABSTRACT
       A module that implements the Discordian calendar made popular(?) in the "Illuminatus!" trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson and by the Church of the SubGenius.

VERSION
       This document describes DateTime::Calendar::Discordian version 1.0

DESCRIPTION
   The Discordian Calendar
       Seasons

               Name            Patron apostle
               ----            --------------
               Chaos           Hung Mung
               Discord         Dr. Van Van Mojo
               Confusion       Sri Syadasti
               Bureaucracy         Zarathud
               The Aftermath   The Elder Malaclypse

       Each season contains 73 consecutively numbered days.

       Holydays

               Apostle Holydays    Season Holydays
               ----------------    ---------------
               1) Mungday          1) Chaoflux
               2) Mojoday          2) Discoflux
               3) Syaday           3) Confuflux
               4) Zaraday          4) Bureflux
               5) Maladay          5) Afflux

       Apostle Holydays occur on the 5th day of the season.

       Season Holydays occur on the 50th day of the deason.

       St. Tib's Day occurs once every 4 years (1+4=5) and is inserted between the 59th and 60th days of the Season of Chaos.

       The era of the Discordian Calendar is called Year Of Lady Discord (YOLD.) Its' epoch (Confusion 1 of year 0) is equivalent to January 1, -1167 B.C.

       X Day is when the Church of the SubGenius believes the alien X-ists will destroy the world.  The revised date is equivalent to Confusion 40, 9827 YOLD.

       Days Of The Week

               1. Sweetmorn
               2. Boomtime
               3. Pungenday
               4. Prickle-Prickle
               5. Setting Orange

       The days of the week are named from the five Basic Elements: sweet, boom, pungent, prickle and orange.

METHODS
   new
       Constructs a new DateTime::Calendar::Discordian object.  This class method requires the parameters day, season, and year.  If day is given as "St. Tib's Day" (or reasonable facsimile thereof,)
       then season is omitted. This function will "die" if invalid parameters are given.  For example:

       my $dtcd = DateTime::Calendar::Discordian->new(
         day => 8, season => 'Discord', year => 3137, );

       The second, nanosecond, and locale parameters are also accepted for compatability with DateTime but nothing is done with them.

   clone
       Returns a copy of the object.

   day
       Returns the day of the season as a number between 1 and 73 or the string "St. Tib's Day".

   day_abbr
       Returns the name of the day of the week in abbreviated form or false if it is "St. Tib's Day".

   day_name
       Returns the full name of the day of the week or "St. Tib's Day" if it is that day.

   days_till_x
       Returns the number of days until X Day.

   from_object
       Builds a DateTime::Calendar::Discordian object from another DateTime object.  This function takes an object parameter and optionally locale. For example:

       my $dtcd = DateTime::Calendar::Discordian->from_object(
         object => DateTime->new(day => 22, month => 3, year => 1971,));

   holyday
       If the current day is a holy day, returns the name of that day otherwise returns an empty string.

   season_abbr
       Returns the abbreviated name of the current season.

   season_name
       Returns the full name of the current season.

   strftime
       This function takes one or more parameters consisting of strings containing special specifiers.  For each such string it will return a string formatted according to the specifiers, er, specified.
       See the strftime Specifiers section for a list of the available format specifiers.  They have been chosen to be compatible with the ddate(1) program not necessarily the strftime(3) C function.  If
       you give a format specifier that doesn't exist, then it is simply treated as text.

       strftime Specifiers

       The following specifiers are allowed in the format string given to the strftime method:

       •   %a

           Abbreviated name of the day of the week (i.e., SM.)  Internally uses the day_abbr function.

       •   %A

           Full name of the day of the week (i.e., Sweetmorn.)  Internally uses the day_name function.

       •   %b

           Abbreviated name of the season (i.e., Chs.)  Internally uses the season_abbr function.

       •   %B

       •   %d

           Ordinal number of day in season (i.e., 23.)  Internally uses the day function.

       •   %e

           Cardinal number of day in season (i.e., 23rd.)

       •   %H

           Name of current Holyday, if any.  Internally uses the holyday function.

       •   %n

           A newline character.

       •   %N

           Magic code to prevent rest of format from being printed unless today is a Holyday.

           Number of days remaining until X-Day.  Internally uses the days_till_x function.

       •   %{

       •   %}
