NAME
       mogautomount - automatically discover and mount MogileFS disks

SYNOPSIS
         mogautomount [--verbose | -v]
         mogautomount [--help | -h]

DESCRIPTION
       Mounts all unmounted filesystems with labels of form "MogileDev<n>" at /var/mogdata/dev<n>, creating the needed directories as well.

       You can do this at runtime without restarting mogstored, assuming you can add new block devices at runtime via your SCSI/SATA/etc controller.

OPTIONS
       --help | -h
           this help

       --verbose | -verbose
           be verbose

       --chmod-mountpoints
           If a mogile device isn't mounted yet, check to make sure the underlying filesystem has the directory set to be not readable or writable at all (chmod 0). This could help prevent mogstored from
           accidentally writing to the underlying filesystem.

RETURN CODE
       0 on success or inaction because no action needed to happen.

       1 on partial failure (some mounts succeed).

       2 on total failure (things had to be done, but nothing was).
