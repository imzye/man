DESCRIPTION
       Under dracut, booting with ZFS-on-/ is facilitated by a number of hooks in the 90zfs module.

       Booting  into a ZFS dataset requires mountpoint=/ to be set on the dataset containing the root filesystem (henceforth "the boot dataset") and at the very least either the bootfs property to be set
       to that dataset, or the root= kernel cmdline (or dracut drop-in) argument to specify it.

       All children of the boot dataset with canmount=on with mountpoints matching /etc, /bin, /lib, /lib??, /libx32, and /usr globs are deemed essential and will be mounted as well.

       zfs-mount-generator(8) is recommended for proper functioning of the system afterward (correct mount properties, remounting, &c.).

CMDLINE
   Standard
       root=zfs:dataset, root=ZFS=dataset           Use dataset as the boot dataset.  All pluses (‘+’) are replaced with spaces (‘ ’).
       root=zfs:AUTO, root=zfs:, root=zfs, [root=]  After import, search for the first pool with the bootfs property set, use its value as-if specified as the dataset above.
       rootfstype=zfs root=dataset                  Equivalent to root=zfs:dataset.
       rootfstype=zfs [root=]                       Equivalent to root=zfs:AUTO.
       rootflags=flags                              Mount the boot dataset with -o flags; cf. “Temporary Mount Point Properties” in zfsprops(7).  These properties will not  last,  since  all  filesystems
                                                    will be re-mounted from the real root.
       debug                                        If specified, dracut-zfs-generator logs to the journal.

       Be careful about setting neither rootfstype=zfs nor root=zfs:dataset — other automatic boot selection methods, like systemd-gpt-auto-generator and systemd-fstab-generator might take precedent.

   ZFS-specific
       bootfs.snapshot[=snapshot-name]  Execute zfs snapshot boot-dataset@snapshot-name before pivoting to the real root.  snapshot-name defaults to the current kernel release.
       bootfs.rollback[=snapshot-name]  Execute zfs rollback -Rf boot-dataset@snapshot-name before pivoting to the real root.  snapshot-name defaults to the current kernel release.
       spl_hostid=host-id               Use zgenhostid(8) to set the host ID to host-id; otherwise, /etc/hostid inherited from the real root is used.
       zfs_force, zfs.force, zfsforce   Appends -f to all zpool import invocations; primarily useful in conjunction with spl_hostid=, or if no host ID was inherited.

FILES
       parse-zfs.sh (cmdline)
         Processes spl_hostid=.  If root= matches a known pattern, above, provides /dev/root and delays the initqueue until zfs(4) is loaded,

       zfs-import-opts.sh (systemd environment generator)
         Turns zfs_force, zfs.force, or zfsforce into ZPOOL_IMPORT_OPTS=-f for zfs-import-scan.service or zfs-import-cache.service.

       zfs-load-key.sh (pre-mount)
         Loads encryption keys for the boot dataset and its essential descendants.
             keylocation=prompt                               Is prompted for via systemd-ask-password thrice.
             keylocation=https://URL, keylocation=http://URL  network-online.target is started before loading.
             keylocation=file://path                          If path doesn't exist, udevadm is settled.  If it still doesn't, it's waited for for up to 10s.

       zfs-env-bootfs.service (systemd service)
         After pool import, sets BOOTFS= in the systemd environment to the first non-null bootfs value in iteration order.

       dracut-zfs-generator (systemd generator)
         Generates sysroot.mount (using rootflags=, if any).  If an explicit boot dataset was specified, also generates essential mountpoints (sysroot-etc.mount, sysroot-bin.mount, &c.), otherwise gener‐
         ates zfs-nonroot-necessities.service which mounts them explicitly after /sysroot using BOOTFS=.

       zfs-snapshot-bootfs.service, zfs-rollback-bootfs.service (systemd services)
         Consume bootfs.snapshot and bootfs.rollback as described in “CMDLINE”.  Use BOOTFS= if no explicit boot dataset was specified.

       zfs-needshutdown.sh (cleanup)
         If any pools were imported, signals that shutdown hooks are required.

       export-zfs.sh (shutdown)
         Forcibly exports all pools.

       /etc/hostid, /etc/zfs/zpool.cache, /etc/zfs/vdev_id.conf (regular files)
         Included verbatim, hostonly.

       mount-zfs.sh (mount)
         Does nothing on systemd systems (if dracut-zfs-generator succeeded).  Otherwise, loads encryption key for the boot dataset from the console or via plymouth.  It may not work at all!
