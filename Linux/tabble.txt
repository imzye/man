NAME
       tabble - program launcher with tabs for X

SYNOPSIS
         tabble

DESCRIPTION
       Tabble is a small alternative X shell which presents your programs in tabs for easy launch. It is not meant to replace a window manager, just complement it. Light window managers benefit the most from
       tabble. The idea is that tabble is 'always on top' so multiple launches can be made without re-navigating a menu hierarchy or clearing the desktop.

OPTIONS
       -c FILE
           Read configuration from FILE.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.

SEE ALSO
