NAME
       atomes - a toolbox to analyze, visualize and create/edit 3D atomistic models

SYNOPSIS
       atomes [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the atomes command.

       atomes is a toolbox to analyze, visualize and edit/create 3D atomistic models.

       It offers a workspace to open and manage project(s) that can exchange data: analysis results, atomic coordinates ...

       atomes also provides an advanced input preparation system for calculations using well know molecular dynamics codes:

              Classical MD: DLPOLY and LAMMPS
              Ab-initio MD: CPMD and CP2K
              QM-MM MD: CPMD and CP2K
