NAME
       lxd-migrate - LXD physical to instance migration tool

DESCRIPTION
   Description:
              Physical to instance migration tool

              This tool lets you turn any Linux filesystem (including your current one) into a LXD instance on a remote LXD host.

              It will setup a clean mount tree made of the root filesystem and any additional mount you list, then transfer this through LXD's migration API to create a new instance from it.

              The same set of options as `lxc launch` are also supported.

   Usage:
              lxd-migrate [flags]

   Flags:
       -h, --help
              Print help

       --rsync-args
              Extra arguments to pass to rsync

       --version
              Print version number
