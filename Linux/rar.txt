NAME
       rar - archive files with compression

SYNOPSIS
       rar <command> [-<switch 1> -<switch N>] archive [files...] [@listfiles...] [path_to_extract]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rar archiver.
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.
       Commands and options described here are as of rar 7.11.

       rar is a program for creating and manipulating .rar archives.

COMMANDS
       After the program name comes a command and then optional switches with dashes before them.
       A summary of commands is included below.  For a complete description, run rar -?

       a      Add files to archive.

       c      Add archive comment. Comment length is limited to 256 KB.

       ch     Change archive parameters.  Can be used with most of archive modification options.

       cw     Write archive comment to a specified file.

       d      Delete files from archive.

       e      Extract files to current directory. Does not create any subdirectories.

       f      Freshen files in archive.  Updates those files changed since they were packed to the archive.  This command will not add new to the archive.

       k      Lock archive.  Any command which intend to change the archive will be ignored.

       l[t[a],b]
              List content of archive [technical[all], bare].
               'lt' displays the detailed file information in multiline mode.  Commands 'lt', 'lta' and 'lb' are equal to 'vt', 'vta' and 'vb' correspondingly.

       m[f]   Move to archive [files only].  Directories will not be removed if 'f' modifier is used and/or '-ed' switch is applied.

       p      Print file to stdout.

       r      Repair archive. For further details look in rar.txt.

       rc     Reconstruct missing volumes using recovery volumes (.rev files).  You need to specify any existing volume as the archive name, for example, 'rar rc backup.part03.rar'.

       rn     Rename archived files.

       rr[N]  Add data recovery record. Optionally, redundant information (recovery record) may be added to an archive.

       rv[N]  Create  recovery volumes (.rev files), which can be later used to reconstruct missing files in a volume set.  This command has sense only for multivolume archives.  For further details look
              in rar.txt.

       s[name|-]
              Convert archive to or from SFX. The archive is merged with SFX-module in the user's home directory.

       t      Test archive files.

       u      Update files in archive. Adds files not already in the archive and updates files changed since they were packed to the archive.

       v[t[a],b]
              Verbosely list archive [technical]

       x      Extract files with full path.

OPTIONS
       NOTE: Every switch must be separated by a whitespace.  They cannot be put together.

       -?     Display help on commands and switches. The same as when none or an illegal command line option is entered.

       --     This switch tells to RAR that there is no more switches in the command line. It could be useful, if either archive or file name starts from '-' character.  Without  '--'  switch  such  name
              would be treated as switch.

       -@[+]  Disable [enable] file lists.

       -ad[1,2]
              Alternate destination path.

       -ag[format]
              Generate  archive  name using the current date and time.  Appends the current date string to an archive name when creating an archive. Useful for daily backups.  For further details look in
              rar.txt.

       -ai    Ignore file attributes.

       -am[s,r]
              Archive name and time [save, restore]

       -ap<path>
              Set path inside archive. This path is merged to file names when adding files to an archive and removed from file names when extracting.

       -as    Synchronize archive contents.
              If this switch is used when archiving, those archived files which are not present in the list of the currently added files, will be deleted from archive. It is convenient to use this switch
              in combination with -u (update) to synchronize contents of an archive and an archiving directory.

       -cfg-  Disable reading configuration and environment.

       -cl    Convert file names to lower case.

       -cu    Convert file names to upper case.

       -c-    Disable showing comments.

       -df    Delete files after archiving. This switch in combination with the command "a" performs the same action as the command "m".

       -dh    Open shared files.  Allows one to process files opened by other applications for writing.

       -ds    Do not sort files while adding to a solid archive.

       -dw    Wipe files after archiving.

       -ed    Do not add empty directories.

       -ep    Exclude paths from names.

       -ep1   Exclude base dir from names.

       -ep2   Expand paths to full. Store full file paths (except a drive letter and leading path separator) when archiving.

       -ep4<path>
              Exclude the path prefix from names.

       -e[+]<attr>
              Set file exclude [or include] attributes.

       -f     Freshen files. May be used with archive extraction or creation.

       -hp[password]
              Encrypt both file data and headers.  The password is case-sensitive. If you omit the password on the command line, you will be prompted with message "Enter password".

       -ht[b|c]
              Select hash type [BLAKE2,CRC32] for file checksum.

       -id[c,d,n,p,q]
              Display or disable messages.

       -ierr  Send all messages to stderr.

              Control notification sounds.

       -iver  Display the version number

              Write names to log file.

       -m<0..5>
