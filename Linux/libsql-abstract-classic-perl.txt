NAME
       SQL::Abstract::Util - Small collection of utilities for SQL::Abstract::Classic

EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS
   is_plain_value
       Determines if the supplied argument is a plain value as understood by this module:

       •   The value is "undef"

       •   The value is a non-reference

       •   The value is an object with stringification overloading

       •   The value is of the form "{ -value => $anything }"

       On failure returns "undef", on success returns a scalar reference to the original supplied argument.

       •   Note

           The  stringification  overloading  detection  is  rather  advanced:  it takes into consideration not only the presence of a "" overload, but if that fails also checks for enabled autogenerated
           versions of "", based on either "0+" or "bool".

           Unfortunately testing in the field indicates that this detection may tickle a latent bug in perl versions before 5.018, but only when very large numbers of stringifying objects  are  involved.
           At the time of writing ( Sep 2014 ) there is no clear explanation of the direct cause, nor is there a manageably small test case that reliably reproduces the problem.

           If you encounter any of the following exceptions in random places within your application stack - this module may be to blame:

             Operation "ne": no method found,
               left argument in overloaded package <something>,
               right argument in overloaded package <something>

           or perhaps even

             Stub found while resolving method "???" overloading """" in package <something>

           If  you fall victim to the above - please attempt to reduce the problem to something that could be sent to the SQL::Abstract::Classic developers (either publicly or privately). As a workaround
           in the meantime you can set $ENV{SQLA_ISVALUE_IGNORE_AUTOGENERATED_STRINGIFICATION} to a true value, which will most likely eliminate your problem (at the expense of not being able to properly
           detect exotic forms of stringification).

           This notice and environment variable will be removed in a future version, as soon as the underlying problem is found and a reliable workaround is devised.

   is_literal_value
       Determines if the supplied argument is a literal value as understood by this module:

       •   "\$sql_string"

       •   "\[ $sql_string, @bind_values ]"

       On failure returns "undef", on success returns an array reference containing the unpacked version of the supplied literal SQL and bind values.
