NAME
       openpgpkey - Create and verify RFC-TBD OPENPGPKEY DNS records

SYNTAX
       openpgpkey [--fetch | --verify] [--insecure] [--resolv.conf /PATH/TO/RESOLV.CONF] user@domain

       openpgpkey [--create] [--insecure] [--resolv.conf /PATH/TO/RESOLV.CONF] [--output {rfc,generic,both}] [--uid <uid>] [--keyid <keyid>] user@domain

DESCRIPTION
       openpgpkey generates RFC-7929 OPENPGPKEY DNS records. To generate these records for older nameserver implementations that do not yet support the OPENPGPKEY record, specify --output generic to
       output the openpgpkey data in Generic Record (RFC-3597) format. Records are generated by taking all keys with the specified email address associated with it from the user's local GnuPG keychain.

       Verification of OPENPGPKEY records is done by comparing the keyid and fingerprint of the OPENPGPKEY obtained from DNS with the version in the local GnuPG keychain.

OPTIONS
       --fetch
           Fetch an OPENPGPKEY public key record from DNS

       --create
           Create an OPENPGPKEY DNS record

       --verify
           Verify a public key from the local GPG keyring with the OPENPGPKEY DNS record

       --resolvconf FILE
           Specify a custom resolv.conf file (default: /etc/resolv.conf)

       --output rfc | generic | both
           Output format of OPENPGPKEY record. "OPENPGPKEY" for rfc, "TYPE61" for generic (default: generic)

       If neither create or verify is specified, create is used.

REQUIREMENTS
       openpgpkey requires the following python libraries: unbound, gnupg and argparse. It also requires gnupg which provides the gpg command.

BUGS
       none known

EXAMPLES
       typical usage:

       openpgpkey --fetch paul@nohats.ca > paul.pubkey

       openpgpkey --verify paul@nohats.ca

       openpgpkey --create paul@nohats.ca
