NAME
       File::Type::WebImages - determine web image file types using magic

SYNOPSIS
           use File::Type::WebImages 'mime_type';

           my $type_1 = mime_type($file);
           my $type_2 = mime_type($data);

DESCRIPTION
       "mime_type()" can use either a filename, or file contents, to determine the type of a file. The process involves looking the data at the beginning of the file, sometimes called "magic numbers".

THE BIG TRADE OFF
       For minimum memory consumption, only the following common web image  file types are supported:

       BMP, GIF, JPEG and PNG.  ( image/bmp, image/gif, image/jpeg and image/png ).

       Unlike with File::Type and File::MMagic, 'undef', not "application/octet-stream" will be returned for unknown formats.

       Unlike File::Type, we return "image/png" for PNGs, not "image/x-png";

       If you want more mime types detected use File::Type or some other module.

TODO
       It would be even better to have a pluggable system that would allow you to plug-in different sets of MIME-types you care about.

SEE ALSO
       File::Type. Similar, but supports over 100 file types.
