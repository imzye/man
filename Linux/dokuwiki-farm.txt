NAME
       dokuwiki-addsite - Create a new site driven by DokuWiki

SYNOPSIS
       dokuwiki-addsite ['OPTIONS'] {'SITE_NAME'}

DESCRIPTION
       DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use wiki mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind.

       dokuwiki-addsite creates the file hierarchy and configuration required to define a new site driven by the installed DokuWiki engine.

OPTIONS
       --no-admin:
              Do create any administrator user and do not ask for a password.

       -h, --help:
              Show a help message and exit.

       SITE_NAME:
              Name  of  the  site to create. For a virtual host-based setup, it reflects the corresponding hostname.  For instance, for a site accessible at an address such as  <http://wiki.project.exam‐
              ple.com:8080/foo/bar/> , it can be either project.example.com, wiki.project.example.com, wiki.project.example.com.foo.bar or even 8080.wiki.project.example.com.foo.bar.  For a directory  or
              htaccess-based  setup, this is the corresponding site identifier. For instance, for a site accessible at an address such as  <http://wiki.example.com/project/> , rewritten by the web server
              as doku.php?animal=project, it is simply project.

NOTES
       The site configuration is stored in /etc/dokuwiki/farm/SITE_NAME/, and the data is stored in /var/lib/dokuwiki/farm/SITE_NAME/, as indicated in the site configuration.

       In a virtual host-based setup, if you need to make a given site accessible at several URLs, you can symlink its configuration directory to another name (it is not necessary to symlink the data di‐
       rectory).

       If you need to rename a site, you can rename the configuration and data directories, and edit the configuration to point to the new data directory.

BUGS
       No check is done against the SITE_NAME, just avoid names like ../../../etc.  Please report any bug to the Debian BTS.
