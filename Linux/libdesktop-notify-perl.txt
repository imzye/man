NAME
       Desktop::Notify - Communicate with the Desktop Notifications framework

VERSION
       Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
           use Desktop::Notify;

           # Open a connection to the notification daemon
           my $notify = Desktop::Notify->new();

           # Create a notification to display
           my $notification = $notify->create(summary => 'Desktop::Notify',
                                              body => 'Hello, world!',
                                              timeout => 5000);

           # Display the notification
           $notification->show();

           # Close the notification later
           $notification->close();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a Perl interface to the Desktop Notifications framework.

       The framework allows applications to display pop-up notifications on an X desktop.  This is implemented with two components: a daemon that displays the notifications, and a client library used by
       applications to send notifications to the daemon.  These components communicate through the DBus message bus protocol.

       More information is available from <http://trac.galago-project.org/wiki/DesktopNotifications>

       This module serves the same purpose as "libnotify", in an object-oriented Perl interface.  It is not, however, an interface to "libnotify" itself, but a separate implementation of the
       specification using Net::DBus.

METHODS
   new %opts
       Connect to the notification daemon. %opts can include the following options:

       app_name
           The application name to use for notifications. Default is "basename($0)"

       app_icon
           Path to an image to use for notification icons.

       bus The Net::DBus message bus to use. Default is to call Net::DBus->session, which is usually where notification-daemon can be reached.

       service
           The DBus service name of the daemon. Default is org.freedesktop.Notifications.

       objpath
           The path to the notifications DBus object. Default is /org/freedesktop/Notifications.

       objiface
           The DBus interface to access the notifications object as. Default is org.freedesktop.Notifications.

   create %params
       Creates a new notification object that can be displayed later. This will return a Desktop::Notify::Notification object; see that module for information about using it.

   close_callback $coderef
       Sets a user-specified function to be called whenever a notification is closed.  It will be called with one argument, which is the Notification object that was just closed.

   action_callback $coderef
       Sets  a  user-specified function to be called whenever an action is invoked.  It will be called with two arguments, which are the Notification object on which an action was invoked, and the key of
       the action invoked.
