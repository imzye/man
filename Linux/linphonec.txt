DESCRIPTION
       Linphonec is the console version of originally Gnome internet phone linphone (http://www.linphone.org) .
       Linphonec  can  be  started without arguments. It doesn't need any config file to start correctly and will create a default one at the first startup if the file does not exist.  By default the path of
       the config file is ~/.linphonerc .  Most parameters (proxy, passwords) can be changed from the command line, for some of them (path of sound rings), you'll need to edit the .linphonerc config file.
       Once linphonec has started, linphonec wait for some commands and is ready to receive calls.
       The most important commands are

       call <sip url> : to call someone. A sip url is in the form sip:user@host

       terminate      : to terminate a call

       answer    : to accept an incoming call.

       help : to display interactive help.
