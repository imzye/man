NAME
       dssi_osc_update - send a DSSI `update' OSC request

SYNOPSIS
       dssi_osc_update <OSC URL>

DESCRIPTION
       dssi_osc_update  sends  a DSSI `update' OSC request to a DSSI host, then waits for OSC responses from the host, writes any responses received to stdout, and exits when it has not received anything for
       five seconds.  DSSI hosts should respond to an `update' request by sending the complete state of the plugin; this program can be used to retrieve and display that state.

OPTIONS
       <OSC URL>
              The URL specifying the host and plugin, to which the request is sent.  This is typically obtained from the host, perhaps from startup messages or the host's `About' dialog. For example:
                osc.udp://localhost:19383/dssi/test.1
                osc.udp://my.host.org:10886/dssi/xsynth-dssi/Xsynth/chan00

SEE ALSO
       dssi_osc_send(1).
