NAME
       pafextract - render panoglview .paf projects

SYNOPSIS
         panoglview equirectangular.tif
         pafextract project.paf
         gimp project.paf.extract.tif
         nona -o overlay project.paf.extract.pto
         composite overlay.tif equirectangular.tif merged.tif

DESCRIPTION
       pafextract takes a panoglview .paf file and renders the saved view as a suitably sized .tif file.  This is useful for simply extracting a 'normal' view from an equirectangular panorama.

       A hugin .pto project is also created, containing all the information necessary to reproject the extracted .tif image back into the same equirectangular space as the original.  This is useful for
       merging edits back into the original with a tool such as ImageMagick or the Gimp.
