NAME
       wmifs - a dockable network traffic monitor

SYNOPSIS
       wmifs [-d <display name>] [-i <interface name>] [-l] [-w] [-h] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       WMiFS  is  a  dockable  applet for X11 that can monitor all your network interfaces. It's designed for WindowMaker's Dock and AfterStep's Wharf, but it's not dependent on these window managers and
       should work with any other.  It can display the net load using a standard bar graph or using a waveform mode. It also displays the state of the interface with a group of leds.  Clicking on the in‐
       terface name will cycle to the next interface in the system. Users can define commands to be executed when the different mouse buttons are pressed on the main window.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -v     Show version of the program.

       -display <display name>
              Use an alternate X display.

       -geometry +x+y
              Set window position.

       -i <interface name>
              Interface that should come up initially when executing wmifs.  If you use "auto" as interface name, the first active ("up") interface will be used.

       -I <interval>
              Sampling interval, in seconds (default: 0.05).

       -l     Starts wmifs in lock mode. Useful if combined with -i, if you want to monitor a, for example, ppp device which isn't up when wmifs is started.  It won't switch to the next available  inter‐
              face.

       -s <interval>
              Scrolling interval, in seconds (default: 5)

       -w     Use the waveform graph instead of the classic one.

       -c <color>
              Set color.

FILES
       /etc/wmifsrc
              system wide wmifs configuration file.

       ~/.wmifsrc
              peruser wmifs configuration file.
