NAME
       LIGGGHTS - open source discrete element method particle simulation code.

SYNOPSIS
       liggghts < in.file

DESCRIPTION
       LIGGGHTS  stands  for  LAMMPS improved for general granular and granular heat transfer simulations.  LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulator. It is widely used in the field of Molecular
       Dynamics.  Thanks to physical and algorithmic analogies, LAMMPS is a very good platform for DEM simulations.  LAMMPS offers a GRANULAR package to perform these kind of simulations.  LIGGGHTS  aims
       to improve those capability with the goal to apply it to industrial applications.

       See http://www.liggghts.com/ for documentation.
