NAME
       mpdscribble - A Music Player Daemon (MPD) client which submits information about tracks being played to a scrobbler (e.g. last.fm).

SYNOPSIS
       mpdscribble [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mpdscribble is a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. mpdscribble connects to an MPD running on the local network and works in parallel with other MPD clients on the network.

       By  default it will get the hostname and port for mpd from the MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT environment variables. mpdscribble will use localhost:6600 if those are not set. The hostname and port can also
       be specified in the configuration file or on the command line.

       $ mpdscribble --host myhost --port=12345

       Values specified on the command line override values from the configuration file or environment variables.

       If you want to use mpdscribble with a password-protected MPD, set the environment variable MPD_HOST to password@host, or specify the host in the configuration file similarly.

       On submission failure, mpdscribble waits for some time then retries. Sending a USR1 signal to a running mpdscribble process makes it submit immediately.

OPTIONS
       --help Display help and exit.

       --version
              Display version information and exit.

       --no-daemon
              Don't daemonize mpdscribble, run it in foreground.

       --pidfile FILE
              Write the process id to this file.

       --daemon-user USERNAME
              Change to this system user after daemonization.

       --log FILE
              Specify log file.  The special value "syslog" makes mpdscribble use the local syslog daemon (which is the default).  "-" means log to stderr.

       --conf FILE
              Read configuration options from file. /etc/mpdscribble.conf is used by default (if --sysconfdir=/etc).

       --host [PASSWORD@]HOSTNAME
              Specify host protected by password.  To connect via Unix Domain Socket, specify an absolute path here.

       --port PORT
              Specify which port the MPD listens on.

       --proxy URL
              HTTP proxy URL.

       --verbose LEVEL
              Specify how verbosely mpdscribble should log.  Possible values are 0 to 3, defaulting to 1.

CONFIGURATION
       mpdscribble looks for its configuration  file  in  the  following  order:  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mpdscribble/mpdscribble.conf,  ~/.config/mpdscribble/mpdscribble.conf,  ~/.mpdscribble/mpdscribble.conf,
       /etc/mpdscribble.conf (if --sysconfdir=/etc) but this can be overridden by specifying an alternate configuration file using the command line option --conf.

       Supported configuration options:

       pidfile = FILE
              Write the process id to this file.

       log = FILE
              The  file  to  which  mpdscribble  should  output  debugging information.  The special value "syslog" makes mpdscribble use the local syslog daemon (which is the default).  "-" means log to
              stderr.

       host = [PASSWORD@]HOSTNAME
              The host running MPD, possibly protected by a password.  To connect via Unix Domain Socket, specify an absolute path here.

       port = PORT
              The port that the MPD listens on and mpdscribble should try to connect to.

       proxy = URL
              HTTP proxy URL.

       verbose = 0, 1, 2, 3
              How verbose mpdscribble's logging should be.  Default is 1.  "0" means log only critical errors (e.g. "out of memory"); "1" also logs non-critical errors (e.g.  "server  unreachable");  "2"
              logs informational messages (e.g. "new song"); "3" prints a lot of debugging messages.

SCROBBLERS
       These options are followed by at least one scrobbler section (choose a unique section name like "libre.fm" which only appears in the log file; the name "mpdscribble" is reserved).

       file = PATH
              Log to a file instead of submitting the songs to an AudioScrobbler server.

       url = URL
              The handshake URL of the scrobbler.  Example: "https://post.audioscrobbler.com/", "http://turtle.libre.fm/"

       username = USERNAME
              Your audioscrobbler username.

       password = MD5SUM
              Your Last.fm password, either cleartext or its MD5 sum.

       journal = FILE
              The file where mpdscribble should store its journal in case you do not have a connection to the scrobbler.  This option used to be called "cache".  It is optional.

FILES
       /etc/mpdscribble.conf
              The system wide configuration file.

       ~/.config/mpdscribble/mpdscribble.conf
              Per user configuration file.

       /var/cache/mpdscribble/mpdscribble.cache
              The system wide Last.fm cache file.

       ~/.cache/mpdscribble/mpdscribble.cache
              Per user Last.fm cache file.

       /var/log/mpdscribble/mpdscribble.log
              The system wide log file.

BUGS
       File permissions on cache/log file may be insecure by default.
