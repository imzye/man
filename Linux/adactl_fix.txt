NAME
       adactl_fix - Ada rules controller, automatic fixer

SYNOPSIS
       adactl_fix [-v] [-o output_prefix] file...

       adactl_fix -h

DESCRIPTION
       adactl_fix  reads  the  indicated files, as produced by adactl, and performs the corresponding fixes. The modified files are printed on the standard output, which can be redirected to a file for later
       splitting at an appropriate place with gnatchop.

       This command line tool directly edits source files. A similar interactive tool is provided as a gnat-gps plugin. If you select this tool, you should read the related section of  the  reference  manual
       before using it.

       AdaControl  is  an  Ada  rules controller. It is used to control that Ada software meets the requirements of a number of parameterizable rules. It is not intended to supplement checks made by the com‐
       piler, but rather to search for particular violations of good-practice rules, or to check that some rules are obeyed project-wide.

       Commercial support is available for AdaControl, see file /usr/share/doc/adacontrol/support.txt. If you plan to use AdaControl for industrial projects, or if you want it to be customized or extended to
       match your own needs, please contact Adalog at info@adalog.fr.

OPTIONS
       -o output_prefix
              Output each modified file to a file whose name is obtained by prefixing output_prefix to the original name of the corresponding source file. The prefix can be any string, and is not analyzed by
              Adactl_Fix. A prefix like result/ will result in all the output going to the directory result, with the same name as the original. Alternatively, a prefix like new- will result  in  all  output
              files being in the same directory. Adactl_Fix will overwrite any existing file with the same name.

       -v     Display actions to standard output.

       -h     Print a brief help message and exits, ignoring all other options and parameters.
