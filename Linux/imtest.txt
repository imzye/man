NAME
       imtest - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Interactive IMAP test program.

SYNOPSIS
       imtest [ -t keyfile ] [ -p port ] [ -m mechanism ]
           [ -a userid ] [ -u userid ] [ -k num ] [ -l num ]
           [ -r realm ] [ -f file ] [ -n num ] [ -s ] [ -q ]
           [ -c ] [ -i ] [ -z ] [ -v ] [ -I file ] [ -x file ]
           [ -X file ] [ -w passwd ] [ -o option=value ] hostname

DESCRIPTION
       imtest  is  a utility that allows you to authenticate to a IMAP or IMSP
       server and interactively issue commands to it. Once  authenticated  you
       may  issue any IMAP or IMSP command by simply typing it in. It is capa‐
       ble of multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and  handles  encryption
       layers transparently. This utility is often used for testing the opera‐
       tion of a imsp or imap server. Also those developing IMAP clients  find
       it useful.

OPTIONS
       -t keyfile
              Enable  TLS.   keyfile contains the TLS public and private keys.
              Specify "" to negotiate a TLS encryption layer but not  use  TLS
              authentication.

       -p port
              Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to imap as defined
              in /etc/services.

       -m mechanism
              Force imtest to use mechanism for authentication. If not  speci‐
              fied  the  strongest  authentication  mechanism supported by the
              server is chosen.  Specify login to use the  LOGIN  command  in‐
              stead of AUTHENTICATE.

       -a userid
              Userid  to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
              This is the userid whose password or credentials  will  be  pre‐
              sented to the server for verification.

       -u userid
              Userid  to  use for authorization; defaults to the current user.
              This is the userid whose identity will be assumed after  authen‐
              tication.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  only  used with SASL mechanisms that allow proxying
                 (e.g. PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5).

       -k num Minimum protection layer required.

       -l num Maximum protection layer to use (0=none; 1=integrity; etc).  For
              example  if  you are using the KERBEROS_V4 authentication mecha‐
              nism specifying 0 will force imtest to not  use  any  layer  and
              specifying  1  will force it to use the integrity layer.  By de‐
              fault the maximum supported protection layer will be used.

       -r realm
              Specify the realm  to  use.  Certain  authentication  mechanisms
              (e.g. DIGEST-MD5) may require one to specify the realm.

       -f file
              Pipe file into connection after authentication.

       -n num Number of authentication attempts; default = 1.  The client will
              attempt to do SSL/TLS session reuse and/or fast reauth (e.g. DI‐
              GEST-MD5), if possible.

       -s     Enable SSL over chosen protocol.

       -q     Enable IMAP COMPRESSion (after authentication).

       -c     Enable  challenge  prompt  callbacks.   This  will cause the OTP
              mechanism to ask for the the one-time password  instead  of  the
              secret pass-phrase (library generates the correct response).

       -i     Don't  send an initial client response for SASL mechanisms, even
              if the protocol supports it.

       -I file
              Echo the PID of the running process into file (This can be  use‐
              ful with -X).

       -v     Verbose. Print out more information than usual.

       -z     Timing test.

       -x file
              Open the named socket for the interactive portion.

       -X file
              Like  -x,  only  close  all  file  descriptors  &  daemonize the
              process.

       -w passwd
              Password to use (if not supplied, we will prompt).

       -o option=value
              Set the SASL option to value.
