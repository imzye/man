NAME
       claws-mail-newmail-plugin - message header summary to a log file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-newmail-plugin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-newmail-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin writes a summary of new mail headers and message related values to a log file. Writing is done after sorting.

       The message headers written are: "Date:", "Subject:", "From:", "To:" and "Cc:". Additionally the message related values currently written are the following:

       "Size:"
           The size of the message in bytes.

       "Path:"
           The full path to the message file.

       "Message:"
           The number of the message.

       "Folder:"
           The folder of the message.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For  this  you  must  go  “Configuration”  menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named newmail.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

FILES
       ~/Mail/NewLog
           Default filename where header summary is written.
