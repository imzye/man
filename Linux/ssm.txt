DESCRIPTION
       System Storage Manager provides an easy to use command line interface to manage your storage using various technologies like lvm, btrfs, encrypted volumes and more.

       In  more  sophisticated  enterprise storage environments, management with Device Mapper (dm), Logical Volume Manager (LVM), or Multiple Devices (md) is becoming increasingly more difficult.  With file
       systems added to the mix, the number of tools needed to configure and manage storage has grown so large that it is simply not user friendly.  With so many options for a system  administrator  to  con‐
       sider, the opportunity for errors and problems is large.

       The btrfs administration tools have shown us that storage management can be simplified, and we are working to bring that ease of use to Linux filesystems in general.

SYSTEM STORAGE MANAGER COMMANDS
   Introduction
       System Storage Manager has several commands that you can specify on the command line as a first argument to ssm. They all have a specific use and their own arguments,  but  global  ssm  arguments  are
       propagated to all commands.

   Create command
       ssm create [-h] [-s SIZE] [-n NAME] [--fstype FSTYPE] [-r LEVEL] [-I STRIPESIZE] [-i STRIPES] [-p POOL] [-e [{luks,plain}]] [-o MNT_OPTIONS] [-v VIRTUAL_SIZE] [device [device ...]] [mount]

       This  command creates a new volume with defined parameters. If a device is provided it will be used to create the volume, hence it will be added into the pool prior to volume creation (See Add command
       section). More than one device can be used to create a volume.

       If the device is already being used in a different pool, then ssm will ask you whether you want to remove it from the original pool. If you decline, or the removal  fails,  then  the  volume  creation
       fails  if  the  SIZE was not provided. On the other hand, if the SIZE is provided and some devices can not be added to the pool, the volume creation might still succeed if there is enough space in the
       pool.

       In addition to specifying size of the volume directly, percentage can be specified as well. Specify --size 70% to indicate the volume size to be 70% of total pool size. Additionally, percentage of the
       used, or free pool space can be specified as well using keywords FREE, or USED respectively.

       The  POOL  name  can  be specified as well. If the pool exists, a new volume will be created from that pool (optionally adding device into the pool).  However if the POOL does not exist, then ssm will
       attempt to create a new pool with the provided device, and then create a new volume from this pool. If the --backend argument is omitted, the default ssm backend will be used. The default  backend  is
       lvm.

       ssm also supports creating a RAID configuration, however some back-ends might not support all RAID levels, or may not even support RAID at all. In this case, volume creation will fail.

       If a mount point is provided, ssm will attempt to mount the volume after it is created. However it will fail if mountable file system is not present on the volume.

       If  the  backend  allows it (currently only supported with lvm backend), ssm can be used to create thinly provisioned volumes by specifying --virtual-size option. This will automatically create a thin
       pool of a given size provided with --size option and thin volume of a given size provided with --virtual-size option and name provided with --name option. Virtual size can be much bigger  than  avail‐
       able space in the pool.

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -s SIZE, --size SIZE
              Gives  the size to allocate for the new logical volume.  A size suffix K|k, M|m, G|g, T|t, P|p, E|e can be used to define 'power of two' units. If no unit is provided, it defaults to kilobytes.
              This is optional and if not given, maximum possible size will be used.  Additionally the new size can be specified as a percentage of the total pool size (50%), as a  percentage  of  free  pool
              space (50%FREE), or as a percentage of used pool space (50%USED).

       -n NAME, --name NAME
              The name for the new logical volume. This is optional and if omitted, name will be generated by the corresponding backend.

       --fstype FSTYPE
              Gives the file system type to create on the new logical volume. Supported file systems are (ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs). This is optional and if not given file system will not be created.

       -r LEVEL, --raid LEVEL
              Specify  a RAID level you want to use when creating a new volume. Note that some backends might not implement all supported RAID levels. This is optional and if no specified, linear volume will
              be created.  You can choose from the following list of supported levels (0,1,10).

       -I STRIPESIZE, --stripesize STRIPESIZE
              Gives the number of kilobytes for the granularity of stripes. This is optional and if not given, backend default will be used. Note that you have to specify RAID level as well.

       -i STRIPES, --stripes STRIPES
              Gives the number of stripes. This is equal to the number of physical volumes to scatter the logical volume. This is optional and if stripesize is set and multiple devices are  provided  stripes
              is determined automatically from the number of devices. Note that you have to specify RAID level as well.

       -p POOL, --pool POOL
              Pool to use to create the new volume.

       -e [{luks,plain}], --encrypt [{luks,plain}]
              Create encrpted volume. Extension to use can be specified.

       -o MNT_OPTIONS, --mnt-options MNT_OPTIONS
              Mount options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma separated string of options. This option is equivalent to the -o mount(8) option.

       -v VIRTUAL_SIZE, --virtual-size VIRTUAL_SIZE
              Gives the virtual size for the new thinly provisioned volume. A size suffix K|k, M|m, G|g, T|t, P|p, E|e can be used to define 'power of two' units. If no unit is provided, it defaults to kilo‐
              bytes.

   List command
       ssm list [-h] [{volumes,vol,dev,devices,pool,pools,fs,filesystems,snap,snapshots}]

       Lists information about all detected devices, pools, volumes and snapshots found on the system. The list command can be used either alone to list all of the information, or you  can  request  specific
       sections only.

       The following sections can be specified:

       {volumes | vol}
              List information about all volumes found in the system.

       {devices | dev}
              List information about all devices found on the system. Some devices are intentionally hidden, like for example cdrom or DM/MD devices since those are actually listed as volumes.

       {pools | pool}
              List information about all pools found in the system.

       {filesystems | fs}
              List information about all volumes containing filesystems found in the system.

       {snapshots | snap}
              List  information about all snapshots found in the system. Note that some back-ends do not support snapshotting and some cannot distinguish snapshot from regular volumes. In this case, ssm will
              try to recognize the volume name in order to identify a snapshot, but if the ssm regular expression does not match the snapshot pattern, the problematic snapshot will not be recognized.

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

   Remove command
       ssm remove [-h] [-a] [items [items ...]]

       This command removes an item from the system. Multiple items can be specified.  If the item cannot be removed for some reason, it will be skipped.

       An item can be any of the following:

       device Remove a device from the pool. Note that this cannot be done in some cases where the device is being used by the pool. You can use the -f argument to force  removal.  If  the  device  does  not
              belong to any pool, it will be skipped.

       pool   Remove a pool from the system. This will also remove all volumes created from that pool.

       volume Remove a volume from the system. Note that this will fail if the volume is mounted and cannot be forced with -f.

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -a, --all
              Remove all pools in the system.

   Resize command
       ssm resize [-h] [-s SIZE] volume [device [device ...]]

       Change  size  of  the  volume  and file system. If there is no file system, only the volume itself will be resized. You can specify a device to add into the volume pool prior the resize. Note that the
       device will only be added into the pool if the volume size is going to grow.

       If the device is already used in a different pool, then ssm will ask you whether or not you want to remove it from the original pool.

       In some cases, the file system has to be mounted in order to resize. This will be handled by ssm automatically by mounting the volume temporarily.

       In addition to specifying new size of the volume directly, percentage can be specified as well. Specify --size 70% to resize the volume to 70% of it's original size. Additionally,  percentage  of  the
       used, or free pool space can be specified as well using keywords FREE, or USED respectively.

       Note that resizing btrfs subvolume is not supported, only the whole file system can be resized.

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -s SIZE, --size SIZE
              New  size  of the volume. With the + or - sign the value is added to or subtracted from the actual size of the volume and without it, the value will be set as the new volume size. A size suffix
              of [k|K] for kilobytes, [m|M] for megabytes, [g|G] for gigabytes, [t|T] for terabytes or [p|P] for petabytes is optional. If no unit is provided the default is kilobytes.  Additionally the  new
              size can be specified as a percentage of the original volume size ([+][-]50%), as a percentage of free pool space ([+][-]50%FREE), or as a percentage of used pool space ([+][-]50%USED).

   Check command
       ssm check [-h] device [device ...]

       Check the file system consistency on the volume. You can specify multiple volumes to check. If there is no file system on the volume, this volume will be skipped.

       In some cases the file system has to be mounted in order to check the file system.  This will be handled by ssm automatically by mounting the volume temporarily.

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

   Snapshot command
       ssm snapshot [-h] [-s SIZE] [-d DEST | -n NAME] volume

       Take  a  snapshot  of  an existing volume. This operation will fail if the back-end to which the volume belongs to does not support snapshotting.  Note that you cannot specify both NAME and DEST since
       those options are mutually exclusive.

       In addition to specifying new size of the volume directly, percentage can be specified as well. Specify --size 70% to indicate the new snapshot size to be 70% of the origin volume size.  Additionally,
       percentage of the used, or free pool space can be specified as well using keywords FREE, or USED respectively.

       In some cases the file system has to be mounted in order to take a snapshot of the volume. This will be handled by ssm automatically by mounting the volume temporarily.

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -s SIZE, --size SIZE
              Gives  the size to allocate for the new snapshot volume. A size suffix K|k, M|m, G|g, T|t, P|p, E|e can be used to define 'power of two' units. If no unit is provided, it defaults to kilobytes.
              This is optional and if not given, the size will be determined automatically. Additionally the new size can be specified as a percentage of the original volume size (50%), as  a  percentage  of
              free pool space (50%FREE), or as a percentage of used pool space (50%USED).

       -d DEST, --dest DEST
              Destination of the snapshot specified with absolute path to be used for the new snapshot. This is optional and if not specified default backend policy will be performed.

       -n NAME, --name NAME
              Name of the new snapshot. This is optional and if not specified default backend policy will be performed.

   Add command
       ssm add [-h] [-p POOL] device [device ...]

       This  command  adds a device into the pool. By default, the device will not be added if it's already a part of a different pool, but the user will be asked whether or not to remove the device from its
       pool. When multiple devices are provided, all of them are added into the pool. If one of the devices cannot be added into the pool for any reason, the add command will fail. If no pool  is  specified,
       the default pool will be chosen. In the case of a non existing pool, it will be created using the provided devices.

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -p POOL, --pool POOL
              Pool to add device into. If not specified the default pool is used.

   Mount command
       ssm mount [-h] [-o OPTIONS] volume directory

       This  command  will  mount  the  volume at the specified directory. The volume can be specified in the same way as with mount(8), however in addition, one can also specify a volume in the format as it
       appears in the ssm list table.

       For example, instead of finding out what the device and subvolume id of the btrfs subvolume "btrfs_pool:vol001" is in order to mount it, one can simply call ssm mount btrfs_pool:vol001 /mnt/test.

       One can also specify OPTIONS in the same way as with mount(8).

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -o OPTIONS, --options OPTIONS
              Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma separated string of options. This option is equivalent to the same mount(8) option.

   Migrate command
       ssm migrate [-h] source target

       Move data from one device to another. For btrfs and lvm their specialized utilities are used, so the data are moved in an all-or-nothing fashion and no other operation  is  needed  to  add/remove  the
       devices or rebalance the pool.  Devices that do not belong to a backend that supports specialized device migration tools will be migrated using dd.

       This operation is not intended to be used for duplication, because the process can change metadata and an access to the data may be difficult.

BACK-ENDS
   Introduction
       Ssm  aims  to create a unified user interface for various technologies like Device Mapper (dm), Btrfs file system, Multiple Devices (md) and possibly more. In order to do so we have a core abstraction
       layer in ssmlib/main.py. This abstraction layer should ideally know nothing about the underlying technology, but rather comply with device, pool and volume abstractions.

       Various backends can be registered in ssmlib/main.py in order to handle specific storage technology, implementing methods like create, snapshot, or remove volumes and pools. The core  will  then  call
       these methods to manage the storage without needing to know what lies underneath it. There are already several backends registered in ssm.

   Btrfs backend
       Btrfs  is the file system with many advanced features including volume management. This is the reason why btrfs is handled differently than other conventional file systems in ssm. It is used as a vol‐
       ume management back-end.

       Pools, volumes and snapshots can be created with btrfs backend and here is what it means from the btrfs point of view:

       pool   A pool is actually a btrfs file system itself, because it can be extended by adding more devices, or shrunk by removing devices from it. Subvolumes and snapshots can also be created.  When  the
              new btrfs pool should be created, ssm simply creates a btrfs file system, which means that every new btrfs pool has one volume of the same name as the pool itself which can not be removed with‐
              out removing the entire pool. The default btrfs pool name is btrfs_pool.

              When creating a new btrfs pool, the name of the pool is used as the file system label. If there is an already existing btrfs file system in the system without a label, a btrfs pool name will be
              generated for internal use in the following format "btrfs_{device base name}".

              A btrfs pool is created when the create or add command is used with specified devices and non existing pool name.

       volume A  volume  in  the btrfs back-end is actually just btrfs subvolume with the exception of the first volume created on btrfs pool creation, which is the file system itself. Subvolumes can only be
              created on the btrfs file system when it is mounted, but the user does not have to worry about that since ssm will automatically mount the file system temporarily in order to create a new  sub‐
              volume.

              The  volume name is used as subvolume path in the btrfs file system and every object in this path must exist in order to create a volume. The volume name for internal tracking and that is visi‐
              ble to the user is generated in the format "{pool_name}:{volume name}", but volumes can be also referenced by its mount point.

              The btrfs volumes are only shown in the list output, when the file system is mounted, with the exception of the main btrfs volume - the file system itself.

              Also note that btrfs volumes and subvolumes cannot be resized. This is mainly limitation of the btrfs tools which currently do not work reliably.

              A new btrfs volume can be created with the create command.

       snapshot
              The btrfs file system supports subvolume snapshotting, so you can take a snapshot of any btrfs volume in the system with ssm. However btrfs does not distinguish  between  subvolumes  and  snap‐
              shots,  because  a  snapshot is actually just a subvolume with some blocks shared with a different subvolume.  This means, that ssm is not able to directly recognize a btrfs snapshot.  Instead,
              ssm will try to recognize a special name format of the btrfs volume that denotes it is a snapshot. However, if the NAME is specified when creating snapshot which does not match the special pat‐
              tern, snapshot will not be recognized by the ssm and it will be listed as regular btrfs volume.

              A new btrfs snapshot can be created with the snapshot command.

       device Btrfs does not require a special device to be created on.

   Lvm backend
       Pools, volumes and snapshots can be created with lvm, which pretty much match the lvm abstraction.

       pool   An lvm pool is just a volume group in lvm language. It means that it is grouping devices and new logical volumes can be created out of the lvm pool.  The default lvm pool name is lvm_pool.

              An lvm pool is created when the create or add commands are used with specified devices and a non existing pool name.

              Alternatively a thin pool can be created as a result of using --virtual-size option to create thin volume.

       volume An lvm volume is just a logical volume in lvm language. An lvm volume can be created with the create command.

       snapshot
              Lvm  volumes can be snapshotted as well. When a snapshot is created from the lvm volume, a new snapshot volume is created, which can be handled as any other lvm volume. Unlike btrfs lvm is able
              to distinguish snapshot from regular volume, so there is no need for a snapshot name to match special pattern.

       device Lvm requires a physical device to be created on the device, but with ssm this is transparent for the user.

   Crypt backend
       The crypt backend in ssm uses cryptsetup and dm-crypt target to manage encrypted volumes. The crypt backend can be used as a regular backend for creating encrypted volumes  on  top  of  regular  block
       devices, or even other volumes (lvm or md volumes for example). Or it can be used to create encrypted lvm volumes right away in a single step.

       Only volumes can be created with crypt backend. This backend does not support pooling and does not require special devices.

       pool   The crypt backend does not support pooling, and it is not possible to create crypt pool or add a device into a pool.

       volume A  volume  in the crypt backend is the volume created by dm-crypt which represents the data on the original encrypted device in unencrypted form.  The crypt backend does not support pooling, so
              only one device can be used to create crypt volume. It also does not support raid or any device concatenation.

              Currently two modes, or extensions are supported: luks and plain. Luks is used by default. For more information about the extensions, please see cryptsetup manual page.

       snapshot
              The crypt backend does not support snapshotting, however if the encrypted volume is created on top of an lvm volume, the lvm volume itself can be snapshotted. The snapshot can be then opened by
              using cryptsetup.  It is possible that this might change in the future so that ssm will be able to activate the volume directly without the extra step.

       device The crypt backend does not require a special device to be created on.

   MD backend
       MD  backend  in ssm is currently limited to only gather the information about MD volumes in the system. You can not create or manage MD volumes or pools, but this functionality will be extended in the
       future.

   Multipath backend
       Multipath backend in ssm is currently limited to only gather the information about multipath volumes in the system. You can not create or manage multipath volumes or pools, but this functionality will
       be extended in the future.

EXAMPLES
       List system storage information:

          # ssm list

       List all pools in the system:

          # ssm list pools

       Create a new 100GB volume with the default lvm backend using /dev/sda and /dev/sdb with xfs file system:

          # ssm create --size 100G --fs xfs /dev/sda /dev/sdb

       Create a new volume with a btrfs backend using /dev/sda and /dev/sdb and let the volume to be RAID 1:

          # ssm -b btrfs create --raid 1 /dev/sda /dev/sdb

       Using the lvm backend create a RAID 0 volume with devices /dev/sda and /dev/sdb with 128kB stripe size, ext4 file system and mount it on /home:

          # ssm create --raid 0 --stripesize 128k /dev/sda /dev/sdb /home

       Create a new thinly provisioned volume with a lvm backend using devices /dev/sda and /dev/sdb using --virtual-size option:

          # ssm create --virtual-size 1T /dev/sda /dev/sdb

       Create a new thinly provisioned volume with a defined thin pool size and devices /dev/sda and /dev/sdb:

          # ssm create --size 50G --virtual-size 1T /dev/sda /dev/sdb

       Extend btrfs volume btrfs_pool by 500GB and use /dev/sdc and /dev/sde to cover the resize:

          # ssm resize -s +500G btrfs_pool /dev/sdc /dev/sde

       Shrink volume /dev/lvm_pool/lvol001 by 1TB:

          # ssm resize -s-1t /dev/lvm_pool/lvol001

       Remove /dev/sda device from the pool, remove the btrfs_pool pool and also remove the volume /dev/lvm_pool/lvol001:

          # ssm remove /dev/sda btrfs_pool /dev/lvm_pool/lvol001

       Take a snapshot of the btrfs volume btrfs_pool:my_volume:

          # ssm snapshot btrfs_pool:my_volume

       Add devices /dev/sda and /dev/sdb into the btrfs_pool pool:

          # ssm add -p btrfs_pool /dev/sda /dev/sdb

       Mount btrfs subvolume btrfs_pool:vol001 on /mnt/test:

          # ssm mount btrfs_pool:vol001 /mnt/test

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SSM_DEFAULT_BACKEND
              Specify which backend will be used by default. This can be overridden by specifying the -b or --backend argument. Currently only lvm and btrfs are supported.

       SSM_LVM_DEFAULT_POOL
              Name of the default lvm pool to be used if the -p or --pool argument is omitted.

       SSM_BTRFS_DEFAULT_POOL
              Name of the default btrfs pool to be used if the -p or --pool argument is omitted.

       SSM_PREFIX_FILTER
              When this is set, ssm will filter out all devices, volumes and pools whose name does not start with this prefix. It is used mainly in the ssm test suite to make sure that we do not scramble the
              local system configuration.

REQUIREMENTS
       Python 3.6 or higher is required to run this tool. System Storage Manager can only be run as root since most of the commands require root privileges.

       There are other requirements listed below, but note that you do not necessarily need all dependencies for all backends. However if some of the tools required by a backend  are  missing,  that  backend
       will not work.

   Python modules
       · argparse

       · atexit

       · base64

       · datetime

       · fcntl

   System tools
       · tune2fs

       · fsck.SUPPORTED_FS

       · resize2fs

       · xfs_db

   Lvm backend
       · lvm2 binaries

       Some distributions (e.g. Debian) have thin provisioning tools for LVM as an optional dependency, while others install it automatically. Thin provisioning without these tools installed is not supported
       by SSM.

   Btrfs backend
       · btrfs progs

   Crypt backend
       · dmsetup

       · cryptsetup

   Multipath backend
       · multipath
