NAME
       xssproxy - forward freedesktop.org Idle Inhibition Service calls to Xss

SYNOPSIS
       xssproxy [-v] [-i APP]

DESCRIPTION
       xssproxy  implements  the  org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver  D-Bus interface described in the Idle Inhibition Service Draft by the freedesktop.org developers.  The inhibition of the screensaver is then
       controlled using the XScreenSaverSuspend function from the Xss (X11 Screen Saver extension) library.

OPTIONS
       -v --verbose
              print messages when receiving inhibition requests

       -i --ignore
              do not disable the screensaver for this application ("*" to ignore all applications)

       --version
              print version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       To use run in your ~/.xinitrc file.  The program doesn't return so you need to run it in the background.
