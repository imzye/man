NAME
       fix_includes.py - manual page for fix_includes.py 6.0-2

SYNOPSIS
       fix_includes.py [options] [filename] ... < <output from include-what-you-use script>

DESCRIPTION
              OR fix_includes.py -s [other options] <filename> ...

       fix_includes.py reads the output from the include-what-you-use script on stdin -- run with --v=1 (default) verbose or above -- and, unless --sort_only or --dry_run is specified, modifies the files
       mentioned in the output, removing their old #include lines and replacing them with the lines given by the include_what_you_use script.  It also sorts the #include and forward-declare lines.

       All files mentioned in the include-what-you-use script are modified, unless filenames are specified on the commandline, in which case only those files are modified.

       The exit code is the number of files that were modified (or that would be modified if --dry_run was specified) unless that number exceeds 100, in which case 100 is returned.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -b, --blank_lines
              Put a blank line between primary header file and C/C++ system #includes, and another blank line between system #includes and google #includes [default]

       --noblank_lines

       --comments
              Put comments after the #include lines

       --nocomments

       --safe_headers
              Do not remove unused #includes/fwd-declares from header files; just add new ones [default]

       --nosafe_headers

       -s, --sort_only
              Just sort #includes of files listed on cmdline; do not add or remove any #includes

       -n, --dry_run
              Do not actually edit any files; just print diffs.  Return code is 0 if no changes are needed, else min(the number of files that would be modified, 100)

       --ignore_re=IGNORE_RE
              fix_includes.py will skip editing any file whose name matches this regular expression.

       --separate_project_includes=SEPARATE_PROJECT_INCLUDES
              Sort  #includes  for  current  project separately from all other #includes.  This flag specifies the root directory of the current project. If the value is "<tld>", #includes that share the
              same top-level directory are assumed to be in the same project.  If not specified, project #includes will be sorted with other non-system #includes.

       --invoking_command_line=INVOKING_COMMAND_LINE
              Internal flag used by iwyu.py, It should be the command line used to invoke iwyu.py

       -m, --keep_iwyu_namespace_format
              Keep forward-declaration namespaces in IWYU format, eg. namespace n1 { namespace n2 { class c1; } }. Do not convert to "normalized" Google format: namespace n1  {\nnamespace  n2  {\n  class
              c1;\n}\n}.

       --nokeep_iwyu_namespace_format
