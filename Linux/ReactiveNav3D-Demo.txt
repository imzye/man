NAME
       ReactiveNav3D-Demo - GUI demo of robot reactive navigation in 3D

SYNOPSIS
       ReactiveNav3D-Demo

DESCRIPTION
       A program to demonstrate the usage of the mrpt reactivenav library. It allows the user to set an arbitrary target and then simulate the robot actions to try to reach the target.

       The movements take into account the arbitrary 3D shape of the robot, and a set of kinematically-constrained trajectories.
