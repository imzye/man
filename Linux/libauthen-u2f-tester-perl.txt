NAME
       Authen::U2F::Tester::Keystore::Wrapped - Wrapped Keystore for Authen::U2F::Tester

VERSION
       version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        my $key = Crypt::PK::ECC->new;
        ...
        my $keystore = Authen::U2F::Tester::Keystore->new(key => $key);

        my $keypair = Authen::U2F::Tester::Keypair->new;
        my $handle = $keystore->put($keypair->private_key);

        if ($keystore->exists($handle)) {
            my $pkec = $keystore->get($handle);
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "wrapped" key store for Authen::U2F::Tester.  This is the default key store used by Authen::U2F::Tester.  This key store does not require any backing storage at all to keep track of
       registered keys.  Instead, it generates key handles by encrypting the private key using the tester's private key and returns this encrypted value as the key handle.  This is somewhat vaguely
       describe in the FIDO/U2F specifications as a "wrapped" key handle.  My experience is that most of the U2F devices out there use some variation of this scheme because it allows the devices to be
       used with an infinite number of services as no local storage is required on the U2F device.

       Storage of the key handle is not required because this class can tell if the handle is valid or not by trying to decrypt the passed in key handle.  If decryption succeeds, then the handle is
       valid.  Otherwise, the handle is not valid.
