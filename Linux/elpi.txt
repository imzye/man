NAME
       elpi - embeddable lambda-Prolog interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       elpi [OPTION].. [FILE].. [-- ARGS..]

DESCRIPTION
   Main options:

       -test runs the query "main"

       -exec pred
              runs the query "pred ARGS"

       -D var Define variable (conditional compilation)

       -document-builtins Print documentation for built-in predicates

       -no-tc don't typecheck the program

       -delay-problems-outside-pattern-fragment (deprecated, for Teyjus
              compatibility)

       -version prints the version of Elpi

   Parsing options:
       -I PATH
              search for accumulated files in PATH

   Tracing options:
       -trace-at FNAME START STOP
              print trace between call START

              and STOP of function FNAME (FNAME can be omitted, default is run)

       -trace-on KIND FILE enable trace printing.

              KIND is tty or json (default is tty).  FILE is stdout or stderr (default) or host:port or /path or ./path

       -trace-skip REX
              ignore trace items matching REX

       -trace-only REX
              trace only items matching REX

       -trace-only-pred REX
              trace only when the current predicate matches REX

       -trace-tty-maxbox NUM
              Format max_boxes set to NUM

       -trace-tty-maxcols NUM
              Format margin set to NUM

       -stats-on
              Collect statistics

       -perf-on
              Disable trace output, but keep perf

       Tracing options can be used to debug your programs and the Elpi interpreter.

       Tracing points for the user are prefixed with 'user:' while the ones for the Elpi developer with 'dev:'.

       A sensible set of options to debug your programs is: -trace-on -trace-at 1 9999 -trace-only '\(run\|select\|user:\)'

   Debug options (for debugging Elpi, not your program):

       -print-accumulated-files prints files loaded via accumulate

       -print-ast prints files as parsed, then exit

       -print prints files after most compilation passes, then exit

       -print-passes prints intermediate data during compilation, then exit

       -print-units prints compilation units data, then exit
