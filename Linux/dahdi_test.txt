NAME
       dahdi_test — Test if the DAHDI timer provides timely response

SYNOPSIS
       dahdi_test [ -v ]

DESCRIPTION
       dahdi_test dahdi_test runs a timing test in a loop and prints the result of each loop.  The test is as follows:

       It reads 8192 bytes from the DAHDI timer device (/dev/dahdi/pseudo).  This should take exactly 8000 ms . It uses calls to gettimeofday(2) before and after that read to check that indeed exactly 8000ms
       have passed.

       Values of 100% and 99.99% Are normally considered a definite pass.  Values of 99.98% and 99.97% are probably OK as well.

OPTIONS
       -v
              Be more verbose: print one line per test.

       -c count
              Run for count times instead of running forever.

FILES
       /dev/dahdi/pseudo
       The device file used to access the DAHDI timer.
