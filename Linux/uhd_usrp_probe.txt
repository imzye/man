NAME
       uhd_usrp_probe - USRP Hardware Driver Peripheral Report Utility

DESCRIPTION
       Report detailed information on UHD-supported Software Radio Peripherals
       attached by USB, network, or embedded configuration.

       The UHD package is the universal hardware  driver  for  Ettus  Research
       products.  The goal is to provide a host driver and API for current and
       future Ettus Research products.  Users will be  able  to  use  the  UHD
       driver standalone or with 3rd party applications.

       Details  include unit names, revision numbers, and available sensors on
       all attached USRP motherboards and daughterboards.

IDENTIFYING USRP DEVICES
       Devices are addressed through key/value  string  pairs.   These  string
       pairs  can  be  used to narrow down the search for a specific device or
       group of devices.  Most UHD utility applications and  examples  have  a
       --args  parameter that takes a device address, where the device address
       is  expressed  as  a  delimited  string.   See  the  documentation   in
       types/device_addr.hpp for reference.

       Every device has several ways of identifying it on the host system.

   Identifying by hardware identifier
       All USRP devices can be found through their hardware series identifier,
       which match to USRP devices as follows:

       Argument    |  Device

       type=usrp1  |  USRP1

       type=usrp2  |  USRP2, USRP N200, USRP N210

       type=b100   |  USRP B100

       type=b200   |  USRP B200, USRP B210

       type=e3x0   |  USRP E310

       type=x300   |  USRP X300, USRP X310

   Identifying by serial number
       All USRP devices are given a unique serial number, which can be used to
       identify a device as follows:

       serial=12345678

   Identifying by IP address
       USRP2, USRP N200, USRP N210, USRP X300, and USRP X310 devices connected
       to the host machine can all be found through  their  IP  addresses,  as
       follows:

       addr=192.168.10.2

   Identifying by name
       Users  have  the  option of giving their USRP devices short names using
       the usrp_burn_mb_eeprom utility in  lib/uhd/utils.  Devices  that  have
       been given a name can be identified as follows:

       name=foo

EXAMPLES
   Device discovery via command line
       Device  address  arguments  can  be supplied to narrow the scope of the
       search.

       uhd_usrp_probe --args="type=usrp1"

       -- OR --

       uhd_usrp_probe --args="serial=12345678"
