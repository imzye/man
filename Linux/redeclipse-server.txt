DESCRIPTION
       Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of
       agility in a variety of environments.

       redeclipse-server is a script which executes the redeclipse-server binary from the /usr/lib/games/redeclipse directory.

       The recommended way to change the settings of the server is to create and edit the file servinit.cfg in your home directory. Examples are available in /usr/share/doc/redeclipse/examples/

OPTIONS
   Filesystem options
       -hhomedir
              Sets your home directory to homedir.  This is where servinit.cfg is read from, it defaults to $HOME/.redeclipse/.

       -ppackagedir
              Includes the data files found in packagedir.  Can be used for adding additional maps that may be distributed to clients. By default redeclipse-server only includes data files in the working
              directory /usr/share/games/redeclipse/data and in the subdirecory temp of the home directory.

       -osauerdir
              Sets the path to your Sauerbraten directory. If the Red Eclipse server can find your Sauerbraten directory, it will be able to load and distribute maps from it.

       -glogfile
              Output log to logfile.  Path is set relative to homedir unless a leading ´/' is used, uses stdout if -g is given without a parameter. Defaults to stdout.

   Server configuration options
       -ss{0..3}
              Sets server type. 0 for local only, 1 for private, 2 for public, 3 for dedicated. Defaults to 1.

       -skjoinpass
              Sets the join password to joinpass.  Users must know the password before they can connect.

       -sPadminpass
              Sets the admin password to adminpass.

       -scmaxclients
              Sets the maximum number of clients to maxclients.

       -sldefaultmap
              Sets default map to defaultmap.

       -x"command 1; command 2; ..."
              Executes a list of commands once the Red Eclipse server has started up.

   Server connection options
       -siserverip
              Binds the server to the host address serverip.  Only needed for machines with more than one interface.

       -spserverport
              sets the server port to serverport.

       -smservermaster
              Uses servermaster as the master server, defaults to play.redeclipse.net.

       -saservermasterport
              Contacts the master server using port servermasterport, defaults to 28800.

       -suserveruprate
              Caps upstream rate to serveruprate.  Once the cap is hit it will likely cause major connection glitching and disconnects. Use maxclients for bandwitch limiting instead.

   Master server options
       -ms{0|1}
              Enables the server to act as a master server, defaults to 0.

       -mimasterip
              Binds the master server to the host address masterip.  Only needed for machines with more than one interface, defaults to localhost.

       -mpmasterport
              Binds the master server to the host port masterport, defaults to 28800.

   General options
       --help Display this manpage

       -v{0..4}
              Sets verbosity. This affects how much information is printed to the console. 0 is the least verbose, 4 is the most verbose.

EXAMPLES
       redeclipse-server -p$HOME/mod/data -ss0 -slbath -sPpass
           Loads data from an additional directory, sets the server type to local (LAN), sets the default map to "bath" and sets the admin password to "pass"

       redeclipse-server -h$HOME/redeclipse-server_configs/
           Reads and writes the configuration files to the specified directory instead of $HOME/.redeclipse/.
