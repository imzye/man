NAME
       cmirrord — cluster mirror log daemon

SYNOPSIS
       cmirrord [-f] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       cmirrord is the daemon that tracks mirror log information in a cluster.
       It is specific to device-mapper based mirrors (and  by  extension,  LVM
       cluster mirrors).  Cluster mirrors are not possible without this daemon
       running.

       This daemon relies  on  the  cluster  infrastructure  provided  by  the
       corosync,  which  must  be  set up and running in order for cmirrord to
       function.

       Output is logged via syslog(3). The SIGUSR1 signal(7) can be issued  to
       cmirrord to gather current status information for debugging purposes.

       Once started, cmirrord will run until it is shutdown via SIGINT signal.
       If there are still active cluster mirrors, however, the signal will  be
       ignored.  Active cluster mirrors should be shutdown before stopping the
       cluster mirror log daemon.

OPTIONS
       -f, --foreground
           Do not fork and log to the terminal.

       -h, --help
           Print usage.
