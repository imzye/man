NAME
       dictfmt_index2suffix  -  Creates  a  .suffix file from a DICTD database
       .index file

SYNOPSIS
       dictfmt_index2suffix [OPTIONS] [index_file]

DESCRIPTION
       dictfmt_index2suffix creates a suffix index file on stdout for the  in‐
       dex  file  given  on stdin or the command line.  A suffix index file is
       the same as the  .index file except the characters in the headwords are
       reversed.  A suffix index file is normally named <basename>.suffix, but
       this is not mandatory as long as the proper name is used in  the  dictd
       configuration file.

OPTIONS
       --help displays a usage message and exits

       --locale locale
              use  locale  for  sorting  the  .suffix file.  If this option is
              omitted, the default locale "C" is used.

       index_file
              the .index file to be converted.
