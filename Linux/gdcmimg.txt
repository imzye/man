GDCMIMG(1)                    DICOM Manipulation.                   GDCMIMG(1)

NAME
       gdcmimg - Manipulate DICOM image file.

       gdcmimg is a low level tool to allow de-/encapsulation from/to DICOM
       image. This tool does not understand Transfer Syntax conversion. It
       will encapsulate the raw data as-is. This has some impact in some
       cases, see special warnings below.

       It is important to note that gdcmimg can only encapsulate proper input
       file, for instance JPG and or JP2 are accepted since an associated
       DICOM Transfer Syntax can be found. However input such as TIFF and/or
       PNG are not, since DICOM does not support those. See instead a tool
       such as gdcm2vtk.

SYNOPSIS
           gdcmimg [options] file-in file-out

DESCRIPTION
       The gdcmimg command line tool can be used in two fashions:

       •   1. Converting a recognized file format into its encapsulated DICOM
           counterpart,

       •   2. Anonymizing a rectangular portion of a DICOM file.

SUPPORTED FILE FORMAT (APPROPRIATE FILE EXTENSION)
       gdcmimg will base it's conversion process based on the file extension.
       Follows the list of recognized file extension. When no extension is
       found, DICOM file is assumed.

       input format

             * RAW       (raw, rawl, gray, rgb)
             * RLE       (rle)
             * PNM       (pgm, pnm, ppm)
             * JPEG-LS   (jls)
             * JPEG 2000 (jp2, j2k, j2c, jpx, jpc)
             * JPEG      (jpg, jpeg, ljpg, ljpeg)
             * DICOM     ()

       output format:

             * PGM       (pgm, pnm, ppm)
             * DICOM     ()

       For RAW file format, you should take special care of the –endian
       option. For the (old) JPEG file format, both the lossy and lossless
       format are supported, user should pay attention to the –sign option.
       For file format such as RLE or RAW, user is expected to fill in
       information required to find the dimension and type of input data as
       there is no other way to find this information. For all other file
       format, the properties are derived from the file format itself.

       PNM file are supposed to be big endian (important for depth > 8)

TYPICAL USAGE
   Remove a rectangular part of the image
       To fill the region [0,100]x[0,100] of a DICOM image simply do:

           $ gdcmimg --fill 0 --region 0,100,0,100 -i input.dcm -o output_black.dcm

       Warning: if the Pixel Data is compressed, the image is first
       decompressed so that pixel can be set to 0, but it is not
       re-compressed.

   Convert RAW to DICOM
       Recognized extension is .raw, .rawl, .gray or .rgb (case insensitive)

           $ gdcmimg --size 512,512 --depth 16 -i input.raw -o output.dcm

       the image will be a Secondary Capture.

       When the input is 3 component, one need to specify explicitly the
       Samples Per Pixel:

           $ gdcmimg --size 512,512 --spp 3  input_rgb.raw output_rgb.dcm

       When the filename contains .rgb as file extension output is
       automatically recognized as RGB no need to specify –spp

           $ gdcmimg --size 512,512 input.rgb output_rgb.dcm

       You can use the dd cmd line to skip any header you would like to
       discard, for instance, if you would like to skip the first 108 bytes,
       simply do:

           $ dd skip=108 bs=1 if=input.raw of=output.raw

       .raw and .rawl extension are equivalent. You need to explicitly specify
       the endianness manually:

           $ gdcmimg --endian MSB --size 512,512 --depth 16 -i input.raw -o output.dcm

       or

           $ gdcmimg --endian LSB --size 512,512 --depth 16 -i input.raw -o output.dcm

   Convert PGM/PNM/PPM to DICOM
       Recognized extensions are .pgm, .pnm, .ppm (case insensitive)

           $ gdcmimg -i input.pgm -o output.dcm

       the image will be a Secondary Capture

   Convert RLE to DICOM
       Recognized extension is .rle (case insensitive)

           $ gdcmimg --size 512,512 --depth 16 -i input.rle -o output.dcm

       the image will be a Secondary Capture

   Convert JPEG to DICOM
       Recognized extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, .ljpg, .ljpeg (case insensitive)

           $ gdcmimg -i input.ljpeg -o output.dcm

       the image will be a Secondary Capture

   Convert J2K to DICOM
       Recognized extensions are .j2k, .jp2, .jpc, jpx, j2c (case insensitive)

           $ gdcmimg -i input.j2k -o output.dcm

       the image will be a Secondary Capture.

       All Pixel information (Bits Stored/Allocated...) will be derived from
       the image itself, and not from the command line options.

   Specifying a SOP Class UID
       Instead of the default Secondary Capture Image Storage, one may want to
       specify, say VL Photographic Image Storage.

           $ gdcmimg --sop-class-uid 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.77.1.4 input.jpg output.dcm

   Specifying a template DICOM file
       Instead of the default Secondary Capture Image Storage, generated with
       default values, one may want to specify a DICOM file that will serve as
       template to fill in the DICOM attributes.

           $ gdcmimg --sign 1 --template template.dcm input.jpg output.dcm

       Pay attention that any values from template.dcm that are not consistent
       with what is found inside the reference image will be overriden (eg.
       image size). On particular case should be of concern: the Pixel
       Representation for the JPEG family.

MULTIPLE FILES
       gdcmimg handle nicely a set of files (for instance jpeg):

           $ gdcmimg -C 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.12.1 1.jpg 2.jpg 3.jpg 4.jpg output.dcm

       It is important to specify an SOP Class that supports multi-frames
       images otherwise gdcmimg will fail.

START OFFSET
       In some case, one may want to create a 2D slice from an arbitrary
       volume (e.g 3D). In which case –offset becomes handy:

           $ gdcmimg --offset 4954104330 --size 1673,1673 Input3D_1673_1673_1775.raw slice_1770.dcm

WARNING
       There are a couple of issues with gdcmimg implementation:

       For RAW file, one should pay attention that when using –endian MSB the
       Pixel Data will be encapsulated as is (not touched by gdcmimg).
       Therefore the only possible transfer syntax available is Implicit VR
       Big Endian DLX (G.E Private). GDCM does handle this private Transfer
       Syntax. So if you need to convert this Transfer Syntax to another one
       (and allow Pixel Data manipulation), you can use:

           $ gdcmconv --raw --force input_big_endian_dlx.raw -o output_implicit_vr_little_endian.dcm

       For JFIF file and JP2 file (with header) the header is copied into the
       Pixel Data element which is illegal for JP2. Use gdcmconv to properly
       re-encode a JP2/JFIF file into J2K/JPG.

           $ gdcmimg input.jp2 output_jp2.dcm
           $ gdcmconv --j2k --force output_jp2.dcm output_j2k.dcm

       For RLE file, no check is done for crossing the row boundary. It is
       recommended to use gdcmconv –rle to re-encode into a proper RLE file in
       case of doubt.

       Of course if the compression is not ok with your setup, you can always
       de-encapsulated the DICOM file (typically JPEG) to a non-encapsulated
       form, using gdcmconv:

           $ gdcmconv --raw input_jpeg.dcm output_raw.dcm
