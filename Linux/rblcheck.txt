NAME
       rblcheck - check if an IP address is blacklisted

SYNOPSIS
       rblcheck [-qtlcvh?] [-s <service>] <address> [ <address> ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       rblcheck is a very basic interface to DNSBL listings such as those operated by The Spamhaus Project or Spamcop.

       The  general  idea  behind DNSBL listings is rapid lookup of IP addresses using DNS (for example, for blacklisting IP addresses because of abuse). Each IP address is reversed and has a domain name
       attached to it; for example, the IP address 127.0.0.2 would become 2.0.0.127, and then a domain such as "relays.visi.com" would be added to it. You would  then  try  to  resolve  the  result  (ie.
       2.0.0.127.relays.visi.com);  if  you  receive  a positive reply, then you know that the address is listed. Further information can also be queried, such as text descriptions of why the address was
       listed.

OPTIONS
       -q     Quiet mode; outputs only matching IP address(es) - use return code (see below).

       -t     Print a TXT record, if any.

       -m     Stop checking after first address match in any list.

       -l     List default DNSBL services to check.

       -c     Clear the current list of DNSBL services.

       -s <service>
              Toggle service in the DNSBL list.

       -h, -? Display the help message.

       -v     Display version information.

       <address>
              An IP address to look up; specify `-' to read multiple addresses from standard input.

RETURN CODES
       When invoked, rblcheck returns either 0 (to indicate error, or that the address was not in any of the listings), or a positive number (indicating the number of listings that  the  IP  address  was
       found in).
