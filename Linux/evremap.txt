NAME
       evremap - keyboard input remapper for Linux/Wayland systems

DESCRIPTION
       evremap  works  by  grabbing  exclusive access to an input device and maintaining a model of the keys that are pressed. It then applies your remapping configuration to produce the effective set of
       pressed keys and emits appropriate changes to a virtual output device.

       Because evremap targets the evdev layer of libinput, its remapping is effective system-wide: in Wayland, X11 and the linux console.

       evtest(1) can be used to identify keycodes of an input device.

   USAGE:

       evremap remap config-file --delay <delay>

       evremap list-devices

       evremap list-keys

       evremap debug-events

   FLAGS:
       -d, --delay <delay>
              Startup delay in second

       -h, --help
              Prints help information

       -V, --version
              Prints version information

   SUBCOMMANDS:
       help   Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

       list-devices
              Rather than running the remapper, list currently available devices. This is helpful to check their names when setting up the initial configuration

       list-keys
              Show a list of possible KEY_XXX values

       debug-events
              Listen to events and print them out to facilitate learning which keys/buttons have which labels for your device(s)

       remap  Load a remapper config and run the remapper. This usually requires running as root to obtain exclusive access to the input devices

FILE
       /etc/evremap.conf
              Mapping configuration file

Sample Configuration
         # The name of the device to remap.
         # Run `sudo evremap list-devices` to see the devices available
         # on your system.
         device_name = "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"

         # If you have multiple devices with the same name, you can optionally
         # specify the `phys` value that is printed by the `list-devices` subcommand
         # phys = "usb-0000:07:00.3-2.1.1/input0"

         # Configure CAPSLOCK as a Dual Role key.
         # Holding it produces LEFTCTRL, but tapping it
         # will produce ESC.
         # Both `tap` and `hold` can expand to multiple output keys.
         [[dual_role]]
         input = "KEY_CAPSLOCK"
         hold = ["KEY_LEFTCTRL"]
         tap = ["KEY_ESC"]
         # This config snippet is useful if your keyboard has an arrow
         # cluster, but doesn't have page up, page down, home or end
         # keys.  Here we're configuring ALT+arrow to map to those functions.
         [[remap]]
         input = ["KEY_LEFTALT", "KEY_UP"]
         output = ["KEY_PAGEUP"]

         [[remap]]
         input = ["KEY_LEFTALT", "KEY_DOWN"]
         output = ["KEY_PAGEDOWN"]

         [[remap]]
         input = ["KEY_LEFTALT", "KEY_LEFT"]
         output = ["KEY_HOME"]

         [[remap]]
         input = ["KEY_LEFTALT", "KEY_RIGHT"]
         output = ["KEY_END"]

         # When applying remapping configuration, ordering is important:
         # Dual Role entries are always processed first Remap entries are applied in
         # the order that they appear in your configuration file

         # Here's an example where ordering is important: on the PixelBook Go keyboard, the
         # function key row has alternate functions on the keycaps. It is natural to want
         # the mute button to mute by default, but to emit the F8 key when holding alt. We
         # can express that with the following configuration:

         [[remap]]
         input = ["KEY_LEFTALT", "KEY_F8"]
         # When our `input` is matched, our list of `output` is prevented from
         # matching as the `input` of subsequent rules.
         output = ["KEY_F8"]

         [[remap]]
         input = ["KEY_F8"]
         output = ["KEY_MUTE"]
