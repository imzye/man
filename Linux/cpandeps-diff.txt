NAME
       cpandeps-diff - generate reports when modules' dependencies get new releases

SYNOPSIS
           cpandeps-diff add Some::Module --perl 5.30.3 --mirror file:///home/me/cpanmirror

           cpandeps-diff list

           cpandeps-diff report Some::Module

COMMANDS
       cpandeps-diff takes at most one of several different commands, some of which in turn take more arguments:

   add $module [@args]
       Add the named module to the list of modules we care about

   remove $module [@args]
       Stop reporting on this module

       (aliases: delete; rm)

   list
       Show which modules we're going to report on

   report $module [@args]
       Generate a report for just this one module

   [@args]
       If you don't provide a command then it will generate a report about all known modules.

   help
       Can you guess what this does?

ARGUMENTS
   perl $version
       Use this version of perl for figuring out what's in core. Any dependencies that are in core will not be reported on unless a newer version is required.

       If not specified it defaults to 5.005.

       Note that adding, removing and reporting on modules always depends on the version of perl, so as well as being used to figure out what's in core you can also have different lists of modules for
       different versions of perl.

   mirror $mirror
       Use this CPAN mirror to fetch dependency information from (see CPAN::FindDependencies documentation for details). You may provide this argument as many times as you want.

FILES
       Data is stored in a directory called .cpandeps-diff, which by default is under your home directory. If you want to put it somewhere else (you probably don't) then set CPANDEPS_DIFF_DIR in your
       environment. That data includes a cache of data fetched from the CPAN which will be automatically cleared out after 23 hours. This cache helps to generate reports for multiple modules more quickly,
       and also to prevent you from being rate-limited or even kicked off CPAN mirrors.

WARNINGS, BUGS and FEEDBACK
       This script has not been thoroughly tested.

       I welcome feedback about my code, including constructive criticism.  Bug reports should be made on Github or by email.
