NAME
       Bio::Graphics::Browser2::CAlign - Compiled helper for Bio::Graphics::Browser::Realign

SYNOPSIS
       No user serviceable parts.

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used internally by Bio::Graphics::Browser2::Realign.  If the module is present, the Smith-Waterman alignment will be faster.  Otherwise, Bio::Graphics::Browser2::Realign will fall
       back to a slower pure-perl implementation.
