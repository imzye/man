SYNOPSIS
       sip  [-h]  [-V] [-a file] [-b file] [-B tag] [-c dir] [-d file] [-D] [-e] [-f] [-g] [-I dir] [-j number] [-k] [-m file] [-n name] [-o] [-p module] [-P] [-r] [-s suffix] [-t tag] [-w] [-x fea‐

DESCRIPTION
       sip takes a set of specification files and generates C++ code, documentation and build files.

       The format of the needed specification file is similar to a C++ header.  sip includes run-time support for the generated code.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -V     Display the sip version number.

       -a file
              The name of the QScintilla API file. If not indicated, it will not be generated.

       -b file
              The name of the build file. If not indicated, it will not be generated.

       -B tag Add tag to the list of timeline backstops (deprecated).

       -c dir The name of the directory where generated source file will be put.  If not indicated, no code will be generated.

       -d file
              The name of the documentation file (deprecated).  If not indicated, no documentation will be generated.

       -D     Generate code for a debug build of Python.

       -e     Enable support for exceptions. Disabled by default.

       -f     Handle warnings as errors.

       -g     Always release and reacquire the GIL.

       -I dir Directory where sip can search for included files.

       -j number
              Splits the generated code in number files (1 by default). This flag was added for parallel compilation on SMP machines.

       -k     Support keyword arguments in functions and methods.

       -m file
              The name of the XML export file. If not indicated, the file will not be generated.

       -r     Enable tracing on generated code.

       -s suffix
              The suffix used for generated C or C++ files (".c" or ".cpp" if none specified)

       -t tag The version/platform to generate code for.

       -w     Enable warning messages.

       -x feature
              Disable a feature.

       -X id:file
              Create the extracts for an id in a file.

       -y file
              The name of the .pyi stub file to generate. If not indicated, it will not be generated.

       -z file
              The name of a file containing additional command line flags.  This option is deprecated, use @file instead.

       @file  The name of a file containing more command line flags.

       file   The name of the file containing the specification. If you skip it, sip will expect to be fed by stdin.
