NAME
       eyes17 - an interactive board to control the expeyes-17 box

SYNOPSIS

       eyes17

DESCRIPTION
       eyes17 is a program to control interactively most features of the expeyes-17 box.

       Eyes17 is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware & software framework for developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and
       learn science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time measurements and analysing the data in different ways. Analog voltages are measured with 0.025% resolution and time
       intervals with one microsecond. This project is based on Free and Open Source software, mostly written in Python programming language. The hardware design is also open. When compared with previous
       ExpEYES boxes (Expeyes, Expeyes-Junior), ExpEYES-17 is richer in various features: multiple soft input ranges, more flexible wave generator, better time resolution, better voltage resolution,
       supports seamlessly cheap I2C sensors.
