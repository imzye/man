              [-i] [-s_srs srs_def] [-t_srs srs_def] [-to "NAME=VALUE"]
              [-ct proj_string] [-order n] [-tps] [-rpc] [-geoloc]

DESCRIPTION
       The  gdaltransform  utility  reprojects  a list of coordinates into any
       supported projection,including GCP-based transformations.

       -s_srs <srs_def>
              Set source spatial reference.  The coordinate systems  that  can
              be passed are anything supported by the OGRSpatialReference.Set‐
              FromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG PCS  and  GCSes  (i.e.
              EPSG:4296),  PROJ.4  declarations  (as  above), or the name of a
              .prj file containing well known text.

       -t_srs <srs_def>
              set target spatial reference.  The coordinate systems  that  can
              be passed are anything supported by the OGRSpatialReference.Set‐
              FromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG PCS  and  GCSes  (i.e.
              EPSG:4296),  PROJ.4  declarations  (as  above), or the name of a
              .prj file containing well known text.

       -ct <string>
              A PROJ string (single step operation  or  multiple  step  string
              starting  with +proj=pipeline), a WKT2 string describing a Coor‐
              dinateOperation, or a urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation:EPSG::XXXX
              URN overriding the default transformation from the source to the
              target CRS. It must take into account  the  axis  order  of  the
              source and target CRS.

              New in version 3.0.

       -to NAME=VALUE
              set  a  transformer option suitable to pass to GDALCreateGenImg‐
              ProjTransformer2().

       -order <n>
              order of polynomial used for warping (1 to 3). The default is to
              select a polynomial order based on the number of GCPs.

       -tps   Force  use  of  thin plate spline transformer based on available
              GCPs.

       -rpc   Force use of RPCs.

       -geoloc
              Force use of Geolocation Arrays.

       -i     Inverse transformation: from destination to source.

       -gcp <pixel> <line> <easting> <northing> [<elevation>]
              Provide a GCP to be used for transformation (generally three  or
              more are required)

       -output_xy
              Restrict output to "x y" instead of "x y z"

       <srcfile>
              File  with  source projection definition or GCP's. If not given,
              source projection is read from the command-line -s_srs  or  -gcp
              parameters

       <dstfile>
              File with destination projection definition.

       Coordinates are read as pairs, triples (for 3D,) or (since GDAL 3.0.0,)
       quadruplets (for X,Y,Z,time) of numbers per line from  standard  input,
       transformed,  and  written  out to standard output in the same way. All
       transformations offered by gdalwarp are  handled,  including  gcp-based
       ones.

       Note  that  input  and output must always be in decimal form.  There is
       currently no support for DMS input or output.

       If an input image file is provided, input is in pixel/line  coordinates
       on  that image.  If an output file is provided, output is in pixel/line
       coordinates on that image.

EXAMPLES
   Reprojection Example
       Simple reprojection from one projected coordinate system to another:

          gdaltransform -s_srs EPSG:28992 -t_srs EPSG:31370
          177502 311865

       Produces the following output in meters in the "Belge  1972  /  Belgian
       Lambert 72" projection:

          244510.77404604 166154.532871342 -1046.79270555763

   Image RPC Example
       The  following  command  requests an RPC based transformation using the
       RPC model associated with the named file.   Because  the  -i  (inverse)
       flag  is  used, the transformation is from output georeferenced (WGS84)
       coordinates back to image coordinates.

          gdaltransform -i -rpc 06OCT20025052-P2AS-005553965230_01_P001.TIF
          125.67206 39.85307 50

       Produces this output measured in pixels and lines on the image:

          3499.49282422381 2910.83892848414 50

   X,Y,Z,time transform
       15-term time-dependent Helmert coordinate transformation from  ITRF2000
       to ITRF93 for a coordinate at epoch 2000.0

          gdaltransform -ct "+proj=pipeline +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg \
          +xy_out=rad +step +proj=cart +step +proj=helmert +convention=position_vector \
          +x=0.0127 +dx=-0.0029 +rx=-0.00039 +drx=-0.00011 +y=0.0065 +dy=-0.0002 \
          +ry=0.00080 +dry=-0.00019 +z=-0.0209 +dz=-0.0006 +rz=-0.00114 +drz=0.00007 \
          +s=0.00195 +ds=0.00001 +t_epoch=1988.0 +step +proj=cart +inv +step \
          +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg"
          2 49 0 2000

       Produces  this  output  measured in longitude degrees, latitude degrees
       and ellipsoid height in metre:

          2.0000005420366 49.0000003766711 -0.0222802283242345
