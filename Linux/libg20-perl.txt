NAME
       G2 - A simple graphics library ported to Perl.

SYNOPSIS
         use G2;

         $dev1 = newX11 G2::Device(775, 575);
         $dev2 = newGD  G2::Device("test.png",600,200);

         $dev1->rectangle(20,20,150,150);
         $dev1->circle(100,150,60);

         $dev2->circle(100,150,60);
         $dev2->string(100,50,"A circle in a PNG file");

DESCRIPTION
       g2 is a simple to use graphics library for 2D graphical applications.  This library provides a comprehensive set of functions for simultaneous generation of graphical output on different types of
       devices.  Presently, following devices are currently supported by g2: X11, PNG, PostScript (xfig is in development).  One major feature of the g2_library is the concept of virtual devices. An
       arbitrary number of physical devices (such as PNG, or X11) can be grouped to create a so-called virtual device. Commands sent to such a virtual devices will automatically issued to all attached
       physical devices. This allows for example simultaneous output to a PNG file and a Postscript file. A virtual device in turn can be attached to another virtual device, allowing to construct trees
       of devices.  Virtual devices can also be useful when using different user-coordinate systems. E.g. one X11 window showing an overview of a graphical output, and a second window showing  a zoom of
       a more detailed area of the graphic.  Drawing in both windows is performed by one single command to the virtual device.  Please see g2 documentation (C interface) for up to date version.

Exported functions
   Creating new devices
       "newX11"
            "G2::Device::newX11(width,height)" class method

            opens an X11 window with width and height of X11 window given in pixels.  returns : a new X11 device.

       "newPS"
            "G2::Device::newPS(filename,paper,orientation)" class method

            opens  a  new  PostScript  device.   file_name: name of PostScript file paper: Paper size (e.g. g2_A4, g2_Letter). See PostScript paper sizes for a full list of supported sizes.  orientation:
            paper orientation. Either g2_PS_land for landscape or g2_PS_port  for  portrait returns : a new PostScript device.

       "newGD"
            "G2::Device::newGD(filename,width,height,type)" class method

            open a new GD device width,height: width and height of the image in pixels filename: name of the output file.  type: file type, 0-jpeg, 1-png returns : a new GD device

       "newVD"
            G2::Device::newVD() class method

            Create a new Virtual Device.  An arbitrary number of physical devices (such as PNG, or X11) can be grouped to create a so-called virtual device. Commands sent to such a virtual  devices  will
            automatically  issued  to  all  attached physical devices. This allows for example simultaneous output to a PNG file and a Postscript file. A virtual device in turn can be attached to another
            virtual device, allowing to construct trees of devices.  Virtual devices can also be useful when using different user-coordinate systems.  E.g.  one  X11  window  showing  an  overview  of  a
            graphical output, and a second window showing  a zoom of a more detailed area of the graphic.  Drawing in both windows is performed by one single command to the virtual device.
