DESCRIPTION
       The Spacewalk Package Pusher (rhnpush) pushes RPMs into locally managed channels on a Spacewalk Server. Refer to the Red Hat Satellite documentation for further reference.

OPTIONS
       -v --verbose
              Increase verbosity (can use multiple times).

       -dDIRECTORY
              process packages from this directory.

       -cCHANNEL_LABEL,
              process data for this specific channel (specified by label) only.  NOTE: the channel's *label* is NOT the same as the channel's *name*.

       -nN_HEADERS_PER_CALL
              process this number of headers per call. Current default is 25. Must be an integer.

       -l --list
              only list the specified channels.

       -rRELATIVE_DIRECTORY
              relative directory to associate with each file.

       -oORGANIZATION_ID
              Your organization's ID number. Must be an integer.

       -uUSERNAME
              username of user that has administrative access to the specified channel.

       -pPASSWORD
              see --username.

       -s --stdin
              read the package names from standard-in (allows piping).

       -Xglob exclude packages that matches this glob expression.

       --force
              force the package upload (overwrites if package is already uploaded).

       --tolerant
              If rhnpush errors while uploading a package, continue attempting to push the rest of the packages.

       --nosig
              don't fail if packages are unsigned.

       --newest
              push only the packages that are newer than those on the server.

              Please note that source RPMs are special in that their versions are never compared. Therefore, using this option with Spacewalk Package Pusher will upload source RPMs for the specified channels
              only if they were not previously uploaded, and binaries built from them exist in those channels.

              In other words, you have to upload a binary rpm before being able to use --newest with its source rpm.

       --timeout=SECONDS
              Change default connection timeout.

       --nullorg
              use the null org ID (most often the case).

       --header
              only upload the headers.

       --source
              the packages indicated are source packages (we treat them differently).

       --server=SERVER
              push to this server. The format is http[s]://<hostname>/APP

       --proxy=PROXY:PORT
              Use proxy server (:)

       --test only print the packages to be pushed, don't actually push them.

       -N --new-cache
              create a new username/password cache

       --no-session-caching
              This option disabled session token authentication. Useful if you want to push to two or more different servers.

       --extended-test
              perform a more verbose test.

       -h --help
              briefly describe the options.

       -? --usage
              usage summary.

NOTES ON USING RHNPUSH
       Rhnpush has three configuration files called /etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnpushrc, ~/.rhnpushrc, and ./.rhnpushrc.

       /etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnpushrc is the system-wide default settings for rhnpush.

       ~/.rhnpushrc is the user-specific settings that override the system-wide settings.

       ./.rhnpushrc controls the directory specific settings that override the user-specific and system-specific settings.

       /etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnpushrc must be present for rhnpush to function correctly. If it is missing, rhnpush will attempt to use a series of default settings stored internally as a  replacement.  ~/.rhn‐
       pushrc and ./.rhnpushrc are not required to be present, but will be used if they are present. They are not created automatically by rhnpush.

       Rhnpush uses a cache, stored at ~/.rhnpushcache, to temporarily hold the username and password for a user.

       If the cache is missing, it will be created by rhnpush.

       If the cache is present and not too old, the usename-password combo will be used as a convenience for the user.

       The amount of time a cache lasts is configurable in any of the three configuration files.

       If  your  username/password combination gets messed up you have two options. One, you can wait until the cache expires, which takes minutes by default. Two, you can use the --new_cache option to force
       rhnpush to let you reenter your username/password.

       Using the --stdin and --dir options at the same time works as follows: rhnpush will let you type in rpm names, each rpm name on a separate line. When you have finished entering in rpm names, hit Ctrl-
       D.  Rhnpush  will  then  grab the files from directory you specified with --dir, put them in a list with the rpms you listed through standard input, and send them to the channel that was listed on the
       command-line or in the configuration files.
