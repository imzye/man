NAME
       Module::Starter::Smart - A Module::Starter plugin for adding new modules into an existing distribution

VERSION
       version 0.0.9

SYNOPSIS
           use Module::Starter qw/Module::Starter::Smart/;
           Module::Starter->create_distro(%args);

           # or in ~/.module-starter/config
           plugin: Module::Starter::Smart

           # create a new distribution named 'Foo-Bar'
           $ module-starter --module=Foo::Bar

           # ... then add a new module
           $ module-starter --module=Foo::Bar::Me --distro=Foo-Bar

DESCRIPTION
       Module::Starter::Smart is a simple helper plugin for Module::Starter.  It subclasses Module::Starter::Simple and provides its own implementation for several file creation subroutines, such as
       "create_distro", "create_modules", "create_t", and so on.  These new implementations were designed to work with existing distributions.

       When invoked, the plugin checks if the distribution is already created.  If so, the plugin would bypass "create_basedir") and go ahead pull in all the existing modules and test files; these
       information would be used later in the corresponding file creation subroutines for skipping already-created files.

       UPDATE: This plugin only covers the simplest use cases.  For advanced usage, check out Module::Starter::AddModule.

   Example
       Say you have an existing distro, Goof-Ball, and you want to add a new module, Goof::Troop.

           % ls -R Goof-Ball
           Build.PL  Changes   MANIFEST  README    lib/      t/

           Goof-Ball/lib:
           Goof/

           Goof-Ball/lib/Goof:
           Ball.pm

           Goof-Ball/t:
           00.load.t       perlcritic.t    pod-coverage.t  pod.t

       Go to the directory containing your existing distribution and run module-starter, giving it the names of the existing distribution and the new module:

           % module-starter --distro=Goof-Ball --module=Goof::Troop
           Created starter directories and files

           % ls -R Goof-Ball
           Build.PL  Changes   MANIFEST  README    lib/      t/

           Goof-Ball/lib:
           Goof/

           Goof-Ball/lib/Goof:
           Ball.pm   Troop.pm

           Goof-Ball/t:
           00.load.t       perlcritic.t    pod-coverage.t  pod.t

       Troop.pm has been added to Goof-Ball/lib/Goof.

INTERFACE
       No public methods.  The module works by subclassing Module::Starter::Simple and rewiring its internal behaviors.

DEPENDENCIES
       Module::Starter::Smart subclasses Module::Starter::Simple.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       The plugin works perfectly with other template plugins, i.e.  Module::Starter::PBP (I started using it to develop this module)
