EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The  arcrm  command  deletes  files  on grid storage elements and indexing services.  In the case of an indexing service url all physical instances of the file corresponding to the given locations are
       deleted and unregistered. If an indexing service url is given without locations, all physical instances and all meta-information about file are deleted.  For more information on ARC URL syntax  please
       read "Protocols, Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and Extensions Supported in ARC" [NORDUGRID-TECH-7]

       If  url starts from '@', the remaining argument is assumed to be a path to a local file containing a list of URLs, one per line.  In this case arcrm performs like it were called with all those URLs as
       arguments.

       Depending on the installed libraries (check with -P ), the following protocols may be used: file  (file://  prefix  may  be omitted), http, https, httpg, ftp, gsiftp, srm, root.

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       X509_USER_PROXY
              The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard location.

       ARC_LOCATION
              The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not specified the install location will be determined from the path to the command being executed, and if this fails  a
              WARNING will be given stating the location which will be used.

       ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
              The  location  of  ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The default location is $ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc (\ in
              Windows).

EXAMPLE
       arcrm gsiftp://example.com/grid/file.dat

NOTES
       Lack of recursion is a feature.
