NAME
       xrdp-sesrun - xrdp-sesman(8) session launcher

SYNTAX
       xrdp-sesrun [ options ] username

DESCRIPTION
       xrdp-sesrun starts a session using xrdp-sesman(8).
       This is a tool useful for testing, it simply behaves like xrdp when some user logs in a new session and authenticates, thus starting a new session.

       Default values for the options are set at compile-time. Run the utility without a username to see what the defaults are for your installation.

       The utility prompts for a password if neither -p or -F is used.

OPTIONS
       -g <width>x<height>
              Set session geometry.
              Note that most configurations will resize the session on connection, so this option may not do what you expect.

       -b <bits-per-pixel>
              Set session bits-per-pixel (colour depth). Some session types (i.e. Xorg) will ignore this setting.

       -s <server>
              Server on which sesman is running (probably 'localhost').
              Use of this option is discouraged as it will be removed in the future.

       -t <session-type>
              Session type - one of Xorg, Xvnc or X11rdp. Alternatively, for testing only, use the numeric session code.

       -D <directory>
              Directory to run the new session in. Defaults to $HOME for the specified user.

       -S <shell>
              Specify an alternate shell to run, instead of the default window manager.

       -p <password>
              Password for user. USE FOR TESTING ONLY - the password will be visible in the output of the ps command.

       -F <file-descriptor>
              Specify a file descriptor (normally 0) to read the password in from. This is a secure way to pass the password in to the utility.

       -c <sesman-ini>
              Specify a different sesman.ini file. This file is used to find out how to connect to xrdp-sesman.

ENVIRONMENT
       SESRUN_LOG_LEVEL
              Override the default logging level. One of "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace" or a number 1-5.

EXAMPLES
       xrdp-sesrun -F 0 user1 <passwd.txt
              Create a default session for user user1 with a password from a file

       xrdp-sesrun -t Xvnc -S /usr/bin/xterm user1
              Create  an  extremely minimal Xvnc session for user user1. This could be useful for debugging why the standard session is not starting properly. Note you would need to install the xterm utility
              first. The gnome-terminal utility probably won't work here.

FILES
       /usr/sbin/xrdp-sesman
       /usr/bin/xrdp-sesrun
       /etc/xrdp/sesman.ini
