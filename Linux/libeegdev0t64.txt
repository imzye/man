EEGDEV-OPEN-OPTIONS(5)                                                                     EEGDEV library manual                                                                     EEGDEV-OPEN-OPTIONS(5)

NAME
       eegdev-open-options - Device configuration format specification

DESCRIPTION
   Syntax of the configuration string
       The device configuration string should follow the syntax:

                                                                                  device[[|option1|value1]...[|optionN|valueN]]

       If  the  specified  device does not support a certain pair of option|value, this will be silently ignored by the opening function. device should be the name of a eegdev plugin or any. In the later
       case, it will try to open one of the devices supported by the installed plugins.

   Syntax of the configuration files
       The configuration files are made of statements (at most one per line) following this syntax (whitespace are ignored):
                                                                                                  option = value

       Comments are preceded by the '#' character:

           # comment line 1
           # comment line 2
           option = value #comment2

FILES
       /etc/eegdev/eegdev.conf
           Shared configuration file.

       /etc/eegdev/<plugin>.conf
           Configuration file loaded when the plugin <plugin> is used. The settings specified here overrides the settings in the shared configuration file.

EXAMPLES
   Configuration string examples
       Device sourcing its data from the GDF file located at "/home/user/data.gdf":
                                                                                        datafile|path|/home/user/data.gdf

       Biosemi device configured to use 32 electrodes:
                                                                                                 biosemi|numch|32

       gTec system consisting in a chain of 2 systems (the first 2 available) with a notch filter at 60Hz without lowpass or highpass sampling at 512Hz (default sampling rate):
                                                                            gtec|notch|60|lowpass|none|highpass|none|deviceid|any+any

       Any supported type of device but should have the serial number UB-2009.10.06 if it is a gTec system:
                                                                                            any|deviceid|UB-2009.10.06

   Configuration file example
           # gTec configuration examples
           notch  = 60 # Notch value for USA
           lowpass =none
           highpass=none

            # Specify a coupled system by default
           deviceid = any+any
