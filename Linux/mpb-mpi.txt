NAME
       mpb-mpi - parallel (MPI) version of mpb
       mpbi-mpi - parallel (MPI) version of mpbi

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mpb-mpi and mpbi-mpi commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original programs don't have a manual page.

       mpb-mpi is a version of mpb built with MPI support through the mpich implementation. It can be run over a computer cluster to achieve distributed computations.

       mpbi-mpi is equivalent to mpb-mpi but requires, like mpbi, photonic structures respecting inversion symmetry.

SEE ALSO
       mpb(1),mpbi(1).
