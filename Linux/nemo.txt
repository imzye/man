NAME
       nemo - the Cinnamon File Manager

SYNOPSIS
       nemo [options] URIs...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nemo command.

       Nemo is the file manager for the Cinnamon desktop.

OPTIONS
       Nemo follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

       -g

       --geometry=GEOMETRY
              Create the initial window with the given geometry.

       -t

       --tabs Open URIs in tabs.

       --existing-window
              Open URIs in an existing window.

       -n

       --no-default-window
              Only create windows for explicitly specified URIs.

       --fix-cache
              Repair the user thumbnail cache - this can be useful if you're having trouble with file thumbnails.  Must be run as root.

       --debug
              Enable debugging code.  Example usage: 'NEMO_DEBUG=Actions nemo --debug'.  Use NEMO_DEBUG=all for more topics.

       -q

       --quit Quit Nemo.

       --help Show a summary of options.

       --version
              Show Nemo's version.

       Other standard GNOME options not listed here are also supported.

NOTE ON THE ROOT USER
       Ordinarily,  nemo and nemo-desktop treat being run as the root user as special, with certain restrictions and UI changes. This behavior can be bypassed via a gsettings key. You can use the follow‐
       ing command to enable/disable this override:

       gsettings set org.nemo.preferences treat-root-as-normal true|false
