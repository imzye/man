NAME
       sipquery - register and report sip contact details

SYNOPSIS
       sipquery [options] userid[@server[:port]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a tool that uses the registration process to query the sip contact uri for a registered user agent.  This may even be considered a demonstration of a security flaw in the standard SIP server
       model.  Basically, an un-authenticated registration request is sent to the server, and the contact uri is read to standard out from the server reply message.

OPTIONS
       --forward=address
              Sets the "public appearing" IP address for testing behind NAT.

       --port=number
              Sets the sip port number, in case the default port (5060) is in use already.

       --proxy=host
              Use a specified outbound proxy uri to get to the server being queried.

       --server=host
              Specify server uri to query unless offered as part of userid.

       --timeout=seconds
              Time to wait for query response.
