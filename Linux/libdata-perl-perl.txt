NAME
       Data::Perl::Role::Collection::Hash - Wrapping class for Perl's built in hash structure.

VERSION
       version 0.002011

SYNOPSIS
         use Data::Perl qw/hash/;

         my $hash = hash(a => 1, b => 2);

         $hash->values; # (1, 2)

         $hash->set('foo', 'bar'); # (a => 1, b => 2, foo => 'bar')

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides a wrapper and methods for interacting with a hash.  All methods that return a list do so via a Data::Perl::Collection::Array object.

PROVIDED METHODS
       new($key, $value, ...)
           Given an optional list of keys/values, constructs a new Data::Perl::Collection::Hash object initialized with keys/values and returns it.

       get($key, $key2, $key3...)
           Returns a list of values in the hash for the given keys.

           This method requires at least one argument.

       set($key => $value, $key2 => $value2...)
           Sets the elements in the hash to the given values. It returns the new values set for each key, in the same order as the keys passed to the method.

           This method requires at least two arguments, and expects an even number of arguments.

       delete($key, $key2, $key3...)
           Removes the elements with the given keys.

           Returns a list of values in the hash for the deleted keys.

       keys
           Returns the list of keys in the hash.

           This method does not accept any arguments.

       exists($key)
           Returns true if the given key is present in the hash.

           This method requires a single argument.

       defined($key)
           Returns true if the value of a given key is defined.

           This method requires a single argument.

       values
           Returns the list of values in the hash.

           This method does not accept any arguments.

       kv  Returns the key/value pairs in the hash as an array of array references.

             for my $pair ( $object->option_pairs ) {
                 print "$pair->[0] = $pair->[1]\n";
             }

           This method does not accept any arguments.

       elements/all
           Returns the key/value pairs in the hash as a flattened list..

           This method does not accept any arguments.

       clear
           Resets the hash to an empty value, like "%hash = ()".

           This method does not accept any arguments.

       count
           Returns the number of elements in the hash. Also useful for not empty: "has_options => 'count'".

           This method does not accept any arguments.

       is_empty
           If the hash is populated, returns false. Otherwise, returns true.

           This method does not accept any arguments.

       accessor($key)
       accessor($key, $value)
           If passed one argument, returns the value of the specified key. If passed two arguments, sets the value of the specified key.

           When called as a setter, this method returns the value that was set.

       shallow_clone
           This  method returns a shallow clone of the hash reference.  The return value is a reference to a new hash with the same keys and values.  It is shallow because any values that were references
           in the original will be the same references in the clone.

       _array_class
           The name of the class which returned lists are instances of; i.e.  "Data::Perl::Collection::Array".

           Subclasses of this class can override this method.

       Note that "each" is deliberately omitted, due to its stateful interaction with the hash iterator. "keys" or "kv" are much safer.
