NAME
       xcolmix - an RGB colour mixer

SYNOPSIS
       xcolmix [-display host:dpy] [-name appname] [-visual class] [-depth d] [-private] [-shared] [-stdcmap] [-debug d] [-sync] rgb-database-file

       The rgb-database-file is the file which holds the X-windows colour definitions, when absent: /etc/X11/rgb.txt is used.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xcolmix, command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       xcolmix  is  a colour mixer that enables you to mix your own colours in order to determine three values (the R/G/B code, or red-green-blue mix) of a colour. You can use those colours to, e.g., de‐
       fine the foreground or background of X applications which support it. Furthermore, xcolmix lets you retrieve RGB values from the X system's database of `predefined' colours.

       xcolmix is non longer actively maintained upstream. If you would like to take it over, talk to the author: Karel Kubat <karel@icce.rug.nl>.

OPTIONS
       xcolmix is built with the XForms Graphical User Interface Toolkit for X, and hence supports a number of flags which are interpreted by XForms.  The flags must be stated before any file  arguments,
       and are:

       -display host:dpy
              defines the X display.

       -name appname
              defines the application name (default is xcolmix).

       -visual class
              TrueColor, PseudoColor etc...

       -depth d
              visual depth in bits

       -private
              forces a private colourmap.

       -shared
              forces a shared colourmap.

       -stdcmap
              forces a standard colourmap.

       -debug l
              prints debugging information, l is the level.

       -sync  forces synchronous mode.

USING XCOLMIX
       Xcolmix  lets  you  define a separate background and a foreground colour for a part of the mixer window (the logo). Use this logo to, e.g., compare whether a particular text colour looks good on a
       particular background.

       Use the `foreground / background' buttons to select between the foreground or the background. Then, use the three silders labelled `red', `green' and `blue' to change the colour.

       The button `lookup' starts a second window, with a browser showing the system colour database. The default database name is /etc/X11/rgb.txt, though you can overrule this filename with a file  ar‐
       gument in the command that starts up xcolmix.
