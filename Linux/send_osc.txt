NAME
       send_osc - Sends a single OSC message

SYNOPSIS
       send_osc port path [,types] [args...]

DESCRIPTION
       send_osc  sends  an  OSC  message  to the specified port (UDP port number, or any other address string supported by liblo).  The message is delivered to path.  If the first argument following the path
       starts with a comma, it's interpreted as a type string, specifying the OSC data types to be used for sending the message arguments.  Otherwise, send_osc automatically tries  to  use  appropriate  data
       types.  Valid integer and float values are sent as such, anything else is sent as a string.
