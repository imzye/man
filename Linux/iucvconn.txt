NAME
       iucvconn - start terminal connection over z/VM IUCV

SYNOPSIS
       iucvconn [-h|--help]
       iucvconn [-v|--version]
       iucvconn [-e|--escape-char escape_char] [-s|--sessionlog log_file] vm_guest terminal_id

DESCRIPTION
       The  iucvconn  application  establishes a terminal connection to another Linux instance. The Linux instance where iucvconn runs and the target Linux instance
       must be z/VM guest operating systems of the same z/VM instance.  The communication path between both virtual machines is based on the z/VM Inter-User  Commu‐
       nication Vehicle (IUCV).  Because z/VM IUCV is independent from TCP/IP, Linux instances with no external network can be accessed.

       iucvconn  accesses  the  terminal specified by terminal_id on the z/VM guest virtual machine vm_guest.  The terminal_id is similar to a port number in TCP/IP
       communications.  terminal_id is case-sensitive and consists of up to 8 alphanumeric characters. terminal_id must either identify a running iucvtty  instance,
       or a terminal device provided by the z/VM IUCV hypervisor console (HVC) device driver.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display a short help text, then exit.

       -v, --version
              Display the version number of iucvconn, then exit.

       -e, --escape-char escape_char
              Set  an escape character for this terminal session. You need an escape character to access special iucvconn functions. The default escape character is
              underscore (_).  If escape_char is set to "none", escaping is not possible.  The escape character can be the closing bracket (]), the caret  (^),  the
              underscore (_), or any alphabetical character except C, D, Q, S and Z.  The escape_char character is not case-sensitive.

              To  invoke  a  iucvconn function, press Ctrl+escape_char, followed by the function character. For example, press "Ctrl+_ d" to disconnect the terminal
              session and exit iucvconn.

              For details, see section "ESCAPE CHARACTERS" below.

       -s, --sessionlog logfile
              Create a transcript of the terminal session and write session data to three different files.

              log_file contains the raw terminal data stream. The log_file.timing file contains timing data that can be used for replaying  the  raw  terminal  data
              stream using realistic output delays.  Additional terminal session information is logged to log_file.info.

              If any of these files already exist, iucvconn exits with an error. To proceed either delete the files or choose another file name for log_file.

ESCAPE CHARACTERS
       iucvconn supports functions through the use of an escape character.  The default escape character (escape_char) is underscore (_).

       To enter the "escape mode" of iucvconn, press the Control and the escape_char key together ("Ctrl+_") In the "escape mode", iucvconn expects a single charac‐
       ter designating the special function.

       The special functions are (assuming escape_char is set to underscore (_)):

           Ctrl+_  Send the escape character to the connected terminal.

           . or d  Disconnect and exit iucvconn.

           r       Force resizing of the connected terminal.

       Any other single character is ignored and is not send to the terminal. If multiple characters are entered together, iucvconn leaves  the  "escape  mode"  and
       sends the characters to the connected terminal.

EXAMPLES
       To access the "lnxterm" terminal on the Linux instance in z/VM guest virtual machine LNXSYS01:

         iucvconn LNXSYS01 lnxterm

       To access the first z/VM IUCV HVC terminal on the Linux instance in z/VM guest virtual machine LNXSYS02:

         iucvconn LNXSYS02 lnxhvc0

       To create a transcript of the terminal session to the Linux instance in z/VM guest virtual machine LNXSYS99:

         iucvconn -s ~/transcripts/lnxsys99 LNXSYS99 lnxhvc0

ENVIRONMENT
       TERM   The terminal environment variable contains the name of the terminal (e.g. linux, xterm, ...) and also specifies the terminal capabilities.

              iucvconn  transfers the value of the TERM environment variable at connection startup to the target system. The iucvtty application sets the TERM envi‐
              ronment variable on the target system before the login program is started.  Setting the TERM environment variable ensures that the terminal  capabili‐
              ties are the same on both sides of the connection.

              The z/VM IUCV hypervisor console (HVC) device driver ignores the content of the TERM environment variable transferred by iucvconn. See the hvc_iucv(9)
              manual page for instructions to configure the terminal environment.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If the Linux kernel does not include kernel support for the AF_IUCV network addressing family, iucvconn exits and displays the message 'AF_IUCV address  fam‐
       ily is not available: Address family not supported by protocol'.

SECURITY
   Linux
       The  iucvconn  program does not require superuser privileges and can be used by regular users.  Each connection attempt and failure is logged to the authpriv
       syslog facility.

       Terminal session transcripts facilitate logging and auditing of terminal activity on remote systems or recording and playing back terminal sessions, for  ex‐
       ample for education and presentations.

   z/VM guest virtual machine
       The z/VM guest virtual machine must have authorization to establish IUCV communication paths to other z/VM guest virtual machines.

       See the af_iucv(7) manual page for details about IUCV authorizations.

NOTES
       The Linux instance where iucvconn runs and the target Linux instances must be z/VM guest operating systems of the same z/VM instance.
