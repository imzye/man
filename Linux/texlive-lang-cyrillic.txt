NAME
       rubibtex - make a bibliography for (La)TeX using Russian letters as item names

SYNOPSIS
       rubibtex BASENAME

DESCRIPTION
       rubibtex is used to run bibtex(1) on auxiliary files with Russian characters in item names (citation keys).  It is part of the T2 package.

       rubibtex copies the auxiliary file to /tmp, uses sed(1) to convert Cyrillic character commands to their 8-bit ASCII equivalents; runs bibtex(1) on the modified file; and finally moves the original
       auxiliary file back (overwriting the modified file).

       rubibtex assumes that the bibtex(1) database (bib) files are encoded with the KOI8-R encoding.

FILES
       basename.aux
              LaTeX auxiliary file
