NAME
       bp_seqpart.pl - Takes one or more sequence files and splits them into a number of load balanced files.

USAGE
        bp_seqpart.pl -n <NUM_PARTS> [-h, -p <PREFIX>, -f <FORMAT>, -o <OUT_DIR>] <FILES...>

          -n number of files to create through partitioning
          -h this help message
          -p prefix for all FASTA file names output, files are of the form <outdir>/<prefix>#.<format>
          -f format of the files, defaults to FASTA but you can specify anything supported by SeqIO from BioPerl
          -o output directory where to dump the split sequence files

DESCRIPTION
       Script wrapping SeqIO that allows partitioning of multiple sequence files into near equal sized parts for later parallel processing. Even if you have 10 input files outputting to 10 files will balance
       the files to contain similar total length of sequence. ID's are ignored when deciding on how to balance each sequence.
