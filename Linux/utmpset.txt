NAME
       utmpset - logout a line from utmp and wtmp file

SYNOPSIS
       utmpset [ -w ] line

DESCRIPTION
       The utmpset program modifies the user accounting database utmp(5) and optionally wtmp(5) to indicate that the user on the terminal line has logged out.

       Ordinary  init(8)  processes handle utmp file records for local login accounting.  The runit(8) program doesn't include code to update the utmp file, the getty(8) processes are handled the same as all
       other services.

       To enable local login accounting, add utmpset to the getty(8) finish scripts, e.g.:

        $ cat /service/getty-5/finish
        #!/bin/sh
        exec utmpset -w tty5
        $

OPTIONS
       -w     wtmp. Additionally to the utmp file, write an empty record for line to the wtmp file.

EXIT CODES
       utmpset returns 111 on error, 1 on wrong usage, 0 in all other cases.
