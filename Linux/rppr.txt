NAME
       rppr - tool for working with reference packages

SYNOPSIS
       rppr <command> [options]

OPTIONS
   available commands
       check  checks a reference package

       convex_taxids
              determines convex tax_ids per-rank in a refpkg

       convexify
              identifies minimal leaf set to cut for taxonomic concordance

       infer  infers classifications of unclassified sequences in a reference package

       info   gives information about a reference package

       min_adcl
              finds a good collection of sequences to cut from a placefile's ref tree

       min_adcl_tree
              finds a good collection of sequences to cut from a tree

       pdprune
              prunes the tree to maximize PD

       prep_db
              makes SQL enabling taxonomic querying of placement results

              reclassifies nonconvex sequences in a reference package

       ref_tree
              writes a taxonomically annotated reference tree and an induced taxonomic tree

       reroot reroots a given reference package in place
