NAME
       gdlgsdoc - produce .gsdoc files from .eomodel files

SYNOPSIS
       gdlgsdoc [--verbose=level] [--project=|--projectName=name] [--documentationDirectory=dir] [--define-variable=value] --template=filename FILES...

DESCRIPTION
       gdlgsdoc  generates .gsdoc files from input .eomodel files.  The number of the generated files corresponds to the number of the input files.  This tool does not generate HTML, use autogsdoc(1) for
       that.

OPTIONS
       --verbose=level
              Sets the verbosity level for debugging messages.  The default is 0 (no additional messages); 1 sets standard debugging output while 3 sets maximum verbosity.  2 has the same  effect  as  1,
              any number above 3 has the effect of 3.

       --project=name
              Sets the project name.

       --projectName=name
              This is an alias for --project.

       --documentationDirectory=dir
              Sets the directory for saving the .gsdoc file(s) relative to the directory of the input .eomodel file(s).  The default is the same directory.

       --define-variable=value
              Defines a user variable to a specific value.  This option can be used multiple times.  Variable placeholders are set in the template file and are substituted with the corresponding value at
              generation time.  If verbosity level is set to 3, the variable(s)/value(s) are printed to the standard output.

       --template=filename
              Uses filename as template for the generated .gsdoc file(s).  Note that this is a mandatory option, failing to specify it means that no .gsdoc file will be created.
