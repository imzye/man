NAME

SYNOPSIS
       f-irc [configurationfile.conf]

       options: configurationfile.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  f-irc  Is  an  irc client for a terminal/command-line/console. Its goal is to be as user friendly as possible with easy navigation and keyboard
       shortcuts for quick navigation. The learning curve should be as shallow as possible.

COLORS
       Available colors: black, blue, cyan, default, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.

DICTIONARY
       F-irc can, apart from channel/nick/command also do tab-completion on a configurable list of words. With "dictionary_file=..." you can select a text-file with
       2 or more columns. In the first column you put the word that f-irc needs to look for when pressing tab. Then when there's a match, that word will be replaced
       by what's in the 2nd (and 3d, etc.) column.

USAGE
       When F-IRC is started, you'll see a list of channels and servers on the right. On the left a large box with what is written by people. The line at the top is
       the topic of that channel and the line at the bottom is where you write the things you would like to appear in the channels.

       If there's a reverse color border around the channel-list, then it is selected. That means that you can navigate through it with the cursor keys. Press right
       to enter a channel. Press right again on that channel to get a list of names in that channel. Press right once again to get a list of actions to  perform  on
       that  user.  Press  left  to  exit the actions menu. Another left to return to the channel-list. Use up cursor/down cursor keys to navigate through the list.
       'home' jumps to the top of the list, 'end' to the bottom.

       Press left on a server to "fold it": this hides the channels. Press the right cursor key to unfold it. When a server is not folded  and  it  is  already  se‐
       lected, press "right" again to get a menu with server-options: reconnect a server for example and disconnect it.

       In the "scroll back"/"search" windows you can press '/' to search in that window and 'w' to write the contents of a window to a file.

       ^X     means: press ctrl key and press x while still holding ctrl.

       If the channel/name-list is selected, you can enter ^N: you can then move the cursor from right to left and back to navigate through the sentence you're typ‐
       ing. If the edit-line is selected, then the border around the names/channels is no longer reverse, also the '>' left from- and the '>' right  from  the  edit
       line are in reverse video.

       If  the  edit-line is selected, you can press up cursor key and down left cursor key to browse through older lines you wrote. Also "home" and "end" work like
       they should.

       ^A     moves the cursor to the left, ^E moves the cursor to the right ^D deletes the character under the cursor. This is like how the bash-shell behaves.

       ^U     Clear input line. Press second time to undo clear.

       If there's something new in a channel, a '*' is put in front of the server or channel name.

       ^Q     jump to your next favorite channel (see the "favorite=... ..." configuration file parameter).

       ^W     lets you jump to the next channel in which new lines were written.

       ^R     like ^W but searching backwards

       ^Z     lets you jump to the next channel in which your (nick-)name was mentioned

       ^X     like ^Z but searching backwards

       ^T     jump back to the previously selected channel

       ^O     lets f-irc remove all the *'s

       ^F     lets you scroll-back in what was written by others

       ^B     lets you scroll-back in what you wrote. you can then select a line and press enter to copy it to your edit-line

       ^Y     Enable/disable "only show channels with new messages".

       ^V     Enter 1 character. Used when entering ascii values < 32, e.g. ^B for bold.

       Press  TAB for auto-completion of commands (e.g. /TOPIC, /TIME, etc.) and nick names

       Press  ^G to close a channel.

       Press  ^L to redraw the screen.

       Press  ^C to terminate the program. Or enter /EXIT (or /exit, commands are not case sensitive).

       When you enter:
              @/...  then /... is send
              @@...  then @... is send
              @...  then the program will look for a channel/server with '...' in its name and then change the channel to that one. you can enter ^J to let it  jump
              to the next channel with that

       ^P     add a markerline to the current channel

       F2     Store current configuration on disk

       F3     Add a new server

       F4     Switch to edit-line (shortcut for ^N)

       F5     Redraw screen

       F6     Search in all windows

       F7     Close all channels with only "NOTICE" messages. Those are most oftehn the channels with messages that come from bots and servers.

       F8     Configure f-irc

       F9     Undo the close of the last closed channel

       F10 ^N Toggle between channel-list, edit-line and word-cloud (if enabled)

       F12    Add markerline to all channels on all servers
