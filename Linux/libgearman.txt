NAME
       libgearman - Gearmand Documentation, http://gearman.info/

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libgearman/gearman.h>

       Link -lgearman

DESCRIPTION
       libgearman  is a small, thread-safe client library for the gearman protocol. The code has all been written with an eye to allow for both web and embedded usage. It handles the work behind routing par‐
       ticular keys to specific servers that you specify (and values are matched based on server order as supplied by you). It implements both the client and worker interfaces.

       All operations are performed against either a client, ie gearman_client_st or worker, ie gearman_worker_st.

       Client and Worker structures can either be dynamically allocated or statically allocated. They must then b initialized by gearman_client_create() or gearman_worker_create().

       Functions have been written in order to encapsulate all structures in the library. It is recommended that you do not operate directly against the structure.

       Nearly all functions return a gearman_return_t value.  This value can be translated to a printable string with gearman_strerror().

       gearman_client_st and gearman_worker_st structures are thread-safe, but each thread must contain its own structure (that is, if you want to share these among threads you must provide  your  own  lock‐
       ing). No global variables are used in this library.

       If you are working with GNU autotools you will want to add the following to your configure.ac to properly include libgearman in your application.

       PKG_CHECK_MODULES(DEPS, libgearman >= 0.8.0) AC_SUBST(DEPS_CFLAGS) AC_SUBST(DEPS_LIBS)

       Hope you enjoy it!

CONSTANTS
       A number of constants have been provided for in the library.

       GEARMAN_DEFAULT_TCP_PORT

       The default port used by gearmand(3).

       GEARMAN_DEFAULT_TCP_PORT

       The default service used by gearmand(3).

       LIBGEARMAN_VERSION_STRING

       String value of the libgearman version such as "0.20.4"

       LIBGEARMAN_VERSION_HEX

       Hex value of the version number. "0x00048000" This can be used for comparing versions based on number.

       GEARMAN_UNIQUE_SIZE

       Largest number of characters that can be used for a unique value.

       GEARMAN_JOB_HANDLE_SIZE

       Largest number of characters that can will be used for a job handle. Please see gearman_job_handle_t for additional information.

THREADS AND PROCESSES
       When  using  threads or forked processes it is important to keep an instance of gearman_client_st or gearman_worker_st  per process or thread.  Without creating your own locking structures you can not
       share a single gearman_client_st or gearman_worker_st.
