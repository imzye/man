NAME
     xml2ssf — XML to BioWare SSF converter

SYNOPSIS
     xml2ssf [options] [input_file] output_file

DESCRIPTION
     xml2ssf converts XML files created by the ssf2xml(1) tool back into the BioWare SSF format.  For a more in-depth description of SSF files, please see the man page for the ssf2xml(1) tool.

     The format of the input XML is pretty simple and straight-forward.

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
     <ssf>
       <sound id="0" label="Attack" strref="66299">vs_fkillerf_attk</sound>
       <sound id="1" label="BattleCry1">vs_fkillerf_bat1</sound>
       <sound id="2" label="BattleCry2" strref="66301"></sound>
       <sound id="3" label="BattleCry3"></sound>
     </ssf>

     The root element is “ssf”, with multiple “sound” elements as children.  Each “sound” element requires an “id” property, specifying the index of the sound within the SSF file.  Optionally, there can be a
     “strref” property, which denotes the string reference (StrRef) of the text line associated with the sound.  The contents of the “sound” element is the filename (ResRef) of the sound file to play.

     Because different BioWare games use slightly different versions of the SSF file format, the game for which to create the SSF file has to be specifying on the command line.  Please note that the file
     versions have different requirements on the input data as well. These requirements are noted below.

OPTIONS
     -h
     --help
           Show a help text and exit.
     --version
           Show version information and exit.
     --nwn
           Create an SSF file fit for use within the game Neverwinter Nights.  Sound filenames have to be 16 characters long or less.
     --nwn2
           Create an SSF file fit for use within the game Neverwinter Nights 2.  Sound filenames have to be 32 characters long or less.
     --kotor
           Create an SSF file fit for use within the game Knights of the Old Republic.  No sound filenames are allowed, only StrRefs.
     --kotor2
           Create an SSF file fit for use within the game Knights of the Old Republic II.  No sound filenames are allowed, only StrRefs.
     input_file
           The XML file to convert.  If no input file is specified, the XML data is read from stdin.  The encoding of the XML stream must always be UTF-8.
     output_file
           The SSF file will be written there.

EXAMPLES
     Convert file1.xml into an SSF for Neverwinter Nights:

           $ xml2ssf --nwn file1.xml file2.ssf

     Convert file1.xml into an SSF for Knights of the Old Republic:

           $ xml2ssf --kotor file1.xml file2.ssf
