NAME
       frozen-bubble-editor - a level editor for Frozen Bubble

SYNOPSIS
           frozen-bubble-editor [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       This editor lets you manipulate level-sets, in which you can add,
       remove and modify levels thanks to a mouse-oriented interface (there
       are also many interesting keyboard shortcuts). The interface is very
       straightforward: click on the written planches on the left an right
       parts of the screen to perform the relevant actions, and on the level
       area to change the bubble color; use the "void" bubble (or right-click)
       to remove a bubble.

       -ls FILENAME, --levelset FILENAME
           directly start with the specified levelset name

       -l NUMB, --level NUMB
