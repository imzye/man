NAME
       qselect - select pbs batch jobs

SYNOPSIS
       qselect [-a [op]date_time] [-A account_string] [-e] [-c [op]interval] [-h hold_list] [-l resource_list] [-N name] [-p [op]priority] [-q destination] [-r rerun] [-s states] [-u user_list]

DESCRIPTION
       The qselect command provides a method to list the job identifier of those jobs which meet a list of selection criteria.  Jobs are selected from those owned by a single server.

       When qselect successfully completes, it will have written to standard output a list of zero or more jobs which meet the criteria specified by the options.  Each option acts as a filter restricting the
       number of jobs which might be listed.  With no options, the qselect command will list all jobs at the server which the user is authorized to list (query status of).  The -u option may be used to limit
       the selection to jobs owned by this user or other specified users.

OPTIONS
       When  an  option is specified with a optional op component to the option argument, then op specifies a relation between the value of a certain job attribute and the value component of the option argu‐
       ment.  If an op is allowable on an option, then the description of the option letter will indicate the op is allowable.  The only acceptable strings for the op component, and the relation  the  string
       indicates, are shown in the following list:

            .eq.  the value represented by the attribute of the job is equal to the value represented by the option argument.

            .ne.  the value represented by the attribute of the job is not equal to the value represented by the option argument.

            .ge.  the value represented by the attribute of the job is greater than or equal to the value represented by the option argument.

            .gt.  the value represented by the attribute of the job is greater than the value represented by the option argument.

            .le.  the value represented by the attribute of the job is less than or equal to the value represented by the option argument.

            .lt.  the value represented by the attribute of the job is less than the value represented by the option argument.

       -a [op]date_time
                 Restricts selection to a specific time, or a range of times.

                 The  qselect command selects only jobs for which the value of the Execution_Time attribute is related to the date_time argument by the optional op operator.  The date_time argument is in the
                 form of the date_time operand of the touch(1) command: [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
                 where the MM is the two digits for the month, DD is the day of the month, hh is the hour, mm is the minute, and the optional SS is the seconds.  CC is the century and YY the year.

                 If op is not specified, jobs will be selected for which the Execution_Time and date_time values are equal.  If op is specified, jobs will be selected according to the following definitions:

                 .eq.   Execution_Time attribute is equal to the date_time argument.

                 .ne.   Execution_Time attribute is not equal to the date_time argument.

                 .ge.   execution_Time attribute is greater than (after) or equal to the date_time argument.

                 .gt.   Execution_Time attribute is greater than (after) the date_time argument.

                 .le.   Execution_Time attribute is less than (before) or equal to the date_time argument.

                 .lt.   Execution_Time attribute is less than (before) the date_time argument.

       -e        Restricts selection to jobs in execution queues.

       -A account_string
                 Restricts selection to jobs whose Account_Name attribute matches the specified account_string.

       -c [op]interval
                 Restricts selection to jobs whose Checkpoint interval attribute matches the specified relationship.

                 The values of the Checkpoint attribute are defined to have the following ordered relationship:
                     n >  s > c=minutes > c > u
                 If the optional op is not specified, jobs will be selected whose Checkpoint attribute is equal to the interval argument.  If op is specified, jobs will be selected according to:

                 .eq.   Checkpoint attribute of the job is equal to the interval argument.

                 .ne.   Checkpoint attribute of the job is not equal to the interval argument.

                 .ge.   Checkpoint attribute of the job is greater than or equal to the interval argument.

                 .gt.   Checkpoint attribute of the job is greater than the interval argument.

                 .le.   Checkpoint attribute of the job is less than or equal to the interval argument.

                 .lt.   Checkpoint attribute of the job is less than the interval argument.

                 For an interval value of "u", only ".eq." and ".ne." are valid.

       -h hold_list
                 Restricts the selection of jobs to those with a specific set of hold types.  Only those jobs will be selected whose Hold_Types attribute exactly match the value of the hold_list argument.

                 The hold_list argument is a string consisting of one or more occurrences the single letter n, or one or more of the letters u, o, or s in any combination.  If letters  are  duplicated,  they
                 are treated as if they occurred once.  The letters represent the hold types:
                   n - none
                   u - user
                   o - other
                   s - system

       -l resource_list
                 Restricts selection of jobs to those with specified resource amounts.

                 Only  those jobs will be selected whose Resource_List attribute matches the specified relation with each resource and value listed in the resource_list argument.  The resource_list is in the
                 following format:
                 resource_nameopvalue[,resource_nameopval,...]
                 The relation operator op must be present.

                 When comparing the values of resources, the following definitions for the operator apply:

                 .eq.   the resource value in the Resource_List attribute of the job equals the value specified in resource_list.

                 .ne.   the resource value in the Resource_List attribute of the job is not equal to the value specified in resource_list.

                 .ge.   the resource value in the Resource_List attribute of the job is greater than or equal to the value specified in resource_list.

                 .gt.   the resource value in the Resource_List attribute of the job is greater than the value specified in resource_list.

                 .le.   the resource value in the Resource_List attribute of the job is less than or equal to the value specified in resource_list.

                 .lt.   the resource value in the Resource_List attribute of the job is less than the value specified in resource_list.

       -N name   Restricts selection of jobs to those with a specific name.

       -p [op]priority
                 Restricts selection of jobs to those with a priority that matches the specified relationship.  If op is not specified, jobs are selected for which the job Priority attribute is equal to  the
                 priority

                 If the op is specified, the relationship is defined as:

                 .eq.   Priority attribute is equal to the value of the priority argument.

                 .ne.   Priority attribute is not equal to the value of the priority argument.

                 .ge.   Priority attribute is greater than or equal to the value of the priority argument.

                 .gt.   Priority attribute is greater than the value of the priority argument.

                 .le.   Priority attribute is less than or equal to the value of the priority argument.

                 .lt.   Priority attribute is less than the value of the priority argument.

       -q destination
                 Restricts selection to those jobs residing at the specified destination.

                 The destination may be of one of the following three forms:
                     queue
                     @server
                     queue@server

                 If the -q option is not specified, jobs will be selected from the default server.

                 If the destination describes only a queue, only jobs in that queue on the default batch server will be selected.

                 If the destination describes only a server, then jobs in all queues on that server will be selected.

                 If the destination describes both a queue and a server, then only jobs in the named queue on the named server will be selected.

       -r rerun  Restricts selection of jobs to those with the specified Rerunable attribute.  The option argument must be a single character.  The following two characters are supported by PBS: y and n.

       -s states Restricts job selection to those in the specified states.

                 The states argument is a character string which consists of any combination of the characters: E, H, Q, R, T, and W.

                 The characters in the states argument have the following interpretation:

                 E    the Exiting state.

                 H    the Held state.

                 Q    the Queued state.

                 R    the Running state.

                 T    the Transiting state.

                 W    the Waiting state.

                 Jobs will be selected which are in any of the specified states.

       -u user_list
                 Restricts selection to jobs owned by the specified user names.

                 This provides a means of limiting the selection to jobs owned by one or more users.

                 The syntax of the user_list is:
                     user_name[@host][,user_name[@host],...]
                 Host  names may be wild carded on the left end, e.g. "*.nasa.gov".  User_name without a "@host" is equivalent to "user_name@*", that is at any host.  Jobs will be selected which are owned by
                 the listed users at the corresponding hosts.

STANDARD OUTPUT
       The list of job identifiers of selected jobs is written to standard output.  Each job identifier is separated by white space.  Each job identifier is of the form:
           sequence_number.server_name@server
       Where sequence_number.server is the identifier assigned at submission time, see qsub.  @server identifies the server which currently owns the job.

STANDARD ERROR
       The qselect command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all options presented to the qselect command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qselect command fails to process any option, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
