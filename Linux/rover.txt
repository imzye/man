NAME

SYNOPSYS
       rover [-h] [-e|--expression EXPRESSION] [-v|--version]

DESCRIPTION
       Rover is a text-based light-weight frontend for update-alternatives, which is inspired by the ranger file browser. Compared to existing graphical frontends such as galternatives and kalternatives,
       Rover still has the following advantages:

       1.  User doesn't need to move hand off the keyboard.

       2.  Zero GUI overhead, and not bound to graphical environment.

       3.  Supports searching by substring or Python regex.
