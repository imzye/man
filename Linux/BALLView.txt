NAME
       BALLView - A free molecular modeling and molecular graphics tool

SYNOPSIS
       BALLView [Molecular-file]

DESCRIPTION
       BALLView BALLView provides fast OpenGL-based visualization of molecular structures, molecular mechanics methods (minimization, MD simulation using the AMBER and CHARMM force fields), calcula‐
       tion and visualization of electrostatic properties (FDPB).

       BALLView  is  based  on  BALL  (Biochemical Algorithms Library) , which is currently being developed in the groups of Oliver Kohlbacher (University of Tuebingen, Germany), Andreas Hildebrandt
       (Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany), and Hans-Peter Lenhof (Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany). BALL is an application framework in C++ that has been  specifically  designed
       for rapid software development in Molecular Modeling and Computational Molecular Biology.  It provides an extensive set of data structures as well as classes for Molecular Mechanics, advanced
       solvation methods, comparison and analysis of protein structures, file import/export, and visualization.

       BALLView is available under the LGPL licence.

USAGE
       To run BALLView, simply type:

              BALLView

              or

              BALLView file.pdp

       where file.pdb is your PDB file. BALLView also supports HIN, MOL, MOL2 and SD files.

       BALLView provides HTML documentation, that is available in the application itself (see Help menu).

       This package also includes Python example scripts, that can be run in BALLView.  They can be found under /usr/share/BALL/PYTHON.
