NAME
       FascistCheck - a pro-active password checker library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <crack.h>

       static char const CRACKLIB_DICTPATH[] =  ...;

       extern char const *
       FascistCheck(char const passwd[], char const dictpath[]);

DESCRIPTION
       cracklib  is  a library containing the FascistCheck C function which may be used in a "passwd" like program.  The idea is simple: try to prevent users from choosing passwords that could be guessed
       by "crack" by filtering them out, at source.  cracklib is an offshoot of the the version 5 of the "crack" software and contains a considerable number of ideas nicked from the new software.

       The first formal argument password is the potential password.  The second formal argument dictpath is the full path name + filename prefix of the cracklib dictionary  database.   FascistCheck  re‐
       turns the NULL pointer for a good password, or a pointer to a diagnostic string if it is a weak password.

       The  database  is  in  a  binary  format generated by the utilities crack_mkdict(8) and crack_packer(8).  On a Debian system the database is located in the directory defined by the static constant
       CRACKLIB_DICTPATH and is set to /var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict.  None of the subroutines in the cracklib libraries have this location hard-coded into their  implementations.   It  is  generated
       daily with the program /etc/cron.daily/cracklib.

FILES
       /var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict.[hwm|pwd|pwi]
