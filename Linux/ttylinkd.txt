TTYLINKD(8)              Linux System Managers Manual              TTYLINKD(8)

NAME
       ttylinkd - TTYlink daemon for AX.25, NET/ROM, ROSE and IP.

SYNOPSIS
       ttylinkd [-hv] [-c callsign] [-f file]

DESCRIPTION
       ttylinkd  is  a  simple daemon that allows incoming ttylink calls to be
       routed through to Linux's normal talkd(8) system and  provides  a  pipe
       between the two.

       ttylinkd  is  usually setup to be spawned from ax25d(8) or inetd(8) but
       can, since version 0.03, be used on the command line, although  talk(1)
       is a much better idea for interactive users.

       Use splitscreen(1) for outgoing ttylink sessions.

OPTIONS
       -v        Display the version.

       -h        Display some help and information on it.

       -c callsign
                 Disable  callsign  checking  and use the given callsign for a
                 name for this end of the link.

       -f file   Use <file> for the configuration file, instead of the default
                 /etc/ax25/ttylinkd.conf

FILES
       /etc/ax25/ttylinkd.conf  the configuration file for ttylinkd

SEE ALSO
       talk(1),    splitscreen(1),   ttylinkd.conf(5),   ax25d(8),   inetd(8),
       talkd(8).

BUGS
       There is still some need for some checking of who is still logged on.

       The daemon may hang if you disconnect from it strangely.

       There is no real way of working out what is going on with talkd.

       If you do not have a talk daemon going on the specified host  then  the
       program will tend to sit there and do nothing.
