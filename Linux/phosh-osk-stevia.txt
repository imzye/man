NAME
       phosh-osk-stevia - An on screen keyboard for Phosh

SYNOPSIS
       phosh-osk-stevia [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       phosh-osk-stevia is an on screen keyboard (OSK) for phosh. It can replace Phosh's default keyboard squeekboard(1).

       phosh-osk-stevia  has two modes of operation. If the application supports and uses text-input-unstable-v3 the Wayland compositor will use the input-method-unstable-v2 protocol to interact with the
       OSK. This allows it to

       • automatically unfold the keyboard

       • handle text prediction / correction via preedit and surrounding text

       • automatically switch to special layouts like to terminal by input hints sent from the application

       This is the preferred mode of operation. For legacy applications like e.g. Electron applications the OSK falls back to a virtual keyboard mode (basically emulating key presses). This means that it
       e.g. can't unfold automatically or support completion. It will hence hide the completion bar in that mode of operation.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print help and exit

       --replace
              Try to grab the sm.puri.OSK0 DBus interface, even if it is already in use by another keyboard.

       --allow-replacement
              (Temporarily) Give up the sm.puri.OSK0 DBus name if another OSK requests it. This also unregisters the Wayland input-method-v1 so another OSK can act as input method.  If the  name  becomes
              available again it is grabbed again and phosh-osk-stevia registers itself as input method again.

       -v, --version

SETUP
       In order to be used by Phosh as OSK, phosh-osk-stevia needs to be started from the /usr/share/applications/sm.puri.OSK0.desktop desktop file. On Debian systems this can be achieved by running

          update-alternatives --config Phosh-OSK

       as root and selecting the entry ending in sm.puri.Phosh.Stevia.desktop.

CONFIGURATION
       phosh-osk-stevia  is  configured  via GSettings. This includes configuration of the loaded layouts from org.gnome.desktop.input-sources via the sources and xkb-options keys, whether the OSK is en‐
       abled at all via the org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications's screen-keyboard-enabled and configuration of word completion (see below).

       For the keyboard to fold and unfold automatically make sure org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-im-module is set to the empty string ('').  This is the default in most distributions. If  unsure  check
       via:

          gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-im-module

   WORD COMPLETION
       phosh-osk-stevia has support for word completion and correction via various completers (see below). It has several modes of operation represented by flags that can be combined:

       • off: no word completion

       • manual: enable and disable completion via an option in the language popover

       • hint: enables and disables completion based on the text input's completion hint.

       Valid settings are off, manual, hint and manual+hint. These can be enabled configured via the gsettings command:

          # off
          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk completion-mode "[]"
          # manual
          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk completion-mode "['manual']"
          # hint
          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk completion-mode "['hint']"
          # manual+hint
          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk completion-mode "['manual','hint']"
          # Reset to default (off)
          gsettings reset sm.puri.phosh.osk completion-mode

       Note that completion is always disabled when

       • No usable completers are found on startup

       • Terminal or emoji layout is in use

       • The application doesn't support text-input so phosh-osk-stevia is falling back virtual-keyboard mode.

   AVAILABLE COMPLETERS
       The available completers depend on how phosh-osk-stevia was built. Available are currently at most

          • hunspell: word correction based on the hunspell library

          • presage: (experimental) word prediction based on the presage library

          • pipe: completer using a pipe

          • fzf: completer based on fzf command line tool. Useful for experiments)

          • varnam: completer using govarnam for Indic languages

       The default word completer is selected via the sm.puri.phosh.osk.Completers default GSetting.

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk.Completers default hunspell

       You need to restart phosh-osk-stevia for the new default completer to become active.

   TEXT CORRECTION USING HUNSPELL
       The  hunspell completer needs dictionaries and affix files in /usr/share/hunspell`. Most importantly ``/usr/share/hunspell/en_US.dic and /usr/share/hunspell/en_US.aff are required as fallback when
       no matching dictionary for the current layout is found.

   TEXT COMPLETION USING PRESAGE
       The presage based completer is considered experimental as there are some known issues when interacting with GTK4 applications.

       For the presage based completer to work you need a model file in /usr/share/phosh/osk/presage/. Likely your distribution already ships one with the presage  library.  You  can  simply  symlink  it
       there.  Models for more languages can be found in
        <https://gitlab.gnome.org/guidog/phosh-osk-data>

   TEXT COMPLETION USING PIPE
       This  completer  feeds  the  current  input word (preedit) to an executable file and expects the executable to output possible completions on stdout. The executable to invoke is configured via the
       sm.puri.phosh.osk.Completers.Pipe command GSetting. It defaults to cat. This can be used to experiment with different completion patterns without having to modify phosh-osk-stevia itself.

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk.Completers.Pipe command 'wc -c'

       You need to restart phosh-osk-stevia for the new command to become active. A commonly used executable is swipeGuess:  <https://git.sr.ht/~earboxer/swipeGuess>

   TEXT COMPLETION USING VARNAM
       This completer feeds the current input word (preedit) to govarnam for easy input of Indic languages.

       For the completer to work it needs govarnam and the language schema files installed. Please refer to the govarnam documentation.

       Note that while you can enable govarnam as default completer this is not recommended. Instead enable it for a specific language via the sources gsettings:

          gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources "[('xkb', 'us'), ('ibus', 'varnam:ml'), ('ibus', 'varnam:ta')]"

       The above would only enable govranam for Malayalam and Tamil while the English US layout would still use the default completer.

   ADDITIONAL COMPLETION SOURCES
       Completers can amend their results with matches from additional sources, the following ones currently exist:

          • emoji: Add emojis

          • keyword: Complete special keywords (e.g. today)

       They can be enabled via the sm.puri.phosh.osk sources gsetting.

   TERMINAL SHORTCUTS
       phosh-osk-stevia can provide a row of keyboard shortcuts on the terminal layout. These are configured via the shortcuts GSetting

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk.Terminal shortcuts "['<ctrl>a', '<ctrl>e', '<ctrl>r']"

       For valid values see documentation of gtk_accelerator_parse():  <https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/func.accelerator_parse.html> One can also add plain <ctrl> and <alt> keys. These then act as latched keys
       until the next regular key is pressed.

   IGNORING ACTIVATION
       For some applications you might not want to unfold the OSK when the application requests it. This can e.g. be useful when you usually read what the application displays (and hence want to  use  as
       much as screen space as possible) but the application focuses a text entry. By adding the application's app-id to the ignore-activation list you can prevent the automatic unfold. The OSK can still
       be unfolded by other means (e.g. via the DBus API or the OSK button in Phosh). To determine an applications app-id you can use the foreign-toplevel command.

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk ignore-activation "['org.gnome.Calculator']"

   HARDWARE KEYBOARDS
       By default the on screen keyboard will not show if it detects a connected hardware keyboard. To make it show nevertheless use

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk ignore-hw-keyboards false

   ADDITIONAL FEATURES
       The osk-features setting is a flag type setting enabling features that apply to all character layouts.

       • key-drag: By default moving the finger while pressing a character will cancel the gesture and not input it. This can be changed by enabling key-drag:

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk osk-features "['key-drag']"

       • key-indicator: Setting this flag enables an additional popover indicating the currently pressed key:

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk osk-features "['key-indicator']"

       Note that all of the above use the same gsetting key as it is a flag type. If you want to set multiple options separate them with a comma (,):

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk osk-features "['key-drag', 'key-indicator']"

   KEYBOARD SCALING
       While  most of the mobile user interfaces features should respect the current output resolution on screen keyboards are the exception from the rule as the size of the users fingers doesn't change.
       We hence want to allow the keyboard's keys to keep the same physical height on resolution changes. Furthermore on taller devices it can be useful to shift the keyboard a bit upwards.  The  scaling
       setting handles this:

       • auto-portrait: Automatically adjust the keyboard height in portrait mode based on the resolution.

       • bottom-dead-zone: Add an empty area at the bottom of the keyboard when enough vertical space is available.

       To enable both of these features you can uses:

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk scaling "['auto-portrait', 'bottom-dead-zone']"

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       phosh-osk-stevia honors the following environment variables for debugging purposes:

       • POS_DEBUG: A comma separated list of flags:

         • force-show: Ignore the screen-keyboard-enabled GSetting and always enable the OSK. This GSetting is usually managed by the user and Phosh.

         • force-completion: Force text completion to ignoring the completion-mode GSetting.

       • POS_TEST_LAYOUT: Load the given layout instead of the ones configured via GSetting.

       • POS_TEST_COMPLETER: Use the given completer instead of the configured ones.  The available values depend on how phosh-osk-stevia was built (see above).

       • G_MESSAGES_DEBUG, G_DEBUG and other environment variables supported by glib.  <https://docs.gtk.org/glib/running.html>

       • GTK_DEBUG and other environment variables supported by GTK, see
          <https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/running.html>

EXAMPLES
       Use swipeGuess for swipe input:

          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk.Completers default pipe
          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk.Completers.Pipe command "swipeGuess /usr/local/share/swipeGuess/words/words-qwerty-en"
          gsettings set sm.puri.phosh.osk osk-features "['key-drag']"
