NAME
       LogolMultiExec  -  Program  to parse a logol grammar and search pattern in a sequence, it allows one to run the LogolExec program on multi fasta input and to
       dispatch the treatements
        on a DRMAA compliant grid or on multi-cpu servers.

SYNOPSIS
       LogolMultiExec [-h]

INSTALLATION
        LogolMultiExec needs the drmaa library. Default is to use SGE library. If another is used,
        one should update the symbolic link in  /usr/share/logol/lib/drmaa.jar to the correct library.
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH must also updated in /sur/share/logol/LogolMultiExec.sh

CONFIGURATION
        LogolMultiExec and LogolExec share the same configuration file. See LogolExec man page for more info.
        .PP

OPTIONS

       -fasta
               Add fasta conversion of the matches to the result archive

       -contig
               Set the input bank as contig sequences

       -guid
               Unique identifier for the query

       -email
               Email address to sent result availability info
               (needs mail setup)

       -local
               Use local mode (multi core)

       -sge
               Use SGE mode

       -forcesplit
               Force the sequence splitting according to parameters and whatever is the number of model used in grammar

               Do not delete created files after treatment (for debug)

       -enabledups
               enable duplicate result matches. By default only keep singletons

       -filter
               Type of filter when enabledups is not enabled. Allowed types are exact(default),local,local0,global.

       -lmin
               minimum length of a variable (to speedup parsing)
