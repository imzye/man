NAME
       nbdkit-cc-plugin - write small nbdkit plugins in inline C (and other languages)

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit cc /path/to/plugin.c [CC=<CC>] [CFLAGS=<CFLAGS>]
                                    [EXTRA_CFLAGS=<EXTRA_CFLAGS>]
        nbdkit cc - <<'EOF'
        ... C code ...
        EOF

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin allows you to write small nbdkit(1) plugins in C (and some other languages).  When you use this plugin it compiles your source code to a temporary plugin and then jumps into your compiled
       plugin.  It is somewhat similar to nbdkit-sh-plugin(3), except for C source code.  This can also be used to write plugins which are "C scripts".

       Note this is not the way you normally write nbdkit plugins in C.  To understand how to write plugins in C normally, read nbdkit-plugin(3).

   Simple plugin example
       Simple plugins from the nbdkit source tree can be compiled and run directly using commands such as:

        $ nbdkit cc plugins/example1/example1.c EXTRA_CFLAGS="-I. -Iinclude"

       You can also read the source from stdin using "-":

        $ nbdkit cc - EXTRA_CFLAGS="-I. -Iinclude" \
                    < plugins/example1/example1.c

       To replace the compiler flags:

        $ nbdkit cc plugins/example1/example1.c \
                    CFLAGS="-O3 -mavx2 -fPIC -shared"

   Compiler name and flags
       The plugin parameters "CC", "CFLAGS" and "EXTRA_CFLAGS" (written in uppercase) can be used to control which C compiler and C compiler flags are used.  If not set, the default compiler and flags from
       when nbdkit was itself compiled from source are used.  To see what those were you can do:

        $ nbdkit cc --dump-plugin
        ...
        CC=gcc
        CFLAGS=-g -O2 -fPIC -shared

       The "CFLAGS" parameter overrides the built-in flags completely.  The "EXTRA_CFLAGS" parameter adds extra flags to the built-in flags.

   Plugin API version
       Plugins compiled this way must use the same API version as the cc plugin itself uses.  Currently this is "NBDKIT_API_VERSION=2".

   C plugin as a self-contained script
       You can create a C plugin which is a self-contained script by adding the following lines at the top and ensuring the C source is executable ("chmod +x plugin.c"):

        #if 0
        exec nbdkit cc "$0" "$@"
        #endif

       The script can be run as a command with additional nbdkit flags and plugin parameters, eg:

        ./plugin.c -f -v
        ./plugin.c -p 10000 --filter=cow
        ./plugin.c param=1

   Using this plugin with other programming languages
       This plugin can be used with most ahead-of-time compiled programming languages if they can create shared objects (.so files).  The only requirement is that the compiler ("CC") supports an -o option to
       write a shared object.  Some examples follow.

       Using this plugin with C++

        nbdkit cc CC=g++ source.cpp

       Using this plugin with OCaml

        nbdkit cc CC=ocamlopt \
                  CFLAGS="-output-obj -runtime-variant _pic NBDKit.cmx -cclib -lnbdkitocaml" \
                  source.ml

       See nbdkit-ocaml-plugin(3).

PARAMETERS
       The script name, or "-", must appear as the first parameter.

       CC=CC
       CFLAGS="CFLAGS"
       EXTRA_CFLAGS="EXTRA_CFLAGS"
           Override the compiler and flags.  See "Compiler name and flags" above.

       All other parameters on the command line are passed to the plugin.

        my_get_size (void *handle)

                  uint32_t flags)
        {
          memcpy (buf, data+offset, count);
          return 0;
        }

        static int
        my_pwrite (void *handle, const void *buf,
                   uint32_t count, uint64_t offset,
                   uint32_t flags)
        {
          memcpy (data+offset, buf, count);
          return 0;
        }

        static struct nbdkit_plugin plugin = {
          .name              = "myplugin",
          .open              = my_open,
          .get_size          = my_get_size,
          .pread             = my_pread,
          .pwrite            = my_pwrite,
        };

        EOF
