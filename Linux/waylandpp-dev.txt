Detailed Description
       buffer release explicit synchronization

       This object is instantiated in response to a zwp_linux_surface_synchronization_v1.get_release request.

       It provides an alternative to wl_buffer.release events, providing a unique release from a single wl_surface.commit request. The release event also supports explicit synchronization, providing a
       fence FD for the client to synchronize against.

       Exactly one event, either a fenced_release or an immediate_release, will be emitted for the wl_surface.commit request. The compositor can choose release by release which event it uses.

       This event does not replace wl_buffer.release events; servers are still required to send those events.

       Once a buffer release object has delivered a 'fenced_release' or an 'immediate_release' event it is automatically destroyed.

Member Enumeration Documentation
   enum class wayland::proxy_t::wrapper_type [strong],  [inherited]
       Underlying wl_proxy type and properties of a proxy_t that affect construction, destruction, and event handling

       Enumerator

       standard
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*. Events are dispatched and it is destructed when the proxy_t is destructed. User data is set.

       display
              C pointer is a wl_display*. No events are dispatched, wl_display_disconnect is called when the proxy_t is destructed. User data is set.

       foreign
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*, but another library owns it and it should not be touched in a way that could affect the operation of the other library. No events are
              dispatched,  wl_proxy_destroy is not called when the proxy_t is destructed, user data is not touched. Consequently, there is no reference counting for the proxy_t. Lifetime of such wrappers
              should preferably be short to minimize the chance that the owning library decides to destroy the wl_proxy.

       proxy_wrapper
              C pointer is a wl_proxy* that was constructed with wl_proxy_create_wrapper. No events are dispatched, wl_proxy_wrapper_destroy is called when the proxy_t is destroyed. Reference counting is
              active. A reference to the proxy_t creating this proxy wrapper is held to extend its lifetime until after the proxy wrapper is destroyed.

Member Function Documentation
   wl_proxy * wayland::proxy_t::c_ptr () const [inherited]
       Get a pointer to the underlying C struct.

       Returns
           The underlying wl_proxy wrapped by this proxy_t if it exists, otherwise an exception is thrown

   std::string wayland::proxy_t::get_class () const [inherited]
       Get the interface name (class) of a proxy object.

       Returns
           The interface name of the object associated with the proxy

   uint32_t wayland::proxy_t::get_id () const [inherited]
       Get the id of a proxy object.

       Returns
           The id the object associated with the proxy

   uint32_t wayland::proxy_t::get_version () const [inherited]
       Get the protocol object version of a proxy object. Gets the protocol object version of a proxy object, or 0 if the proxy was created with unversioned API.

       A returned value of 0 means that no version information is available, so the caller must make safe assumptions about the object's real version.

       display_t will always return version 0.

       Returns
           The protocol object version of the proxy or 0

   wrapper_type wayland::proxy_t::get_wrapper_type () const [inline],  [inherited]
       Get the type of a proxy object.

   std::function< void(int)> & zwp_linux_buffer_release_v1_t::on_fenced_release ()
       release buffer with fence

       Parameters
           fence fence for last operation on buffer

       Sent when the compositor has finalised its usage of the associated buffer for the relevant commit, providing a dma_fence which will be signaled when all operations by the compositor on that buffer
       for that commit have finished.

       Once the fence has signaled, and assuming the associated buffer is not pending release from other wl_surface.commit requests, no additional explicit or  implicit  synchronization  is  required  to
       safely reuse or destroy the buffer.

       This event destroys the zwp_linux_buffer_release_v1 object.

       Definition at line 5679 of file wayland-client-protocol-unstable.cpp.

   std::function< void()> & zwp_linux_buffer_release_v1_t::on_immediate_release ()
       release  buffer  immediately Sent when the compositor has finalised its usage of the associated buffer for the relevant commit, and either performed no operations using it, or has a guarantee that
       all its operations on that buffer for that commit have finished.

       Once this event is received, and assuming the associated buffer is not pending release from other wl_surface.commit requests, no additional explicit or  implicit  synchronization  is  required  to
       safely reuse or destroy the buffer.

       This event destroys the zwp_linux_buffer_release_v1 object.

       Definition at line 5684 of file wayland-client-protocol-unstable.cpp.

   wayland::proxy_t::operator bool () const [inherited]
       Check whether this wrapper actually wraps an object.

       Returns
           true if there is an underlying object, false if this wrapper is empty

   bool wayland::proxy_t::operator!= (const proxy_t & right) const [inherited]
       Check whether two wrappers refer to different objects.

   bool wayland::proxy_t::operator== (const proxy_t & right) const [inherited]
       Check whether two wrappers refer to the same object.

   bool wayland::proxy_t::proxy_has_object () const [inherited]
       Check whether this wrapper actually wraps an object.

       Returns
           true if there is an underlying object, false if this wrapper is empty

   void wayland::proxy_t::proxy_release () [inherited]
       Release the wrapped object (if any), making this an empty wrapper. Note that display_t instances cannot be released this way. Attempts to do so are ignored.

       Examples
           foreign_display.cpp.

   void wayland::proxy_t::set_queue (event_queue_t queue) [inherited]
       Assign a proxy to an event queue.

       Parameters
           queue The event queue that will handle this proxy

       Assign proxy to event queue. Events coming from proxy will be queued in queue instead of the display's main queue.

       See also: display_t::dispatch_queue().

       Examples
           proxy_wrapper.cpp.
