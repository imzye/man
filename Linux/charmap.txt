NAME
       Charmap - a character map

SYNOPSIS
       Charmap

OPTIONS
       Charmap has no options.

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the Charmap command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have
       a manual page.

       Charmap is a character map. It is developed using the GNUstep development environment (www.gnustep.org) and is meant to contribute to GNUstep's  promise  to‐
       wards a desktop environment.

       Charmap offers font selection, allowing one to easily see all the glyphs which a particular font offers.

       Perhaps Charmap's biggest advantage is its support for displaying Unicode information.
