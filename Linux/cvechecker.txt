NAME
       cvechecker  -  Attempt  to identify possible vulnerable software on the
       system

SYNOPSIS
       cvechecker [-i] [-l version.dat] [-b binlist.txt] [-c] [-C] [-r] [-s]
       [-S] [-d] [-D] [-H] [-w watchlist.txt] [-f filename]

DESCRIPTION
       cvechecker  is a tool that, simply stated, matches your installed soft‐
       ware versus an online database of potential vulnerable software and re‐
       port the results back to you.

       To  be  able  to  identify  which software is installed on your system,
       cvechecker asks you to load a list of filenames (such as the output  of
       a  find command) into the tool using the -b (or --binlist) argument. It
       will then try to match the files against  an  internal  list  of  known
       softwares.  If it finds a known software title, it will attempt to dis‐
       cover the version of this software title. This internal list can be up‐
       dated using the -l (or --loaddata) arguments.

       To identify potential vulnerable software, cvechecker downloads the CVE
       entries from the Mitre site and stores it in the database. The  results
       of the CVE data and the scanned software on the system then provides us
       with the means to generate a report, listing software/version sets that
       have one (or more) CVE entries assigned to them.

       cvechecker  also supports a watchlist. This is a file that contains the
       CPEs for which you want to watch for CVEs. The watchlist behaves as  if
       the selected software is indeed installed on your system (so it will be
       visible in the reports that you pull from cvechecker). Using  a  watch‐
       list  allows  administrators  to add software that is not detectable by
       cvechecker (yet).

USAGE
   INITIALIZATION
       To use cvechecker, you first need to initialize the the databases.   If
       your installation uses a server RDBMS (instead of sqlite) this requires
       database owner privileges. Please consult the user guide for  more  in‐
       formation on how to initialize the database using SQL files (instead of
       database owner) if this is not allowed on your system.

       cvechecker -i

       Next, download the CVE entries from the Internet as well as the version
       detection rules and load them in the database.

       pullcves pull

   LOAD SOFTWARE LIST
       Every  time your system changes, you need to (re)load the software list
       in the database. Otherwise, cvechecker will  keep  on  reporting  about
       software  and  versions  that you might not have anymore (or not report
       about software that you have). A possible method  is  to  use  find  to
       identify  all  executable  commands  and  libraries  and  load those in
       cvechecker. I also  recommend  to  add  /proc/version  as  this  allows
       cvechecker to validate Linux kernel vulnerabilities as well.

       find / -path /mnt -prune -o -path /media -prune -o -type f -perm -o+x > scanlist.txt
       echo "/proc/version" >> scanlist.txt
       cvechecker -b filelist.txt

       It  is possible to only update a part of the file database when you add
       the  -d  (--deltaonly)  option.  This  is  useful  when  you  integrate
       cvechecker with your package management system. It also supports remov‐
       ing a part of the entries in the database (such as when  you  uninstall
       software) when you add the -D (--deletedeltaonly) option.

   LOAD WATCHLIST
       Like the software list, you can have cvechecker load a watchlist.  This
       load can happen concurrently with the filelist and  also  supports  the
       delta  options.  Be  aware though that, if you do not use the delta op‐
       tion, loading a watchlist will reload the database (clearing  your  de‐
       tected  software).  As  such, it is recommended to use the watchlist at
       the same time with your binary file listing, like so:pr

       cvechecker -b filelist.txt -w watchlist.txt

       In the reports, watchlist-provided software will have a filename start‐
       ing with "<<provided>>" and named after the CPE they represent.

   LOAD LATEST CVE ENTRIES
       Pull  in  the  latest CVE entries from the Internet (see also man pull‐
       cves)

       pullcves pull

   REPORT ON POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES
       To get a report on potential vulnerabilities, run cvechecker  with  the
       -r argument.

       cvechecker -r

       If  you want cvechecker to report on vulnerabilities that have been ex‐
       posed with higher versions of software that you have installed, you can
       add  the  -H (--reporthigher) option. However, be warned that this will
       give lots of false positives. The upside is that you can find potential
       vulnerabilities  in  software whose CVE entries doesn't contain all af‐
       fected software versions (some CVEs only - falsely - contain the  high‐
       est version where the vulnerability was present).

       cvechecker -r -H

       If  you  want  to use the output of the command as input for other com‐
       mands (for instance, to create a nice report), you can add the -C argu‐
       ment which makes the output csv-like:

       cvechecker -r -C

   REPORT ON DETECTED SOFTWARE
       To  get  a  report on the detected software, run cvechecker with the -s
       (only software) or -S (software with files that lead  to  the  software
       detection) argument.

       cvechecker -s

       If  you  want  to use the output of the command as input for other com‐
       mands (for instance, to create a nice report), you can add the -C argu‐
       ment which makes the output csv-like:

       cvechecker -s -C

COMMAND REFERENCE
       cvechecker supports the following arguments:

       -i, --initdbs
              Initialize the databases

       -l <datafile>, --loaddata=<datafile>
              Load the version detection rules

       -b <binlist>, --binlist=<binlist>
              Load the list of binaries available on the system. Accepts stan‐
              dard input if "-" is given.

       -c <cvelist>, --cvedata=<cvelist>
              Load the CSV file with CVE data. The CSV file can  be  generated
              with  nvd2simple,  part of the cvechecker package.  Normally you
              don't need to call this argument as it will be done by  pullcves
              anyway.

       -f <binfilepath>, --fileinfo=<binfilepath>
              Load a single file path in cvechecker. This allows you to verify
              if cvechecker can identify the binary or not (as it will display
              the CPE data if it can)

       -r, --runcheck
              Match the identified software and versions against the known CVE
              entries and report it on the screen

       -C, --csvoutput
              Report using CSV-like output.

              Only interesting when used with -r or -s

       -s, --showinstalled
              Show the detected software/version sets of this system

       -S, --showinstalledfiles
              Show the detected software/version sets of this system  together
              with the files that are used to detect this software/version set

       -d, --deltaonly
              The  file  passed on through the -b (--binlist) option only con‐
              tains files that need to be added  to  the  file  database  (and
              checked for versions) rather than a full file system dump

       -D, --deletedeltaonly
              The  file  passed on through the -b (--binlist) option only con‐
              tains files that have been uninstalled from the system, and thus
              can be removed from the database

       -H, --reporthigher
              Do  not  only  report  on CVEs that affect software installed on
              your system, but also on CVEs that affect higher versions of the
              software that is installed on your system

       -w <watchlist>, --watchlist=<watchlist>
              Load  the watchlist information (a file containing CPE entries -
              one per line - using the official CPE syntax)

CONFIGURATION FILE
       cvechecker will read the configuration  file  pointed  towards  by  the
       CVECHECKER_CONFFILE variable. If that variable is not set, ~/.cvecheck‐
       er.rc, /usr/local/etc/cvechecker.conf or  /etc/cvechecker.conf,  which‐
       ever  comes  first.  This  file contains the locations as well as other
       static parameters for the cvechecker application. An example configura‐
       tion file is:

       #
       # Generic settings
       #
       dbtype = "mysql";
       #dbtype = "sqlite3";
       cvecache = "/var/lib/cvechecker/cache";
       datadir = "/usr/share/cvechecker";
       stringcmd = "/usr/bin/strings -n 3 '@file@'";
       version_url = "https://raw.github.com/sjvermeu/cvechecker/master/versions.dat";
       #userkey = "servertag";

       #
       # For SQLite3
       #
       sqlite3: {
         localdb = "/var/lib/cvechecker/local";
         globaldb = "/var/lib/cvechecker/global.db";
       }

       #
       # For MySQL
       #
       mysql: {
         dbname = "cvechecker";
         dbuser = "cvechecker_rw";
         dbpass = "passwordforcvechecker_rw";
         dbhost = "mysql.company.com";
       };

       The following options are supported:

       • dbtype  tells the cvechecker application which back-end to use.  Cur‐
         rently, "sqlite", "sqlite3" and "mysql"  are  supported  (sqlite  and
         sqlite3 result in the same back-end)

       • cvecache  is  a  (cvechecker writeable) directory where pullcves will
         download all XML files and store the transformed XML2CSV files  (con‐
         taining  the  CVE  entry data). Although it is not used anymore after
         being imported into the  local  databases,  pullcves  relies  on  the
         availability of the XML files to find out if it needs to (re)download
         and import CVE entries. So if you want to clean  out  the  directory,
         make  (empty)  files  named after the XML files so that pullcves does
         not redownload and reimport the CVE entry data (not  that  this  will
         render the application unusable, but it takes a while)

       • datadir is a directory where cvechecker-related files are stored, in‐
         cluding the XSLT transformation files used to convert CVE  XML  files
         in  CSV  files  as well as the sample reporting files as used in this
         document

       • stringcmd is the command that cvechecker launches against a  file  to
         get  the files' content. Currently, this is the only supported method
         for cvechecker to identify the software/version.

       • version_url is the location where pullcves can find the latest  soft‐
         ware/version  matching  rules  to  identify installed software on the
         system.

       • servertag is an optional setting that is used in case of server RDBMS
         backends  to  differentiate between the cvechecker clients. It is op‐
         tional, because cvechecker already uses the clients'  hostname  as  a
         key, but users can define a second one. This can be both because they
         want to run multiple clients from the same  system/hostname,  or  be‐
         cause they want a more proper key for their identification (such as a
         server serial id or asset tag). This key is displayed in the reports.

       • sqlite3: combines all sqlite specific settings, which are:

         • localdb is a (cvechecker writeable) directory where cvechecker will
           store its sqlite3 databases containing the CPE data (identification
           information of software/versions) as well  as  the  local  systems'
           matching file/software pairs and all downloaded CVE entries

         • globaldb  is  a  (cvechecker writeable) sqlite3 database containing
           the software/version matching rules and CPEs associated with  these
           rules

       • mysql: combines all mysql specific settings, which are:

         • dbname is the name of the cvechecker database

         • dbuser is the user that cvechecker uses to connect to the database

         • dbpass is the password that cvechecker uses to connect to the data‐
           base and authenticate itself

         • dbhost is the hostname where the database resides

CVECHECKER IS NOT COMPLETE
       The strength of cvechecker can only be fully used if the list  of  sup‐
       ported software is huge. Currently, the list is too small to cover most
       systems. However, if you want to help us out in creating a larger data‐
       base, please read on.

       The format used to import software detection rules is as follows:

       ,[filepart],1,[fileregexp],[contentregexp],a,[vendor],[product],[version],[update],[edition],[language]

       The first comma tells cvechecker what the field separator is, so if you
       need to use the comma in a regular expression, you can use a  different
       field separator. Just start the line with the separator.

       • filepart is a string which cvechecker will match against the filename
         (not fully qualified). If it matches, cvechecker will  continue  with
         this file's investigation. This is merely for performance reasons

       • 1 is the type of check that cvechecker will execute to find out about
         the software's version. Currently, only 1 is supported.  In  the  fu‐
         ture, more methods will be added.

         • The  "1"  method  uses  the output of strings <file>. The output is
           then matched against a regular expression (with grouping)  and  the
           results  of the matches are then used to identify the version, edi‐
           tion, ... of the software

       • fileregexp is a regular expression statement that cvechecker will run
         against the filename (not fully qualified). If it matches, cvechecker
         will continue with this file's investigation.

       • contextregexp is a regular expression statement that cvechecker  will
         run  against the output of the strings <file> command. If it matches,
         the same regular expressions' grouping output will be used to fill up
         the metadata about the software

       • a  means that this is an application match. Other values are h (hard‐
         ware) or o (operating system). From  this  point  onwards,  all  next
         fields are part of the CPE specification

       • vendor  is the vendor name of the software. You can deduce the vendor
         name by surfing to the software's  homepage/vendor's  homepage.   The
         vendor  name is the domainname, without any prefix or suffix. For in‐
         stance, www.redhat.com yields "redhat". If no vendor exists, then the
         vendor is the name of the author. For instance, Sven Vermeulen yields
         "sven_vermeulen".

       • product is the name of the software title itself

       • version is the version of the  software.  It  will  most  likely  use
         grouping references (\1, \2, ...) from the regular expression

       • update is the update of the software. It will either be empty, or use
         the grouping references (\1, \2, ...) from the regular expression

       • edition is the edition of the software. It will either be  empty,  or
         use the grouping references (\1, \2, ...) from the regular expression

       • language is the language of the software. It will either be empty, or
         use the grouping references (\1, \2, ...) from the regular expression

       I have mentioned CPE. CPE stands for Common Platform Enumeration and is
       a  standard for identifying a product with version. More information on
       CPE    can    be    found    at     http://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm     and
       http://cpe.mitre.org/specification/index.html.

       A few examples of these detection rules:

       ,ncftp,1,ncftp,^.*NcFTP ([0-9\.]+)/([0-9]+) .*,a,ncftp_software,ncftp,\1,\2,,
