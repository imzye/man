NAME
       sqlsh - SQL shell

SYNOPSIS
               sqlsh -d DBI:Oracle:DEVDB -u scott -p tiger

DESCRIPTION
       sqlsh is an interactive shell run from the command-line for working with databases.  This is a terse summary for quick reference.  For a full description see SQL::Shell::Manual.  For a list of
       commands, type:

               help

       at the prompt after running sqlsh.  If you pass a username with -u and don't pass a password with -p, sqlsh will prompt you for a password.  You can pass a blank password with -p if required (-p
       followed by nothing).

OPTIONS
               -d <DSN>
               -u <username>
               -p <password>
               -i - read list of commands from STDIN
               -q - quiet (no banner)
               -A - turn AutoCommit ON
               -H - help

COMMANDS ADDED BY SQLSH
        cat|more|less <file> - display file
        help|? - show this
        reload - reload the shell
        exit|quit|bye|\w+ off - quit the shell

READLINE MODE
       This script uses Term::Readline. Term::Readline sets the editing mode (vi/emacs) based on the user's .inputrc, or the $EDITOR environment variable.

       This script will set $EDITOR based on $PERL_READLINE_MODE or bash's $SHELLOPTS variable. Any .inputrc "editing-mode" declaration still takes precedence.
