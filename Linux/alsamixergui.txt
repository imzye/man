NAME
       alsamixergui — FLTK based frontend for alsamixer

SYNOPSIS
       alsamixergui [-h]  [-c <card number or identification>]  [-D <mixer device>]  [-g]  [-s]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the alsamixergui commands.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       alsamixergui  is  a  FLTK based frontend for alsamixer. It is written directly on top of the alsamixer source, leaving the original source intact, only adding a couple of ifdefs, and some calls to
       the gui part, so it provides exactly the same functionality, but with a graphical user interface.

       -c <card number or identification>
