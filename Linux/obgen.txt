NAME
     obgen — generate 3D coordinates for a molecule

SYNOPSIS
     obgen [OPTIONS] filename

DESCRIPTION
     The obgen tool will generate 3D coordinates for molecules in a file (e.g. multi-molecule SMILES files). The resulting structure will be optimized using the given forcefield and checked for the lowest-
     energy conformer using a Monte Carlo search.  Output will be sent to standard output in the SDF file format.

OPTIONS
     If no filename is given, obgen will give all options including the available forcefields.

     -ff forcefield
           Select the forcefield

EXAMPLES
     View the possible options, including available forcefields:
           obgen

     Generate 3D coordinates for the molecule(s) in file test.smi:
           obgen test.smi

     Generate 3D coordinates for the molecule(s) in file test.smi using the UFF forcefield:
           obgen -ff UFF test.smi
