NAME
       cb2bib - software to extract bibliographic references from various sources

SYNOPSIS
       cb2bib

       cb2bib  [--conf [filename.conf]] [action] [filename1 [filename2 ... ]]

       c2bimport <imported reference file>

       c2bciter [space-separated list of BibTeX files or directories]

DESCRIPTION
       cb2bib is a software to extract bibliographic references from unformatted and non standard sources, like, for example 1) email alerts; 2) journal Web pages; 3) PDF files.

       Captured references are provided to the user for inspection in a graphical form. Once validated, the references are transformed into BibTeX records which might be appended to a user-defined BibTeX
       bib file.

       The software allows one to peruse a BibTeX file and to send to the clipboard a citation of all the records currently selected. A pipe is also setup with the LyX LaTeX editor.

       When invoked with the -h | --help option, cb2bib lists all the options that are available on the command line.

VARIANTS
       cb2bib is the main program.

       c2bimport is equivalent to using cb2bib --import (this variant takes only one file name as parameter).

       c2bciter is equivalent to using cb2bib --citer.

OPTION
       --conf [filename.conf]   Use configuration file

ACTIONS
       --configure [filename.conf]                       Edit configuration

       --import <tmp_reference_filename>                 Imports reference, usually from ad hoc websites

       --doc2bib fn1.doc [fn2.doc ... ] reference.bib    Extract reference from document file

       --txt2bib fn1.txt [fn2.txt ... ] reference.bib    Extract reference from text file

       --html-annote filename.tex                        Convert annote file to HTML

EXAMPLES

       cb2bib                                        Starts cb2Bib extraction program

       cb2bib --import tmp_reference_filename        Imports a reference from a file

       cb2bib --bibedit filename.bib                 Edits BibTeX filename.bib

       cb2bib --conf                                 Starts cb2Bib in USB mode

       cb2bib --doc2bib *.pdf references.bib         Extracts references from PDF title pages

NOTES

       The file cb2bib.conf must be readable and writable. If it does not exist, the cb2Bib will create one based on predefined defaults.

       Use switch --conf to particularize specific settings for specific actions.

       If  starting the cb2Bib from a removable media use the command 'cb2bib --conf' without configuration filename. Settings will be read from and written to /cb2bib/full/path/cb2bib.conf, being there‐
       fore independent of the mounting address that the host computer will provide.

       To import references from a browser select when asked c2bimport, which expands to 'cb2bib --import %f'. The browser will provide the temporary reference filename. The  temporary  file  is  deleted
       once imported.

       A number of factors influence the reliability of automatic extractions. Consider writing customized regular expressions and network queries, and use metadata when available.

       Important

       The commands --doc2bib and --txt2bib do not append the references to the references.bib. They create a new file, or silently overwrites it if already exists.
