NAME
       pnmixer - a mixer for the system tray

SYNOPSIS
       pnmixer [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       pnmixer  is  a  simple mixer application designed to run in your system tray. It integrates nicely into desktop environments that don't have a panel that supports applets and therefore can't run a
       mixer applet.  In particular it's been used quite a lot with fbpanel and tint2, but should run fine in any system tray.

       pnmixer is designed to work on systems that use ALSA for sound management. Any other sound driver like OSS or FFADO are currently not supported (patches welcome). pnmixer has been reported to work
       well with PulseAudio, but we lack feedback on this matter.
