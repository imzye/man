NAME
       xemacs - Emacs: The Next Generation

SYNOPSIS
       xemacs [ command-line switches ] [ files ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       XEmacs is a version of Emacs, compatible with and containing many improvements over GNU Emacs, written by Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation.  It was originally based on an early release
       of GNU Emacs Version 19, and has tracked subsequent releases of GNU Emacs as they have become available.

       The primary documentation of XEmacs is in the XEmacs Reference Manual, which you can read on-line using Info, a subsystem of XEmacs.  Please look there for complete and up-to-date documentation.  Com‐
       plete documentation on using Emacs Lisp is available on-line through the XEmacs Lisp Programmer's Manual.  Both manuals also can be printed out nicely using the TeX formatting package.

       The user functionality of XEmacs encompasses everything other Emacs editors do, and it is easily extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp.

       XEmacs  has an extensive interactive help facility, but the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate XEmacs windows and buffers.  CTRL-h enters the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) re‐
       quests an interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the fundamentals of XEmacs in a few minutes.  Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you find a command given its functionality, Help Key Binding (CTRL-
       h  k)  describes a given key sequence's effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp function specified by name.  You can also look up key sequences in the XEmacs Reference Manual using
       Lookup Key Binding (CTRL-h CTRL-k), and look up Lisp functions in the XEmacs Lisp Programmer's Manual using Lookup Function (CTRL-h CTRL-f).  All of these help functions, and more,  are  available  on
       the Help menu if you are using a window system.

       XEmacs  has  extensive GUI (graphical user interface) support when running under a window system such as X, including multiple frames (top-level windows), a menubar, a toolbar, horizontal and vertical
       scrollbars, dialog boxes, and extensive mouse support.

       XEmacs has full support for multiple fonts and colors, variable-width fonts, and variable-height lines, and allows for pixmaps to be inserted into a buffer. (This is used in the W3 web-browsing  pack‐
       age and in some of the debugger and outlining interfaces, among other things.)

       XEmacs's Undo can undo several steps of modification to your buffers, so it is easy to recover from editing mistakes.

       XEmacs's  many  special packages handle mail reading (VM, MH-E and RMail) and sending (Mail), Usenet news reading and posting (GNUS), World Wide Web browsing (W3), specialized modes for editing source
       code in all common programming languages, syntax highlighting for many languages (Font-Lock), compiling (Compile), running subshells within XEmacs windows (Shell), outline editing (Outline), running a
       Lisp read-eval-print loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy (Doctor).

       There  is  an  extensive  reference manual, but users of other Emacsen should have little trouble adapting even without a copy.  Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly by
       studying the tutorial and using the self-documentation features.

       XEmacs Options

       XEmacs accepts all standard X Toolkit command line options when run in an X Windows environment.  In addition, the following options are accepted (when options imply a sequence of actions to  perform,
       they are performed in the order encountered):

       -t file Use specified file as the terminal instead of using stdin/stdout.  This implies -nw.

       -batch  Edit in batch mode.  The editor will send messages to stdout.  You must use the -l, -f, and -eval options to specify files to execute and functions to call.

       -nw     Inhibit the use of any window-system-specific display code: use the current TTY.

       -debug-init
               Enter the debugger if an error occurs loading the init file.

       -unmapped
               Do not map the initial frame.

       -no-site-file
               Do not load the site-specific init file (site-start.el).

       -q, -no-init-file
               Do not load an init file.

       -no-early-packages
               Do not process the early packages.

       -vanilla
               Load no extra files at startup.  Equivalent to the combination of -q, -no-site-file, and -no-early-packages.

       -u user, -user user
               Load user's init file.

       file    Edit file.

       +number Go to the line specified by number (do not insert a space between the "+" sign and the number).

       -help   Print a help message and exit.

       -V, -version,
               Print the version number and exit.

       -f function, -funcall function
               Execute the lisp function function.

       -l file, -load file
               Load the Lisp code in the file file.

       -eval form
               Evaluate the Lisp form form.

       -i file, -insert file
               Insert file into the current buffer.

       -kill   Exit XEmacs (useful with -batch).

       Using XEmacs with X Windows

       XEmacs has been tailored to work well with the X window system.  If you run XEmacs from under X windows, it will create its own X window to display in.

       XEmacs can be started with the following standard X options:

       -visual <visualname><bitdepth>
              Select  the  visual that XEmacs will attempt to use.  <visualname> should be one of the strings "StaticColor", "TrueColor", "GrayScale", "PseudoColor" or "DirectColor", and <bitdepth> should be
              the number of bits per pixel (example, "-visual TrueColor24" for a 24bit TrueColor visual) See X(1) for more information.

       -privateColormap
              Require XEmacs to create and use a private colormap for display.  This will keep XEmacs from taking colors from the default colormap and keeping them from other clients, at the cost of  causing
              annoying flicker when the focus changes.  Use this option only if your X server does not support 24 bit visuals.

       -geometry ##x##+##+##
              Specify  the  geometry of the initial window.  The ##'s represent a number; the four numbers are width (characters), height (characters), X offset (pixels), and Y offset (pixels), respectively.
              Partial specifications of the form ##x## or +##+## are also allowed. (The geometry specification is in the standard X format; see X(1) for more information.)

       -iconic
              Specifies that the initial window should initially appear iconified.

       -name name
               Specifies the program name which should be used when looking up defaults in the user's X resources.

       -title title, -T title, -wn title
               Specifies the title which should be assigned to the XEmacs window.

       -d displayname, -display displayname
               Create the XEmacs window on the display specified by displayname.  Must be the first option specified in the command line.

       -font font, -fn font
               Set the XEmacs window's font to that specified by font.  You will find the various X fonts in the /usr/lib/X11/fonts directory.  XEmacs works with either fixed- or  variable-width  fonts,  but
               will probably look better with a fixed-width font.

       -scrollbar-width pixels
               Specify the width of the vertical scrollbars.

       -scrollbar-height pixels
               Specify the height of the horizontal scrollbars.

       -bw pixels, -borderwidth pixels
               Set the XEmacs window's border width to the number of pixels specified by pixels.  Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.

       -ib pixels, -internal-border-width pixels
               Specify the width between a frame's border and its text, in pixels.  Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.

       -fg color, -foreground color
               Sets the color of the text.

               See the file /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt for a list of valid color names.

       -bg color, -background color
               Sets the color of the window's background.

       -bd color, -bordercolor color
               Sets the color of the window's border.

       -mc color
               Sets the color of the mouse pointer.

       -cr color
               Sets the color of the text cursor.

       -rv, -reverse
               Reverses the foreground and background colors (reverse video).  Consider explicitly setting the foreground and background colors instead of using this option.

       -xrm argument
               This allows you to set an arbitrary resource on the command line.  argument should be a resource specification, as might be found in your .Xresources or .Xdefaults file.

       You can also set resources, i.e.  X default values, for your XEmacs windows in your .Xresources or .Xdefaults file (see xrdb(1)).  Use the following format:

              Emacs.keyword:value

       or

              Emacs*EmacsFrame.keyword:value

       where value specifies the default value of keyword.  (Some resources need the former format; some the latter.)

       You can also set resources for a particular frame by using the format

              Emacs*framename.keyword:value

       where framename is the resource name assigned to that particular frame.  (Certain packages, such as VM, give their frames unique resource names, in this case "VM".)

       XEmacs lets you set default values for the following keywords:

       default.attributeFont (class Face.AttributeFont)
               Sets the window's text font.

       default.attributeForeground (class Face.AttributeForeground)
               Sets the window's text color.

       default.attributeBackground (class Face.AttributeBackground)
               Sets the window's background color.

       face.attributeFont (class Face.AttributeFont)
               Sets the font for face, which should be the name of a face.  Common face names are

               FACE            PURPOSE
               default         Normal text.
               bold            Bold text.

               and Lucid scrollbars and "bottom-left" for the Athena scrollbars.

       topToolBarHeight (class TopToolBarHeight)
               Sets the height of the top toolbar, in pixels.  0 means no top toolbar.

       bottomToolBarHeight (class BottomToolBarHeight)

       rightToolBarWidth (class RightToolBarWidth)
               Sets the width of the right toolbar, in pixels.  0 means no right toolbar.

       topToolBarShadowColor (class TopToolBarShadowColor)

       topToolBarShadowPixmap (class TopToolBarShadowPixmap)
               Sets the pixmap of the top shadows for the toolbars. (For all toolbars, not just the toolbar at the top of the frame.) If set, this resource overrides the corresponding color resource.

       bottomToolBarShadowPixmap (class BottomToolBarShadowPixmap)
               Sets the pixmap of the bottom shadows for the toolbars. (For all toolbars, not just the toolbar at the bottom of the frame.) If set, this resource overrides the corresponding color resource.

       toolBarShadowThickness (class ToolBarShadowThickness)
               Thickness of the shadows around the toolbars, in pixels.

       visualBell (class VisualBell)

       modeLinePointer (class Cursor)
               The cursor to use when the mouse is over a mode line.

       gcPointer (class Cursor)
               The cursor to display when a garbage-collection is in progress.

       scrollbarPointer (class Cursor)
               The cursor to use when the mouse is over the scrollbar.

       MOUSE BUTTON         FUNCTION
       left                 Set point or make a text selection.
       middle               Paste text.
       right                Pop up a menu of options.
       SHIFT-left           Extend a selection.
       CTRL-left            Make a selection and insert it at point.
       CTRL-middle          Set point and move selected text there.
       CTRL-SHIFT-left      Make a selection, delete it, and insert it at point.
       META-left            Make a rectangular selection.

FILES
       Lisp code is read at startup from the user's init file, $HOME/.xemacs/init.el. If this file does not exist then $HOME/.emacs will be read if it is present.

       /usr/local/info - files for the Info documentation browser (a subsystem of XEmacs) to refer to.  The complete text of the XEmacs Reference Manual and the XEmacs Lisp Programmer's Manual is included in
       a convenient tree structured form.

       /usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/info - the Info files may be here instead.

       /usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/lisp/* - Lisp source files and compiled files that define most editing commands.  The files are contained in subdirectories, categorized by function or individual  pack‐
       age.  Some are preloaded; others are autoloaded from these directories when used.

       /usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/etc - some files of information, pixmap files, other data files used by certain packages, etc.

       /usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/$CONFIGURATION - various programs that are used with XEmacs.

       /usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/$CONFIGURATION/DOC  -  contains  the  documentation  strings  for the Lisp primitives and preloaded Lisp functions of XEmacs.  They are stored here to reduce the size of
       XEmacs proper.

       /usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-lisp - locally-provided Lisp files.

BUGS AND HELP
       There is a newsgroup, comp.emacs.xemacs, for reporting XEmacs bugs and fixes and requesting help.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is a bug, not a  misun‐
       derstanding  or  a  deliberate feature.  We ask you to read the section ``Reporting XEmacs Bugs'' near the end of the reference manual (or Info system) for hints on how and when to report bugs.  Also,
       include the version number of the XEmacs you are running and the system you are running it on in every bug report that you send in.  Finally, the more you can isolate the cause of a bug and the condi‐
       tions it happens under, the more likely it is to be fixed, so please take the time to do so.

       The newsgroup is bidirectionally gatewayed to and from the mailing list xemacs@xemacs.org.  You can read the list instead of the newsgroup if you do not have convenient Usenet news access.  To request
       to be added to the mailing list, send mail to xemacs-request@xemacs.org. (Do not send mail to the list itself.)

       The XEmacs maintainers read the newsgroup regularly and will attempt to fix bugs reported in a timely fashion.  However, not every message will get a response from one of the maintainers.   Note  that
       there are many people other than the maintainers who read the newsgroup, and will usually be of assistance in helping with any problems encountered.

       If you need more personal assistance than can be provided by the newsgroup, look in the SERVICE file (see above) for a list of people who offer it.

       For more information about XEmacs mailing lists, see the file /usr/local/lib/xemacs-$VERSION/etc/MAILINGLISTS.

AUTHORS
       XEmacs was written by Steve Baur <steve@xemacs.org>, Martin Buchholz <martin@xemacs.org>, Richard Mlynarik <mly@adoc.xerox.com>, Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@xemacs.org>, Chuck Thompson <cthomp@xemacs.org>,
       Ben Wing <ben@xemacs.org>, Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.org>, and many others.  It was based on an early version of GNU Emacs Version 19, written by Richard Stallman  <rms@gnu.org>  of  the  Free  Software
       Foundation, and has tracked subsequent releases of GNU Emacs as they have become available.  It was originally written by Lucid, Inc.  (now defunct) and was called Lucid Emacs.

       Chuck  Thompson  wrote  the  XEmacs  redisplay engine, maintains the XEmacs FTP and WWW sites, and has put out all releases of XEmacs since 19.11 (the first release called XEmacs).  Ben Wing wrote the
       Asian-language support, the on-line documentation (including this man page and much of the FAQ), the external widget code, and retooled or rewrote most  of  the  basic,  low-level  XEmacs  subsystems.
       Jamie Zawinski put out all releases of Lucid Emacs, from the first (19.0) through the last (19.10), and was the primary code contributor for all of these releases.  Richard Mlynarik rewrote the XEmacs
       Lisp-object allocation system, improved the keymap and minibuffer code, and did the initial synching of XEmacs with GNU Emacs Version 19.

       Many others have also contributed significantly.  For more detailed information, including a long history of XEmacs from multiple viewpoints and pretty pictures and bios of the major XEmacs  contribu‐
       tors, see the XEmacs About Page (the About XEmacs option on the Help menu).
