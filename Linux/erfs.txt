NAME
       erfs - a tool to create an encrypted file system on the cloud

SYNOPSIS
       erfs <COMMAND> [-options] <SHARE-SECRET> [<mount-point>]

DESCRIPTION
       erfs is a simple unix utility which creates and mounts an encrypted remote file system. The file system is encrypted locally and the encrypted data is stored in the cloud.

       The  cloud  server  has no knowledge of the content. A rogue server operator can not access the data. All key material is created on the user's computer and never stored or transferred to the
       server.

       It supports collaboration and the same filesystem can be accessed from different computers at the same time. The data is securely and seamlessly synchronized.

COMMAND
       init         Initialize (create) a new file system and print the SHARE-SECRET of the newly created file system.

       mount <SHARE-SECRET>
                    Mount the encrypted remote file system.

       umount <SHARE-SECRET>
                    Unmount the encrypted remote file system. SHARE-SECRET is optional and all filesystems will be unmounted if no specific SHARE-SECRET is given.

OPTIONS
       -x           read the SHARE-SECRET from standard input.

SECURITY
       Passing the SHARE-SECRET as command line parameter is insecure. Use the -x option or set the environment variable (example):

       $ SEC=aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y ./erfs m

ENVIRONEMT
       The following environment variable can be set to control the behavior.

       SEC=<SHARE SECRET> Specify the SHARE-SECRET to pass it (securely) to erfs.

COPYRIGHT
       ERFS is entirely my own creation, although plenty of other code was used as examples. It is released under GPL.

NOTES
       The latest version is available from https://github.com/hackerschoice/erfs/.

BUGS
       Efforts have been made to have erfs "do the right thing" in all its various modes.  If you believe that it is doing the wrong thing under whatever circumstances, please notify me and tell  me
       how  you  think  it should behave. I certainly encourage people to make custom mods and send in any improvements they make to it. Continued feedback from the Internet community is always wel‐
       come!

EXAMPLES
       Initialize a new encrypted and remote file system:
       $ erfs init

       Mount the new file system (replace aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y with the SHARE-SECRET from the previous step):
       $ erfs mount aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y

       or mount to a specific mount-point (~/secure-drive):
       $ mkdir ~/secure-drive
       $ erfs mount aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y ~/secure-drive

       Unmount the file system:
       $ erfs umount ~/secure-drive

       or unmount the file system by specifying the SHARE-SECRET:
       $ erfs umount aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y

       or unmount all encrypted file systems:
       $ erfs umount
