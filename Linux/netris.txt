NAME
       netris - networked version of tetris

SYNOPSIS
       netris [-wFDSCHR] [-c host] [-p port] [-k keys] [-i sec] [-r robot] [-s seed]

DESCRIPTION
       The  object  of  the  game  Tetris is to fit the shapes together forming complete rows, which then vanish.  When the shapes fill up to the top, the game ends.  This version of Tetris can be played
       against other people over a network.

OPTIONS
       -w     Wait for connection from another host running netris.

       -c  host
              Initiate connection to waiting netris running on host.

       -p  port
              Set the port number to use for connecting to netris, the default port is 9284.

       -k  keys
              Remap keys, the argument is a prefix of the string containing the keys in order: left, rotate, right, drop, down-faster, toggle-spying, pause, faster, redraw and new game. Use the "^" char‐
              acter to prefixes controls.  The default is to use "jkl mspf^ln".

       -i  sec
              Set the step-down interval, in seconds.

       -r  robot
              Execute robot (a command) as a robot controlling the game instead of the keyboard.

       -F     Use fair robot interface.

       -s  seed
              Start with given random seed.

       -D     Drops go into drop mode, this means that sliding off a cliff after a drop causes another drop automatically.

       -S     Disable inverse/bold/color for slow terminals.

       -C     Disable color.

       -H     Show distribution and warranty information.

       -R     Show the rules of the game.

RULES
   Two player mode
       It's just like normal Tetris except that when you clear more than one row with a single piece, the other player's board is moved up and junk rows are added to the bottom.  If you clear 2, 3  or  4
       rows,  1, 2 or 4 junk rows are added to your opponent's board, respectively.  The junk rows have exactly one empty column.  For each group of junk rows given, the empty columns will line up.  This
       is intentional.

       The longest surviving player wins the game.

   One player mode
       This mode is currently very boring, because there's no scoring and it never gets any faster.  This will be rectified at some point.  I'm not very motivated to do it right now because I'm  sick  of
       one player Tetris.  For now, use the "f" key (by default) to make the game go faster.  Speed-ups cannot be reversed for the remainder of the game.
