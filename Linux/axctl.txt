AXCTL(8)                 Linux System Managers Manual                 AXCTL(8)

NAME
       axctl - Configure/Kill running AX.25 connections.

SYNOPSIS
       axctl [-v] port dest src window|t1|t2|t3|n2|idle|paclen|kill [parm]

DESCRIPTION
       The  axctl  command is designed to be a multi-function command that al‐
       lows miscellaneous commands to be issued to the  Linux  AX.25  protocol
       layer  for existing AX.25 connections. The connection is uniquely iden‐
       tified via the combination of port,  destination  callsign  and  source
       callsign, with that information the kernel is able to change the param‐
       eters, or abort the connection.

       Many of the options are similar to those found in axparms  and  perform
       the same function. Only one parameter may be changed on each invokation
       of axctl.

OPTIONS
       -v                  Displays the version number.

       window window       Sets the window size for the AX.25 connection.

       t1 t1-timeout       Sets the initial T1 timeout  value  for  the  AX.25
                           connection, the value is given in seconds.

       t2 t2-timeout       Sets the T2 timeout value for the AX.25 connection,
                           the value is given in seconds.

       t3 t3-timeout       Sets the T3 timeout value for the AX.25  connected,
                           the value is given in seconds.

       n2 n2-count         Sets the maximum number of tries for the AX.25 con‐
                           nection.

       idle idle-timeout   Sets the value for the idle  timer  for  the  AX.25
                           connection, the value is in minutes.

       paclen paclength    Sets  the  maximum packet length that may be trans‐
