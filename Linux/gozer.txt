NAME
       gozer - a commandline text renderer

SYNOPSIS
       gozer [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       gozer is a commandline text rendering utility for creating images from abitrary text in antialised truetype fonts using optional fontstyles, wordwrapping and layout control.  gozer uses the imlib2 li‐
       brary to create and save images.  gozer has a few options, detailed below. Specify [file] as the filename to save the rendered text to. Options can also be specified in an rc file ,  allowing  you  to
       save  commonly  used  options (such as fontpaths) for reuse.  The rc file $HOME/.gozerrc is always parsed for default settings, and other rc files can be specified on the commandline to override these
       options. See RC FILES for information on syntax.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
            display help output and exit.

       -v, --version
            output version information and exit.

       -b, --background COL
            use COL as the background color, see COLOUR_DEFINITIONS for syntax, default is transparent (0,0,0,0).

       -f, --foreground COL
            use COL as the foreground color. Default is white (255,255,255,255).

       -F, --font STR
            draw using font STR. Size is specified with the name, eg 'arial/12' for 12pt arial, default is 20thcent/16 (a font supplied by gozer).

       -j, --justification STR
            justify text, allowed values for STR are left, right, center or block. Default is left.

       -l, --line-spacing INT
            separate multiple lines by INT pixels, default 1.

       -p, --fontpath STR
            colon seperated list of font directories to search for fonts in. Best used in the RCFILE to save typing it each time.

       -q, --quality INT
            1-100, effects quality of output for certain formats, e.g. jpeg compression (higher means higher quality).

       -P, --pipe
            Pipe input text from standard in instead of reading it from a file.

       -r, --rc-file STR
            use STR as the rc file to look for extra options, default is $HOME/.gozerrc

       -s, --style STR
            use STR as a file to load a fontstyle from, see FONTSTYLES for syntax.

       -t, --text STR
            use STR as text to draw.

       -T, --textfile STR
            read text to draw from file STR.

       -w, --wrap INT
            wordwrap the text to INT pixels.

       -x, --x-offset INT
            Offset text horizontally from top left by INT pixels.

       -y, --y-offset INT
            Offset text vertically from top left by INT pixels.

RC FILES
       rc file syntax is simple. The '#' character at the start of a line denotes that the line is a comment, otherwise lines are started with the name of a long option from the commandline (without  prefix‐
       ing the --), some whitespace and the value of the option. E.g.
       fontpath /usr/share/truetype:/usr/local/share/truetype
       NOTE that options in a --rc-file specified rc file OVERRIDE those from the commandline, but the $HOME/.gozerrc file is always read first for default settings.

COLOUR_DEFINITIONS
       You can define colours in 4 ways. Using the html style: #RRGGBB (in which case alpha defaults to 255),
       #RRGGBBAA, or an alternative style:
       r,g,b or r,g,b,a (no spaces between commas please).
       eg for white text, either use #ffffff, #ffffffff, "255,255,255" or "255,255,255,255". For red, #ff0000, #ff0000ff or "255,0,0" etc.

FONTSTYLES
       fontstyles can be defined in the EFM syntax (for compatibility only, these are not as powerful), or the recommended syntax defined here.
       The first line contains the line:
       #Style
       The second, an optional style name,
       #NAME mystyle
       There follows a list of layers. Each is described by this rule:
       RED GREEN BLUE ALPHA X_OFFSET Y_OFFSET
       The special values or 0,0,0,0 for red, green, blue and alpha specify the positioning of the actual text in it's selected colour.
       For example, the following style defines a very simple shadow for text:
       #Style
       #NAME shadow
       0 0 0 128 -3 -3
       0 0 0 0 0 0
