NAME
       Tie::CPHash - Case preserving but case insensitive hash table

VERSION
       This document describes version 2.000 of Tie::CPHash, released January 17, 2015.

SYNOPSIS
           use Tie::CPHash 2; # allows initialization during tie
           tie %cphash, 'Tie::CPHash', key => 'value';

           $cphash{'Hello World'} = 'Hi there!';
           printf("The key `%s' was used to store `%s'.\n",
                  tied(%cphash)->key('HELLO WORLD'),
                  $cphash{'HELLO world'});

DESCRIPTION
       The Tie::CPHash module provides a hash table that is case preserving but case insensitive.  This means that

           $cphash{KEY}    $cphash{key}
           $cphash{Key}    $cphash{keY}

       all refer to the same entry.  Also, the hash remembers which form of the key was last used to store the entry.  The "keys" and "each" functions will return the key that was used to set the value.

       An example should make this clear:

           tie %h, 'Tie::CPHash', Hello => 'World';
           print $h{HELLO};            # Prints 'World'
           print keys(%h);             # Prints 'Hello'
           $h{HELLO} = 'WORLD';
           print $h{hello};            # Prints 'WORLD'
           print keys(%h);             # Prints 'HELLO'

       Tie::CPHash version 2.000 introduced the ability to pass a list of "key => value" pairs to initialize the hash (along with the "add" method that powers it).  The list must include a value for each
       key, or the constructor will croak.

       The additional "key" method lets you fetch the case of a specific key:

           # When run after the previous example, this prints 'HELLO':
           print tied(%h)->key('Hello');

       (The "tied" function returns the object that %h is tied to.)

       If you need a case insensitive hash, but don't need to preserve case, just use $hash{lc $key} instead of $hash{$key}.  This has a lot less overhead than Tie::CPHash.

       "use Tie::CPHash;" does not export anything into your namespace.

METHODS
   add
         tied(%h)->add( key => value, ... );
         tied(%h)->add( \@list_of_key_value_pairs );

       This method (introduced in version 2.000) adds keys and values to the hash.  It's just like

         %h = @list_of_key_value_pairs;

       except that it doesn't clear the hash first.  It accepts either a list or an arrayref.  It croaks if the list has an odd number of entries.  It returns the tied hash object.

       If the list contains duplicate keys, the last "key => value" pair in the list wins.  (You can't pass a hashref to "add" because it would be ambiguous which key would win if two keys differed only
       in case.)

       For people used to Tie::IxHash, "add" is aliased to both "Push" and "Unshift".  (Tie::CPHash does not preserve the order of keys.)

   key
         $set_using_key = tied(%h)->key( $key )

       This method lets you fetch the case of a specific key.  For example:

         $h{HELLO} = 'World';
         print tied(%h)->key('Hello'); # prints HELLO

       If the key does not exist in the hash, it returns "undef".

DIAGNOSTICS
       Odd number of elements in CPHash add
           You passed a list with an odd number of elements to the "add" method (or to "tie", which uses "add").  The list must contain a value for each key.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       Tie::CPHash requires no configuration files or environment variables.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       No bugs have been reported.
