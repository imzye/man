NAME
       gamemoderun - invoke gamemode into any program

SYNOPSIS
       gamemoderun PROGRAM

DESCRIPTION
       GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a
       set of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.

       The design has a clear cut abstraction between the host daemon and  li‐
       brary  (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemod‐
       eauto and gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe usage without  worry‐
       ing  about whether the daemon is installed or running. This design also
       means that while the host library currently relies on systemd  for  ex‐
       changing  messages with the daemon, it's entirely possible to implement
       other internals that still work with the same clients.

       GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
       the  Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended
       to be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are  a  wealth
       of automation tasks one might want to apply.

USAGE
       libgamemodeauto.so.0  can  be  pre-loaded  into  any program to request
       gamemoded begin or end the mode, like so:

           gamemoderun ./game

       Or by setting the Steam launch options for a game:

           gamemoderun %command%

       The library can be manually preloaded if needed:

           LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/usr/\$LIB/libgamemodeauto.so.0 ./game

CONFIG
       It is possible to set additional start commands to gamemoderun by  set‐
       ting the environment variable:

           GAMEMODERUNEXEC="command"

       When  this  is  set, gamemoderun will execute the command given by that
       environment variable, and the command line passed to  gamemoderun  will
       be passed as arguments to that command. GameMode will not be applied to
       the wrapper command, just the game itself.
