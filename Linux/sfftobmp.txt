NAME
       sfftobmp - SFF (Structured Fax File) Converter

SYNOPSIS
       sfftobmp [options] INFILE1 [INFILE2 ..] [-o OUTSPEC]

OPTIONS
       -h or -help       Show this message and exit

       -v or -version    Show version and exit

       -b or -bmp        Output is one monochrome BMP file for each fax page

       -p or -pbm        Output is one Portable Bitmap file for each fax page

       -j or -jpg        Output is one JPEG file for each fax page

       -jNUM or -jpg=NUM Use jpeg quality of NUM percent (1..99)

       -T or -tifs       Output is one single-page TIFF file for each fax page

       -t or -tif        Output is one multi-paged TIFF file containing all pages

       -r or -keepres    Inhibit line doubling for low-res faxes

       -d or -keepdate   Keep date and time of input file for the output file(s)

   The OUTSPEC is interpreted as:
              - a filename if only one input file is given.  - a directory name if more than one input file is given.

       If OUTSPEC is omitted, the name of the output files will be derived from the input files and created in the same directory.

       Output on stdout is available for multipaged TIFF output only (option "-t").  Use "-" as output filename in this case.

       In case of TIFF output, you can specify the compression by using additional specifiers:

       -tr resp. -Tr : CCITT modified Huffman RLE

       -t4 resp. -T4 : CCITT Fax Class 4 compression

       The default is CCITT Fax Class 3 compression.
