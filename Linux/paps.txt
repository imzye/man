NAME
       paps - UTF-8 to PostScript converter using Pango

SYNOPSIS
       paps [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       paps reads a UTF-8 encoded file and generates a PostScript language rendering of the file. The rendering is done by creating outline curves through the pango ft2 backend.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       --landscape
              Landscape output. Default is portrait.

       --columns=cl
              Number of columns output. Default is 1.
              Please notice this option isn't related to the terminal length as in a "80 culums terminal".

       --font=desc
              Set the font description. Default is Monospace 12.

       --rtl  Do right to left (RTL) layout.

       --paper ps
              Choose paper size. Known paper sizes are legal, letter and A4. Default is A4.

       Postscript points
              Each postscript point equals to 1/72 of an inch. 36 points are 1/2 of an inch.

       --bottom-margin=bm
              Set bottom margin. Default is 36 postscript points.

       --top-margin=tm
              Set top margin. Default is 36 postscript points.

       --left-margin=lm
              Set left margin. Default is 36 postscript points.

       --right-margin=rm
              Set right margin. Default is 36 postscript points.

       --gutter-width=gw
              Set gutter width. Default is 40 postscript points.

       --help Show summary of options.

       --header
              Draw page header for each page.

       --markup
              Interpret the text as pango markup.

       --lpi  Set the lines per inch. This determines the line spacing.

       --cpi  Set the characters per inch. This is an alternative method of specifying the font size.

       --stretch-chars
              Indicates that characters should be stretched in the y-direction to fill up their vertical space. This is similar to the texttops behaviour.
