NAME
       luametatex - Next generation ConTeXt procession engine.

SYNOPSIS
       luametatex --lua=FILE [OPTION]... [TEXNAME[.tex]] [COMMANDS]
       luametatex --lua=FILE [OPTION]... RST-LINE
       luametatex --lua=FILE [OPTION]... &FMT ARGS

DESCRIPTION
       Run LuaMetaTeX on TEXNAME, usually creating TEXNAME.pdf. Any remaining COMMANDS are processed as luatex input, after TEXNAME is read.

       Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a backslash, LuaMetaTeX interprets all non-option arguments as an input line.

       Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a &, the next word is taken as the FMT to read, overriding all else. Any remaining arguments are processed as above.

       If no arguments or options are specified, prompt for input.

       The following regular options are understood:

       --credits
              display credits and exit

       --fmt=FORMAT
              load the format file FORMAT

       --help display help and exit

       --ini  be iniluametatex, for dumping formats

       --jobname=STRING
              set the job name to STRING

       --lua=FILE
              load and execute a lua initialization script

       --version
              display version and exit

       Alternate behaviour models can be obtained by special switches

       --luaonly
              run a lua file, then exit

       Loading libraries from Lua is blocked unless one explicitly permits it:

       --permitloadlib
              permit loading of external libraries (coming)

       See the reference manual for more information about the startup process.

       The LuaMetaTeX project is related to ConTeXt development. This macro package tightly integrates TeX and MetaPost in close cooperation with Lua. Updates will happen in sync with  ConTeXt  and  when
       needed. Don't be fooled by unchanged dates: long term stability is the objective.
