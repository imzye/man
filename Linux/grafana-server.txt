NAME
       grafana-server  - back-end server for the Grafana metrics dashboard and
       graph editor

DESCRIPTION
       grafana-server is the back-end server for the Grafana metrics dashboard
       and  graph  editor.   The grafana-server program should not normally be
       run from the command line, except when testing or for development  pur‐
       poses.   Rather  it  should  be  managed  by systemd.  After installing
       Grafana, the systemd service should be enabled and started as follows:

          systemctl daemon-reload
          systemctl enable grafana-server.service
          systemctl start grafana-server.service
