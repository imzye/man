MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal(3pm)                                                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                    MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal(3pm)

NAME
       MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal - Less Sugary Syntax for moose 'has' fields

VERSION
       version 1.000006

SYNOPSIS
       This is a legacy variant of Sugar which only exports "ro" and "rw" functions, the way MooseX::Has::Sugar used to with ":is";

           use MooseX::Types::Moose qw( Str );
           use MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal;

           has foo => (
                   isa => Str,
                   is  => ro,
                   required => 1,
           );
           has bar => (
                   isa => Str,
                   is => rw,
                   lazy_build => 1,
           );

       All functions are exported by The Sub::Exporter Module.

EXPORT GROUPS
   ":default"
       Exports ":is"

   ":is"
       Exports "bare", "ro", "rw"

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
   "bare"
       returns "('bare')"

   "ro"
       returns "('ro')"

   "rw"
       returns "('rw')"

CONFLICTS
   MooseX::Has::Sugar
   MooseX::Has::Sugar::Saccharin
       This module is not intended to be used in conjunction with
        ::Sugar or ::Sugar::Saccharin.

       We all export "ro" and "rw" in different ways.

       If you do however want to use them in conjunction, specific imports must
        be done on MooseX::Has::Sugar's side to stop it exporting different
        ro/rw. Any of the below should be fine.

           use MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal;
           use MooseX::Has::Sugar qw( :attrs );

           has foo =>( is => rw , lazy_build );

           use MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal;
           use MooseX::Has::Sugar qw( lazy_build );

           has foo =>( is => rw , lazy_build );
