NAME
       stompserver - Stomp protocol messaging server

SYNOPSIS
       stompserver [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Stomp messaging server with file/dbm/memory/activerecord based FIFO queues, queue monitoring, and basic authentication.

OPTIONS
       -C, --config=CONFIGFILE
              Configuration File (default: stompserver.conf)

       -p, --port=PORT
              Change the port (default: 61613)

       -b, --host=ADDR
              Change the host (default: localhost)

       -q, --queuetype=QUEUETYPE
              Queue type (memory|dbm|activerecord|file) (default: memory)

       -w, --working_dir=DIR
              Change the working directory (default: current directory)

       -s, --storage=DIR
              Change the storage directory (default: .stompserver, relative to working_dir)

       -d, --debug
              Turn on debug messages

       -a, --auth
              Require client authorization

       -c, --checkpoint=SECONDS
              Time between checkpointing the queues in seconds (default: 0)

       -h, --help
              Show this message

QUEUES
       Stompserver handles basic message queue processing using memory, file, or dbm based queues. Messages are sent and consumed in FIFO order (unless a client error happens, this should be corrected in
       the future). Topics are memory-only storage.  You can select activerecord, file or dbm storage and the queues will use that, but topics will only be stored in memory.

       memory queues are of course the fastest ones but shouldn't be used if you want to ensure all messages are delivered.

       dbm  queues will use berkeleydb if available, otherwise dbm or gdbm depending on the platform. sdbm does not work well with marshalled data. Note that these queues have not been tested in this re‐
       lease.

       For the file based storage, each frame is stored in a single file. The first 8 bytes contains the header length, the next 8 bytes contains the body length, then the headers are stored  as  a  mar‐
       shalled  object  followed by the body stored as a string. This storage is currently inefficient because queues are stored separately from messages, which forces a double write for data safety rea‐
       sons on each message stored.

       The activerecord based storage expects to find a database.yml file in the configuration directory. It should be the most robust backend, but the slowest one. The database must have an  ar_messages
       table which can be created with the following code (you are responsible to do so):

         ActiveRecord::Schema.define do
           create_table 'ar_messages' do |t|
             t.column 'stomp_id', :string, :null => false
             t.column 'frame', :text, :null => false
           end
         end

       You can read the frames with this model:

         class ArMessage < ActiveRecord::Base
           serialize :frame
         end

       The ar_message implementation will certainly change in the future.

       This is meant to be easily readable by a Rails application (which could handle the ar_messages table creation with a migration).

ACCESS CONTROL
       Basic  client authorization is also supported.  If the -a flag is passed to stompserver on startup, and a .passwd file exists in the run directory, then clients will be required to provide a valid
       login and passcode.  See passwd.example for the password file format.

MONITORING
       Queues can be monitored via the monitor queue (this will probably not be supported this way in the future to avoid polluting the queue namespace). If you subscribe to /queue/monitor, you will  re‐
       ceive  a  status  message  every 5 seconds that displays each queue, it's size, frames enqueued, and frames dequeued. Stats are sent in the same format of stomp headers, so they are easy to parse.
       Following is an example of a status message containing stats for 2 queues:

       Queue: /queue/client2 size: 0 dequeued: 400 enqueued: 400

       Queue: /queue/test size: 50 dequeued: 250 enqueued: 300
