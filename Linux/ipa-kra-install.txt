NAME
       ipa-kra-install - Install a KRA on a server

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-kra-install [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a KRA as an IPA-managed service. This requires that the IPA server
       is already installed and configured, including a CA.

       The KRA (Key Recovery Authority) is a component used to securely  store
       secrets  such as passwords, symmetric keys and private asymmetric keys.
       It is used as the back-end repository for the IPA Password Vault.

       Domain level 0 is not supported anymore.

       ipa-kra-install can be used to add KRA to the existing CA,  or  to  in‐
       stall the KRA service on a replica.

       KRA   can   only   be  removed  along  with  the  entire  server  using
       ipa-server-install --uninstall.
