NAME
       ipmiutil_health- show IPMI health

SYNOPSIS
       ipmiutil health [-ifhglmnopqsx -N node -U user -P/-R pswd -EFJTVY]

DESCRIPTION
       ipmiutil  health  is a program that uses IPMI commands to show the health of the BMC.  This utility can use either the /dev/ipmi0 driver from OpenIPMI, the /dev/imb driver from Intel, the /dev/ipmikcs
       driver from valinux, direct user-space IOs, or the IPMI LAN interface if -N.

OPTIONS
       Command line options are described below.

       -c     Show canonical, delimited output.

       -f     Show the FRUSDR version also.

       -g     Show the IPMI GUID of this system.  The GUID is a read-only unique identifier.

       -h     Check the health of the HotSwap Controller also.

       -l     Show the IPMI LAN channel statistics also.

       -m 002000
              Target a specific MC (e.g. bus 00, sa 20, lun 00).  This could be used for PICMG or ATCA blade systems.  The trailing character, if present, indicates SMI addressing if 's', or IPMB  addressing
              if 'i' or not present.

       -n string
              Set the System Name to this string in the IPMI System Information.

       -o string
              Set the Primary Operating System to this string in the IPMI System Information.

       -p 1   Set the chassis Power restore policy, governing the desired behavior when power was lost and is restored.  Values: 0 = stay off, 1 = last state, 2 = always on.

       -q string
              Set the Secondary Operating System to this string in the IPMI System Information.

       -s     Show the IPMI Session information also.

       -x     Causes extra debug messages to be displayed.

       -N nodename
              Nodename or IP address of the remote target system.  If a nodename is specified, IPMI LAN interface is used.  Otherwise the local system management interface is used.

       -P/-R rmt_pswd
              Remote password for the nodename given.  The default is a null password.

       -U rmt_user
              Remote username for the nodename given.  The default is a null username.

       -E     Use the remote password from Environment variable IPMI_PASSWORD.

       -F drv_t
              Force the driver type to one of the followng: imb, va, open, gnu, landesk, lan, lan2, lan2i, kcs, smb.  Note that lan2i means lan2 with intelplus.  The default is to detect any available driver
              type and use it.

       -J     Use the specified LanPlus cipher suite (0 thru 17): 0=none/none/none, 1=sha1/none/none, 2=sha1/sha1/none, 3=sha1/sha1/cbc128,  4=sha1/sha1/xrc4_128,  5=sha1/sha1/xrc4_40,  6=md5/none/none,  ...
              14=md5/md5/xrc4_40.  Default is 3.

       -T     Use a specified IPMI LAN Authentication Type: 0=None, 1=MD2, 2=MD5, 4=Straight Password, 5=OEM.

       -V     Use a specified IPMI LAN privilege level. 1=Callback level, 2=User level, 3=Operator level, 4=Administrator level (default), 5=OEM level.

       -Y     Yes, do prompt the user for the IPMI LAN remote password.  Alternatives for the password are -E or -P.
