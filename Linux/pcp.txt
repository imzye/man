NAME
       labels.conf - Performance Co-Pilot labels configuration

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/pcp/labels.conf

DESCRIPTION
       Several  Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) tools and utilities support the use of metric labels.  This functionality applied a hierarchical set of labels to each instance of every metric, as described in
       pmLookupLabels(3).

       The pmcd(1) and pmproxy(1) daemons are particularly important to the labels system, respectively providing the labels in real-time and then discovering recorded (archive) labels and indexing these
       for pmseries(1) queries using a distributed key-value service such as https://valkey.io/.

       The /etc/pcp/labels.conf file is a single point of configuration for behaviour affecting all labels exported by pmcd or through tools using PMAPI  local  context  services.   It  uses  the  common
       ``ini'' file format and any variable it specifies that is not in an explicit square-bracket enclosed section is considered a [global] variable.

       The available configuration variables are as follows :

       machineid_hash=none|sha256
            When specified in the [global] section, controls the manner in which the local machine-id(5) is exported as a label.  The default setting (none) exports a "machineid" context label with value
            reflecting  the  contents  of  the  /etc/machine-id  file, on any platforms that provide this file.  The alternative (sha256) exports a "machineid_sha256" label, instead, and the value is the
            SHA256 (one-way) hash of the file.
