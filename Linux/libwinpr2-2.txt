NAME
       wLog - WinPR logging facility

DESCRIPTION
       wLog is a configurable and flexible logging system used throughout WinPR and FreeRDP.

       The primary concept is to have a hierarchy of loggers that can be be configured independently.

Appenders
       WLog  uses different appenders that define where the log output should be written to. If the application doesn't explicitly configure the appenders the below
       described variable WLOG_APPENDER can be used to choose one appender.

       The following kind of appenders are available:

       Binary Write the log data into a binary format file.

       Console
              The console appender writes to the console. Depending of the operating system the application runs on, the output might be  handled  differently.  For
              example on android log print would be used.

       File   The file appender writes the textual output to a file.

       Udp    This appender sends the logging messages to a pre-defined remote host via UDP.

              If no target is set the default one 127.0.0.1:20000 is used. To receive the log messages one can use netcat. To receive the default target the follow‐
              ing command can be used: nc -u 127.0.0.1 -p 20000 -l

       Syslog Use syslog for outputting the debug messages.

       Journald
              This appender outputs messages to journald.

Levels
       The WLog are complementary, the higher level always includes the lower ones.  The level list below is top down. Top the highest level.

       TRACE  print everything including packets dumps

       DEBUG  debug messages

       INFO   general information

       WARN   warnings

       ERROR  errors

       FATAL  fatal problems

       OFF    completely disable the wlog output

Formats
       The format a logger prints has the following possible options:

       lv     log level

       mn     module name

       fl     file name

       fn     function

       ln     line number

       pid    process id

       tid    thread id

       yr     year

       mo     month

       dw     day of week

       hr     hour

       mi     minute

       se     second

       ml     millisecond

       A maximum of 16 options can be used per format string.

       An example that generally sets the WLOG_PREFIX for xfreerdp would look like: WLOG_PREFIX="pid=%pid:tid=%tid:fn=%fn -" xfreerdp /v:xxx

ENVIRONMENT
       WLOG_APPENDER
              The kind of appender, the accepted values are: CONSOLE, FILE, BINARY, SYSLOG, JOURNALD or UDP

       WLOG_PREFIX
              configure the prefix used for outputting the message (see Format for more details and examples)

       WLOG_LEVEL
              the level to output messages for

       WLOG_FILTER
              sets a filter for WLog messages. Only the filtered messages are printed. The format of the filter is a series of <logger  name>:<level>  separated  by
              comas

              example: WLOG_FILTER=core.channel:DEBUG,dummy:TRACE will display debug messages for the core.channel logger and trace level for the dummy logger

       WLOG_FILEAPPENDER_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH
              When using the file appender it may contains the output log file's path

       WLOG_FILEAPPENDER_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME
              When using the file appender it may contains the output log file's name

       WLOG_JOURNALD_ID
              When using the systemd journal appender, this variable contains the id used with the journal (by default the executable's name)

       WLOG_UDP_TARGET
              target to use for the UDP appender in the format host:port
