NAME
       checkpc - check out the printcap database

SYNOPSIS
       checkpc [ -aflprsV ] [ -Aage[DHMS] ] [ -Ddebugflags ] [ -Pprinter ] [ -t size[kM] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Checkpc is used to check for the existence and correct permissions of entries in the printcap database.  It is useful when installing a new printcap database and cleaning up existing printer spoolers.

       -a     Do not create accounting files (:af).

       -f     The  fix  flag  will  cause the checkpc program create and fix various files and permissions.  It does this in a simple minded manner, and the program may have to be run several times until all
              permissions are correct.  It also reports in extremely verbose details its actions.

       -l     Do not create log files (:lf).

       -p     Print verbose printcap information.  Useful if interested in the printcap values.

       -r     remove junk or job files older than the age set by -A.  You must set the age to a non-zero value otherwise no files are removed.

       -s     Do not create filter status files (:ps).

       -A Age[DHMS]
              Report junk or job files older than age.  The age time can have a suffix days (D) hours (H), minutes (M), or seconds (S); default is days.

       -D debugflags
              Run the program with debugging flags.  See the LPRng HOWTO for details of the flags actions.

       -V     Verbose mode.

       -P printer
              Process only the specified print queue.

       -t size[kM]
              Truncate log files (:lf) to the specified size in Kbytes or Mbytes (default is Mbytes).

       -T serial-line
              set process name and start feature test

ANNOYING FEATURES
       If the -f(fix) option is specified and you do not run this as root, it will complain, but attempt to carry out the operations.  This will lead to a large number of failures reports  if  the  ownership
       and/or permissions are incorrect.

FILES
       The files used by LPRng are set by values in the printer configuration file and by configuration options.  The following are a commonly used set of default values.
       /etc/lprng/lpd.conf                          LPRng configuration file
       ${HOME}/.printcap                            user printer description file
       /etc/printcap                                printer description file
       /etc/lprng/lpd.perms                         permissions
       /var/run/lprng/lpd                           lock file for queue control
       /var/spool/lpd                               spool directories
       /var/spool/lpd/QUEUE/control                 queue control
       /var/spool/lpd/QUEUE/log                     trace or debug log file
       /var/spool/lpd/QUEUE/acct                    accounting file
       /var/spool/lpd/QUEUE/status                  status file

DIAGNOSTICS
       Most of the diagnostics are self explanatory.  If you are puzzled over the exact cause of failure, set the debugging level on (-D5) and run again.

       The debugging information will help you to pinpoint the exact cause of failure.
