NAME
       fookb - Xkb state indicator with optional Window Maker support

SYNOPSIS
       fookb [options]

DESCRIPTION
       fookb  is  a  Xkb  state indicator. It displays the icon corresponding to the number of Xkb locked group. You may use mouse-clicks to change Xkb locked group with mouse. Additionally, fookb can be
       configured to execute a program on changing group.

       fookb man page is based on WMMail.app man page. Program was written from scratch.

       To use fookb with the Window Maker Dock, simply drag the fookb icon to the Window Maker Dock (if fookb was compiled with Window Maker support).

OPTIONS
       NB! Command line parameters take precedence over config file!

       All the icons should be of the same size or fookb will refuse to run.
              fookb will warn you if you use icons of size more than 64x64, but it will try to run anyway.

              Icon to show for the 1st Xkb group

       --icon2
              Icon to show for the 2nd Xkb group

       --icon3
              Icon to show for the 3rd Xkb group

       --icon4
              Icon to show for the 4th Xkb group

       --iconboom
              Icon to show when Xkb system goes crazy

       -d,--display
              X display to use (normally not needed)

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file consist of a single PropList dictionary, which in turn is composed of several PropList key-value pairs. The recognized keys is:

       Icon1 Filename (mandatory)
              XPM file contains an icon for 1st XKB group.

       Icon2 Filename (mandatory)
              XPM file contains an icon for 2nd XKB group.

       Icon3 Filename (mandatory)
              XPM file contains an icon for 3rd XKB group.

       Icon4 Filename (mandatory)
              XPM file contains an icon for 4th XKB group.

       IconBoom Filename (mandatory)
              XPM file contains an icon for "broken Xkb". Please look in BUGS section.

       Sound (Yes|No)
              fookb will run command from "Command" value (see below), if this parameter is set to "Yes". You'll receive (non-fatal) error message if this parameter is not defined. In any other case com‐
              mand will not be run.

       Command command_to_run
              This command will be run if XKB locked group is changed and "Sound" is set to "Yes".

EXAMPLES
       Here is an example of configuration file.

       {
         Icon1 = "/usr/local/share/fookb/icon1.xpm";
         Icon2 = "/usr/local/share/fookb/icon2.xpm";
         Icon3 = "/usr/local/share/fookb/icon3.xpm";
         Icon4 = "/usr/local/share/fookb/icon4.xpm";
         IconBoom = "/usr/local/share/fookb/crash.xpm";
         Sound = "Yes";
         Command = "/usr/bin/play /usr/local/share/fookb/click.au";
       }

FILES
       ~/.fookb
              fookb defaults

BUGS
       Sometimes fookb receives message about changing XKB group, but message.state.group does not point to any existing XKB group. In this case fookb will show IconBoom (from config file) picture.

       As far as I know the only way to look at this bug is to run vmware.

VERSION
       This man page is [hopefully] up-to-date for version 4.1 of fookb.
