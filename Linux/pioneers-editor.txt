NAME
       pioneers-editor - Editor for the Pioneers boardgame

SYNOPSIS
       pioneers-editor [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pioneers-editor command.

       Pioneers is an implementation of the popular, award-winning "Settlers of Catan" board game for the GNOME desktop environment.  It uses a client/server model for networked play of between two and eight
       players.  You will need to connect to a machine running either pioneers-server-gtk or pioneers-server-console to play.  An AI client, pioneersai, is also available.

       Pioneers-editor can be used to create new board layouts.  Clicking on the plus and minus signs on the side of the board will increase and decrease the board size respectively.  Left clicking on a tile
       allows one to select the terrain type; Middle or right clicking allows one to set the chit number or port type and orientation.  The chit number can also be set by pressing the number key(s) while the
       pointer is hovering over the tile.

       In the settings tab, several game settings can be adjusted.

PLAYING
       Games created with pioneers-editor can be played with pioneers-server-gtk and pioneers-server-console, if they are installed in the global game directory.  Alternatively, they can be played with  pio‐
       neers-server-console, by using the --file option.

OPTIONS
       Pioneers-editor accepts the standard GTK+/GNOME commandline options.  See pioneers-editor --help for details.

FILES
       /usr/share/games/pioneers/*.game
              Global game files.  Games which are installed here can be selected by title, and played from pioneers-server-gtk.
