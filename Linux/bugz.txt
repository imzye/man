NAME
       pybugz.d - configuration files for pybugz

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/share/pybugz.d/*.conf

       /etc/pybugz.d/*.conf

       ~/.bugzrc

DESCRIPTION
       When started, bugz reads configuration files from all of the locations listed above, in the order listed. In the directories, it reads the files in lexical order.

       Files located in /usr/share/pybugz.d/*.conf are provided by pybugz and should not be modified.

       Files located in /etc/pybugz.d/*.conf, if it exists, are provided by the system administrator.

       The  final  file  that is read, if it exists, is ~/.bugzrc by default. This is the user-specific configuration file. This file name can be overridden on the command line by using the --config-file
       option.

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       A configuration file consists of sections which define parameters for the Bugzillas you intend to use. Each section starts with a case-sensitive section name in square brackets and is followed  by
       the settings, in the form "key = value" or "key : value", which define the parameters for this bugzilla instance.

       The section name is  also the name that should be used with the --connection option of the bugz command or the "connection" setting in the default section of the configuration file.

       The  section named [default] is special. Any settings defined in this section will have the value they are given here in all other sections unless they are overridden. So, for example, if you want
       to use the same username for most of your bugzillas, define user in the default section.

       Comments are also allowed. A comment must begin with "#" or ";" and be on a line of its own.

CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
       This is a list of the current settings supported by pybugz.

       connection = sectionname

       This is used in the default section to define the bugzilla you connect with most of the time. It is not an error to put it in another section, but it does not make much sense to do so.

       base = http://my.project.com/bugzilla/xmlrpc.cgi

       base = http://myhttpname:myhttppasswd@my.project.com/bugzilla/xmlrpc.cgi

       This is the base URL of the bugzilla. It must point to the xmlrpc.cgi script on the bugzilla installation. The second form is used if you need to encode a username and password into  the  URL  for
       basic http authentication.

       user = myname@my.project.com

       password = secret2

       These  set  your  username  and  password  for  this  bugzilla. If you do not provide one or both of these and you do not use the key setting below, you will be prompted for the setting you do not
       provide.

       passwordcmd = gpg --decrypt ~/.my-encrypted-password.gpg

       As another alternative for storing your password, you can provide a password command. This command will be run, and pybugz expects it to output the password to stdout. The example above  uses  gpg
       to decrypt an encrypted password stored in a file. The default setting is undefined, so it will not be used unless you define it.

       key = string

       This  is  your API key, which is an alternative way to authenticate for Bugzilla 5.0 and newer.  To use this, you must generate an API key in the preferences section of Bugzilla and set it to that
       value. This overrides the username and password settings. The default is undefined.

       columns = 80

       This is the number of columns your terminal can display. Most of the time, pybugz should be able to determine this value. If it cannot, the default value is 80, so more than likely you will  never
       have to change this setting.

       debug = 0

       This sets the level of debug logging. This is mostly used for development purposes. It causes PyBugz to print out debugging information as it runs.

       quiet = False

       If set to true, this requests that pybugz run in quiet mode. This means only output returned from the Bugzilla will be displayed; several more verbose log messages will not be displayed.

       product = string

       This  is  the  default  setting for the product field in bugs in this Bugzilla instance. It is possible to define this in the default section.  However, it does not make sense to do so most of the
       time. If this is set, you will not be prompted for a product when you run bugz post, and this value will also be the default for bugz search.

       component = string

       This is the default setting for the component field in bugs in this Bugzilla instance. It is possible to define this in the default section.  However, it does not make sense to do so most  of  the
       time. If this is set, you will not be prompted for a component when you run bugz post, and this will also be the default value for bugz search.

       search_statuses = confirmed, in_progress, unconfirmed

       This sets the default statuses to be used in a search command. It is a space separated list of Bugzilla statuses.

       insecure = true | false

       If this is set to true, pybugz will not validate the ssl certificate used during an https connection to this site. Do not use this setting unless you know exactly what you are doing.

       interactive = true | false

       If  this  is  set  to true, pybugz will prompt for a username and password for the bugzilla you are attempting to connect to if no credentials are specified in the configuration file.  The default
       setting is false.
