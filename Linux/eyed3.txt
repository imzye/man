NAME
       eyeD3 - displays and manipulates id3-tags on mp3 files

SYNOPSIS
       eyeD3 [options] PATH [PATH...]

DESCRIPTION
       eyeD3  Manipulates  ID3 tags in mp3 files and is able to read/write and convert between ID3 v1.0, v1.1, v2.3 and v2.4 tags.  High-level access is provided to most frames, including APIC (i.e., im‐
       ages) frames.

       The eyeD3 command line interface is based on plugins that operates on files.  To list the available plugins use the --plugins option and to select a plugin pass its name using --plugin=NAME.

       The PATH argument(s) along with optional usage of --exclude are used to tell eyeD3 what files or directories to process. Directories are searched recursively and every file encountered  is  passed
       to the selected plugin until no more files are found.

BASE OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show a brief help string and exit.

       --version
              Display version information and exit

       --exclude=PATTERN
              A regular expression for path exclusion. May be specified multiple times.

       -L, --plugins
              List all available plugins.

       -P NAME, --plugin=NAME
              Specify which plugin to use. The default is ´classic'

       -C FILE, --config=FILE
              Supply a configuration file.  The default is ´~/.eyeD3/config.ini', although even that is optional.

       --no-config
              Do not load the default user config ´~/.eyeD3/config.ini'.  The -c/--config options are still honored if present.

       --backup
              Plugins should honor this option such that a backup is made of any file modified. The backup is made in same directory with a ´.orig' extension added.

       -Q, --quiet
              A hint to plugins to output less.

       --fs-encoding=ENCODING
              Use the specified file system encoding for filenames.  Default is detected from the current locale, overriding is useful for example when reading from mounted file systems.

       --no-color
              Suppress color codes in console output. This will happen automatically if the output is not a TTY (e.g.  when redirecting to a file)

DEBUGGING
       -l LEVEL[:LOGGER], --log-level=LEVEL[:LOGGER]
              Set  a log level. This option may be specified multiple times.  If a logger name is specified than the level applies only to that logger, otherwise the level is set on the top-level logger.
              Acceptable levels are ´debug', ´verbose', ´info', ´warning', ´error', ´critical'.

       --profiler
              Run using python profiler.

       --debugger
              Drop into python debugger when errors occur.

`CLASSIC` PLUGIN
       This plugin is the classic eyeD3 interface for viewing and editing tags.

       All PATH arguments are parsed and displayed. Directory paths are searched recursively. Any editing options (--artist, --title) are applied to each file read.

       All date options (--release-year excepted) follow ISO 8601 format. This is ´yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss'. The year is required, and each component thereafter is optional. For example, "2012-03" is  valid,
       "2012--12" is not.

       -a STRING, --artist=STRING
              Set the artist name.

       -A STRING, --album=STRING
              Set the album name.

       -b STRING, --album-artist=STRING
              Set the album artist name. "Various Artists", for example. Another example is collaborations when the track artist might be "Eminem featuring Proof" the album artist would be "Eminem".

       -t STRING, --title=STRING
              Set the track title.

       -n NUM, --track=NUM
              Set the track number. Use 0 to clear.

              Set total number of tracks. Use 0 to clear.

       --track-offset=N
              Increment/decrement the track number by [-]N. This option is applied after --track=N is set.

       -d NUM, --disc-num=NUM
              Set the disc number. Use 0 to clear.

       -G GENRE, --genre=GENRE
              Set the genre. If the argument is a standard ID3 genre name or number both will be set. Otherwise, any string can be used. Use --plugin=genres for a list of standard ID3 genre names/ids.

       -Y YEAR, --release-year=YEAR
              Set the year the track was released. Use the date options for more precise values or dates other than release.

       -c STRING, --comment=STRING
              Set a comment. In ID3 tags this is the comment with an empty description. See --add-comment to add multiple comment frames.

       --rename=PATTERN

OTHER PLUGINS
       Execution of a plugin other than ´classic' is possible through the --plugin option.

   art
       This plugin manages art files and tags for albums, artists, etc...

       Options --update-files and --update-tags are mutually exclusive.

       --update-files
              Write art files from tag images.

       --update-tags
              Write tag image from art files.

   fixup
       Performs various checks and fixes to directories of audio files.

       Operates  on  directories  at  a time, fixing each as a unit (album, compilation, live set, etc.). All of these should have common dates, for example but other characteristics may vary. The --type
       should be used whenever possible, ´lp' is the default.

       The following tests and fixes always apply:

         1.  Every file will be given an ID3 tag if one is missing.
         2.  Set ID3 v2.4.
         3.  Set a consistent album name for all files in the directory.
         4.  Set a consistent artist name for all files, unless the type is ´various' in which case the artist may vary  (but must exist).
         5.  Ensure each file has a title.
         6.  Ensure each file has a track # and track total.
         7.  Ensure all files have a release and original release date, unless the type is ´live' in which case the recording date is set.
         8.  All ID3 frames of the following types are removed: USER, PRIV
         9.  All ID3 files have TLEN (track length in ms) set (or updated).
         10. The album/dir type is set in the tag. Types of ´lp' and ´various' do not have this field set since the latter is the default and the former can be determined during sync. In  ID3  terms  the
             value is in TXXX (description: ´eyeD3#album_type').
         11. Files are renamed as follows:
             •  Type ´various': ${track:num} - ${artist} - ${title}
             •  Type ´single': ${artist} - ${title}
             •  All other types: ${artist} - ${track:num} - ${title}
             •  A rename template can be supplied in --file-rename-pattern
         12. Directories are renamed as follows:
             •  Type ´live': ${best_date:prefer_recording} - ${album}
             •  All other types: ${best_date:prefer_release} - ${album}
             •  A rename template can be supplied in --dir-rename-pattern

       Album types

         • ´lp': A traditinal "album" of songs from a single artist.  No extra info is written to the tag since this is the default.
         • ´ep': A short collection of songs from a single artist. The string "ep" is written to the tag's ´eyeD3#album_type' field.
         • ´various': A collection of songs from different artists. The string "various" is written to the tag's ´eyeD3#album_type' field.
         • ´live': A collection of live recordings from a single artist. The string "live" is written to the tag's ´eyeD3#album_type' field.
         • ´compilation':  A  collection  of  songs  from various recordings by a single artist. The string "compilation'"is written to the tag's ´eyeD3#album_type' field. Compilation dates, unlike other
           types, may differ.
         • ´demo': A demo recording by a single artist. The string "demo" is written to the tag's ´eyeD3#album_type' field.
         • ´single': A track that should no be associated with an album (even if it has album metadata). The string "single" is written to the tag's ´eyeD3#album_type' field.

       -t TYPE, --type TYPE
              One of the album types. How to treat each directory. The default is "lp" although you may be prompted for an alternate choice if the files look like another type.

       --fix-case
              Fix casing on each string field by capitalizing each word.

       -n, --dry-run
              Only print the operations that would take place, but do not execute them.

       --no-prompt
              Exit if prompted.

       --dotted-dates
              Separate date with ´.' instead of ´-' when naming directories.

       --file-rename-pattern FILE_RENAME_PATTERN
              Rename file (the extension is not affected) based on data in the tag using substitution variables: $album, $album_artist, $artist, $best_date,  $best_date:prefer_recording,  $best_date:pre‐
              fer_recording:year,   $best_date:prefer_release,   $best_date:prefer_release:year,   $best_date:year,   $disc:num,   $disc:total,  $file,  $file:ext,  $original_release_date,  $original_re‐
              lease_date:year, $recording_date, $recording_date:year, $release_date, $release_date:year, $title, $track:num, $track:total

       --dir-rename-pattern DIR_RENAME_PATTERN
              Rename directory based on data in the tag using substitution variables.  Available substitution are the same as in --file-rename-pattern

   genres
       Display the full list of standard ID3 genres.

       ID3 v1 defined a list of genres and mapped them to to numeric values so they can be stored as a single byte. It is recommended that these genres are used although most  newer  software  (including
       eyeD3) does not care.

   itunes-podcast
       Adds (or removes) the tags necessary for Apple iTunes to identify the file as a podcast.

       --add  Add the podcast frames.

       --remove
              Remove the podcast frames.

   lameinfo
       Outputs lame header (if one exists) for file.  The ´lame' (or xing) header provides extra information about the mp3 that is useful to players and encoders but not officially part of the mp3 speci‐
       fication. Variable bit rate mp3s, for example, use this header.

       For more details see <http://gabriel.mp3-tech.org/mp3infotag.html>.

       ´xing' is an alias for this plugin.

   nfo
       Create NFO files for each directory scanned.  Each directory scanned is treated as an album and a NFO (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.nfo>) file is written to standard out.

       NFO files are often found in music archives.

   stats
       Computes statistics for all audio files scanned.

       --verbose
              Show details for each file with rule violations.

   xep-118
       Outputs all tags in XEP-118 XML format.

       See: <http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0118.html>

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Command  line  options  can be read from a configuration file using the -C/--config option. It expects a path to an Ini (<http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html>) file contain sections
       with option values. For a sample config file see /usr/share/doc/eyeD3/examples/config.ini.

       If the file ´${HOME}/.eyeD3/config.ini' exists it is loaded each time eyeD3 is run and the values take effect. This can be disabled with ´--no-config'.
