NAME
       MSI2LMP - Converter for Materials Studio files to LAMMPS

SYNOPSIS
       msi2lmp <ROOTNAME> [-class <I|1|II|2|O|0>] [-frc <path to frc file>] [-print #] [-ignore] [-nocenter] [-oldstyle] [-shift <x> <y> <z>]

DESCRIPTION
       MSI2LMP  is  a  tool bundled with LAMMPS to aide in the conversion of simulation inputs from Biovia's Materials Studio software for use with LAMMPS.  It is a standalone program that generates a LAMMPS
       data file based on the information in an MS .car file (atom coordinates), an .mdf file (molecular topology and atom types) and an .frc (forcefield parameters) file.  The .car and .mdf files  are  spe‐
       cific to a molecular system while the .frc file is specific to a forcefield (variant).  The only coherency needed between .frc and .car/.mdf files are the atom types.

OPTIONS
       <ROOTNAME>
              This  has  to  be  the first argument and is a mandatory argument. It defines the root of the file names; i.e. for a <ROOTNAME> of benzene, you have to provide the files 'benzene.car' and 'ben‐
              zene.mdf' in the current working directory.  msi2lmp will then read and process those files according to its remaining settings.  All other settings are optional and have defaults as listed.

       -c <I,1,II,2,O,0>, -class <I,1,II,2,O,0>
              The -c or -class option selects the force field class, i.e which pair styles and bond styles and so on are required in the LAMMPS input file.  Class I or class 1  uses  similar  combination  of
              functional  forms  as  Amber and Charmm force field and support the force fields cvff and clayff.  Class II or class 2 corresponds to the more complex force fields COMPASS and pcff.  Class O or
              class 0 finally is an experimental and incomplete extension and supports generating output for OPLS-AA

       -f <ffname>, -frc <ffname>
              The -c or -frc option allows the selection of the force field parameter file Valid names for <ffname> with this distribution are: cvff, clayff, cvff_aug,  pcff,  compass_published,  cff91,  and
              oplsaa.  If  the argument is a pathname, i.e. it starts with a '.' or a '/', then this absolute path is used to read the force field, otherwise msi2lmp will look in the folder pointed to by the
              environment variable $MSI2LMP_LIBRARY. If the variable is not set, then it will look in the current directory. The extension '.frc' is appended, if missing.  Default is to look for the cvff.frc
              force field file.

       -p <loglevel>, -print <loglevel>,
              Selects the amount of information messages about the progress of the conversion printed to the screen.  <loglevel> can be a number from 0 (silent except for errors) to 3 (very detailed).

       -i, -ignore,
              Ignore  errors about missing parameters and use 0.0 for the respective force constants making these no-ops. Is correct to be used for a few molecules and settings, but often an indication, that
              either the atom type assignment have errors, or the force field file is missing entries.

       -n, -nocenter,
              Do not center the box around the (geometrical) center of the atoms, but around the origin. Default is to recenter.

       -o, -oldstyle,
              Write out a data file without style hint comments to be compatible with old LAMMPS versions. Default is to write out those comments.

       -s <x> <y> <z>, -shift <x> <y> <z>,
              Shift the entire system (box and coordinates) by a vector (default: 0.0 0.0 0.0).

       EXAMPLES

              msi2lmp benzene -c 2 -p 1 -f ../frc_files/pcff.frc

              msi2lmp benzene-class1 -c I

              msi2lmp decane -c 0 -f oplsaa
