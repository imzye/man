NAME
       Net::Dropbox::API - A dropbox API interface

VERSION
       Version 1.9.8

SYNOPSIS
       The Dropbox API is a OAuth based API. I try to abstract as much away as possible so you should not need to know too much about it.  This is how it works:

           use Net::Dropbox::API;

           my $box = Net::Dropbox::API->new({key => 'KEY', secret => 'SECRET'});
           my $login_link = $box->login;  # user needs to click this link and login
           $box->auth;                    # oauth keys get exchanged
           my $info = $box->account_info; # and here we have our account info

       See the examples for a working Mojolicious web client using the Dropbox API.

       You can find Dropbox's API documentation at <https://www.dropbox.com/developers/web_docs>

FUNCTIONS
   login
       This sets up the initial OAuth handshake and returns the login URL. This URL has to be clicked by the user and the user then has to accept the application in dropbox.

       Dropbox then redirects back to the callback URL defined with "$self->callback_url". If the user already accepted the application the redirect may happen without the user actually clicking
       anywhere.

   auth
       The auth method changes the initial request token into access token that we need for subsequent access to the API. This method only has to be called once after login.

   account_info
       account_info polls the users info from dropbox.

   list
       lists all files in the path defined:

           $data = $box->list();           # top-level
           $data = $box->list( "/Photos" ); # folder

       The data returned is a ref to a hash containing various fields returned by Dropbox, including a "hash" value, which can be used later to check if Dropbox data beneath a specified folder has
       changed since the last call.

       For this, list() accepts an optional 'hash' argument:

           $data = $box->list({ hash => "ce9ccbfb8f255f234c93adcfef33b5a6" },
                              "/Photos");

       This will either return

           { http_response_code => 304 }

       in which case nothing has changed since the last call, or

           { http_response_code => 200,
             # ... various other fields
           }

       if there were modifications.

   copy
       copies a folder
           copy($from, $to)

   move
       move a folder
           move($from, $to)

   mkdir
       creates a folder
           mkdir($path)

   delete
       delete a folder
           delete($path)

   view
       creates a cookie protected link for the user to look at.
           view($path)

   metadata
       creates a cookie protected link for the user to look at.
           metadata($path)

   putfile
       uploads a file to dropbox

   getfile
       get a file from dropbox

   debug
       Set this to a non-false value in order to print some debugging information to STDOUT.
           debug(1)

INTERNAL API
   _talk
       _talk handles the access to the restricted resources. You should normally not need to access this directly.

   nonce
       Generate a different nonce for every request.
