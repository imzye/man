NAME
       SCAP-Security-Guide - Delivers security guidance, baselines, and associated validation mechanisms utilizing the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).

DESCRIPTION
       The project provides practical security hardening advice and also links it to compliance requirements in order to ease deployment activities, such as certification and accreditation. These include
       requirements  in  the  U.S.  government  (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence Community) as well as of the financial services and health care industries. For example, high-level and widely-accepted
       policies such as NIST 800-53 provides prose stating that System Administrators must audit "privileged user actions," but do not define what "privileged actions" are. The SSG bridges  the  gap  be‐
       tween generalized policy requirements and specific implementation guidance, in SCAP formats to support automation whenever possible.

              This profile contains configuration checks that align to the DISA STIG with GUI for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 V2R4.

              In addition to being applicable to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, this configuration baseline is applicable to the operating system tier of Red Hat technologies that are based on Red  Hat  En‐
              terprise Linux 8, such as:

              -  Red  Hat  Enterprise  Linux  Server - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation and Desktop - Red Hat Enterprise Linux for HPC - Red Hat Storage - Red Hat Containers with a Red Hat Enterprise
              Linux 8 image

              Warning: The installation and use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) increases your attack vector and decreases your overall security posture. If your Information Systems Security  Officer
              (ISSO) lacks a documented operational requirement for a graphical user interface, please consider using the standard DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 profile.

              (i) a basic security requirements section; (ii) a derived security requirements section.

              The basic security requirements are obtained from FIPS Publication 200, which provides the high-level and fundamental security requirements for federal information and information  systems.
              The derived security requirements, which supplement the basic security requirements, are taken from the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53.
