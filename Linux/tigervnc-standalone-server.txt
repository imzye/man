NAME
       tigervncsession - start a VNC server

SYNOPSIS
       tigervncsession [-D] <username> <:display#>

DESCRIPTION
       tigervncsession  is  used to start a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) desktop.  tigervncsession performs all the necessary steps to create a new user session, run Xtigervnc with appropriate options
       and starts a window manager on the VNC desktop.

       tigervncsession is rarely called directly and is normally started by the system service manager.

-D OPTION
       tigervncsession by default forks and detaches. If the -D option is used, it does not fork and detach. This option is provided for use with system service managers that require services to  run  in
       the foreground. This option is not intended for debugging in a login shell from a terminal or for running tigervncsession from a terminal as an ordinary user.

FILES
       Several VNC-related files are found in the directory $HOME/.config/tigervnc:

       /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults
              The  optional  system-wide  equivalent  of $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.pl.  If this file exists and defines options to be passed to Xtigervnc, they will be used as defaults for users. The
              user's $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.pl overrides settings configured in this file. The overall configuration file load order  is:  this  file,  $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.pl,  and  then
              /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory.  None are required to exist.

       /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory
              The  optional  system-wide equivalent of $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.pl.  If this file exists and defines options to be passed to Xtigervnc, they will override any of the same options de‐
              fined in a user's $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.pl.  This file offers a mechanism to establish some basic form of system-wide policy.  WARNING! There is nothing  stopping  users  from  con‐
              structing  their own tigervncsession-like script that calls Xtigervnc directly to bypass any options defined in /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory. The overall configuration file load
              order is: /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults, $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.pl, and then this file. None are required to exist.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tigervnc/config.pl
       $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config.pl
              An optional server config file wherein options to be passed to Xtigervnc are listed to avoid hard-coding them to the physical invocation. This file uses perl(1) syntax. The  special  option
              session  can  be  used  to  control which session type will be started. This should match one of the files in /usr/share/xsessions. E.g., if there is a file called gnome.desktop, then $ses‐
              sion="gnome"; would use that session type.

              To be compatible with the upstream provided wrapper scripts, we will fall back to trying to load configuration from $HOME/.config/tigervnc/config if config.pl is  not  present.  The  config
              file  lists  options  one per line. For those requiring an argument, simply separate the option from the argument with an equal sign, for example: "geometry=2000x1200" or "securitytypes=Vn‐
              cAuth,TLSVnc". Options without an argument are simply listed as a single word, for example: "localhost" or "alwaysshared".

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tigervnc/passwd
       $HOME/.config/tigervnc/passwd
              The VNC password file.

       $XDG_STATE_HOME/tigervnc/Bhost:Bdisplay#.log
       $HOME/.local/state/tigervnc/Bhost:Bdisplay#.log
              The log file for Xtigervnc and the session.
