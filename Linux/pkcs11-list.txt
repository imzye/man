NAME
       pkcs11-list - list PKCS#11 objects

       pkcs11-list [-P] [-m module] [-s slot] [-i ID ] [-l label] [-p PIN]

DESCRIPTION
       pkcs11-list  lists the PKCS#11 objects with ID or label or, by default,
       all objects. The object class, label, and  ID  are  displayed  for  all
       keys.  For private or secret keys, the extractability attribute is also
       displayed, as either true, false, or never.

OPTIONS
       -P     This option lists only the public objects. (Note  that  on  some
              PKCS#11 devices, all objects are private.)

       -m module
              This  option specifies the PKCS#11 provider module. This must be
              the full path  to  a  shared  library  object  implementing  the
              PKCS#11 API for the device.

       -s slot
              This  option  opens the session with the given PKCS#11 slot. The
              default is slot 0.

       -i ID  This option lists only key objects with the given object ID.

       -l label
              This option lists only key objects with the given label.

       -p PIN This option specifies the PIN for the device. If no PIN is  pro‐
              vided on the command line, pkcs11-list prompts for it.
