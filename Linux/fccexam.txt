NAME fccexam - Study guide for USA FCC commercial radio license examinations.
SYNOPSIS
       fccexam [option]

DESCRIPTION
       fccexam  presents  questions  in  random  order from the selected question pool, and terminates when all questions have been answered correctly. The session may be interrupted with ^C, and resumed
       later.

       Some questions refer to figures. The figures for the selected question pool are displayed in a separate window using $HTML_VIEWER, if it is executable. If $HTML_VIEWER  is  undefined,  xdg-open(1)
       will be used to choose the default browser. If $HTML_VIEWER is not an executable command (e.g. ""), then questions which refer to figures will be noted and skipped.

       Licenses  are issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but examinations are administered by COLEM examiners. See http://wireless.fcc.gov/commoperators/index.htm?job=home for informa‐
       tion regarding USA commercial radio licenses.
