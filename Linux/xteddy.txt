NAME
       xteddy - cuddly teddy bear for your X Windows desktop.

SYNOPSIS
       xteddy [ -wm -float -noquit -nocursor -F<file> ]
       [ -geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y -display SERVER ]
       [ -h --help -v ]

DESCRIPTION
       Xteddy is a cuddly teddy bear for your X Windows desktop.

       Normally,  xteddy just sits around doing nothing. After all, that's what teddy bears are for. Look at him, talk to him, place heavy windows on top of him, zap him around until he becomes dizzy, do
       what you like; he will always be your true (albeit virtual) friend.

       You can move xteddy with the mouse by pointing at him and dragging him around. When clicked upon, he will pop up on top of all other windows. If you type "q" or "Esc" on him, he will exit (or,  as
       I like to think of it, be tucked away in the file system until you need him next time).

       That's it. But he's cute.

OPTIONS
       -wm    Use  the window manager. Normally, xteddy sets the override_redirect flag for his window, which will cause most window managers to ignore him. However, some window managers might have prob‐
              lems coping with a window that is nailed directly to the root.  In that case, use this option. If possible, instruct your window manager not to put any title bar or window frame on the win‐
              dow, or xteddy will lose some of his charm.

       -float Float up on top of overlapping windows. This will make xteddy stay in sight at all times, so you won't lose him. However, this is a bit intrusive and quite unlike a real teddy bear,  so  it
              is not the default action.

       -noquit
              Disable the "quit" command (do not quit when typing "q" in the window, but of course still on explicit window kills or process kills).  This might seem an unnecessary option, but if you use
              the  -wm  option Xteddy might keep receiving keyboard events even after the mouse has left his window. I you use the -wm option in conjunction with a click-to-type window manager, you would
              probably want to include this option.

       -nocursor
              Disable the X11 cursor over the xteddy window.

       -F,-f  < file > Display another image instead of xteddy.  file can be the full name of an image file which reasonably should contain a transparent background.  If there is no such file in the cur‐
              rent working directory xteddy searches in $(installation_prefix)/share/xteddy, where $(installation_prefix) is determined at compile time (for instance /usr/X11R6).  If this  fails  by  de‐
              fault  /usr/share/xteddy is searched.  Failing this, /usr/local/share/xteddy is searched.  If there is no such file in these directories the following appendixes where appended to the given
              name: xpm, png, tif, jpg, jpeg, gif and pnm.  These files will be searched in the three directories.  If all files the last try is to append the extensions in upper cases. '-F' and '-f' are
              equivalent, and the space in '-f <file>' is optional.

       If no `-F` parameter is given file equals to xteddy or more precisely to the name of the calling program.  For instance if there is a symlink

              ln -s xteddy xpenguin

       then file equals to xpenguin and the appropriate pixmaps with the name xpenguin are searched for.

       -geometry
              The standard X geometry specification. Only X and Y position requests are honored. Any height and width specifications will be ignored.

       -display
              Specify an X server other than the local display.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -v     Print the version number and exit.

BUGS
       The Desktop Manager in Sun CDE (Common Desktop Environment) does not like xteddy. Xteddy by default does not use the window manager, and so he shows up as a sticky window on all desktops.  If  you
       don't  like this, and try to circumvent it by running him with the -wm option, move him by grabbing him by the tummy instead of by the title bar, and then move him partly off the screen, the image
       is lost and never redrawn again, so all you see is a silhouette of a teddy bear.  I have no idea why this happens. If you know, please tell me, and if you can fix it, please do. If you run CDE  on
       other platforms than Sun, please tell me if it works for you. CDE does something which xteddy does not handle properly, and since I have a Sun with CDE myself I would like to know what the problem
       is.

       For most X servers, the -float option does not work properly if xteddy is moved partially off the screen. This is the X server's fault, not mine.

       If  two  copies  of  xteddy are placed so they overlap, and both were run with the -float option, the X server will try to put each on top of the other in an endless loop, which looks very bad and
       takes a lot of CPU power.

       Xteddy does not make use of the X resource database. I just didn't get around to that.
