NAME
       darkplaces - an engine for iD software's Quake and related games

SYNOPSIS
       darkplaces [ -options ] [ +set cvar value ] [ +console commands ]

DESCRIPTION
       DarkPlaces is an OpenGL-only engine for Quake and related games, with greatly enhanced effects and lighting and many features for mods.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the Quake convention, with long options starting with a single dash (`-').  Options include:

       -basedir
              Specify the location of the game data files. The default is the current directory, which is not usually useful.

       -dedicated
              Run as a dedicated server, without the GUI. Alternatively, you can run darkplaces-server if installed.

       -game  Start the game using the files from a mission pack or a mod.

       -hipnotic
              Start the game with the Hipnotic mission pack.

       -rogue Start the game with the Rogue mission pack.

       -nexuiz
              Expect the basedir to contain the standalone game Nexuiz, instead of Quake.

       Various other mods and standalone games are supported, see /usr/share/doc/darkplaces/README.Debian.
