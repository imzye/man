NAME
       autodir - manage home directories

SYNOPSIS
       autodir [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       autodir is a command to organize home directories, usually for user accounts from a centralized database like LDAP, SQL, NIS, etc... It also has transparent backup features.

OPTIONS
       -d DIR Specifies the virtual base directory; the mount point for the autofs filesystem. If DIR does not exist, it will be created. An absolute path is expected for this option.

       -t SECONDS
              Expiration timeout for virtual directories. If a directory is inactive for SECONDS, it will be unmounted.

       -m MODULE
              Module to be used with autodir. The full path to MODULE is expected.

       -n     Do not kill the backup process and wait for it to finish.

       -N     Do not kill the backup process, but do NOT wait for it to finish.

       -o SUBOPTS
              All options SUBOPTS are passed to the module. This option passing syntax is similar to that of the mount command with its -o option. See specific module's documentation for more info.

       -f     q Run in the foreground and log all messages to the console. For debugging purpose and to see how autodir works.

       -l FILE
              Full path to a file in which autodir will write its process id.

       -h     Display help about autodir options.

       -v     Display version information.

       -V     Use verbose logging.

       -b PROG
              This option is to specify the program to use for backups, as well as options for it. The path to PROG should be absolute.

       -w SECONDS
              Whenever  a virtual directory is not used for a period of time, it is assumed inactive and is unmounted. Then, a backup is immediately started. With this option, you can specify to wait SECONDS
              before the backup starts. If this option is absent, the backup will start immediately.

       -p NUMBER
              Backup process priority. This value is from 1-40, with 1 being highest priority and 40 being lowest. The default value is 30.

       -c NUMBER
              This restricts the number of backup processes to NUMBER at any given time. The default value is 150.  # manpage written on Nov. 24, 2010 by Timmy
