NAME
       http-relay - Relay HTTP requests from local host to a remote host.

DESCRIPTION
       usage: http-relay [-h] [-n NUM_THREADS] [-b BUFFER_SIZE] [-t SIGKILL_TIMEOUT]

              [-s] host [port] [local_port] [local_addr]

       Relay HTTP requests from localhost to a remote host (act as reverse HTTP proxy).

   positional arguments:
       host   The remote host to connect to (e.g. "cvut.cz")

       port   The remote host's port to connect to (e.g. 80).

       local_port
              The local port to be used for the relay. If left out, will be the same as remote port.

       local_addr
              Local interface (IP or hostname) to run the relay on.  By default, it runs on all IPv4 interfaces (0.0.0.0).

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -n NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
              Number of threads servicing the incoming requests.

       -b BUFFER_SIZE, --buffer-size BUFFER_SIZE
              Size of the buffer used for reading responses.  Generally, a larger buffer should be more efficient, but if it is too large, the local clients may time out before they receive any data.

       -t SIGKILL_TIMEOUT, --sigkill-timeout SIGKILL_TIMEOUT
              If specified, the relay will be sigkilled in this number of seconds.

       -s, --sigkill-on-stream-stop
              If  True, --sigkill-timeout will not be counted when no requests are active, and during requests, each successful data transmission will reset the timeout.  This can be used to detect stale
              streams if you expect an application to be constantly receiving data.
