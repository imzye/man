NAME
       mori-4d.x - manual page for mori-4d.x 2.11

SYNOPSIS
       mori-4d.x [-<Option-string>] [in-file [out-file]]

DESCRIPTION
       This is ``mori.x'':  star triangulations of a polytope P* in N

       Mori cone of the corresponding toric ambient spaces
              intersection rings of embedded (CY) hypersurfaces

   Options (concatenate any number of them into <Option-string>):
       -h     print this information

       -f     use as filter

       -g     general output: triangulation and Stanley-Reisner ideal

       -I     incidence information of the facets (ignoring IPs of facets)

       -m     Mori generators of the ambient space

       -P     IP-simplices among points of P* (ignoring IPs of facets)

       -K     points of P* in Kreuzer polynomial form

       -b     arithmetic genera and Euler number

       -i     intersection ring

       -c     Chern classes of the (CY) hypersurface

       -t     triple intersection numbers

       -d     topological information on toric divisors & del Pezzo conditions

       -a     all of the above except h, f, I and K

       -D     lattice polytope points of P* as input (default CWS)

       -H     arbitrary (also non-CY) hypersurface `H = c1*D1 + c2*D2 + ...'  input: coefficients `c1 c2 ...'

       -M     manual input of triangulation

       Input: 1) standard: degrees and weights `d1 w11 w12 ... d2 w21 w22 ...'

       2) alternative (use -D): `d np' or `np d' (d=Dimension, np=#[points])
