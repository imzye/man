OPTIONS
       FILE...  Files to open.

       --line num
              After opening a file, the cursor will be placed at the beginning of the specified line. If more than one filename is provided, the last file will be used.

       --master
              The file will be defined as the master document. If more than one filename is provided, the last file will become the master document.

       --page num
              This option can only be used in combination with option --pdf-viewer-only in order to tell TeXstudio which page to display.

       --pdf-viewer-only
              TeXstudio will open as a standalone pdf viewer without editor. FILE has to be a pdf file, not a tex document. Only the first specified file will be opened.

       --start-always
              If this option is provided texstudio starts a new instance even if texstudio is already running.

       --insert-cite citation
              Inserts the bibtex key citation at the current cursor position, automatically taking care of necessary cite commands.
