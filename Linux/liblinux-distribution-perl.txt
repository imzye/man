NAME
       Linux::Distribution - Perl extension to detect on which Linux distribution we are running.

SYNOPSIS
         use Linux::Distribution qw(distribution_name distribution_version);

         if(my $distro = distribution_name) {
               my $version = distribution_version();
               print "you are running $distro, version $version\n";
         } else {
               print "distribution unknown\n";
         }

         Or else do it OO:

         use Linux::Distribution qw(distribution_name distribution_version);

         my $linux = Linux::Distribution->new;
         if(my $distro = $linux->distribution_name()) {
               my $version = $linux->distribution_version();
               print "you are running $distro, version $version\n";
         } else {
               print "distribution unknown\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple module that tries to guess on what linux distribution we are running by looking for release's files in /etc.  It now looks for 'lsb-release' first as that should be the most
       correct and adds ubuntu support.  Secondly, it will look for the distro specific files.

       It currently recognizes slackware, debian, suse, fedora, redhat, turbolinux, yellowdog, knoppix, mandrake, conectiva, immunix, tinysofa, va-linux, trustix, adamantix, yoper, arch-linux, libranet,
       gentoo, ubuntu, scientific, oracle enterprise linux, amazon linux and redflag.

       It has function to get the version for debian, suse, fedora, redhat, gentoo, slackware, scientific, oracle enterprise linux, amazon linux, redflag and ubuntu(lsb). People running unsupported
       distro's are greatly encouraged to submit patches :-)

   EXPORT
       None by default.

TODO
       Add the capability of recognize the version of the distribution for all recognized distributions.
