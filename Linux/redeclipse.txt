SYNOPSIS
       redeclipse [-hhomedir] [-ppackagedir] [-osauerdir] [-glogfile]

                  [-df{0|1}] [-dwwidth] [-dhheight] [-du{agf123}] [-dasamples] [-dddepth]

                  [-x'command(s)'] [-v{0..4}] [--help]

                  [-ss{0..3}] [-smservermaster] [-saservermasterport]

DESCRIPTION
       Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of
       agility in a variety of environments.

       redeclipse is a script which executes the redeclipse binary from the /usr/lib/games/redeclipse directory.

       The recommended way to change the settings of the client are to edit the config.cfg and init.cfg files in the home directory.

       The redeclipse client starts a local loopback server upon launch which it uses to connect to for singleplayer, hence many of the server options are accepted by the redeclipse binary as well (see
       redeclipse-server(6)).  To edit the specific settings related to the loopback server, use the localexec.cfg and localinit.cfg files in the home directory.

CAVEATS
       Many of these options will, if used, be permanently saved in the init.cfg file.

OPTIONS
   Filesystem options
       -hhomedir
              Sets  your home directory to homedir.  Red Eclipse will look for files in this directory in addition the normal installation directory. All user files will be written to the home directory.
              Defaults to $HOME/.redeclipse/.

       -ppackagedir
              Includes the data files found in packagedir.  Can be used for adding additional mods. Packages will be loaded in the order specified. By default redeclipse only includes data files  in  its
              working directory /usr/share/games/redeclipse/, and in the temp subdirectory of the home directory.

       -osauerdir
              Sets the path to your Sauerbraten directory. If Red Eclipse can find your Sauerbraten directory, you can load and play Sauerbraten maps from withing Red Eclipse.

       -glogfile
              Output log to logfile.  Path is set relative to homedir unless a leading ´/' is used, uses stdout if -g is given without a parameter. Defaults to log.txt.

   Video options
       -df{0|1}
              Turns fullscreen mode on or off. 0 to disable, 1 to enable. Defaults to 1.

              This configuration is stored in init.cfg

       -dwwidth
              Sets screen width to width.  If height not specified, also sets height to 3/4 of width. min is 320.

              This configuration is stored in init.cfg

       -dhheight
              Sets screen height to height.  If width not specified, also sets width to 4/3 of height. min is 320.

              This configuration is stored in init.cfg

       -dasamples
              Sets full-scene anti-aliasing (FSAA) to samples samples.

              This configuration is stored in init.cfg

       -dddepth
              Sets z-buffer depth to depth.

              This configuration is stored in init.cfg

   General options
       -x'command1; command2; ...'
              Executes a list of commands once Red Eclipse has started up.

       -v{0..4}
              Sets verbosity. This affects how much information is printed to the console. 0 is the least verbose, 4 is the most verbose, defaults to 0.

              This configuration is stored in init.cfg

       --help Display this manpage

   Server options
       -ss{0..3}
              Sets the server type of the local server. 0 for local only, 1 for private, 2 for public, 3 for dedicated. Defaults to 1. If set as dedicated (3) redeclipse will act similarly to redeclipse-
              server and not start the GUI.

       -smservermaster
              Connects to servermaster to get the list of available servers, defaults to play.redeclipse.net.

       -saservermasterport
              Contacts the master server using port servermasterport, defaults to 28800.

EXAMPLES
       redeclipse -p$HOME/mod/data
           Load data from an additional directory.

       redeclipse -h$HOME/redeclipse_configs/
           Reads and writes the configuration files to the specified directory instead of $HOME/.redeclipse/.

       redeclipse -x'mode 7; trialweapon 0; map hinder'
           Sets game mode to time trial, trialmode weapon to empty hands, and starts a game on the map "hinder".
