NAME
       netselect-apt - create sources.list for the fastest Debian mirrors

SYNOPSIS
       netselect-apt [OPTIONS] [stable|testing|unstable|experimental|release_codename|sid]

DESCRIPTION
       netselect-apt  automatically  creates  a sources.list file for using with apt for the specified distribution by downloading the list of Debian mirrors using wget choosing the fastest servers using
       netselect, and testing the valid servers using curl (if available). The output file is written to OUTFILE.

       The list of fastest servers is determined by checking through netselect, which servers responder faster to ICMP queries. In order to determine if the servers are  valid  a  connectiong  using  the
       specificied protocol (HTTP or FTP) is done using curl.

       If  netselect  is not installed setuid, then netselect-apt needs to run as an administrator user (i.e. root). This is only required because the network probes done by netselect requires these per‐
       missions. No changes are done to the system.

       If -i INFILE is passed netselect-apt uses that rather than downloading another copy to a temporary file. The file will be downloaded from http://www.debian.org/mirror/mirrors_full

OPTIONS
       stable|testing|unstable|experimental|release_codename|sid
              Specify which distribution of Debian to use.  By default stable is used.

       -a, --arch ARCH
              Use mirrors containing ARCH. By default the architecture of the current machine is used as reported by dpkg

       -s, --sources
              While generating OUTFILE include also deb-src lines to use with ``apt-get source'' to obtain Debian source packages.

       -i, --infile INFILE
              Use INFILE instead of downloading the mirror list to a temporary file. The file must be in the same format as mirrors_full.

       -o, --outfile OUTFILE
              Use OUTFILE instead of sources.list.

       -n, --nonfree
              Include also non-free section while generating OUTFILE.

       -f, --ftp
              Use FTP mirrors instead of HTTP and generate OUTFILE accordingly.

       -O OPTIONS
              The OPTIONS provided are added, verbatim, to netselect when it is run. Here you can provide a (quoted) list of options for netselect.

       -t, --tests hosts
              Make a short list with the number of hosts provided and use that list to test for mirror validity.  By default 10 hosts are tested.

       -c, --country COUNTRY
              Only test the sites found under the country COUNTRY (the value can either be an ISO-3166 value or the full name of the language, in English).  When this value is set the mirror list or  the
              INFILE  will be filtered and only the sites that are listed under the given country will be tested. Note that restricting the search might not give the best results, as the "fastest" mirror
              might not even be in the same country as the system the program is running in.

ENVIRONMENT
       WANT_SOURCES
              setting this to 1 is equivalent to --sources

       WANT_NONFREE
              setting this to 1 is equivalent to --nonfree

LIMITATIONS
       netselect-apt is unable to work with restricted environments in which network filtering is implemented as it relies on netselect being able to find a suitable mirror. To do this, the system  where
       the script is run needs to have network visibility of the mirrors, as it will probe them using ICMP probes.

       netselect-apt  is also unable to work in environments where HTTP or FTP network connections have to be done through a proxy host, as it relies on being able to test the validity of the remote mir‐
       rors doing direct network connections to them.

       netselect-apt will not check if the mirror it suggests as the "fastest" mirror is either valid or up-to-date. It is recommended that users that use this tool also validate that  the  mirrors  sug‐
       gested are official mirrors and are also current.

SEE ALSO
       netselect(1), wget(1), curl(1), apt(8), sources.list(5).

       For  Debian  GNU/Linux  it  is  recommended  that users review the official mirror list at http://www.debian.org/mirror/official as well as the mirror checker tool at http://mirror.debian.org/sta‐
       tus.html (which provides information on the up-to-dateness status of mirrors)
