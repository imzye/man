NAME
       icewmhint - set IceWM hints by window class and instance

SYNOPSIS
       icewmhint CLASS.INSTANCE OPTION VALUE ...

DESCRIPTION
       icewmhint is a utility for passing IceWM hints to icewm(1).  icewm uses these hints for the first X11 client which is subsequently started. They take precedence over hints from the icewm-winoptions(1)
       file.

       A hint is a triplet consisting of a class.instance, an IceWM winoption and its value. Multiple hints can be given per invocation of icewmhint.

       The hints are communicated over the "_ICEWM_WINOPTHINT" property on the root window.  icewmhint appends hints to this property, while icewm removes the property after reading it.

OPTIONS
       icewmhint recognizes the following options:

   COMMAND OPTIONS
       Only one command option can be specified per invocation.  If no command option is specified, argument parsing and processing is performed.

       -h, --help
           Print a brief usage statement to stdout and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print the program version to stdout and exit.

       -C, --copying
           Print copying permissions to stdout for the program and exit.

   GENERAL OPTIONS
       -d, --display=DISPLAY
           Specifies the X11 DISPLAY. If unspecified, defaults to $DISPLAY.

ARGUMENTS
       The following three arguments are required for each hint.

       CLASS.INSTANCE
           Specifies the ICCCM 2.0 WM_CLASS property in terms of resource class and resource name separated by a period (".").  For example: "XTerm.xterm". Just the resource class or resource name without a
           dot is also acceptable, like "XTerm" or "xterm".

       OPTION
           Specifies the OPTION to affect.

       VALUE
           Gives the VALUE for the option.

       Multiple hints can be given.

   GENERAL OPTION ARGUMENTS
       General option arguments are normally associated with GNOME WinWM/WMH hints (except for the tray option argument).

       icon NAME
           Specifies the icon name for windows of CLASS.INSTANCE.  NAME should be the name of the icon.  icewm(1) will use its usual method to locate the icon.  The default is the name provided by window
           manager hints.

       workspace WORKSPACE
           Specifies the workspace on which a window of CLASS.INSTANCE will be initially placed.  The default is the current workspace.  WORKSPACE should be a workspace number counting from 0.

       geometry GEOMETRY
           Specifies the initial geometry for windows of the given CLASS.INSTANCE.  GEOMETRY must be a geometry that can be parsed by XParseGeometry(3).  The default is the geometry provided by window
           manager hints.

       order NUMBER
           The sorting order of task buttons and tray icons. The default value is zero. Increasing positive values go farther right, while decreasing negative values go farther left. The order option applies
           to the task pane, the tray pane and the system tray.

       opacity NUMBER
           Set the _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY property if NUMBER is a value between 1 and 100. NUMBER is interpreted as percentage of maximum opaqueness.

       layer {Desktop|Below|Normal|OnTop|Dock|AboveDock|Menu|NUMBER}
           The layer is a similar concept to the layer specified by GNOME/WMH and implied by NetWM/EWMH.  It is in this case however specific to icewm(1).

           This command option specifies the layer to be associated with a CLASS.INSTANCE.  The default is the "Normal" layer.  VALUE is either a layer number or a symbolic layer name.  Symbolic layer names
           are:

               Desktop    (0)  desktop window layer.
               Below      (2)  below normal windows.
               Normal     (4)  default window layer.
               OnTop      (6)  above normal windows.
               Dock       (8)  docks (panels and edge displays).
               AboveDock (10)  above docks.
               Menu      (12)  above everything else.

       tray {Ignore|Minimized|Exclusive|NUMBER}
           Specifies the tray handling to be applied to windows with CLASS.INSTANCE.  This option is specific to icewm(1) and sets the "_ICEWM_TRAY" property associated with the window.  The default is
           "Ignore".  VALUE can be an option number or a symbolic name as follows:

               Ignore     (0)  only in task list.
               Minimized  (1)  icon in tray, task list unminimized.
               Exclusive  (2)  only in tray, not in task list.

   FUNCTION OPTION ARGUMENTS
       Specifies which functions are disabled or enabled (0/1) for windows with CLASS.INSTANCE.  All functions have a default value of enabled (1) unless overridden by the application.  The Motif-like
       functions are as follows:

           fClose     can be closed:        (default: 1).
           fHide      can be hidden:        (default: 1).
           fMaximize  can be maximized:     (default: 1).
           fMinimize  can be minimized:     (default: 1).
           fMove      can be moved:         (default: 1).
           fResize    can be resized:       (default: 1).
           fRollup    can be shaded:        (default: 1).

   DECOR OPTION ARGUMENTS
       Specifies which decorations are disabled or enabled (0/1) for windows with CLASS.INSTANCE.  All decor options have a default value of enabled (1) unless overridden by the application. The Motif-like
       decorations are as follows:

           dBorder    has border:           (default: 1).
           dClose     has close button:     (default: 1).
           dDepth     has depth button:     (default: 1).
           dHide      has hide button:      (default: 1).
           dMaximize  has maximize button:  (default: 1).
           dMinimize  has minimize button:  (default: 1).
           dResize    has resize grips:     (default: 1).
           dRollup    has shade button:     (default: 1).
