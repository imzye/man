NAME
       Module::Optimize - Perl Module Optimization

SYNOPSIS
           package Foo;
           use Module::Optimize -base;

           sub pmc_optimize {
               my ($self, $source) = @_;
               # Convert perl5 $source into semantically equivalent $compiled_output
               return $compiled_output;
           }

       In "Bar.pm":

           package Bar;

           use Foo;

       or lexically:

           package Bar;

           {
               use Foo;
               ...
           }

       To compile "Bar.pm" into "Bar.pmc":

           perl -c Bar.pm

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a system for writing modules that compile other Perl modules.

       Modules that use these compilation modules get compiled into some altered form the first time they are run. The result is cached into ".pmc" files.

       Perl has native support for ".pmc" files. It always checks for them, before loading a ".pm" file.

       You get the following benefits:
