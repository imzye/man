KISSUTIL(1)                 General Commands Manual                KISSUTIL(1)

NAME
       kissutil - KISS TNC troubleshooting and Application Interface.

SYNOPSIS
       kissutil [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       kissutil  can be used interactively for troubleshooting a KISS TNC.  It
       is usable with direwolf and other generic KISS TNCs connected to a  se‐
       rial  port.  It can also be used as an application interface where each
       side places files in a directory for the other to  process.   See  User
       Guide for more details.

OPTIONS
       -h host
              Hostname  or  IP  address for a TCP KISS TNC.  Default is local‐
              host.

       -p port
              A number may be specified for a TCP port other than the  default
              8001.   If  not  a  number, it is considered to be a serial port
              name such as /dev/ttyS0 or COM3.

       -s speed
              Speed for serial port. e.g. 9600.

       -o rec-directory
              For each received frame, a new file is created here.  It is  ex‐
              pected  that  some  other application will process files in this
              directory then delete them.

       -T format
              Each received frame will be preceded by a timestamp in the spec‐
              ified  format.   See strftime documentation for a description of
              the format string.  Example:   %H:%M:%S   for  current  time  in
              hours, minutes, seconds.

       -f xmit-directory
              Files in this directory are transmited and deleted.  Another ap‐
              plication places a file here  when  it  wants  something  to  be
              transmitted.

       -v     Verbose - Display the KISS frames going to and from the TNC.
