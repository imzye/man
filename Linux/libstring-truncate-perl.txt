NAME
       String::Truncate - a module for when strings are too long to be displayed in...

VERSION
       version 1.100603

SYNOPSIS
       This module handles the simple but common problem of long strings and finite terminal width.  It can convert:

        "this is your brain" -> "this is your ..."
                             or "...is your brain"
                             or "this is... brain"
                             or "... is your b..."

       It's simple:

        use String::Truncate qw(elide);

        my $brain = "this is your brain";

        elide($brain, 16); # first option
        elide($brain, 16, { truncate => 'left' });   # second option
        elide($brain, 16, { truncate => 'middle' }); # third option
        elide($brain, 16, { truncate => 'ends' });   # fourth option

        String::Trunc::trunc($brain, 16); # => "this is your bra"

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

FUNCTIONS
   elide
         elide($string, $length, \%arg)

       This function returns the string, if it is less than or equal to $length characters long.  If it is longer, it truncates the string and marks the elision.

       Valid arguments are:

        truncate - elide at left, right, middle, or ends? (default: right)
        marker   - how to mark the elision (default: ...)
        at_space - if true, strings will be broken at whitespace if possible

   trunc
         trunc($string, $length, \%arg)

       This acts just like "elide", but assumes an empty marker, so it actually truncates the string normally.

IMPORTING
       String::Truncate exports both "elide" and "trunc", and also supports the Exporter-style ":all" tag.

         use String::Truncate ();        # export nothing
         use String::Truncate qw(elide); # export just elide()
         use String::Truncate qw(:all);  # export both elide() and trunc()
         use String::Truncate qw(-all);  # export both elide() and trunc()

       When exporting, you may also supply default values:

         use String::Truncate -all => defaults => { length => 10, marker => '--' };

         # or

         use String::Truncate -all => { length => 10, marker => '--' };

       These values affect only the imported version of the functions.  You may pass arguments as usual to override them, and you may call the subroutine by its fully-qualified name to get the standard
       behavior.

BUILDING CODEREFS
       The imported builds and installs lexical closures (code references) that merge in given values to the defaults.  You can build your own closures without importing them into your namespace.  To do
       this, use the "elide_with_defaults" and "trunc_with_defaults" routines.

   elide_with_defaults
         my $elider = String::Truncate::elide_with_defaults(\%arg);

       This routine, never exported, builds a coderef which behaves like "elide", but uses default values when needed.  All the valid arguments to "elide" are valid here, as well as "length".

   trunc_with_defaults
       This routine behaves exactly like elide_with_defaults, with one obvious exception: it returns code that works like "trunc" rather than "elide".  If a "marker" argument is passed, it is ignored.

SEE ALSO
       Text::Truncate does a very similar thing.  So does Text::Elide.

BUGS
       Please report any bugs or feature requests through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=String-Truncate>.  I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be
       notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Ian Langworth gave me some good advice about naming things.  (Also some bad jokes.  Nobody wants String::ETOOLONG, Ian.)  Hans Dieter Pearcey suggested allowing defaults just in time for a long
       bus ride, and I was rescued from boredom by that suggestion
