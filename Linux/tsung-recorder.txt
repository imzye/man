NAME
       tsung-recorder - Proxy recorder for the tsung load testing tool.

SYNOPSIS
       tsung-recorder [ -l log file ]  [ -r command ]  [ -p plugin ]  [ -L listen port ]  [ -I IP ]  [ -P port ]  [ -u  ]  [ start|stop|restart|record_tag ]

DESCRIPTION
       tsung is a distributed load testing tool. It is protocol-independent and can currently be used to stress and benchmark HTTP, WebDAV, LDAP, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Jabber/XMPP servers. tsung-recorder can
       be used to record sessions (only for HTTP, WebDAV and Postgresql) that can be edited and replayed later by tsung

       tsung-recorder is a proxy that records a session in the tsung native XML format; it can be used by your favorite client (browser in the case of the http plugin).

       start  start the proxy recorder (listening port is 8090). By default the HTTP recorder is started. With the -p option,  you  can  select  another  plugin.  The  resulting  files  will  be  created  as
              ~/.tsung/tsung_recorderYYYMMDD-HH:MM.xml; if it doesn't work, take a look at ~/.tsung/log/tsung.log-tsunami_recorder@hostname

       stop   stop the proxy recorder

       record_tag value
              add a string (comment or tag) while recording a session. This is useful for example to add transaction tag while recording a session.
