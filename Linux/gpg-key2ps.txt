NAME
       gpg-key2ps - generates a PS file from a GnuPG keyring

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-key2ps [-r revoked-style] [-p papersize] [-1] [-s] keyid-or-name [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       gpg-key2ps generates a PostScript file with your OpenPGP key fingerprint (repeated as often as it fits) useful for keysigning parties. The only argument is the same as you would pass to GPG's list-
       keys command, either a key-id or a (partial) name.  The PS data is written to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -p --paper-size paper-size
           Select the output paper size. Default is to look into /etc/papersize or A4 if libpaper isn't installed.

       -s --show-subkeys
           Enable subkey information to be printed on the slips. Subkey information is normally not relevant to the key signing process.

       -r --revoked-style revoked-style
           Select how to mark revoked UIDs and subkeys. Five styles are available:
            hide don't show at all (default),
            show show normally,
            grey display in 50% grey,
            note add "[revoked]", and
            strike strike through.

       -1  Print only one column of paper slips instead of the default two. Useful for keys with long UIDs that otherwise won't fit.

       keyid
           Keyids to print. Multiple can be separated by spaces.

       -h --help
           Print usage and exit.

       -v --version
           Print version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME
           The default home directory.

       GNUPGBIN
           The gpg binary.  Default: "gpg".

       GNUPGHOME
           The default working directory for gpg.  Default: "$HOME/.gnupg".

       gpg-key2latex(1)
           Like gpg-key2ps, but produces LaTeX output instead.

           gpg-key2ps prints plain fingerprint slips. If you are looking for something more stylish, look at these latex templates for business cards that also include fingerprints.
