NAME
       pmdk-convert - upgrade pool files layout version

SYNOPSIS
              $ pmdk-convert <file>

DESCRIPTION
       The  pmdk-convert  performs  a  conversion of the specified pool to the
       newest layout supported by this  tool.   Currently  only  libpmemobj(7)
       pools are supported.

       The conversion process is not fail-safe - power interruption may damage
       the pool.  It is advised to have a backup of the  pool  before  conver‐
       sion.

       This tool doesn't support remote replicas.  Before a conversion all re‐
       mote replicas have to be removed from the pool  by  pmempool  transform
       command.
