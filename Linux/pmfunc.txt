NAME
       pmfunc - cat out a function from a module

DESCRIPTION
       Given a fully-qualified function, this program opens up the file and
       attempts to display the source for that function.

EXAMPLES
           $ pmfunc Cwd::_perl_getcwd
           sub _perl_getcwd
           {
               abs_path('.');
           }

RESTRICTIONS
       Only subroutines that are defined in the normal fashion are seen, since
       a simple pattern-match is what does the extraction.  Those loaded other
       ways, such as via AUTOLOAD, typeglob aliasing, or in an "eval", will
       all necessarily be missed.

       This is mostly here for people who are too lazy to type

           sed '/^sub getcwd/,/}/p' `pmpath Cwd`
       or
           perl -ne 'print if /^sub\s+getcwd\b/ .. /}/' `pmpath Cwd`
