NAME
       Mino - a user friendly text editor for GNU/Linux console/xterm

SYNOPSIS
       mino [file-name] [--help, -h] [--reset-config]

DESCRIPTION
       About  The  mino  editor  Mino  is  a GNU software, part of the GnuDOS package.  Mino is a text file editor for use with the GNU/Linux console/xterm. The idea was to provide a text editor that is user
       friendly and easy to use for those who came from DOS land. Having accustomed to SHIFT selecting text, using CTRL-shortcut keys and so on makes it hard for a regular Joe to dive in head first into  GNU
       syntax.  Mino  provides  multi-level  experience, the level of complexity can be adjusted by the user: you want to use DOS-keys with a few basic GNU ones? you want to go with the full power of the GNU
       system? All are options that are provided by the six levels of experience of Mino:

         1- Newbie: All DOS shortcut keys, no GNU keys yet
         2- Novice: DOS shortcut keys, some of which are replaced with GNU's
         3- Intermediate: DOS keys with a few more replaced with GNU keys
         4- Advanced: ... And more GNU keys in
         5- Expert: Very few DOS keys, most are GNU keys
         6- Veteran: Only GNU keys, no DOS-like keys

       You start with level 1 by default.  To set your level, call the mino with '--levelX' or '-lX' options,

       Which keys are defined for which level?
       =======================================
       There is a table showing the DOS-like key combinations along with their respective GNU key bindings in the README file installed with this package.  To read more about the levels of experience and the
