NAME
       pymcapostbatch - PyMca batch result analysis application

SYNOPSIS
       pymcapostbatch [FILE1] [FILE2] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Start the graphical user interface of the PyMca X-Ray Fluorescence Toolkit image correlation tool.

       This tool is automatically launched by the PyMca X-ray fluorescence toolkit after a batch analysis.

       It allows one to superpose up to three images in RED, GREEN and BLUE in order to investigate correlations among them. All the images have to be of the same dimension.

       The program builds a table with all the input images but only three of them can be superposed at the same time.

       This program also offers the possibility to perform mathematical operations among the images and simple multivariate analysis.

EXAMPLES
       pymcapostbatch

       Start the program with a file browser to select the input files.

       pymcapostbatch file1.tif file2.tif file3.tif file4.tif

       Tries to open the files named file1.tif, file2.tif, file3.tif and file4.tif.
