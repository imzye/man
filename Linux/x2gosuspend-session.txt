NAME
       x2gosuspend-session - Suspend an X2Go Session

SYNOPSIS
       x2gosuspend-session <session_id>

DESCRIPTION
       x2gosuspend-session suspends the running session with session ID <session_id>.

       This command is normally issued by an X2Go client application with X2Go user privileges.

RETURN VALUES
       x2gosuspend-session reports to stderr if resuming of session <session_id> failed. This very probably means that the session's X agent has died, so the session <session_id> will be marked as finished
       in the X2Go session database.

       As exitcode x2gosuspend-session always returns 0.
