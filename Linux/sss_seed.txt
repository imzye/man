NAME
       sss_seed - seed the SSSD cache with a user

SYNOPSIS
       sss_seed [options] -D DOMAIN -n USER

DESCRIPTION
       sss_seed seeds the SSSD cache with a user entry and temporary password.
       If a user entry is already present in the SSSD cache then the entry is
       updated with the temporary password.

OPTIONS
       -D,--domain DOMAIN
           Provide the name of the domain in which the user is a member of.
           The domain is also used to retrieve user information. The domain
           must be configured in sssd.conf. The DOMAIN option must be
           provided. Information retrieved from the domain overrides what is
           provided in the options.

       -n,--username USER
           The username of the entry to be created or modified in the cache.
           The USER option must be provided.

       -u,--uid UID
           Set the UID of the user to UID.

       -g,--gid GID
           Set the GID of the user to GID.

       -c,--gecos COMMENT
           Any text string describing the user. Often used as the field for
           the user's full name.

       -h,--home HOME_DIR
           Set the home directory of the user to HOME_DIR.

       -s,--shell SHELL
           Set the login shell of the user to SHELL.

       -i,--interactive
           Interactive mode for entering user information. This option will
           only prompt for information not provided in the options or
           retrieved from the domain.

       -p,--password-file PASS_FILE
           Specify file to read user's password from. (if not specified
           password is prompted for)

       -?,--help
           Display help message and exit.

NOTES
       The length of the password (or the size of file specified with -p or
       --password-file option) must be less than or equal to PASS_MAX bytes
       (64 bytes on systems with no globally-defined PASS_MAX value).
