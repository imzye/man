NAME
       rebuild - Rebuilds perl packages from scratch

DESCRIPTION
       Main goal is to rebuild perl modules packages for Fedora. The rebuild is driven from bottom to top, i.e. from perl interpreter to modules depending on intermediate modules. This way, it's possible to
       upgrade perl interpreter to incompatible version and to rebuild all modules against the new interpreter.
