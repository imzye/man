NAME
       LimeUtil - control and update LMS7 based transceiver devices

SYNOPSIS
       LimeUtil [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       LimeUtil is a tool to show information about and control LMS7 based transceiver devices such as the LimeSDR.  It can be used to update the firmware and to calibrate the device.

OPTIONS
       --help Print a help message.

       --info Print information about LimeSuite and found devices.

       --find[="SPEC"]
              Discover available devices, restricted to those matching the SPEC if given.  If no matching devices are found it will exit with exit status 1.

       --make[="SPEC"]
              Create a device instance.

   Advanced options
       --args[="ARGS"]
              Supply arguments ARGS to the --update, --fpga and --fw options.

       --update
              Download latest firmware and program it into the device flash memory.

       --fpga="FILE"
              Program FPGA firmware image in FILE to device flash memory.

       --fw="FILE"
              Program FX3 firmware image in FILE to device flash memory.

       --timing
              Time interfaces and operations.

   Calibrations sweep
       --cal[="ARGS"]
              Calibrate device. Use ARGS to select and configure device.

       --start=FREQ
              Start calibration sweep at frequency FREQ Hz.

       --stop=EQ
              Stop calibration sweep at frequency FREQ Hz.

       --step=STEP
              Step frequency during calibration sweep by STEP Hz (default 1 MHz).

       --bw=BW
              Set calibration bandwidth to BW Hz (default 30 MHz).

       --dir=DIR
              Set calibration direction to DIR (one of RX, TX or BOTH, default is BOTH).

       --chans=CHANNELS
              Set calibration channels to CHANNELS (one of 0, 1 or ALL, default is ALL).

HOMEPAGE
       LimeUtil is part of the Lime Suite.
