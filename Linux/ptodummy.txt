NAME
       ptodummy - create missing input photos

SYNOPSIS
         ptodummy project.pto

DESCRIPTION
       ptodummy takes a .pto project and creates missing input photos as necessary.  Each input photo is filled with a different colour to help identify them in the hugin preview or in the stitched output.

       This is useful for debugging failing .pto projects submitted in bug reports, as the original photos are not necessary to open and stitch the project in hugin.

       The created images will always be placed in the current working directory regardless of any paths specified in the project, pre-existing files will not be clobbered.
