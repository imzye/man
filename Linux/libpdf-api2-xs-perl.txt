NAME
       PDF::API2::XS - Optional PDF::API2 add-on using XS to speed up expensive operations

DESCRIPTION
       PDF::API2 will make use of this distribution, if it's installed, to speed up some operations that are significantly faster in C than in Perl.

       There's no need to interact with this distribution directly.  PDF::API2 will use it automatically if it detects it.
