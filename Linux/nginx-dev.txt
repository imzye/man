NAME
       dh_nginx - register configuration snippets to the nginx web server

SYNOPSIS
       dh_nginx [debhelper options] [-n|--noscripts] [--in-nginx-tree]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_nginx is a debhelper program that is responsible for correctly installing Nginx configuration snippets and setting postinst, prerm and dependencies in Nginx web server modules and web
       applications.

       It supports the following configuration types

       •   Nginx modules

INVOCATION
         %:
            dh $@ --with nginx

FILES
       debian/package.nginx
       debian/nginx

       Lists files to be registered with the Nginx HTTP server. The file is interpreted as line separated list of installation stanzas, where each entry consists of whitespace separated values conforming
       to the file semantics below.

       When  this  file is missing but the name of the package looks like a nginx module, the module load file and its loading priority is automatically generated inferring from the package name. In this
       case, package-name.install or other mechanisms should be used for copying the .so library into the correct place.

   FILE SEMANTICS
       Each line consists of a triple

       type file [arguments]

       where the values are interpreted as follows:

       type

       Denotes the type of file to be installed. Recognized values are mod for Nginx modules.

       file

       Is interpreted as existing file name within the source package. No path expansion is effectuated. Just like dh_install(1), dh_nginx can not rename files.

       arguments

       Is inrerpreted as optional arguments if any, currently not used.

   MODULES
       Modules are handled specially and are determined by the mod type. Modules  must  have  a  .conf  suffix.  In  that  case  the  file  is  interpreted  as  module  load  file  and  is  installed  to
       /etc/nginx/modules-available.  If the file is ending with a .so suffix it is interpreted as actual module shared object and is installed to the Nginx module directory, an optional numeric priority
       can be set as the last argument to handle module dependencies.

OPTIONS
       -e, --noenable
           Install maintainer scripts accordingly, but do not enable the scripts or configuration by default.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm maintainer scripts.

       --in-nginx-tree
           Specify this option when building in-tree modules along with nginx. When specified, nginx abi version is not required in package name.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to  be  added  to  maintainer
       scripts.
