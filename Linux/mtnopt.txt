NAME
       mtnopt - generate shell variables from monotone workspace options

SYNOPSIS
       mtnopt [-s|-c|-v] [-d dir] [-k keys]
       mtnopt -h

DESCRIPTION
       mtnopt prints shell variable assignments for each value in the file of monotone workspace options, _MTN/options, in the current directory. For instance, if _MTN/options contained this text:

              database "/home/user/src/monotone.mtn"
                branch "net.venge.monotone"
                keydir "/home/user/.monotone/keys"

       mtnopt would print:

              MTN_database="/home/user/src/monotone.mtn";
              MTN_branch="net.venge.monotone";
              MTN_keydir="/home/user/.monotone/keys";

       By default, mtnopt attempts to guess appropriate syntax from the value of the SHELL environment variable.  This can be overridden with the -s and -c command‐line options.

OPTIONS
       -s     Print variable assignments in sh(1) syntax.

       -c     Print variable assignments in csh(1) syntax.

       -v     Print only the values, with no indication of the corresponding option keys.

       -d directory
              Look for _MTN/options in directory, rather than in the current directory.

       -k keys
              Print assignments for only those options that match the egrep(1) regular expression keys.

       -h     Print a help message and exit.

BUGS
       mtnopt only looks in the current directory for the _MTN directory, so it will fail in a subdirectory of a workspace.

       mtnopt should be aware of the set of possible options, rather than blindly printing whatever is in _MTN/options.

       The behavior when there is no _MTN/options file to be found is less than helpful.
