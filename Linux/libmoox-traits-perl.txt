NAME
       MooX::Traits::Util - non-role alternative to MooX::Traits

SYNOPSIS
       Given some roles:

          package Role;
          use Moo::Role;
          has foo => ( is => 'ro', required => 1 );

       And a class:

          package Class;
          use Moo;

       Apply the roles to the class:

          use MooX::Traits::Util -all;

          my $class = new_class_with_traits('Class', 'Role');

       Then use your customized class:

          my $object = $class->new( foo => 42 );
          $object->isa('Class'); # true
          $object->does('Role'); # true
          $object->foo; # 42

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the functionality of MooX::Traits, but it's an exporter rather than a role.

       It's inspired by, but not compatible with MooseX::Traits::Util. The latter module is undocumented, and it's not entirely clear whether it's intended to be consumed by end-users, or is an entirely
       internal API.

       This module exports nothing by default.

   Functions
       "new_class_with_traits( $class, @traits )"
           Return a new class name with the traits applied.

           This function is not quite compatible with the "new_class_with_traits" function provided by MooseX::Traits::Util, in that the latter will return a metaclass object.

           This function can be exported.

       "new_class_with_traits_one_by_one( $class, @traits )"
           Rather than applying the the traits simultaneously, the traits are applied one at a time. It is roughly equivalent to:

              use List::Util qw(reduce);
              use MooX::Traits::Util qw( new_class_with_traits );

              my $class  = ...;
              my @traits = ...;
              my $new    = reduce { new_class_with_traits($a, $b) } $class, @traits;

           Applying traits one by one has implications for method modifiers, and for method conflict detection. Use with caution.

           There is no equivalent functionality in MooseX::Traits::Util.

           This function can be exported.

       "resolve_traits( $class, @traits )"
           This  function  returns  a  list of traits, but does not apply them to the class. It honours the class' "_trait_namespace" method (but only if the class does the MooX::Traits role) and handles
           parameter hashrefs for parameterizable roles. (That is, parameters are applied to the role, and the list of traits returned by the function includes the result of that application  instead  of
           including the original hashref.)

           This function is not quite compatible with the "resolve_traits" function provided by MooseX::Traits::Util, in that the latter will not handle parameter hashrefs, trusting Moose to do that.

           This function cannot be exported.
