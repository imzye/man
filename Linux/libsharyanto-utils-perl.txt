NAME
       SHARYANTO::Hash::Util - Hash utilities

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.77 of SHARYANTO::Hash::Util (from Perl distribution SHARYANTO-Utils), released on 2015-09-04.

SYNOPSIS
        use SHARYANTO::Hash::Util qw(rename_key);
        my %h = (a=>1, b=>2);
        rename_key(\%h, "a", "alpha"); # %h = (alpha=>1, b=>2)

FUNCTIONS
   rename_key(\%hash, $old_key, $new_key)
       Rename key. This is basically $hash{$new_key} = delete $hash{$old_key} with a couple of additional checks. It is a shortcut for:

        die unless exists $hash{$old_key};
        die if     exists $hash{$new_key};
        $hash{$new_key} = delete $hash{$old_key};

   replace_hash_content($hashref, @pairs) => $hashref
       Replace content in <$hashref> with @list. Return $hashref. Do not create a new hashref object (i.e. it is different from: "$hashref = {new=>"content"}").

       Do not use this function. In Perl you can just use: "%$hashref = @pairs". I put the function here for reminder.
