       interface is cx.ath.matthew.bluemon.Bluemon. The signal interface is cx.ath.matthew.bluemon.ProximitySignal       and have the names Connect and Disconnect       which both have 1 parameter, which
       is the string representation of the bluetooth device ID which has been connected or disconnected. The method has the signature Status(IN STRING address, OUT STRING address, OUT BOOLEAN status, OUT
       UINT32 level). The in parameter may be blank in which case the first connected device will be returned.  If status is true (device is connected) then the address and level will correspond  to  the
       device address and the reported link quality. Otherwise they will set to the address asked for and -1 respectively.
