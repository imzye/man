NAME
       hcal - displays a Hebrew / Gregorian calendar

SYNOPSIS
       hcal [options] [coordinates [timezone]] [[mm] yyyy]

       coordinates: -l [NS]yy[.yyy] -L [EW]xx[.xxx]
                           -l [NS]yy[:mm[:ss]] -L [EW]xx[:mm[:ss]]
              timezone:    -z nn[( .nn | :mm )]

DESCRIPTION
       hcal  prints  a calendar with both Gregorian and Hebrew dates for the specified Gregorian month or, if no month is specified, for the whole Gregorian year. If no arguments are given, it prints the
       current month's calendar. Jewish holidays are annotated, and can optionally be footnoted.  hcal tries to be sunset-aware in order to correctly highlight the current Hebrew date, and can also  dis‐
       play Shabbat times and parshiot. See the section LOCATION, below.

       INPUTTING  A HEBREW DATE: If the year provided is greater than 3000, hcal will interpret the given date as a Hebrew date, and will display the calendar of the corresponding Gregorian month(s). He‐
       brew months are expected to be passed as numbers 1-12 for Tishrei - Elul; Adar I and Adar II are expected to be passed as months 13 and 14.

OPTIONS

              -z --timezone     +/-UTC. Notation may  be in decimal hours ( hh[.hh] ) or hours, minutes ( hh[:mm] )

NOTES
   HOLIDAYS
       Holidays are depicted by a change in the symbol separating a day's Gregorian and Hebrew dates, as follows:

              /  Regular day
              +  Yom Tov (plus Yom Kippur)
              *  Erev Yom Kippur
              ~  Hol HaMoed
              !   Hanuka and Purim
              @  Tzomot
              $  Lag BaOmer ,Tu BeAv, Tu BeShvat
              #  Independance day and Yom Yerushalaim
              %  Tzahal and Holocaust memorial days
              ^  Other Israeli National days

       Use the -f (--footnote) option to have hcal describe what any particular day is marking.

   LOCATIONS
       If you want hcal to display accurate Shabbat times, and to accurately advance the Hebrew 'today's date' indicator at sunset, hcal requires location and time zone information in order to  make  as‐
       tronomical  calculations  for  a  given date. If you don't provide ANY such information, hcal uses your computer's local time zone information as an indicator, and either picks a city in that time
       zone, or defaults to the equator at the center of that time zone. If hcal can't even retrieve time zone information from your computer, it defaults to Tel-Aviv. For other locations, use the -l  -L
       option pair. For other timezones, use the -z option. Co-ordinates and standard time zones for some common locations are listed below.

       The current defaults include:
                Timezone   Default city    Lattitude  Longitude
                   -5      New York City      40        -74
                    0      London             51          0
                    1      Paris              48          2
                    2      Tel-Aviv           32         34
                    3      Moscow             55         37

FILES
   CONFIG FILE
       This folder and file will be automatically created, and includes its own documentation, in-line:
                       ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/hcal/hcalrc

       If ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME} is undefined:
                       ~/.config/hcal/hcalrc

BUGS
       Accuracy  The accuracy of the astronomically-derived data will suffer from not accounting for environmental conditions such as elevation, horizon, temperature and air pressure.

       Timezones The timezone support is currenlty primitive and lacks support for daylight savings time transitions.

       Historical
                 The  software does not yet account for the phenomenon and complications of the "Gregorian transition" from the prior, Julian calendar, which effectively caused an instantaneous 'loss' of
                 two weeks for all gentiles affected. Countries (eg. Poland, Spain and Italy) began adopting the Gregorian calendar on 8 Tishrei 5343 (4 October 1582CE), although many did not  transition
                 until  the 56th century (1752 CE, eg. UK colonies, Sweden). Russia did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 5678 (1918 CE) and Turkey did not until 5687 (December, 1926 CE). Many other
                 countries made the transition on other dates. Keep in mind that Russia invaded part of Poland, undoing, for the interim, the Gregorian transition for (only) that part of Poland; Also im‐
                 portant to remember in this regard is that Eretz Ysroel was part of the Turkish Ottoman empire until the British mandate (5677 (1917CE)). Until all this is accounted  for  adequately  by
                 this  application,  refer to ' ncal -p ´ for a basic table of country transitions. However, keep in mind that European borders underwent many changes during the 426 years in question, so
                 the accuracy of your data will depend on accurate knowledge of whether any particular date at any specific location was Julian or Gregorian.

EXAMPLES
       1. Display a 2012ce year's calendar, three-months wide, in color.
             hcal -3c 2012

       2. Display the current month's calendar, with Shabbat times, parshiot, footnoted holiday identification, with Hebrew information in Hebrew, and all in "calming", "muted" color-tones.
             hcal -csfH

       Hcal and Hdate are part of the package libhdate , a small C/C++ library for Hebrew dates, holidays, and reading sequences (parashiot). It uses the source code from Amos Shapir's  "hdate"  package,
       as fixed and patched by Nadav Har'El. The Torah reading sequence tables were contributed by Zvi Har'El.
