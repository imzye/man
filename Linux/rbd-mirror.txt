NAME
       rbd-mirror - Ceph daemon for mirroring RBD images

SYNOPSIS
       rbd-mirror

DESCRIPTION
       rbd-mirror is a daemon for asynchronous mirroring of RADOS block device (rbd) images among Ceph clusters. It replays changes to images in remote clusters in a local cluster, for disaster recovery.

       It  connects  to  remote  clusters via the RADOS protocol, relying on default search paths to find ceph.conf files, monitor addresses and authentication information for them, i.e. /etc/ceph/$clus‐
       ter.conf, /etc/ceph/$cluster.keyring, and /etc/ceph/$cluster.$name.keyring, where $cluster is the  human-friendly  name  of  the  cluster,  and  $name  is  the  rados  user  to  connect  as,  e.g.
       client.rbd-mirror.

OPTIONS
       -c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
              Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.

       -m monaddress[:port]
              Connect to specified monitor (instead of looking through ceph.conf).

       -i ID, --id ID
              Set the ID portion of name for rbd-mirror

       -n TYPE.ID, --name TYPE.ID
              Set the rados user name for the gateway (eg. client.rbd-mirror)

       --cluster NAME
              Set the cluster name (default: ceph)

       -d     Run in foreground, log to stderr

       -f     Run in foreground, log to usual location

AVAILABILITY
       rbd-mirror is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at https://docs.ceph.com for more information.
