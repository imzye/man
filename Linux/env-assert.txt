NAME
       Env::Assert - Ensure that the environment variables match what you need, or abort.

VERSION
       version 0.011

SYNOPSIS
           use Env::Assert qw( assert report_errors );

           my %want = (
               options => {
                   exact => 1,
               },
               variables => {
                   USER => { regexp => '^[[:word:]]{1}$', required => 1 },
               },
           );
           my %parameters;
           $parameters{'break_at_first_error'} = 1;
           my $r = assert( \%ENV, \%want, \%parameters );
           if( ! $r->{'success'} ) {
               print report_errors( $r->{'errors'} );
           }

STATUS
       Package Env::Assert is currently being developed so changes in the API are possible, though not likely.

NOTES
DEPENDENCIES
       No external dependencies outside Perl's standard distribution.

FUNCTIONS
       No functions are automatically exported to the calling namespace.

   assert( \%env, \%want, \%params )
       Ensure your environment, parameter env (hashref), matches with the environment description, parameter want (hashref).  Use parameter params (hashref) to specify processing options.

       Supported params:

       break_at_first_error
               Verify environment only up until the first error.  Then break and return with only that error.

       Return: hashref: { success => 1/0, errors => hashref, };

   report_errors( \%errors )
       Report errors in a nicely formatted way.

   file_to_desc( @rows )
       Extract an environment description from a .envdesc file.

SEE ALSO
       Env::Dot  is  a  "sister"  to  Env::Assert.  Read environment variables from a .env file directly into you program.  There is also script envdot which can turn .env file's content into environment
       variables for different shells.
