DESCRIPTION
       DDD is a graphical front-end for GDB and other command-line debuggers.  Using DDD, you can see what is going on “inside” another program while it executes—or what another program was doing at  the
       moment it crashed.

       DDD can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

       • Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

       • Make your program stop on specified conditions.

       • Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

       • Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

       “Classical”  UNIX debuggers such as the GNU debugger (GDB) provide a command-line interface and a multitude of commands for these and other debugging purposes.  DDD is a comfortable graphical user
       interface around an inferior GDB, DBX, Ladebug, XDB, JDB, Python debugger, or Perl debugger.

       DDD is invoked with the shell command ddd.  You can open a program to be debugged using `File→Open Program' (the `Open Program' item in the `File' menu.  You can get online help at any time  using
       the `Help' menu; for the first steps, try `Help→What Now?'.  Quit DDD using `File→Exit'.

       More  information  on  DDD is contained in the DDD Manual.  You can read the text-only version in DDD (via `Help→DDD Reference') or in Emacs (as Info file).  Full-fledged HTML, PostScript, and PDF
       versions are available online via the DDD WWW page,

         http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/

OPTIONS
       These are the most important options used when starting DDD.  All options may be abbreviated, as long as they are unambiguous; single dashes may also be used.  DDD also understands the usual X op‐
       tions such as `-display' or `-geometry'; see X(1) for details.

       All arguments and options not handled by DDD are passed to the inferior debugger.  To pass an option to the inferior debugger that conflicts with an X option, or with a DDD option listed here, use
       the `--debugger' option, below.

       --configuration
              Show the DDD configuration settings and exit.

       --dbx  Run the DBX debugger as inferior debugger.

       --debugger name
              Invoke the inferior debugger name.  This is useful if you have several debugger versions around, or if the inferior debugger cannot be invoked as `gdb',  `dbx',  `xdb',  `jdb',  `pydb',  or
              `perl' respectively.
              This option can also be used to pass options to the inferior debugger that would otherwise conflict with DDD options.  For instance, to pass the option `-d directory' to XDB, use:

                ddd --debugger "xdb -d directory"

              If  you  use  the  `--debugger'  option,  be  sure  that the type of inferior debugger is specified as well.  That is, use one of the options `--gdb', `--dbx', `--xdb', `--jdb' `--pydb', or
              `--perl' (unless the default setting works fine).

       --gdb  Run the GDB debugger as inferior debugger.

       --help Give a list of frequently used options.  Show options of the inferior debugger as well.

       --host [username@]hostname
              Invoke the inferior debugger directly on the remote host hostname.  If username is given and the `--login' option is not used, use username as remote user name.

       --jdb  Run JDB as inferior debugger.

       --ladebug
              Run Ladebug as inferior debugger.

       --perl Run Perl as inferior debugger.

       --pydb Run PYDB as inferior debugger.

       --rhost [username@]hostname
              Run the inferior debugger interactively on the remote host hostname.  If username is given and the `--login' option is not used, use username as remote user name.

       --trace
              Show the interaction between DDD and the inferior debugger on standard error.  This is useful for  debugging  DDD.   If  `--trace'  is  not  specified,  this  information  is  written  into
              `$HOME/.ddd/log', such that you can also do a post-mortem debugging.

       --version
              Show the DDD version and exit.

       --wdb  Run the WDB debugger as inferior debugger.

       --xdb  Run XDB as inferior debugger.

       A full list of options, including important options of the inferior debugger, can be found in the DDD manual.
