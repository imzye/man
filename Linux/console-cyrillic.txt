NAME
       dumppsf - converts psf file to readable ASCII file.

SYNOPSIS
          dumppsf fontfile

DESCRIPTION
       This script takes psf font with unicode mapping as an argument, and produces text file where all characters from this font are represented graphically. It allows to preview Linux console font even
       there is no Linux console around.

BUGS
       No undumppsf script is written yet, so it is impossible to edit ASCII representation of font and convert back
