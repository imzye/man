       This program will convert a DICOM series into a NIfTI file.

       It  reads the DICOM Position and Orientation metadata, and uses this information to generate qform and sform entries for the NIfTI header, after doing a conversion from the DICOM coordinate system
       to the NIfTI coordinate system.

       By default, it will also reorder the columns of the image so that columns with higher indices are further to the patient's right (or in the case of sagittal images, further  anterior).   Likewise,
       rows  will  be  rearranged so that rows with higher indices are superior (or anterior for axial images).  Finally, it will reorder the slices so that the column direction, row direction, and slice
       direction follow the right-hand rule.

       It is also possible to reformat the images into the axial orientation via the --reformat-to-axial option  This option is mutually exclusive with the no-reordering options.  The resulting  orienta‐
       tion matrix will be the identity matrix.

       If  the  output NIFTI files are to be used with the FMRIB FSL package, then use the --fsl option to reformat the images to match the standard FSL orientation: axial images with the slices arranged
       from inferior to superior, column number increasing from right to left, and row number increasing from posterior to anterior.  This will also convert the data type from unsigned 16-bit  to  signed
       16-bit if necessary.

       The  --time-tag, --time-delta-tag, and --time-delta options can be used to tweak the time information.  By default, tags such as TriggerTime, TemporalPositionIdentifier, or TriggerTime are used to
       perform temporal sorting, but --time-tag can be used to explicitly name a tag.  The --time-delta-tag option can be used to set which tag gives temporal spacing, if there is no tag that  gives  the
       temporal coordinate.  The --time-delta option will force the temporal spacing to be a specific value, e.g. 500ms, 2s, or 2600us.

       If  batch  mode  is  selected, the output file given with "-o" can be constructed from DICOM attributes, by providing the attribute names within curly braces.  For example, consider the following:
       "{PatientID}-{StudyDate}/{SeriesDescription}-{SeriesNumber}.nii" or something similar to produce a hierarchical directory structure.  The attributes used in the path should be from  the  following
       list:

              PatientID, PatientName, PatientBirthDate, PatientSex, StudyID, StudyDescription, StudyDate, StudyTime, StudyInstanceUID, SeriesNumber, SeriesDescription, SeriesInstanceUID, Modality, Acces‐
              sionNumber.

       Here is an example of batch mode that recurses into subdirectories and compresses the output files, putting the results in the current directory:

       ./obj-x86_64-linux-gnu/bin/dicomtonifti -brz -o {SeriesDescription}-{SeriesNumber}.nii /path/to/dicom/files
