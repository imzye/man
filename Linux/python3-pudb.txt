NAME
       pudb - full-screen, console-based Python3 debugger

SYNOPSIS
       pudb [options] script-to-run [script-arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pudb command.

       PuDB is a full-screen, console-based visual debugger for Python.

       Its  goal  is to provide all the niceties of modern GUI-based debuggers in a more lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. PuDB allows you to debug code right where you write and test it -- in a
       terminal. If you've worked with the excellent (but nowadays ancient) DOS-based Turbo Pascal or C tools, PuDB's UI might look familiar.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -c, --continue
              Let the script run until an exception occurs or a breakpoint is hit.

       -s, --steal-output

       -m, --module
              Debug as module or package instead of as a script.

       --pre-run=COMMAND
              run COMMAND before each program run

       -v, --version
              Show program's version number and exit.
