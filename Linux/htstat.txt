NAME
       htstat -  returns statistics on the document and word databases, much like the -s option to htdig or htmerge.

SYNOPSIS
       htstat [-v][-a][-c configfile][-u]

DESCRIPTION
       Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the HTTP protocol and gathers information from these documents which can later be used to search these documents. This program can be referred to as the search ro‐
       bot.

OPTIONS
       -a     Use alternate work files. Tells htstat to append .work to database files, causing a second copy of the database to be built. This allows the original files to be used  by  htsearch  during  the
              run.

       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -u     Give a list of URLs in the document database.

       -v     Verbose  mode. This increases the verbosity of the program.  Using more than 2 is probably only useful for debugging purposes. The default verbose mode (using only one -v) gives a nice progress
              report while digging.

FILES
       /etc/htdig/htdig.conf
              The default configuration file.
