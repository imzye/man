NAME
       ws_list - list workspaces

SYNOPSIS
       ws_list [-h] [-F FILESYSTEM] [-g] [-l] [-s] [-v] [-s] [-r] [-N] [-R] [-C] [PATTERN]

DESCRIPTION
       List workspaces of the calling user.  The output can be restricted to workspaces in a certain FILESYSTEM, matching a certain PATTERN, and can be sorted according to different criterias.

       The idea of the workspace is to allow the administrator to keep control of filespace in working filesystems, and to avoid the situations that data of past and finished projects/jobs is idling for ever
       on disks. A user can create and dispose arbitrary number of workspaces, they are cheap, and can be created e.g. for each job.

       From the system side, workspaces will be deleted after beeing expired. A friendly user can release workspaces before the expiration date using ws_release which will mark the workspace for future dele‐
       tion.

       Deletion is probably a task done once a night and not immediately.

       If a workspace was forgotten and expired, it might make sense to contact the administrator, as he probaly can restore a workspace for some time, if disk space is not low.

OPTIONS
       -h     display usage help text

       -l     list the available filesystems, only filesystems the user has access to will be shown.

       -F     select the filesystem to list the workspaces from.

       -g     show group-workspaces visible for current group in addition to own workspaces

       -s     short listing, only workspace names will be listed.

       -t     terse listing, less information is shown

       -v     verbose listing, all information is shown

       -N     sort according to names of workspaces

       -R     sort according to remaining time of workspaces

       -C     sort according to creation date of workspaces

       -r     invert the sorting of -N, -C or -R

EXAMPLES
       list all workspaces, unsorted:
              ws_list

       list available filesystems:
              ws_list -l

       list all workspaces, sorted by remaining time, shortest first:
              ws_list -R

       list all workspaces, sorted by creation time, oldest last:
              ws_list -R -r list a specific workspace ws_list my_workspace
