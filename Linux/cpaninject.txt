NAME
       cpaninject - Inject a distribution for installation via the CPAN shell

SYNOPSIS
         # Add the distribution
         cpaninject myperlmodule.tar.gz

         # And then install it from the cpan shell
         cpan> install LOCAL/myperlmodule.tar.gz

DESCRIPTION
       cpaninject is a small front-end application for the CPAN::Inject module.

       It takes any arbitrary Perl distribution tarball (open source or otherwise) and injects it into the local CPAN file cache, smoothing some metadata files to make it look as if it came from CPAN.

       It makes use the officially blessed "Reserved Local CPAN Author" id "LOCAL" as the author the distributions are added under.

       To use the program, just run cpaninject mytarball.tar.gz to add it, then the CPAN shell to install it (with full automatic recursive dependency installation).

       The key here being the recursive dependency installation, which you are now able to do even for installing non-CPAN modules.

       This simplifies the installation process a little, and makes things easier on someone that just wants to install a single commercial or non-CPAN Perl module that might have a dozen or more CPAN
       dependencies.
