EXAMPLES
       This example creates a disk image with user-data which can be used to start a cloud image which supports cloud-init(1).

       Create some user-data:

              cat > my-user-data <<EOF
              password: passw0rd
              chpasswd: { expire: False }
              ssh_pwauth: True
              EOF

       Create the disk image which contains the user-data:

              cloud-localds my-seed.img my-user-data

       Boot the cloud-image:

              qemu -net nic -net user -hda cloud-image.img -hdb my-seed.img -m 512

       cloud-image.img is a image which supports cloud-init(1) during the boot process.
