NAME
       twill - translate WEB to TeX

SYNOPSIS
       twill [-x] webfile[.web] [changefile[.ch]]

DESCRIPTION
       The  twill  program is used to create a TeX file for viewing a Web program.  It takes appropriate care of typographic details like page layout and the use of
       indentation, italics, boldface, etc., and it supplies extensive cross-index information in the form of 'mini-indexes' for each spread of pages and a  'master
       index' at the end that it gathers automatically.

       The  command line arguments are the same as for tangle except for the option: -x says to omit the indexes, module name list, and table of contents pages.  (A
       CONTENTS.tex file will still be written when the TeX file is processed, however, unless some macros in webmac.tex are redefined.)

       The output TeX file name is formed by adding .tex to the root of the Web file name.

       There are several macros that probably should be redefined by the programmer at the beginning of the Web file.  It is a good idea to set \title to  the  name
       of the program.  And, to cause output of only changed modules, one can say \let\maybe=\iffalse (usually as the first change in the change file).

ENVIRONMENT
       The  environment  variable WEBINPUTS is used to search for the input files, or the system default if WEBINPUTS is not set.  See tex(1) for the details of the
       searching.

FILES
       $TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/knuth-lib/twimac-web.tex
           TeX macros used by twill output.
