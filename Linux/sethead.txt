Name
       sethead - Set FITS or IRAF header keyword values

Synopsis
       sethead [-dknv][r letter] <FITS or IRAF file> kw1=val1 kw2=val2 ... kwn=valuen

Description
       Set  parameters  in  the header of a FITS or IRAF image.  If the keywords do not already exist, they are added at the end of the header.  Values are assumed to be numeric if they contain no alphabetic
       characters and right-aligned.  Otherwise they are left-aligned after the equals sign, and padded by spaces to a minimum of 8 characters.  To set keywords in a list of files, substitute @<listfile> for
       the  file  names  on  the command line.  To set a lot of keywords, put them, one per line, in a file and substitute @<keylistfile> on the command line.  If two @ commands are present, the program will
       figure out which contains file names and which contains keywords.  Lines in a keyword list file which do not contain an = are ignored.

Options
       -h     Write HISTORY line into output header with sethead version, current date and time, and names of keywords set.

       -k     Write SETHEAD keyword into output header with sethead version, current date and time, and names of keywords set.  If a SETHEAD keyword already exists, move the  old  value  to  a  HISTORY  line
              before writing the new value

       -n     Write a new file with an added "e" before the extension.

       -r letter
              Rename existing keywords whose values are being reset by prepending the character "letter".  Drop the last character if the changed keyword is already 8 characters long.

       -v     Print confirmations of each parameter setting
