NAME
       rpiboot - Boot a Raspberry Pi in device mode

SYNOPSIS
       rpiboot [-d directory] [-l] [-o] [-m delay] [-v] [-s] [-0|1|2|3|4|5|6]

       rpiboot -h

DESCRIPTION
       rpiboot  is a command line utility for booting a Raspberry Pi in USB device mode.  Firmwares are provided to boot a Pi directly as a mass storage device (particularly useful for flashing Com‐
       pute Module devices with on-board eMMC storage), or you may provide a set of boot files in a directory from which to boot. This can contain an initramfs to boot with a Linux kernel.

       For more information about the bootloader EEPROM please see [EEPROM].

OPTIONS
       -d directory
              Boot the device using the boot files in directory.  Without this option, boot the device into mass storage device (MSD) mode.

       -l     Loop forever. Without this option, the application will exit once the boot files have been successfully transferred, and the device re-appears on the USB bus (e.g. as  a  mass  storage
              device).

       -o     Used in conjunction with -d to specify that files from the “overlay” sub-directory (under the directory specified with -d) should be used, if they exist.

       -m delay
              The number of micro-seconds delay between checking for new devices. Defaults to 500µs.

       -v     Produce more verbose output.

       -s     Sign boot files using bootsig.bin

       -0|1|2|3|4|5|6
              Only look for Compute Modules attached to USB port number 0 through 6.

       -h     Display a brief help page.

EXAMPLES
       rpiboot
              Boot an attached Compute Module as a mass storage device (MSD).

       rpiboot -v -1
              Boot a Compute Module on USB port 1 (only) as a mass storage device, with verbose reporting.

       rpiboot -d recovery
              Flash the default bootloader EEPROM image onto a Compute Module 4
