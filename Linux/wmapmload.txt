NAME
       wmapmload - A dockapp to monitor apm battery status

SYNOPSIS
       wmapmload [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmapmload command.

       WMApmLoad is a program to monitor apm battery status. It is a dockapp that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment.

       The  remaining  time  is  displayed in the top half.  The battery load percentage is in the bottom half in two manner : number and graphic. Next to percentage number are the on-line/on-battery and on-
       charge status. It has an LCD look-alike user interface.  The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button 1 (left) over the application. If battery status is below a critical level, an
       alarm-mode  will  alert you by turning on and off back-light. This can be stopped (and restarted) by clicking the mouse button 3 (right) over the application. An application can be launched when alarm
       is on to notify user that level is too low.  By clicking with mouse button 2 (middle), the computer can be put in STANDBY (default) or SUSPEND mode (with CONTROL key).
