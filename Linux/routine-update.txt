NAME
       routine-update - routine updater for a Debian source package

SYNOPSIS
       routine-update (-h|--help)   shows this info

DESCRIPTION
       routine-update --clone repository
              fetches and updates a remote repository

       routine-update
              updates a Debian source tree

   Other options:

       --64:       restrict the packages to 64-bit architectures

       -a|--auto: Automatically upload and tag

       -b|--branch BRANCH: Git branch that should be updated, overrides 'debian-branch' in debian/gbp.conf

       -c|--copyright-diff: Show the diff of copyright and license statements for the this update

       -d|--debug:    output debugging information, very verbose

       -e|--experimental: target distribution experimental instead of unstable

       -f|--force: also runs on projects that are up to date

       --little-endian: restrict the packages to little-endian architectures

       --no-build: prevents building the package post routine-update operations

       -p|--show-patch: display the output of git log --patch

       -t|--no-tag: do not tag version ready for upload

       -u|--no-uscan: do not run uscan and thus ignore new upstream

       Run routine-update from the root of a local instance of a Debian package's repository.  Alternatively, give the ssh, https URL or gbp-clone(1) shortcut to clone the repository, first.

TIPS
       If you have write access to Salsa, you can ensure you can push to the repository after cloning it with HTTPS or gbp-clone(1) shortcut by configuring Git like this:
       git config --global url."git@salsa.debian.org:".pushInsteadOf https://salsa.debian.org/
