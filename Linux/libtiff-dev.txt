NAME
       TIFFReadRGBAImage - read and decode an image into a fixed-format raster

SYNOPSIS
          #include <tiffio.h>

       TIFFGetR(abgr)
              ((abgr)&0xff)

       TIFFGetG(abgr)
              (((abgr) >> 8) & 0xff)

       TIFFGetB(abgr)
              (((abgr) >> 16) & 0xff)

       TIFFGetA(abgr)
              (((abgr) >> 24) & 0xff)

       int TIFFReadRGBAImage(TIFF *tif, uint32_t width, uint32_t height, uint32_t *raster, int stopOnError)

       int TIFFReadRGBAImageOriented(TIFF *tif, uint32_t width, uint32_t height, uint32_t *raster, int orientation, int stopOnError)

DESCRIPTION
       TIFFReadRGBAImage()  reads  a  strip- or tile-based image into memory, storing the result in the user supplied raster.  The raster is assumed to be an array of width × height 32-bit entries, where
       width must be less than or equal to the width of the image (height may be any non-zero size).  If the raster dimensions are smaller than the image, the image data is cropped to the raster  bounds.
       If  the raster height is greater than that of the image, then the image data are placed in the lower part of the raster.  (Note that the raster is assume to be organized such that the pixel at lo‐
       cation (x, y) is raster [ y × width + x ]; with the raster origin in the lower-left hand corner.)

       TIFFReadRGBAImageOriented() works like TIFFReadRGBAImage() except that the user can specify the raster origin position with the orientation parameter. Four orientations are supported:

       • ORIENTATION_TOPLEFT: origin in top-left corner,

       • ORIENTATION_TOPRIGHT: origin in top-right corner,

       • ORIENTATION_BOTLEFT: origin in bottom-left corner

       • ORIENTATION_BOTRIGHT: origin in bottom-right corner.

       If you choose ORIENTATION_BOTLEFT, the result will be the same as returned by the TIFFReadRGBAImage().

       Raster pixels are 8-bit packed red, green, blue, alpha samples.  The macros TIFFGetR, TIFFGetG, TIFFGetB, and TIFFGetA should be used to access individual samples.  Images without Associated Alpha
       matting information have a constant Alpha of 1.0 (255).

       TIFFReadRGBAImage() converts non-8-bit images by scaling sample values.  Palette, grayscale, bilevel, CMYK, and YCbCr images are converted to RGB transparently.  Raster pixels are returned  uncor‐
       rected by any colorimetry information present in the directory.

       The  parameter  stopOnError  specifies  how  to  act  if  an  error  is  encountered  while  reading  the  image.  If stopOnError is non-zero, then an error will terminate the operation; otherwise
       TIFFReadRGBAImage() will continue processing data until all the possible data in the image have been requested.

NOTES
       IFFReadRGBAImage() is just a wrapper around the more general TIFFRGBAImage facilities.

       For general notes see TIFFRGBImage notes.

RETURN VALUES
       1 is returned if the image was successfully read and converted.  Otherwise, 0 is returned if an error was encountered and stopOnError is zero.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFErrorExtR() routine.

       "Sorry, can not handle %d-bit pictures":
          The image had BitsPerSample other than 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.

       "Sorry, can not handle %d-channel images":
          The image had SamplesPerPixel other than 1, 3, or 4.

       Missing needed "PhotometricInterpretation" tag:
          The image did not have a tag that describes how to display the data.

       No "PhotometricInterpretation" tag, assuming RGB:
          The image was missing a tag that describes how to display it, but because it has 3 or 4 samples/pixel, it is assumed to be RGB.

       No "PhotometricInterpretation" tag, assuming min-is-black:
          The image was missing a tag that describes how to display it, but because it has 1 sample/pixel, it is assumed to be a grayscale or bilevel image.

       "No space for photometric conversion table":
          There was insufficient memory for a table used to convert image samples to 8-bit RGB.

       Missing required "Colormap" tag:
          A Palette image did not have a required Colormap tag.

       "No space for tile buffer":
          There was insufficient memory to allocate an i/o buffer.

       "No space for strip buffer":
          There was insufficient memory to allocate an i/o buffer.

       "Can not handle format":
          The image has a format (combination of BitsPerSample, SamplesPerPixel, and PhotometricInterpretation) that TIFFReadRGBAImage() can not handle.

       "No space for B&W mapping table":
          There was insufficient memory to allocate a table used to map grayscale data to RGB.

       "No space for Palette mapping table":
          There was insufficient memory to allocate a table used to map data to 8-bit RGB.
