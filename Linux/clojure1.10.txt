NAME
       clojure - a JVM-based dynamic programming language

SYNOPSIS
       clojure [-cp/-classpath classpath] [-i/--init path] [-e/--eval expr] {-h | -r | path | -} [args ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the clojure command.

       clojure is the main entry point for Clojure, a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine.   With no options or arguments, it runs an interactive Read-Eval-Print loop (REPL).

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -cp, -classpath classpath
              Specifies additional classpath elements.  Overrides the $CLASSPATH environment variable.  Must appear first if given.

       -i, --init path
              Load a file or resource at initialisation time.  May be specified multiple times.

       -e, --eval string
              Evaluate expressions in string; print non-nil values.  May be specified multiple times.

       -m, --main ns-name
              Call the -main function from a namespace with args

       -r, --repl
              Run a repl

       path   Run a script from a file or resource

       -      Run a script from standard input

       -h, -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit

PATH ARGUMENTS
       A  Clojure file can be provided as a path argument.  Files to be loaded from the classpath must be prefixed with a `@' character, and must be an absolute path to the classpath resource.  Note that the
       path will be treated as absolute within the classpath, whether it is prefixed with a slash or not.

       clojure binds *command-line-args* to a seq containing the (optional) arguments provided after the path argument; this provides a way to provide command-line arguments to your scripts.

ENVIRONMENT
       A listing of recognised environment variables is included below.

       CLASSPATH
              Specifies additional classpath elements.
