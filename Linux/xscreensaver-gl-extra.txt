NAME
       fliptext - draws pages of text whose lines transparently flip around

SYNOPSIS
       fliptext  [--display  host:display.screen]  [--window]  [--root]  [--window-id  number] [--visual visual] [--delay microseconds] [--program command] [--size integer ] [--columns integer] [--left |
       --center | --right] [--lines integer] [--speed float] [--delay usecs] [--font xlfd] [--wireframe] [--fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The fliptext program runs another program to generate a stream of text, then animates the lines of that text transparently flipping in and out in 3D.

OPTIONS
       fliptext accepts the following options:

       --window
               Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       --root  Draw on the root window.

       --window-id number
               Draw on the specified window.

       --install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       --visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       --program sh-command
               This program will be run periodically, and its output will be the text that is displayed.  Default xscreensaver-text.

               You can configure the text printed through the "Advanced" tab of xscreensaver-settings(1), or by editing your ~/.xscreensaver file.

       --size integer
               How large a font to use, in points.  (Well, in some arbitrary unit we're calling "points" for the sake of argument.)  Default: 20.

       --columns integer
               At (approximately) what column to wrap lines.  Default 80.  Wrapping is done by pixels, not characters, and lines will always wrap at the edge of the screen regardless.

       --left | --center | --right
               Whether to align the text flush left, centered, or flush right.  The default is to choose randomly each time a new screen of text is displayed.

       --lines integer
               How many lines of text should be shown at once.  Default 8.

       --speed ratio
               Change the animation speed; 0.5 to go half as fast, 2.0 to go twice as fast.

       --delay usecs
               The delay between frames of the animation; default is 10000 (1/10th second.)

       --font font-name
               The name of the font to use.  For best effect, this should be a large font (at least 36 points.)  The bigger the font, the better looking the characters will be.  Note  that  the  size  of
               this font affects only the clarity of the characters, not their size on the screen: for that, use the --size or --columns options.

               Default: -*-utopia-bold-r-normal-*-*-720-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

       --fps   Display the current frame rate, CPU load, and polygon count.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW
               The window ID to use with --root.
