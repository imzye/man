NAME
       dk_make_protocol - tool to generate protocol declarations from D-Bus introspection data

SYNOPSIS
       dk_make_protocol -i interface_file -o output_file

DESCRIPTION
       dk_make_protocol parses D-Bus interface files with introspection data and generates Objective-C @protocol declarations.  This allows invoking methods on D-Bus objects from GNUstep application
       code using the DBusKit framework.

       dk_make_protocol accepts the following options:

OPTIONS
       -i interface_file
              Expects the interface file with introspection data.

       -o output_file
              Output file for the header with the generated @protocol declarations.  If this option is omitted, the generated header will be printed on the standard output.

EXAMPLES
       dk_make_protocol -i org.freedesktop.Foo.xml -o Foo.h

SEE ALSO
       GNUstep(7).
