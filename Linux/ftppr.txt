NAME
       ftppr - FTP proxy gateway service

SYNOPSIS
       ftppr [-d] [-l[[@]logfile]] [-pport] [-iinternal_ip] [-eexternal_ip] [-hdefault_ip[:port]]

DESCRIPTION
       ftppr is FTP gateway service to allow internal users to access external FTP servers.

OPTIONS
       -I     Inetd mode. Standalone service only.

       -d     Daemonise. Detach service from console and run in the background.

       -t     Be silenT. Do not log start/stop/accept error records.

       -u     Never look for username authentication.

       -e     External address. IP address of interface proxy should initiate connections from.  By default system will deside which address to use in accordance with routing table.

       -i     Internal address. IP address proxy accepts connections to.  By default connection to any interface is accepted. It´s usually unsafe.

       -h     Default destination. It's used if targed address is not specified by user.

       -p     Port. Port proxy listens for incoming connections. Default is 21.

       -l     Log. By default logging is to stdout. If logfile is specified logging is to file. Under Unix, if ´@´ preceeds logfile, syslog is used for logging.

       -S     Increase or decrease stack size. You may want to try something like -S8192 if you experience 3proxy crashes.

CLIENTS
       You can use any FTP client, regardless of FTP proxy support. For client with FTP proxy support configure internal_ip and port in FTP proxy parameters.  For clients without FTP proxy support use inter‐
       nal_ip and port as FTP server. Address of real FTP server must be configured as a part of FTP username. Format for username is username@server, where server is address of FTP server  and  username  is
       user´s login on this FTP server. Login itself may contain ´@´ sign.  Only cleartext authentication is currently supported.
