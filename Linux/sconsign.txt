NAME
       sconsign - print SCons signature file information

SYNOPSIS
       sconsign [options...] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       Displays the contents of one or more sconsign files, the signature database files used by the SCons build tool.

       By default, sconsign dumps the entire contents of the sconsign file(s). Without options, individual dependency entries are printed in the following format:

           depfile: signature timestamp length
                   implicit_dependency_1: content_signature timestamp length
                   implicit_dependency_2: content_signature timestamp length
                   ...
                   action_signature [action string]

       None is printed in place of any missing timestamp, content signature (csig) or build action signature values for any entry or any of its dependencies. If the entry has no implicit dependencies, or no
       build action, those lines are omitted.

       By default, sconsign assumes that any file arguments that end with a .dblite suffix contains signature entries for more than one directory (that is, was specified by the SConsignFile function). Any
       file argument that has no suffix is assumed to be an old-style sconsign file containing the signature entries for a single directory. If neither of those is true, sconsign attempts to guess the
       format. If that does not work, an explicit format may be specified using the -f or --format= options.

       If there are no file arguments, the name .sconsign.dblite is assumed by default.

OPTIONS
       Various options control what information is printed and the format:

       -a, --act, --action
           Prints only the build action information for all entries or the specified entries.

       -c, --csig
           Prints only the content signature (csig) information for all entries or the specified entries.

       -d DIRECTORY, --dir=DIRECTORY
           When the signatures are being read from a .dblite file, or the -f dblite or --format=dblite options are used, prints information about only the signatures for entries in the specified DIRECTORY.

       -e ENTRY, --entry=ENTRY
           Prints information about only the specified ENTRY. Multiple -e options may be used, in which case information about each ENTRY is printed in the order in which the options are specified on the
           command line.

       -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
           The file(s) to be printed are in the specified FORMAT. Legal values are dblite (the SCons.dblite format used by default, as well as when the SConsignFile function is called, except when a filename
           argument of None is given) and sconsign (the format used for an individual .sconsign file in each directory).

       -h, --help
           Prints a help message and exits.

       -i, --implicit
           Prints the list of cached implicit dependencies for all entries or for the specified entries.

       --raw
           Prints a pretty-printed representation of the raw Python dictionary that holds build information about individual entries (both the entry itself and its implicit dependencies). An entry's build
           action is still printed in its usual format.

       -r, --readable
           Prints timestamps in a human-readable string, enclosed in single quotes.

       -t, --timestamp
           Prints the timestamp information for all entries or the specified entries.

       -v, --verbose
           Prints labels identifying each field being printed.

ENVIRONMENT
       SCONS_LIB_DIR
           Specifies the directory that contains the SCons Python module directory (e.g.  /home/aroach/scons-src/SCons).
