NAME
       cloud-sandbox - launch a cloud instance and ssh directly into it, as a 'sandbox' system

SYNOPSIS
       cloud-sandbox [instance-type [ubuntu-release]] [ec2-run-instance-options]

DESCRIPTION
       cloud-sandbox  is  a  program  that  launches a cloud instance (EC2 by default), automatically generates ssh host keys, ssh's into the launched system, and prompts the user for instance termination on
       exit.

       cloud-sandbox does the following:
        - conveniently supports simple parameters for instance-type and ubuntu-release, by passing those to ubuntu-ec2-run(1)
        - generates ssh-host keys locally using ssh-keygen(1), and passes them to the instance
        - automatically adds host key fingerprints to a local host keys file, $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts.cloud, which removes the interactive fingerprint prompt
        - uses ssh-import-id(1) in the instance to import the user's public SSH key, if the environment variable $LAUNCHPAD_ID exists
        - uses bootmail(1) to send the user email noting that the instance has booted, if the environment variable $BOOTMAIL exists and is a valid email address
        - waits in a loop for sshd(8) to start on the cloud instance
        - execs an ssh(1) session to the instance
        - upon exit, interactively prompts the user if they want to immediately terminate the instance and remote the ssh known host key
