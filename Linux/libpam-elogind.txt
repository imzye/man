NAME
       pam_elogind - Register user sessions in the elogind login manager

SYNOPSIS
       pam_elogind.so

DESCRIPTION
       pam_elogind registers user sessions with the elogind(8) login manager, and hence the elogind control group hierarchy.

       The module also applies various resource management and runtime parameters to the new session, as configured in the JSON User Records[1] of the user, when one is defined.

       On login, this module ensures the following:

        1. If it does not exist yet, the user runtime directory /run/user/$UID is either created or mounted as new "tmpfs" file system with quota applied, and its ownership changed to the user that is
           logging in.

        2. The $XDG_SESSION_ID environment variable is initialized. If auditing is available and pam_loginuid.so was run before this module (which is highly recommended), the variable is initialized from
           the auditing session id (/proc/self/sessionid). Otherwise, an independent session counter is used.

        3. The "$TZ", "$EMAIL" and "$LANG" environment variables are configured for the user, based on the respective data from the user's JSON record (if it is defined). Moreover, any environment
           variables explicitly configured in the user record are imported, and the umask, nice level, and resource limits initialized.

       On logout, this module ensures the following:

        1. If enabled in logind.conf(5) (KillUserProcesses=), all processes of the session are terminated. If the last concurrent session of a user ends, the user's elogind instance will be terminated
           too, and so will the user's slice unit.

        2. If the last concurrent session of a user ends, the user runtime directory /run/user/$UID and all its contents are removed, too.

       If the system was not booted up with elogind as init system, this module does nothing and immediately returns PAM_SUCCESS.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       class=
           Takes a string argument which sets the session class. The XDG_SESSION_CLASS environment variable (see below) takes precedence. One of "user", "greeter", "lock-screen" or "background". See
           sd_session_get_class(3) for details about the session class.

           Added in version 197.

       type=
           Takes a string argument which sets the session type. The XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable (see below) takes precedence. One of "unspecified", "tty", "x11", "wayland" or "mir". See
           sd_session_get_type(3) for details about the session type.

           Added in version 209.

       desktop=
           Takes a single, short identifier string for the desktop environment. The XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP environment variable (see below) takes precedence. This may be used to indicate the session desktop
           used, where this applies and if this information is available. For example: "GNOME", or "KDE". It is recommended to use the same identifiers and capitalization as for $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP, as
           defined by the Desktop Entry Specification[2]. (However, note that the option only takes a single item, and not a colon-separated list like $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP.) See sd_session_get_desktop(3)
           for further details.

           Added in version 240.

       default-capability-bounding-set=, default-capability-ambient-set=
           Takes a comma-separated list of process capabilities (e.g.  CAP_WAKE_ALARM, CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND, ...) to set for the invoked session's processes, if the user record does not encode appropriate
           sets of capabilities directly. See capabilities(7) for details on the capabilities concept. If not specified, the default bounding set is left as is (i.e. usually contains the full set of
           capabilities). The default ambient set is set to CAP_WAKE_ALARM for regular users if the PAM session is associated with a local seat or if it is invoked for the "elogind-user" service.
           Otherwise defaults to the empty set.

           Added in version 254.

       debug[=]
           Takes an optional boolean argument. If yes or without the argument, the module will log debugging information as it operates.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Only session is provided.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are initialized by the module and available to the processes of the user's session:

       $XDG_SESSION_ID
           A short session identifier, suitable to be used in filenames. The string itself should be considered opaque, although often it is just the audit session ID as reported by /proc/self/sessionid.
           Each ID will be assigned only once during machine uptime. It may hence be used to uniquely label files or other resources of this session. Combine this ID with the boot identifier, as returned
           by sd_id128_get_boot(3), for a globally unique identifier.

       $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
           Path to a user-private user-writable directory that is bound to the user login time on the machine. It is automatically created the first time a user logs in and removed on the user's final
           logout. If a user logs in twice at the same time, both sessions will see the same $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and the same contents. If a user logs in once, then logs out again, and logs in again, the
           directory contents will have been lost in between, but applications should not rely on this behavior and must be able to deal with stale files. To store session-private data in this directory,
           the user should include the value of $XDG_SESSION_ID in the filename. This directory shall be used for runtime file system objects such as AF_UNIX sockets, FIFOs, PID files and similar. It is
           guaranteed that this directory is local and offers the greatest possible file system feature set the operating system provides. For further details, see the XDG Base Directory
           Specification[3].  $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set if the current user is not the original user of the session.

       $TZ, $EMAIL, $LANG
           If a JSON user record is known for the user logging in these variables are initialized from the respective data in the record.

           Added in version 245.

       The following environment variables are read by the module and may be used by the PAM service to pass metadata to the module. If these variables are not set when the PAM module is invoked but can
       be determined otherwise they are set by the module, so that these variables are initialized for the session and applications if known at all.

       $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
           The session type. This may be used instead of type= on the module parameter line, and is usually preferred.

           Added in version 209.

       $XDG_SESSION_CLASS
           The session class. This may be used instead of class= on the module parameter line, and is usually preferred.

           Added in version 209.

       $XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP
           The desktop identifier. This may be used instead of desktop= on the module parameter line, and is usually preferred.

           Added in version 209.

       $XDG_SEAT
           The seat name the session shall be registered for, if any.

           Added in version 209.

       $XDG_VTNR
           The VT number the session shall be registered for, if any. (Only applies to seats with a VT available, such as "seat0")

           Added in version 209.

       If not set, pam_elogind will initialize $XDG_SEAT and $XDG_VTNR based on the $DISPLAY variable (if the latter is set).

SESSION LIMITS
       PAM modules earlier in the stack, that is those that come before pam_elogind.so, can set session scope limits using the PAM context objects. The data for these objects is provided as
       NUL-terminated C strings and maps directly to the respective unit resource control directives. Note that these limits apply to individual sessions of the user, they do not apply to all user
       processes as a combined whole.

       systemd.memory_max=
           Sets unit MemoryMax=.

           Added in version 239.

       systemd.tasks_max=
           Sets unit TasksMax=.

           Added in version 239.

       systemd.runtime_max_sec=
           Sets unit RuntimeMaxSec=.

           Added in version 244.

       Example data as can be provided from an another PAM module:

           pam_set_data(handle, "systemd.memory_max", (void *)"200M", cleanup);
           pam_set_data(handle, "systemd.tasks_max",  (void *)"50",   cleanup);
           pam_set_data(handle, "systemd.runtime_max_sec", (void *)"3600", cleanup);

EXAMPLE
       Here's an example PAM configuration fragment that allows users sessions to be managed by

       elogind:

           #%PAM-1.0
           auth            required        pam_shells.so
           auth            required        pam_nologin.so
           auth            include         system-auth
           account         required        pam_access.so
           account         required        pam_nologin.so
           account         required        pam_time.so
           account         include         system-auth
           password        include         system-auth
           session         optional        pam_loginuid.so
           session         required        pam_env.so envfile=/etc/profile.env
           session         optional        pam_lastlog.so silent
           session         include         system-auth
           session         optional        pam_motd.so motd=/etc/motd
           session         optional        pam_mail.so
           -session  optional   pam_elogind.so
