NAME
       screenruler - a graphical ruler to measure objects on screen

SYNOPSIS
       screenruler

DESCRIPTION
       ScreenRuler is a simple graphical ruler which allows you to measure horizontal or vertically any object on screen using different metric systems (pixels, centimetres, inches, picas, points or as a
       percentage).

       It  was created for GNOME desktops and can be controled either using the mouse or, if you need more precision, with the keyboard. If you need it, it also has an option to keep on top of other win‐
       dows.

OPTIONS
       As already said, ScreenRuler is a graphical application, and as such it takes no command line options. All configuration must be done using its GTK interface.
