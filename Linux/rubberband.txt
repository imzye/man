NAME
       rubberband — an audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting utility program

SYNOPSIS
       rubberband [options]  [input file]  [output file]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rubberband command.

       Rubber Band is a program that permits you to change the tempo and pitch of an audio recording independently of one another.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       You must specify at least one of the following time and pitch ratio options.

       -t, --time X
                 Stretch to X times original duration, or

       -T, --tempo X
                 Change tempo by multiple X (equivalent to --time 1/X)

       -p, --pitch X
                 Raise pitch by X semitones, or

       -f, --frequency X
                 Change frequency by multiple X

       The following option provides a simple way to adjust the sound.  See below for more details.

       -n, --crisp N
                 Crispness (N = 0,1,2,3,4,5); default 4 (see below)

       The  remaining  options fine-tune the processing mode and stretch algorithm.  These are mostly included for test purposes; the default settings and standard crispness parameter are intended to provide
       the best sounding set of options for most situations.

       -P, --precise
                 Aim for minimal time distortion (implied by -R)

       -R, --realtime
                 Select realtime mode (implies -P --no-threads)

       --no-threads
                 No extra threads regardless of CPU and channel count

       --threads Assume multi-CPU even if only one CPU is identified

       --no-transients
                 Disable phase resynchronisation at transients

       --bl-transients
                 Band-limit phase resync to extreme frequencies

       --no-peaklock
                 Disable phase locking to peak frequencies

       --no-softening
                 Disable large-ratio softening of phase locking

       --window-long
                 Use longer processing window (actual size may vary)

       --window-short
                 Use shorter processing window

       --thresh N F
                 Set internal freq threshold N (N = 0,1,2) to F Hz

       -d, --debug N
                 Select debug level (N = 0,1,2,3); default 0, full 3 (N.B. debug level 3 includes audible ticks in output)

       -q, --quiet
                 Suppress progress output

       -h, --help
                 Show a list of available options

       "Crispness" levels:

       0         equivalent to --no-transients --no-peaklock --window-long

       1         equivalent to --no-transients --no-peaklock

       2         equivalent to --no-transients

       3         equivalent to --bl-transients

       4         default processing options

       5         equivalent to --no-peaklock --window-short (may be suitable for drums)
