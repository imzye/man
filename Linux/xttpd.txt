DESCRIPTION
       XTide is a package that provides tide and current predictions in a wide variety of formats. Graphs, text listings, and calendars can be generated, or a tide clock can be provided on your desktop.

       XTide can work with X-windows, plain text terminals, or the web. This is accomplished with three separate programs: the interactive interface (xtide), the non-interactive  or  command  line  interface
       (tide), and the web interface (xttpd).

       xttpd  is an XTide web server. It provides web-based access to XTide's tide predictions by allowing a web browser to speak directly to the XTide program in HTTP.  xttpd can replace httpd or it can co-
       exist with one.

       At installation time, xttpd can be configured to integrate with systemd or it can be used in conventional init mode.

       In conventional mode, if you run xttpd with no command line arguments, it will assume that it is replacing httpd and try to bind port 80. If you want it to co-exist with an existing server, or if  you
       do not have privilege to get port 80, give it the port number as the first command line argument:
              % xttpd 8080
       You  will  then need to link it up as http://www.wherever.org:8080/ instead of just http://www.wherever.org/, but otherwise, no damage done.  Similarly, if you wish to bind a specific address, you can
       specify that as the first argument:
              % xttpd 127.0.0.2
       If you need to specify both address and port number, separate the two with a slash, like this:
              % xttpd 127.0.0.2/8080
       IPv6 addresses and hostnames are also accepted for the address.

       When systemd is used, the port and address must instead be configured in systemd configuration files.

       Once the port is established, xttpd will try to set its UID and GID to values that were specified at compile time.  If it is unable to do this, it will log failure messages to syslog  and  then  exit.
       Consequently,   if  it  is  to  be  started  by  someone  other  than  root,  that  user's  UID  and  GID  must  be  configured  at  compile  time.   Instructions  for  doing  this  are  available  at
       https://flaterco.com/xtide/installation.html.

       For a complete discussion of the command line options and a detailed explanation of the XTide package, please see the verbose documentation at https://flaterco.com/xtide/.

CONFIGURATION
       Unless a configuration file /etc/xtide.conf is supplied, you must set the environment variable HFILE_PATH to point to the harmonics files that should have been installed along with the xtide  program.
       Example:
              export HFILE_PATH=/usr/local/share/xtide/harmonics.tcd
       If  a  configuration file is used, the first line should consist of the colon-separated list of harmonics files (e.g. the HFILE_PATH line above without the "export HFILE_PATH=" part).  The environment
       variable takes precedence over the configuration file.

       Set the environment variable XTTPD_FEEDBACK to change the mail feedback address for xttpd.

OPTIONS
       -cf ``format-string''
              strftime(3) style format string for printing days in calendars (default %a %d).

       -dc color
              Daytime background color in tide graphs (default SkyBlue).

       -Dc color
              Color of datum line in tide graphs (default white).

       -df ``format-string''
              strftime(3) style format string for printing dates (default %Y-%m-%d).  For calendars see -cf.

       -ec color
              Foreground in tide graphs during outgoing tide (default SeaGreen).

       -el y|n
              Select whether or not to draw datum and middle-level lines in tide graphs (default n).

              The National Ocean Service (NOS) defines both Mean Sea Level (MSL) and Mean Tide Level (MTL) in terms of averages taken over observations.  The middle-level line is drawn at the midpoint of the
              theoretical  tidal  range,  which  usually  corresponds to the mathematical mean level of the predictions.  This approximates both MSL and MTL, but, strictly speaking, is equivalent to neither.
              Moreover, subordinate station offsets may shift the actual mean so that it no longer falls at the midpoint of the tidal range.  The datum line is drawn at the zero  level  of  the  predictions,
              which usually corresponds to the station's benchmark, but this too can be rendered inaccurate by subordinate station offsets.

       -em pSsMm
              Events to suppress (p = phase of moon, S = sunrise, s = sunset, M = moonrise, m = moonset), or x to suppress none.  E.g, to suppress all sun and moon events, set eventmask to the value pSsMm.

       -fc color
              Foreground in tide graphs during incoming tide (default Blue).

       -fg color
              Color of text and other notations (default black).

       -ga aspect
              Aspect for tide graphs (default 1.0).  This controls not the width or height of the window but rather the relative scaling of the X and Y axes in the plot of the tide curve.

       -gh pixels
              Height for tide graphs (default 312 pixels).

       -gs d|l|s
              Style of graphs and clocks.  Valid values: d (default), l (line), s (semitransparent).

       -gt y|n
              Select whether or not to label tenths of units in tide graphs (default n).

       -gw pixels
              Width for tide graphs (default 960 pixels).

       -hf ``format-string''
              strftime(3) style format string for printing hour labels on time axis (default %l).

       -in y|n
              Select whether or not to use inferred values for some constituents (default n).  For expert use only.

       -lb y|n
              Select whether or not calendar mode inserts a line break before prediction values (default n).

       -lw pixels
              Width of line in graph styles l and s (default 2.5 pixels).

       -mc color
              Color of mark line in graphs (default red).

       -Mc color
              Color of middle-level line in tide graphs (default yellow).

       -nc color
              Nighttime background color in tide graphs (default DeepSkyBlue).

       -ou y|n
              Select whether or not to print numbers with no ft/m/kt (default n). Where possible, adds a header line stating the units and datum.

       -pb y|n
              Select whether or not calendar mode inserts a page break and repeats the station header for each month (default y).

       -pi days
              Number of days of predictions to generate when no end time is specified (default 4).

       -tf ``format-string''
              strftime(3) style format string for printing times (default %l:%M %p %Z).

       -tl y|n
              Select whether or not to draw depth lines on top of the tide graph (default n).

       -u ft|m
              Preferred units of length (default no preference).

       -v     Print version string and exit.

       -z y|n Select whether or not to coerce all time zones to UTC (default n).
