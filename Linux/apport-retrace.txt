NAME
       dupdb-admin - Manage the duplicate database for apport-retrace.

SYNOPSIS
       dupdb-admin -f dbpath dump

       dupdb-admin -f dbpath changeid oldid newid

       dupdb-admin -f dbpath publish path

DESCRIPTION
       apport-retrace(1) has the capability of checking for duplicate bugs (amongst other things). It uses an SQLite database for keeping track of master bugs.  dupdb-admin is a small tool to manage
       that database.

       The  central  concept  in that database is a "crash signature", a string that uniquely identifies a particular crash. It is built from the executable path name, the signal number or exception
       name, and the topmost functions of the stack trace.

       The database maps crash signatures to the 'master' crash id and thus can close duplicate crash reports with a reference to that master ID.  It also tracks the status of crashes (open/fixed in
       a particular version) to be able to identify regressions.

MODES
       dump   Print a list of all database entries.

       changeid
              Change the associated crash ID for a particular crash.

       publish
              Export the duplicate database into a set of text files in the given directory which is suitable for WWW publishing.  If the directory already exists, it will be updated. The  new  con‐
              tent is built in a new directory which is the given one with ".new" appended, then moved to the given name in an almost atomic way.

OPTIONS
       -f path, --database-file=path
              Path to the duplicate database SQLite file.
