NAME
       faultstat - report page faults

SYNOPSIS
       faultstat [options] [delay [count]]

DESCRIPTION
       faultstat reports the major and minor page fault activity of processes.

       If a delay and count are not specified, a snapshot of the current page fault activity is displayed.

       If  a  delay  in seconds is specified, faultstat will periodically show any per-process page fault changes.  This will run indefinitely until a SIGINT is caught.   Specifying count will repeat the
       periodic output count number of times.

       -a     show page fault size changes with up arrow ↑ when they increment

       -p proclist

       -t     top mode, show top page faulting processes by current page fault changes
