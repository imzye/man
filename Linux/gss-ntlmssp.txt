NAME
       gssntlmssp - GSSAPI NTLM Security Service Provider mechanism

SYNOPSIS

       gssntlmssp_v1 2.16.840.1.113730.3.8.15.X /usr/lib64/gssntlmssp/gssntlmssp.so  [options]

DESCRIPTION
       A GSSAPI NTLM mechanism that allows to perform NTLM authentication in GSSAPI programs.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       NTLM_USER_FILE
           A file containing users and their password hashes. The file formats supported are the one used by Heimdal for its NTLM backend, and the samba password file format.

       NETBIOS_COMPUTER_NAME
           Set the NETBIOS (short) Computer name used in NTLM packets

       NETBIOS_DOMAIN_NAME
           Set the NETBIOS (short) Domain name used in NTLM packets

       NTLMUSER
           Set the NTLM User name used for authentication on initiation of the security context

       USER
           The default source for the User name used on initiation of the security context

       LM_COMPAT_LEVEL
           The LM Compatibility Level enforced during security context negotiation. The default level is 3

       GSSNTLMSSP_DEBUG
           The name of a file to send debug logs

       GSSNTLMSSP_WB_TLS_CTX
           This variable is used to control whether thread local contexts are used for winbindd communication or whether a single process context is used. Setting the value of this variable to 0 disables
           per-thread contexts. Because creating Winbindd contexts is an expensive operation this is used as an optimization in applications that can insure a single thread is used, or already handle
           their own locking. The default behavior is to create a context for each thread, this behavior can be restored by setting the environment variable back to the value 1
