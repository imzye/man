NAME
       fierce - DNS scanner that helps locate non-contiguous IP space and hostnames against specified domains.

SYNOPSIS
       fierce [-h] [--domain DOMAIN] [--connect] [--wide] [--traverse TRAVERSE] [--search SEARCH [SEARCH ...]] [--range RANGE] [--delay DELAY] [--subdomains SUBDOMAINS [SUBDOMAINS ...] | --subdomain-file
       SUBDOMAIN_FILE] [--dns-servers DNS_SERVERS [DNS_SERVERS ...] | --dns-file DNS_FILE] [--tcp]

DESCRIPTION
       Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous IP space and hostnames against specified domains. It's really meant as a pre-cursor to nmap, OpenVAS, nikto, etc, since all of
       those require that you already know what IP space you are looking for.  This does not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole internet indiscriminately. It is meant specifically to locate
       likely targets both inside and outside a corporate network.  Because it uses DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured networks that leak internal address space. That's especially useful in
       targeted malware.  Originally written by RSnake along with others at http://ha.ckers.org/.  This is simply a conversion to Python 3 to simplify and modernize the codebase.

OPTIONS
         -h, --help            show this help message and exit
         --domain DOMAIN       domain name to test
         --connect             attempt HTTP connection to non-RFC 1918 hosts
         --wide                scan entire class c of discovered records
         --traverse TRAVERSE   scan IPs near discovered records, this won't enter adjacent class c's
         --search SEARCH [SEARCH ...]
                               filter on these domains when expanding lookup
         --range RANGE         scan an internal IP range, use cidr notation
         --delay DELAY         time to wait between lookups
         --subdomains SUBDOMAINS [SUBDOMAINS ...]
                               use these subdomains
         --subdomain-file SUBDOMAIN_FILE
                               use subdomains specified in this file (one per line)
         --dns-servers DNS_SERVERS [DNS_SERVERS ...]
                               use these dns servers for reverse lookups
         --dns-file DNS_FILE   use dns servers specified in this file for reverse lookups (one per line)
         --tcp                 use TCP instead of UDP

EXAMPLES
       Something basic:
              $ fierce --domain google.com --subdomains accounts admin ads

       Traverse IPs near discovered domains to search for contiguous blocks with the `--traverse` flag:
              $ fierce --domain facebook.com --subdomains admin --traverse 10

       Limit nearby IP traversal to certain domains with the `--search` flag:
              $ fierce --domain facebook.com --subdomains admin --search fb.com fb.net

       Attempt an `HTTP` connection on domains discovered with the `--connect` flag:
              $ fierce --domain stackoverflow.com --subdomains mail --connect

       Exchange  speed  for breadth with the `--wide` flag, which looks for nearby domains on all IPs of the [/24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks) of a dis‐
       covered domain:
              $ fierce --domain facebook.com --wide

       Zone transfers are rare these days, but they give us the keys to the DNS castle. [zonetransfer.me](https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php) is a very useful  service  for  testing  for  and
       learning about zone transfers:
              $ fierce --domain zonetransfer.me

       To save the results to a file for later use we can simply redirect output:
              $ fierce --domain zonetransfer.me > output.txt

       Internal networks will often have large blocks of contiguous IP space assigned. We can scan those as well:
              $ fierce --dns-servers 10.0.0.1 --range 10.0.0.0/24

                                                                                                                                                                                                  FIERCE(1)
