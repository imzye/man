NAME
       zenon - Automated theorem prover for first-order classical logic

SYNOPSIS
       zenon [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Zenon  is  an automated theorem prover for first order classical logic with equality, based on the tableau method.  Zenon can read input files in TPTP, Coq, Focal, and its own Zenon format.  Zenon can
       directly generate Coq proofs (proof scripts or proof terms), which can be reinserted into Coq specifications.  Zenon can also be extended.

OPTIONS
       If file is "-", it will read input from stdin.

       -context  provide context for checking the proof independently

       -d        debug mode

       -errmsg <message>
                 prefix warnings and errors with <message>

       -help, --help
                 print this option list and exit

       -I <dir>  add <dir> to the include path (for TPTP input format)

       -icoq     read input file in Coq format

       -ifocal   read input file in Focal format

       -itptp    read input file in TPTP format

       -iz       read input file in Zenon format (default)

       -loadpath path to Zenon's coq libraries (default /usr/share/zenon)

       -max <s>[kMGT]/<i>[kMGT]/<t>[smhd]
                 set size, step, and time limits

       -max-size <s>[kMGT]
                 limit heap size to <s> kilo/mega/giga/tera word (default 100M)

       -max-step <i>[kMGT]
                 limit number of steps to <s> kilo/mega/giga/tera (default 10k)

       -max-time <t>[smhd]
                 limit CPU time to <t> second/minute/hour/day (default 5m)

       -ocoq     print the proof in Coq script format

       -ocoqterm print the proof in Coq term format

       -oh       <n>             print the proof in high-level format up to depth <n>

       -ol       print the proof in low-level format

       -olx      print the proof in raw low-level format

       -om       print the proof in middle-level format

       -onone    do not print the proof (default)

       -opt0     do not optimise the proof

       -opt1     do peephole optimisation of the proof (default)

       -p0       turn off progress bar and progress messages

       -p1       display progress bar (default)

       -p2       display progress messages

       -q        (quiet) suppress proof-found/no-proof/begin-proof/end-proof

       -rename   prefix all input symbols to avoid clashes

       -rnd <seed>
                 randomize proof search

       -stats    print statistics

       -short    output a less detailed proof

       -v        print version string and exit

       -versions print CVS version strings and exit

       -w        suppress warnings

       -where    print the location of the zenon library and exit

       -wout <file>
                 output errors and warnings to <file> instead of stderr

       -x <ext>  activate extension <ext>

EXAMPLE
       The command:
                zenon -itptp -ocoq /usr/share/zenon*/examples/tptp-COM003+2.p
       will take the input file "tptp-COM003+2.p" in TPTP format (-itptp), search for a proof, and produce any proof output in Coq format (-ocoq).  tptp-COM003+2.p is a TPTP  representation  of  the  halting
       problem.  Zenon can prove this, and will print out:
              (* PROOF-FOUND *)
              (* BEGIN-PROOF *)
              ... details of proof in Coq format
              (* END-PROOF *)
