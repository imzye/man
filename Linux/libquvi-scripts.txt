NAME
       libquvi-scripts - Overview of the library scripts

DESCRIPTION
       libquvi-scripts contains the Lua scripts for libquvi that it uses to parse the different properties, such as the media properties.

TYPES
   Common scripts
       The common scripts are modules that may be loaded from other scripts, e.g. the quvi-modules(7).

       These scripts are typically installed at
           $prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/$major_ver.$minor_ver/common/

   Media scripts
       The media scripts are responsible for parsing the media properties, e.g. the media stream URLs. There is usually a media script for each supported website.

       These scripts are typically installed at
           $prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/$major_ver.$minor_ver/media/

   Playlist scripts
       The playlist scripts are responsible for parsing the playlist properties. There is usually a playlist script for each supported website.

       These scripts are typically installed at
           $prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/$major_ver.$minor_ver/playlist/

   Scan scripts
       The scan scripts are used to scan an URL for embedded media URLs.

       These scripts are typically installed at
           $prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/$major_ver.$minor_ver/scan/

   Subtitlte scripts
       The subtitle scripts are responsible for retrieving subtitle data for the media as well as exporting the data to another format, e.g. SubRip.

       These scripts are typically installed at
           $prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/$major_ver.$minor_ver/subtitle/ $prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/$major_ver.$minor_ver/subtitle/export/

   Utility scripts
       The utility scripts are used by libquvi to perform misc. tasks, such as parsing file extension from a content-type, or converting HTML entities to UTF-8 characters.

       These scripts are typically installed at
           $prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/$major_ver.$minor_ver/util/

ENVIRONMENT
       LIBQUVI_SCRIPTS_VERBOSE
           When defined, enables the output from any libquvi scripts using the debug facility (quvi/debug module).
