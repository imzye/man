NAME
       clit - program to manipulate Microsoft Reader .LIT files

SYNOPSIS
       1.  clit [options] litfile.lit subdir/
       2.  clit [options] oldfile.lit newfile.lit
       3.  clit [options] oldfile.lit newfile.lit inscription

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the clit command.

       ConvLIT is a program to convert Microsoft Reader format eBooks [LIT] into an open format.  clit supports three modes of operation:

       1.     Explosion: expanding a LIT file into an OEBPS compliant package, that is the original XML / HTML source.

       2.     Downconverting: converts to DRM1 format, also known as sealing the LIT file.

       3.     Inscribing: similar to #2, this adds a label, or inscription, to the ebook to mark that it belongs to you.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, run the program without any arguments.

       -d     Disable creating multiple subdirectories.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -k   /path/to/keys.txt
              The DRM5 key file is assumed to be called keys.txt and located in the current directory.  If not, use this option to instruct ConvLIT where to find the key file.
