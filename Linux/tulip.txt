       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in HTML format; see below.

       The programs are documented fully by the Tulip User Manual available on the Tulip website (link to URL https://tulip.labri.fr/Documentation/current/tulip-user/html/index.html)
