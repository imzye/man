NAME
       dh_raku_test -- automatically test perl 6 module packages

SYNOPSIS
       dh_raku_test

DESCRIPTION
       This script calls "prove --exec raku -Ilib" to test a Raku module package. It only does so if three conditions are met:

       •   A 't' directory exists

       •   The debhelper build option 'nocheck' is not set

   HOME directory
       Before launching tests, the "HOME" directory is set to "debian/tmp/home". This directory is cleaned up after the tests are done.

   Breaking build dependency loop
       This script use to call c<prove6> but it caused a lot of problems because of dependency loop. Now only Perl's prove is used.
