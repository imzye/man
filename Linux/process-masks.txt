NAME
       process-masks - Preprocessor for enblend masks

Synopsis
         process-masks image1_mask.tif [image2_mask.tif ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Transfers white areas in each mask (indicating pixels to keep) as black areas in other masks.  Areas to be blended need to be indicated as shades of grey.

       Pass mask tif files as program arguments, originals are renamed and replaced by processed files.

       Requires ImageMagick.

       Note masks can be any bit depth, but with no alpha channel.
