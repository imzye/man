DESCRIPTION
       GROMACS  is  a  full-featured  suite  of  programs to perform molecular
       dynamics simulations, i.e., to simulate the behavior  of  systems  with
       hundreds  to millions of particles using Newtonian equations of motion.
       It is primarily used for research on proteins,  lipids,  and  polymers,
       but  can  be  applied  to  a  wide  variety  of chemical and biological
       research questions.
