DESCRIPTION
       Parallel Python Network Server (pp-1.7.7)

OPTIONS
       -h                 : this help message

       -d                 : set log level to debug

       -f format          : log format

       -a                 : enable auto-discovery service

       -r                 : restart worker process after each task completion

       -n proto           : protocol number for pickle module

       -c path            : path to config file

       -i interface       : interface to listen

       -b broadcast       : broadcast address for auto-discovery service

       -p port            : port to listen

       -w nworkers        : number of workers to start

       -s secret          : secret for authentication

       -t seconds         : timeout to exit if no connections with clients exist

       -k seconds         : socket timeout in seconds

       -P pid_file        : file to write PID to

       To print server stats send SIGUSR1 to its main process (unix only).

       Due to the security concerns always use a non-trivial secret key.  Secret key set by -s switch will override secret key assigned by pp_secret variable in .pythonrc.py
