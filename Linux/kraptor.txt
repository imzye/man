NAME
       kraptor - a classic shoot 'em up scroller game

SYNOPSIS
       kraptor [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Kraptor is a classic shoot 'em up scroller game, where you must fight against tons of bad dudes. The game offers high speed action with massive destruction and lots of fun. Kraptor features a pow‐
       erful engine for 2D shooter scroller games.

       After  years of oppression the slaved people of the world have raised against their masters. You, a mercenary pilot, have been contacted by the popular rebellion to fight against the forces of op‐
       pression.

       In the morning you jump into your cockpit and start up the engines. It's time to get airborne and start the attack. Get ready to defeat the scum hired by the masters. Fighting for freedom  is  the
       only way, you're on a mission, don't defraud us...

USAGE
       You  must  fly your plane and fight your enemies through a series of different levels. You can move your plane with the mouse, fire your current selected weapon with your left mouse button and use
       the right mouse button to change weapons.

       There's access to a 'black market' shop between levels where you can buy new weapons and upgrade your ship. You can always save your game at that point, so you don't have to start from the  begin‐
       ning every time you play the game.
