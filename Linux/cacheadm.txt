NAME
       cacheadm - administer and configure AtFS derived object cache

SYNOPSIS
       cacheadm [-Amax_cached_per_cacheattr] [-Nmax_cached_per_name] [-Tmax_total_cached] [-q] [-v] directories

DESCRIPTION
       cacheadm provides control over the size of a derived object cache. You may set the maximum total number (T) of derived files to be stored, the maximum number of derived files per name (N) and the max‐
       imum number of derived files with the same name and the same caching attribute (A). Called without any options, cacheadm returns the actual sizes of the derived object caches in the named  dirctories.
       An empty list of directories causes cacheadm to operate on the current directory.

       The relationship of the three cache size values must always be T >= N >= A. The caching attribute mechanism is described on the af_cache(3) manual page.  When calculating your caching sizes you should
       keep in mind that you may set the total size (T) to any value but your cache will never grow bigger than N*number_of_names.  Number_of_names is the number of source object histories in  your  directo‐
       ries, where derived objects may be compiled from. If you set T to an astronomic value, the cache adapt it's size to the number of source histories automatically.

       In  the  current  implementation,  the  caching  sizes  can only be increased. Reduction of the maximum cache size is only possible when the cache is empty. Hence you have to clean your cache (atfsre‐
       pair -C (1)) first if you want to shrink its size.

OPTIONS
       -A max_cached_per_cacheattr
               Set the maximum number of derived files with the same name and the same caching attribute to be stored. Default is 1.

       -N max_cached_per_name
               Set the maximum number of derived files with the same name to be stored. Default is 3.

       -T max_total_cached
               Set the total maximum number of derived files to be stored in the derived object cache. Default is 64.  -q Quiet operation. Suppresses any output to stdout. This option does not  affect  error
               messages (stderr).

       -v      Output version identification string.
