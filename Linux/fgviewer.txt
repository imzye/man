NAME
       fgviewer - An alternative FlightGear viewer application

SYNOPSIS
       fgviewer  [--fg-root  rootdir] [--fg-scenery scenerydir] [--config con‐

DESCRIPTION
       fgviewer  is a viewer application that allows you to examine FlightGear
       scenery and objects without starting fgfs(1).

OPTIONS
       --fg-root rootdir
              Set the FlightGear data root directory ($FG_ROOT) to rootdir. If
              this  option is not set, fgviewer uses the path specified in the
              FG_ROOT environment variable or,  absent  that,  the  FlightGear
              data directory chosen at the time the program was compiled.

       --fg-scenery scenerydir
              Set  the  FlightGear scenery directory ($FG_SCENERY) to scenery‐
              dir.  If this option is not set, fgviewer uses the  path  speci‐
              fied in the FG_SCENERY environment variable or, absent that, the
              Scenery subdirectory inside $FG_ROOT.

       --config configfile
              Read configuration directives from configfile.

       --prop property value
              Set the property named property to value.

       --renderer rend
              Use the renderer named rend to render the scenery.  This  option
              is currently not supported.

       --hla  Enable HLA federation.

       --federation fed
              Enable a custom federation named fed.

EXIT STATUS
       fgviewer  exits  with EXIT_SUCCESS on success, with EXIT_FAILURE if the
       syntax of the command-line arguments is wrong or an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
       FG_ROOT
           If FG_ROOT is set and --fg-root is not set, it specifies  the  root
           data directory to use.

       FG_SCENERY
           If  FG_SCENERY is set and --fg-scenery is not set, it specifies the
           scenery directory to use.

FILES
       $FG_ROOT/defaults.xml
           Default preferences file loaded on startup.
