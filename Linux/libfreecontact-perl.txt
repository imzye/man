NAME
       FreeContact - fast protein contact predictor

SYNOPSIS
         use FreeContact;

         open(EXAMPLE, '<', '/usr/share/doc/libfreecontact-perl/examples/demo_1000.aln') || confess($!);
         my @aln = <EXAMPLE>; chomp(@aln); close(EXAMPLE);

         my $contacts = FreeContact::Predictor->new()->run(ali => \@aln);

         my $predictor = FreeContact::Predictor->new();
         my %parset = FreeContact::get_ps_evfold();
         my $contacts = $predictor->run(ali => \@aln, %parset, num_threads => 1);

         my $predictor = FreeContact::Predictor->new();
         my($aliw, $wtot) = $predictor->get_seq_weights(ali => \@aln, num_threads => 1);
         my $contacts = $predictor->run_with_seq_weights(ali => \@aln, aliw => $aliw, wtot => $wtot, num_threads => 1);

DESCRIPTION
       FreeContact is a protein residue contact predictor optimized for speed.  Its input is a multiple sequence alignment. FreeContact can function as an accelerated drop-in for the published contact
       predictors EVfold-mfDCA of DS. Marks (2011) and PSICOV of D. Jones (2011).  FreeContact is accelerated by a combination of vector instructions, multiple threads, and faster implementation of key
       parts.  Depending on the alignment, 10-fold or higher speedups are possible.

       A sufficiently large alignment is required for meaningful results.  As a minimum, an alignment with an effective (after-weighting) sequence count bigger than the length of the query sequence
       should be used. Alignments with tens of thousands of (effective) sequences are considered good input.

       jackhmmer(1) from the hmmer package, or hhblits(1) from hhsuite can be used to generate the alignments, for example.

FreeContact
   EXPORT_OK
       get_ps_evfold()
           Get parameters for EVfold-mfDCA operating mode.

       get_ps_psicov()
           Get parameters for PSICOV 'improved results' operating mode.

       get_ps_psicov_sd()
           Get parameters for PSICOV 'sensible default' operating mode. This is much faster than 'improved results' for a slight loss of precision.

           These  get_ps_()  functions return a hash of arguments (clustpc => num,...,rho => num) that can be used with get_seq_weights(), run() or run_with_seq_weights(). The arguments correspond to the
           published parametrization of the respective method.

FreeContact::Predictor
   Constructor
       new( dbg => bool )
           Creates an "FreeContact::Predictor".

   Methods
       get_seq_weights()
           Defaults for the arguments are obtained with get_ps_evfold().

       run(ali => [], clustpc => dbl, density => dbl, gapth => dbl, mincontsep => uint, pseudocnt => dbl, pscnt_weight => dbl, estimate_ivcov => bool, shrink_lambda => dbl, cov20 => bool, apply_gapth =>
       bool, rho => dbl, [veczw => bool], [num_threads => int], [icme_timeout => int], [timing => {}])
           Defaults for the arguments are obtained with get_ps_evfold().

           ali Reference to array holding alignment rows as strings. The first row must hold the query, with no gaps.

           clustpc
               BLOSUM-style clustering similarity threshold [0-1].

           icme_timeout
               Inverse covariance matrix estimation timeout in seconds. Default: 1800.

               The estimation sometimes gets stuck. If the timeout is reached, the run() method dies with "Caught FreeContact timeout exception: ...". You can  catch  this  exception  and  handle  it  as
               needed, e.g. by setting a higher rho value.

           num_threads
               Number of OpenMP threads to use. If unset, all CPUs are used.

           timing
               If given, this hash reference is filled with data containing wall clock timing results in seconds:

                 {
                   num_threads =>  NUM,
                   seqw =>         NUM,
                   pairfreq =>     NUM,
                   shrink =>       NUM,
                   inv =>          NUM,
                   all =>          NUM
                 }

           run() returns a hash reference of contact prediction results:

             {
               fro => [  # identifier of scoring scheme
                 [
                   I,    # 0-based index of amino acid i
                   J,    # 0-based index of amino acid j
                   SCORE # contact score
                 ], ...
               ],
               MI => ...,
               l1norm => ...
             }

           Use 'fro' scores with EVfold.
