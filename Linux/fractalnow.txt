NAME
       fractalnow - Generate fractal images.

SYNOPSYS
       fractalnow [OPTIONS] -c <Config> [-x <Width>|-y <Height>] -o <Output>
       fractalnow [OPTIONS] -f <Fractal> -r <Rendering> [-x <Width>|-y <Height>] -o <Output>

DESCRIPTION
       FractalNow is a command line tool that generates pictures of fractals as Portable PixMap (PPM) files.
       It is multi-threaded and implements advanced algorithms and heuristics that make computation very fast compared to most existing free fractal generators.
       See QFractalNow, a graphical tool to explore fractals.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print help.

       -q     Quiet mode, only errors are displayed.

       -v     Verbose mode.

       -j <NbThreads>
              Specify number of threads (see help for default value).

       -g <GradientFile>
              Specify gradient file, overriding gradient from configuration/ rendering file.

       -l <FloatType>
              Specify float type:
              single     Single precision.
              double     Double precision.
              ldouble    Long double precision.
              mp         Multiple precision.

       -L <MPPrecision>
              Specify precision of Multiple Precision (MP) floats (see help for default value).

       -a <AntiAliasingMethod>
              Specify anti-aliasing method:
              none          By default.
              blur          Gaussian blur.
              oversampling  Oversampling.
              adaptive      Smart oversampling.

       -s <AAMSize>
              Specify size for anti-aliasing:
              Radius for blur (values in [2.5, 4] are generally good).
              Scale factor for oversampling ([3, 5] is good for a high quality image).
              Scale factor for adaptive (integers between 3-5 are good for a high quality image).

       -p <AAMThreshold>
              Threshold for adaptive anti-aliasing (see help for default value).

       -i <QuadSize>
              Maximum size of quadrilaterals for linear interpolation.
              Default is good for no visible loss of quality (see help for default value).
              1 means no interpolation (all pixels are computed).

       -t <Threshold>
              Dissimilarity threshold for quad interpolation.
              Default is good for no visible loss of quality (see help for default value).
              A quadrilateral that shows too dissimilar values at its corners will be computed, as opposed to interpolated.
