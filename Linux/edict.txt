NAME
       edict-grep - search EDICT files with specific queries

SYNOPSIS
       edict-grep [options] <query>...

DESCRIPTION
       The edict-grep command is used to search the EDICT file(s) for specific queries based on various options.

OPTIONS
       -c     Match only common entries.

       -w     Word match; each English query must match whole words only.

       -e     Exact match; each query must match an entire EDICT field.

       -s     Make English queries case-sensitive (default is insensitive).

       -f EDICT_FILE
              Path to EDICT file (default: /usr/share/edict/edict). This program assumes EDICT is in the original EUC-JP encoding.

       -c     Current terminal character encoding (default: UTF-8).

       -h     Show this message.

EXAMPLES
       If you use multiple queries, it is like an AND search. For example:
              $ edict-grep cold war
       will match all entries mentioning both 'cold' and 'war'. To search for an exact sentence, use shell escaping:
              $ edict-grep 'cold war'
       (and consider -e).

NOTES
       Be sure to put the queries only AFTER all options!
