NAME
       Lucene::QueryParser - Turn a Lucene query into a Perl data structure

SYNOPSIS
         use Lucene::QueryParser;
         my $structure = parse_query("red and yellow and -(coat:pink and green)");

       $structure will be:

        [ { query => 'TERM', type => 'NORMAL', term => 'red' },
          { query => 'TERM', type => 'NORMAL', term => 'yellow' },
          { subquery => [
               { query => 'TERM', type => 'NORMAL', term => 'pink', field => 'coat' },
               { query => 'TERM', type => 'NORMAL', term => 'green' }
            ], query => 'SUBQUERY', type => 'PROHIBITED'
          }
        ]

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses a Lucene query, as defined by http://lucene.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/faq/faqmanager.cgi?file=chapter.search&toc=faq#q5

       It deals with fields, types, phrases, subqueries, and so on; everything handled by the "SimpleQuery" class in Lucene. The data structure is similar to the one given above, and is pretty self-
       explanatory.

       The other function, "deparse_query" turns such a data structure back into a Lucene query string. This is useful if you've just been mucking about with the data.

   PLUCENE
       Note for people using Plucene: the big arrayref and the hashes in the output of "parse_query" are actually objects. They're not "Plucene::Query" objects, because then everyone who wanted to do
       search queries would have to pull in Plucene, which is a bit unfair. However, they can be turned into "Plucene::Query"s by calling "to_plucene" on them. The argument to "to_plucene" should be the
       default field to search if none is supplied.

   EXPORT
       Exports the "parse_query" and "deparse_query" functions.
