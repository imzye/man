NAME
       claws-mail-fetchinfo-plugin - inserts headers with download information

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-fetchinfo-plugin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-fetchinfo-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin enables adding several extra headers to the received mails containing additional download information. These headers can be used later in filtering or processing rules, extending mail
       identification and/or classification capabilities.

       Currently the following headers can be added:

       X-FETCH-ACCOUNT
           Receiving account name from Claws Mail configuration (As appears in the accountrc file).

       X-FETCH-SERVER
           POP3 server used for downloading.

       X-FETCH-TIME
           Timestamp of download, RFC-822 formatted.

       X-FETCH-UIDL
           UIDL specifying the message on the server.

       X-FETCH-USERID
           Username in the receiving account.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For  this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named fetchinfo_plugin.so, and press
       the “Open” button.
