KEA-DHCP6(8)                          Kea                         KEA-DHCP6(8)

NAME
       kea-dhcp6 - DHCPv6 server in Kea

SYNOPSIS
       kea-dhcp6  [-v]  [-V]  [-W]  [-d] [-c config-file] [-t config-file] [-p
       server-port-number]

DESCRIPTION
       The kea-dhcp6 daemon provides the DHCPv6 server implementation.

ARGUMENTS
       The arguments are as follows:

       -v     Displays the version.

       -V     Displays the extended version.

       -W     Displays the configuration report.

       -d     Enables the debug mode with extra verbosity.

       -c config-file
              Specifies the configuration file with the configuration for  the
              DHCPv6  server.  It  may  also contain configuration entries for
              other Kea services.

       -t config-file
              Checks the configuration file and reports the  first  error,  if
              any.  Note  that  not  all parameters are completely checked; in
              particular, service and control channel sockets are not  opened,
              and hook libraries are not loaded.

       -p server-port-number
              Specifies  the  server port number (1-65535) on which the server
              listens. This is useful for testing purposes only.

DOCUMENTATION
       Kea comes with an extensive Kea  Administrator  Reference  Manual  that
       covers all aspects of running the Kea software - compilation, installa‐
       tion, configuration, configuration examples, and much  more.  Kea  also
       features  a  Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea
       can print with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
       available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea distribu‐
       tion.     The     Kea      documentation      is      available      at
       https://kb.isc.org/docs/kea-administrator-reference-manual .

       Kea  source code is documented in the Kea Developer's Guide. Its online
       version is available at https://jenkins.isc.org/job/Kea_doc/doxygen/.

       The Kea project website is available at https://kea.isc.org.

MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT
       There are two public mailing  lists  available  for  the  Kea  project.
       kea-users (kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while
       kea-dev (kea-dev at lists.isc.org)  is  intended  for  Kea  developers,
       prospective  contributors,  and  other  advanced  users. Both lists are
       available at https://lists.isc.org. The community provides  best-effort
       support on both of those lists.

       ISC    provides    professional   support   for   Kea   services.   See
       https://www.isc.org/kea/ for details.

HISTORY
       The b10-dhcp6 daemon was first coded in June 2011 by Tomek Mrugalski.

       Kea became a standalone server and the BIND 10 framework  was  removed.
       The DHCPv6 server binary was renamed to kea-dhcp6 in July 2014.
