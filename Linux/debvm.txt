NAME
       debefivm-ukify - Create Unified Kernel Images for UEFI systems in a similar way to systemd's ukify

SYNOPSIS
       debefivm-ukify build --linux=vmlinuz --output=uki.efi [options]

DESCRIPTION
       debefivm-ukify is a reimplementation of parts of systemd-ukify and mainly meant for backports.  Please prefer systemd's implementation.  It only supports the build subcommand, does not implement
       any functionality related to secure boot and lacks configuration file support.  Other than that, it can be used to assemble a linux kernel image, an initrd and an EFI stub image from systemd into
       an EFI-bootable Unified Kernel Image.

OPTIONS
       --deb-arch=debian_architecture
               Set  the  architecture  of  the supplied and produced artifacts using Debian's architecture nomenclature.  See --efi-arch for another supplying it using the EFI nomenclature instead.  This
               option is not available on the systemd implementation.

       --devicetree=devicetree_blob
               Add a device tree file as a dtb section to the generated UKI.  There can be at most one device tree.

       --cmdline=kernel_cmdline
               Supply extra arguments to be appended to the Linux kernel command line during boot.  Can be given given at most once.  If the value starts with an @, it is  treated  as  a  filename  whose
               contents will be added.

       --efi-arch=efi_architecture
               Set the architecture of the supplied and produced artifacts using EFI's architecture nomenclature.  See --deb-arch for another supplying it using the Debian nomenclature instead.

       --initrd=initrd
               Supply an initrd image to be embedded.  There can be at most one initrd.

       --linux=vmlinuz
               Supply a Linux kernel image to be embedded.  This option must be given exactly once.

       --os-release=release_information
               Set the os-release description of in the UKI.  Can be given given at most once.  If the value starts with an @, it is treated as a filename whose contents will be added.

       --output=<uki.efi>
               Set the name of the resulting UKI image.  This option must be given exactly once and the target file must not exist already.

       --section=<name:value>
               Add  an  arbitrary  ELF section to the resulting UKI.  If the value starts with an @, it is treated as a filename whose contents will be added.  Most image components actually are such ELF
               sections.  For instance --os-release, adds a section named osrel.

       --stub=efi_stub
               Supply the location of systemd's EFI stub image.  Unlike the systemd implementation, this option accepts a directory containing stubs named by architecture.   By  default,  stubs  will  be
               looked up in /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi.

       --verbose
               Print diagnostic information during image conversion.  This option is not available on the systemd implementation.
