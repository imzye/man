NAME
       bbackupd.conf - Box Backup client daemon configuration file

SYNOPSIS

       /etc/box/bbackupd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       AccountNumber
           The account number of this client. This is set by the admin of the store server.

       UpdateStoreInterval
           Specifies the interval between scanning of the local discs. To avoid cycles of load on the server, this time is randomly adjusted by a small percentage as the daemon runs. Defaults to 1 hour.

       MinimumFileAge
           Specifies how long since a file was last modified before it will be uploaded. Defaults to 6 hours.

       MaxUploadWait
           If a file is repeatedly modified it won't be uploaded immediately in case it's modified again. However it should be uploaded eventually. This is how long we should wait after first noticing a
           change. Defaults to 1 day.

       MaxFileTimeInFuture

       AutomaticBackup

       SyncAllowScript
           Use this to temporarily stop bbackupd from syncronising or connecting to the store. This specifies a program or script script which is run just before each sync, and ideally the full path to
           the interpreter. It will be run as the same user bbackupd is running as, usually root.

           The script prints either "now" or a number to STDOUT (and a terminating newline, no quotes). If the result was "now", then the sync will happen. If it's a number, then the script will be asked
           again in that number of seconds.

           For example, you could use this on a laptop to only backup when on a specific network.

       MaximumDiffingTime
           How much time should be spent on diffing files.

       FileTrackingSizeThreshold

       DiffingUploadSizeThreshold

       StoreHostname
           The hostname or IP address of the bbstored(8) server.

       StorePort
           The port used by the server. Defaults to 2201.

       ExtendedLogging
           Logs everything that happens between the client and server. The bbackupd(8) client must also be started with -V.

       ExtendedLogFile

       LogAllFileAccess

       LogFile

       LogFileLevel

       CommandSocket
           Where the command socket is created in the filesystem.

       KeepAliveTime

       StoreObjectInfoFile

       NotifyScript
           The location of the script which runs at certain events. This script is generated by bbackupd-config(8). Defaults to /etc/box/bbackupd/NotifySysAdmin.sh.

       NotifyAlways

       CertificateFile
           The path to the client's public certificate.

       PrivateKeyFile
           The path to the client's private key. This should only be readable by root.

       TrustedCAsFile
           The Certificate Authority created by bbstored-certs(8).

       KeysFile
           The data encryption key. This must be kept safe at all costs, your data is useless without it!

       DataDirectory
           A directory to keep temporary state files. This is usually something like /var/bbackupd.

       Server
           This section relates to the running daemon.

           PidFile
               The location of the process ID file. Defaults to /var/run/bbackupd.pid.

       BackupLocations
           This section defines each directory to be backed up. Each entry must have at least a Path entry and, optionally, include and exclude directives.

           Multiple include and exclude directives may appear.

           Path
               The path to back up.

           ExcludeFile
               Exclude a single file.

           ExcludeFilesRegex
               Exclude multiple files based on a regular expression. See re_format(7).

           ExcludeDir
               Exclude a single directory.

           ExcludeDirsRegex
               Exclude multiple directories based on a regular expression. See re_format(7).

           AlwaysIncludeFile
               Include a single file from a directory which has been excluded.

           AlwaysIncludeFilesRegex
               Include multiple files from an excluded directory, based on a regular expression.

           AlwaysIncludeDir
               Include a single directory from a directory which has been excluded.

           AlwaysIncludeDirsRegex
               Include multiple directories from an excluded directory, based on a regular expression.

EXAMPLES
       The following is an example of a backup location:

           home
           {
              Path = /home
              ExcludeDir = /home/guest
              ExcludeDir = /home/[^/]+/tmp
              ExcludeFilesRegex = .*\.(mp3|MP3)$
              AlwaysIncludeFile = /home/someuser/importantspeech.mp3
           }
