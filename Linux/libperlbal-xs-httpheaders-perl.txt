NAME
       Perlbal::XS::HTTPHeaders - Perlbal extension for processing HTTP headers.

SYNOPSIS
         use HTTPHeaders;

         my $hdr = Perlbal::XS::HTTPHeaders->new("GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n");
         if ($hdr->getMethod == M_GET()) {
           print "GET: ", $hdr->getURI(), "\n";
           print "Connection: ", $hdr->getHeader('Connection'), "\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to read HTTP headers from a string and to parse them into an internal storage format for easy access and modification.  You can also ask the module to reconstitute the headers
       into one big string, useful if you're writing a proxy and need to read and write headers while maintaining the ability to modify individual parts of the whole.

       The goal is to be fast.  This is a lot faster than doing all of the text processing in Perl directly, and a lot of the flexibility of Perl is maintained by implementing the library in Perl and
       descending from Perlbal::HTTPHeaders.
