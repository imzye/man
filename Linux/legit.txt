LEGIT: GIT FOR HUMANS()                                                                                                                                                             LEGIT: GIT FOR HUMANS()

NAME
       Legit: Git for Humans -

       Inspired by GitHub for Mac.

THE CONCEPT
       GitHub for Mac <http://mac.github.com>
        is not just a Git client.

       This comment <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2684483>
        on Hacker News says it best:
          They  haven't  re-created the git CLI tool in a GUI, they've created something different. They've created a tool that makes Git more accessible. Little things like auto-stashing when you switch
          branches will confuse git veterans, but it will make Git much easier to grok for newcomers because of the assumptions it makes about your Git workflow.

       Why not bring this innovation back to the command line?

THE INTERFACE
       switch <branch>
              Switches to specified branch.  Defaults to current branch.  Automatically stashes and unstashes any changes. (alias: sw)

       sync [<branch>]
              Synchronizes the given branch. Defaults to current branch.  Stash, Fetch, Auto-Merge/Rebase, Push, and Unstash.  You can only sync published branches. (alias: sy)

       publish [<branch>]
              Publishes specified branch to the remote. (alias: pub)

       unpublish <branch>
              Removes specified branch from the remote. (alias: unp)

       undo   Un-does the last commit in git history.  (alias: un)

       branches [<wildcard pattern>]
              Display a list of available branches.  Allows wildcard pattern matching of branch name.

THE INSTALLATION
        <[image: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/legit.svg] >  <[image: https://img.shields.io/travis/frostming/legit/master.svg] >  <[image: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/github/frostming/legit.svg]  >
       <[image: https://repl.it/badge/github/frostming/legit] >

       From PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/legit/>
        with the Python package manager:

          pip install legit

       Or download a standalone Windows executable from GitHub Releases <https://github.com/frostming/legit/releases> .

       To install the cutting edge version from the git repository:

          git clone https://github.com/frostming/legit.git
          cd legit
          python setup.py install

       Note: if you encountered Permission denied, prepend sudo before the pip or python setup.py command.

       You'll then have the wonderful legit command available. Run it within a repository.

       To view usage and examples, run legit with no commands or options:

          legit

       To install the git aliases, run the following command:

          legit --install

       To uninstall the git aliases, run the following command:

          legit --uninstall

COMMAND OPTIONS
       All legit commands support --verbose and --fake options.

       In order to view the git commands invoked by legit, use the --verbose option:

          legit sync --verbose

       If you want to see the git commands used by legit but don't want them invoked, use the --fake option:

          legit publish --fake

CAVEATS
       • All remote operations are carried out by the remote identified in $ git config legit.remote remotename

       • If a stash pop merge fails, Legit stops. I'd like to add checking for a failed merge, and undo the command with friendly error reporting.

                                                                                                                                                                                    LEGIT: GIT FOR HUMANS()
