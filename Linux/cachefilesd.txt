NAME
       /etc/cachefilesd.conf - Local file caching configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       The configuration file for cachefilesd which can manage a persistent cache for a variety of network filesystems using a set of files on an already mounted filesystem as the data store.

DESCRIPTION
       This  configuration  file can contain a number of commands.  Each one should be on a separate line.  Blank lines and lines beginning with a '#' character are considered to be comments and are dis‐
       carded.

       The only mandatory command is:

       dir <path>
              This command specifies the directory containing the root of the cache.  It may only specified once per configuration file.

       All the other commands are optional:

       secctx <label>
              Specify an LSM security context as which the kernel will perform operations to access the cache.  The default is to use cachefilesd's security context.  Files will be created in  the  cache
              with the label of directory specified to the 'dir' command.

       brun <N>%

       bcull <N>%

       bstop <N>%

       frun <N>%

       fcull <N>%

       fstop <N>%
              These commands configure the culling limits.  The defaults are 7% (run), 5% (cull) and 1% (stop) respectively.  See the section on cache culling for more information.

              The commands beginning with a 'b' are file space (block) limits, those beginning with an 'f' are file count limits.

       tag <name>
              This command specifies a tag to FS-Cache to use in distinguishing multiple caches.  This is only required if more than one cache is going to be used.  The default is "CacheFiles".

       culltable <log2size>
              This  command  specifies  the size of the tables holding the lists of cullable objects in the cache.  The bigger the number, the faster and more smoothly that culling can proceed when there
              are many objects in the cache, but the more memory will be consumed by cachefilesd.

              The quantity is specified as log2 of the size actually required, for example 12 indicates a table of 4096 entries and 13 indicates 8192 entries.  The permissible values are between  12  and
              20, the latter indicating 1048576 entries.  The default is 12.

       nocull Disable  culling.   Culling  and  building up the cull table take up a certain amount of a systems resources, which may be undesirable.  Supplying this option disables all culling activity.
              The cache will keep building up to the limits set and won't be shrunk, except by the removal of out-dated cache files.

       resume_thresholds <blocks> <files>
              This command specifies the amount of blocks or files that the kernel should let go of before the daemon should resume from culling table scan suspension.

              Scanning to refill the cull table is suspended when all the objects in a cache are pinned by a live network filesystem in the kernel and there's nothing to cull.

              Either value can be "-" to indicate that this threshold should be ignored.

       debug <mask>
              This command specifies a numeric bitmask to control debugging in the kernel module.  The default is zero (all off).  The following values can be OR'd into the mask to collect various infor‐
              mation:

              1      Turn on trace of function entry (_enter() macros)

              2      Turn on trace of function exit (_leave() macros)

              4      Turn on trace of internal debug points (_debug())

              This mask can also be set through /sys/module/cachefiles/parameters/debug.

EXAMPLES
       As an example, consider the following:

              dir /var/cache/fscache
              secctx cachefiles_kernel_t
              tag mycache
              brun 10%
              bcull 7%
              bstop 3%
              secctx system_u:system_r:cachefiles_kernel_t:s0

       This places the cache storage objects in a directory called "/var/cache/fscache", names the cache "mycache", permits the cache to run freely  as  long  as  there's  at  least  10%  free  space  on
       /var/cache/fscache/,  starts culling the cache when the free space drops below 7% and stops writing new stuff into the cache if the amount of free space drops below 3%.  If the cache is suspended,
       it won't reactivate until the amount of free space rises again to 10% or better.

       Furthermore, this will tell the kernel module the security context it should use when accessing the cache (SELinux is assumed to be the LSM in this example).   In  this  case,  SELinux  would  use
       cachefiles_kernel_t as the key into the policy.

CACHE CULLING
       The  cache  may need culling occasionally to make space.  This involves discarding objects from the cache that have been used less recently than anything else.  Culling is based on the access time
       of data objects.  Empty directories are culled if not in use.

       Cache culling is done on the basis of the percentage of blocks and the percentage of files available in the underlying filesystem.  There are six "limits":

       brun

       frun   If the amount of free space and the number of available files in the cache rises above both these limits, then culling is turned off.

       bcull

       fcull  If the amount of available space or the number of available files in the cache falls below either of these limits, then culling is started.

       bstop

       fstop  If the amount of available space or the number of available files in the cache falls below either of these limits, then no further allocation of disk  space  or  files  is  permitted  until
              culling has raised things above these limits again.

       These must be configured thusly:

              0 <= bstop < bcull < brun < 100
              0 <= fstop < fcull < frun < 100

       Note that these are percentages of available space and available files, and do not appear as 100 minus the percentage displayed by the df program.

       The  userspace  daemon scans the cache to build up a table of cullable objects.  These are then culled in least recently used order.  A new scan of the cache is started as soon as space is made in
       the table.  Objects will be skipped if their atimes have changed or if the kernel module says it is still using them.

       Culling can be disabled with the nocull option.
