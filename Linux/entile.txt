NAME
       entile - create a tiled image pyramid

SYNOPSIS
       entile image1 [path_prefix] [pix_size]

DESCRIPTION
       entile takes an image file name and splits it into a collection of equally sized JPEG tiles representing the image at all resolutions.

       e.g. a 1024x1024 pixel image will be split into the following:

       16 full resolution 256x256 tiles

       4 half resolution 256x256 tiles

       1 quarter resolution 256x256 tile

       The default output prefix path is 't', i.e. output files will be prefixed with 't' in the current working directory.

       The default tile size is 256x256.

       Note that input images are expanded to be square and doubled multiples of the tile size, i.e. for a 256x256 output tile, the input photos are enlarged be one of: 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192,
       16384, 32768 etc... pixels square

       The naming format is 'keyhole' style, i.e. "q, r, s, t" represent the four quadrants clockwise starting top-left:

         q r
         t s

       The next level down reproduces the same pattern:

         qq qr rq rr
         qt qs rt rs
         tq tr sq sr
         tt ts st ss

       etc...
