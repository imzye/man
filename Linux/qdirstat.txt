NAME
       QDirStat - Qt-based directory statistics

DESCRIPTION
       QDirStat is a graphical application to show where your disk space has gone and to help you to clean it up.

USAGE
       qdirstat [OPTION]...  [<directory-name>]

       qdirstat --cache|-c <cache-file-name>

       qdirstat pkg:/<pkg-spec>

       qdirstat unpkg:/<dir>

OPTIONS
       -h|--help

              Show a summary of command line options on stdout.  That information might be more up-to-date than this man page.

       -s|--slow-update

              Slow down display updates during directory reading. This is useful when running QDirStat over a remote X11 connection.

              The exact update interval is specified in the SlowUpdateMillisec parameter in the [DirectoryTree] section of the configuration file. The default is 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds).

       -d|--dont-ask

              Don't prompt for a directory to read upon program start even if no directory was specified on the command line.

       -c|--cache <cache-file-name>

              Read the content of a directory tree from a cache file that was generated by QDirStat's "Write to Cache File" option or by the qdirstat-cache-writer script.

              A  file .qdirstat.cache.gz in the directory that it describes is automatically picked up and used: A cache file /data/archive/foo/.qdirstat.cache.gz with the content of /data/archive/foo is
              used automatically when found while reading a directory tree containing it.

NORMAL OPERATION
       You start the program without any parameters; then it will open a directory selection box to let you choose an existing directory. Alternatively, you can specify the path of an existing  directory
       as a command line parameter.

       The program will then start reading that directory tree, i.e. it will recursively traverse that directory tree and read information for each directory and its subdirectories.

       The  result  is  displayed in a tree view where you can open and close branches. The tree view displays information such as the accumulated size of each subtree, the number of items, the number of
       files, the latest modification time ("mtime") in that subtree, and some more. You can sort the tree by each of those columns.

       You can select one or more items in the tree view to get more detailed information or to start "cleanup actions": Move to trash, remove immediately (caution!), create a gzipped tarball from a  di‐
       rectory,  "make  clean", open a file manager window with that directory or start a shell there - and more. Use the context menu (right mouse button) or the "Clean Up" menu in the menu bar (you can
       "tear off" that menu so it remains open).

       There are three predefined column layouts L1, L2, L3 where you can switch what columns are displayed and whether or not to display the details panel at the right.

       Right-click on a column header to show or hide individual columns or to switch between automatic column width and a user-defined width (drag the column divider in the header).  You  can  rearrange
       the order of columns with drag and drop (but the "Name" column will always remain fixed at the very left side).

THE TREEMAP
       As  a  secondary  view,  there  is a "treemap" with colored rectangles ("tiles"). The area of each of those tiles corresponds to its size; the larger a tile, the larger the item. So you can spot a
       large file buried deep down in the directory hierarchy easily.

       The color of each tile corresponds to its type ("MIME category"). There are a number of predefined categories such as images (photos etc.), videos, music etc.; they can be configured in  the  con‐
       figuration dialog (menu "Edit" -> "Configure QDirStat").

PKG URLS / PACKAGES VIEW
       Specifying a pkg:/ URL at the command line starts the packages view that groups files by the software package they belong to.

       The package specification in the pkg:/ URL is case insensitive.

       Some  heuristics  are used to determine what mode to use: The default is "starts with", but if the search pattern contains typical regexp special characters, it interprets the pattern as a regular
       expression.

       If it detects just "*" (not ".*") or "?", it uses wildcard mode.

       If the first character is "=", it uses exact matching.

       qdirstat pkg:/chrom

              This shows all packages starting with "chrom" or "Chrom" or "CHROM".

       qdirstat pkg:/=emacs

              This shows only package "emacs", not "emacs25" or any other one starting with "emacs".

       qdirstat "pkg:/*gtk*"

              This shows all packages that have "gtk" somewhere in their name.

              Notice that you have to protect the "*" wildcards from the shell by escaping them with quotes.

       qdirstat "pkg:/.*qt[45].*"

              This shows all Qt4 or Qt5 packages.

       qdirstat "pkg:/(firefox|mozilla|chrome|chromium|opera)"

              This shows all the well-known browsers on the system. Notice that regular expressions use a partial match, so use the "^" and "$" anchors when appropriate.

UNPKG URLS / UNPACKAGED FILES VIEW
       Specifying an unpkg:/ URL at the command line starts the "unpackaged files" view: This reads the specified directory and ignores files that are owned by an installed software package.

       Some well-known directories that are known to contain only unpackaged files are excluded by default, and some file types are ignored by default:

              /home                   user home directories
              /root                   home directory of the root user
              /tmp                    directory for temporary files
              /var                    variable data for all kinds of software
              /usr/lib/sysimage/rpm   RPM database
              /usr/local              locally installed software

              *.pyc                   compiled Python files

       This list can be modified when starting the unpackaged files view from the menu. Starting the view from the command line uses the same settings that were used last time when using the menu.

       qdirstat unpkg:/

              This shows the unpackaged files of the complete root filesystem.

       qdirstat unpkg:/usr/share

              This shows the unpackaged files of /usr/share.

FILES
       ~/.config/QDirStat/QDirStat-cleanup.conf   cleanup actions configuration
       ~/.config/QDirStat/QDirStat-exclude.conf   exclude rules configuration
       ~/.config/QDirStat/QDirStat-mime.conf      MIME categories configuration
       ~/.config/QDirStat/QDirStat.conf           general configuration
       ~/.config/QDirStat/bookmarks.txt           bookmarks (plain text, one per line)

       /tmp/qdirstat-$USER/qdirstat.log           current / last log file
       /tmp/qdirstat-$USER/qdirstat-*.old         previous log files

       **/.qdirstat.cache.gz                      auto-used cache file

       It is safe to delete any or all of the configuration files; the next program start will restore them with default settings.

       The configuration files can safely be edited while QDirStat is not running. Many parameters can be accessed via GUI, but some (the more arcane ones) can only be changed by editing a  configuration
       file manually.
