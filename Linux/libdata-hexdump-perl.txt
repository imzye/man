NAME
       Data::HexDump - Hexadecial Dumper

SYNOPSIS
       Functional interface:

         use Data::HexDump;
         print HexDump($data_string);

       OO interface:

         use Data::HexDump;
         my $dumper = Data::HexDump->new();
         print while $_ = $dumper->dump;

DESCRIPTION
       This module will generate a hexadecimal dump of a data string or file.  You can either use the exported function, as shown in the SYNOPSIS above, or the OO interface, described below.

       The second example from the SYNOPSIS generated this output:

                  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 - 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F  0123456789ABCDEF

        00000000  23 21 2F 75 73 72 2F 62 - 69 6E 2F 70 65 72 6C 0A  #!/usr/bin/perl.
        00000010  75 73 65 20 73 74 72 69 - 63 74 3B 0A 75 73 65 20  use strict;.use
        00000020  77 61 72 6E 69 6E 67 73 - 3B 0A 0A 70 72 69 6E 74  warnings;..print
        00000030  20 22 48 65 6C 6C 6F 2C - 20 77 6F 72 6C 64 5C 6E   "Hello, world\n
        00000040  22 3B 0A                                           ";.

       The result is returned in a string.  Each line of the result consists of the offset in the source in the leftmost column of each line, followed by one or more columns of data from the source in
       hexadecimal.  The rightmost column of each line shows the printable characters (all others are shown as single dots).

   Functional Interface
       This module exports a single function, "HexDump", which takes a scalar value and returns a string which contains the hexdump of the passed data.

   OO Interface
       You first construct a "Data::HexDump" object, then tell it where to get the data from, and then generate the hex dump:

           my $dh = Data::HexDump->new();

           $dh->data($scalar);      # dump the data in this scalar
           $dh->fh($fh);            # read this filehandle
           $dh->file($filename);    # read this file and dump contents

           print while $_ = $dh->dump;

       The different potential sources for data are considered in the order given above, so if you pass to the "data" method, then any subsequent calls to "fh()" or "file()" will have no effect.

SEE ALSO
       Data::Hexify, by Johan Vromans, is another simple option, similar to this module. Last release in 2004.

       Data::Hexdumper (by David Cantrell, DCANTRELL) is another hex dumper, with more features than this module.

       App::colourhexdump (by Kent Fredric, RIP) provides a script which gives colourised output with character class highlighting.

       Data::HexDump::Range provides more functions, colour output, and the ability to skip uninteresting parts of the input data.

       Data::HexDump::XXD provides hex dumps like xxd.  It doesn't say what xxd is, or provide a link, and there's no example output.  But if you know and like xxd, this might be the one for you!

       Devel::Hexdump provides some configuration options, but there are other more featured modules, and this one doesn't have example output in the doc.

       Data::Peek is a collection of functions for displaying data, including "DHexDump" which generates a simple hex dump from a string.

       String::HexConvert will convert ASCII strings to hex and reverse.
