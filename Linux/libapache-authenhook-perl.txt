NAME
       Apache::AuthenHook - Perl API for Apache 2.1 authentication

SYNOPSIS
         PerlLoadModule Apache::AuthenHook

         PerlModule My::OtherProvider

         <Location /digest>
           Require valid-user
           AuthType Digest
           AuthName realm1

           AuthDigestProvider My::DigestProvider file My::OtherProvider::digest

           AuthUserFile realm1
         </Location>

         <Location /basic>
           Require valid-user
           AuthType Basic
           AuthName foorealm

           AuthBasicProvider My::OtherProvider::basic file My::BasicProvider

           AuthUserFile realm1
         </Location>

DESCRIPTION
       Apache::AuthenHook offers access to the 2.1 Apache authentication API in Perl.  This is different than the authentication API from Apache 1.3 or even Apache 2.0, but in its differences lies
       strength.

       For a full description of how authentication works in 2.1, see

       http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/2202671

       Basically, the difference between 2.0 and 2.1 is that authentication is now delegated to providers, and each provider has a specific purpose.  For instance, mod_authn_file covers gleaning the
       password from an .htpasswd or .htdigest file, while mod_auth_basic covers the Basic dialogue between the client and server, regardless of the source of the password.  The best part of all this (to
       me) is that Digest authentication is also delegated out - mod_auth_digest now handles all the intricacies of Digest authentication (including the elusive MSIE support) which means you don't need
       to worry about them (and neither do I).  All that Digest authentication requires is *some* authentication provider to provide user credentials - this can be via mod_authn_file or another mechanism
       of your choosing.

       Apache::AuthenHook registers and coordinates the use of Perl handlers as authentication providers.

       How does this affect you?  Read on...

EXAMPLE
       Say you want to enable Digest authentication in your Apache 2.1 server...

         PerlLoadModule Apache::AuthenHook

         <Location /digest>
           Require valid-user
           AuthType Digest
           AuthName realm1

           AuthDigestProvider My::DigestProvider file

           AuthUserFile realm1
         </Location>

       This configuration means that My::DigestProvider will be responsible for providing user credentials for requests to /digest.   if My::DigestProvider finds a suitable user, mod_auth_digest will
       verify those credentials and take care of setting all the proper headers, set the proper HTTP response status, and so on.  If My::DigestProvider cannot find a matching user it can decide what to
       do next - either pass the user to the next provider (in this case the default file provider, which will use the flat file "realm1") or decide that no user means no access.

       Here is a simple My::DigestProvider

         use Apache2::Const -compile => qw(OK DECLINED HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED);

         sub handler {

           my ($r, $user, $realm, $hash) = @_;

           # user1 at realm1 is found - pass to mod_auth_digest
           if ($user eq 'user1' && $realm eq 'realm1') {
             $$hash = 'eee52b97527306e9e8c4613b7fa800eb';
             return Apache2::Const::OK;
           }

           # user2 is denied outright
           if ($user eq 'user2' && $realm eq 'realm1') {
             return Apache2::Const::HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED;
           }

           # all others are passed along to the next provider
           return Apache2::Const::DECLINED;
         }

       isn't that easy?

       the only thing that is a bit tricky here is $$hash.  the fourth argument passed to your handler, $hash, is a reference to to a simple scalar that needs to be populated with the MD5 hash of the
       user:realm:password combination you determine for the incoming user.  this may seem a bit strange, but it is actually exactly how things work over in Apache C land, so I guess that makes it ok.

       as you can see, returning OK means "user found" and requires that $$hash be populated - mod_auth_digest will take care of determining whether the hash matches the incoming Digest criteria.
       returning HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED (which is the same as the former and still available AUTH_REQUIRED constant) means "no access." returning DECLINED means "some other provider can try."

       The steps are remarkably similar for Basic authentication, first

         <Location /basic>
           Require valid-user
           AuthType Basic
           AuthName foorealm

           AuthBasicProvider My::BasicProvider file

           AuthUserFile realm1
         </Location>

       then

         use Apache2::Const -compile => qw(OK DECLINED HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED);

         sub handler {

           my ($r, $user, $password) = @_;

           # user1/basic1 is ok
           if ($user eq 'user1' && $password eq 'basic1') {
             return Apache2::Const::OK;
           }

           # user2 is denied outright
           if ($user eq 'user2') {
             return Apache2::Const::HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED;
           }

           # all others are passed along to the next provider
           return Apache2::Const::DECLINED;
         }

       In the case of Basic authentication, the return codes mean essentially the same thing.  The one exception is that OK means that you have checked the user against the password and have found that
       they match (as opposed to with Digest, where the actual verification is not done by you).

       These explanations should be enough to get you going - see the files in the test suite for more examples.

NOTES
       This has been tested under the prefork MPM only, using mostly Perl 5.9.0 (as well as some 5.8.0).  It will not work under threaded MPMs - soon, just not yet.

FEATURES/BUGS
       This is very much so alphaware, so beware - bugs may lurk in unexpected places.  there is one bug that is outside of my control, though, and concerns MSIE and Digest authentication for URIs that
       include query strings.  see

       http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_auth_digest.html

       one workaround for this issue is is to use POST instead of GET for your forms.

       A limitation of this interface is that you can't use Perl providers that are not at least two levels deep - the criterion for registering a Perl provider is a simple check for a double-colon.  for
       example, My::Provider will work while Provider won't (although Provider::handler will).  anyway, single level handlers are rare, so fixing it would be a lot of trouble for little benefit.
