CLAWS-MAIL-LIBRAVATAR(7)                                                                         Claws Mail                                                                        CLAWS-MAIL-LIBRAVATAR(7)

NAME
       claws-mail-libravatar - show profile images from a libravatar server

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-libravatar package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-libravatar is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       Allows showing the sender profile image stored in the libravatar server configured in the sender's domain (a federated domain) or the libravatar.org server if the former is not available.

       If no profile is available in libravatar.org, as current fallback of the service, gravatar.com servers are also tried. This behaviour can be disabled by plugin's configuration if desired.

       If no profile image is found at all the plugin can be also configured to request a generated image from the libravatar service (through one of the available methods) or even from a custom URL.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named libravatar.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

CAVEATS
       This plugin may slow down message display because of the additional network access required for image retrieval, specially on flaky networks. Disabling image cache or setting a cache refresh
       interval too low will only make this slowness more noticeable and is not recommended.
