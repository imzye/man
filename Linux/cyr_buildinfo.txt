NAME
       cyr_buildinfo - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Cyrus build-configuration inspection tool

SYNOPSIS
       cyr_buildinfo [ -C config-file ] [format]

DESCRIPTION
       cyr_buildinfo  is  a tool to inspect the build configuration of a Cyrus
       release.  The intent is to provide compilation settings during  runtime
       and testing.

       cyr_buildinfo  reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5)
       file unless specified otherwise by -C.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              This option is ignored,  but  accepted  for  compatibility  with
              other Cyrus tools.

       format Specify one of the following:
                 pretty  - print the build configuration in indented JSON for‐
                 mat. This is the default.

                 dense  - print the build configuration in dense JSON format.

                 flat   - print the build configuration as  flattened  proper‐
                 ties. Note that the print order is non-deterministic.
