NAME
       paw-demos - run PAW demonstrations

SYNOPSIS
       paw-demos [options] [example_num [test_num]]

DESCRIPTION
       paw-demos  is a script to run the demonstrations of PAW in the paw-demos package.  It will create a demo directory (by default $HOME/paw-demos), copy the demos from /usr/share/paw-demos to this direc‐
       tory, and run them.  Both examples and tests are available.

       example_num is the number of the example to start with; examples are skipped if example_num > 31.  test_num is the number of the test to start with; tests are skipped if test_num > 8.  Note  that  the
       first example is numbered 1 but the first test is numbered 0.

OPTIONS
       --batch
              Run demos in batch mode; output to PostScript.  The resulting output files are placed into a "linux" subdirectory of the demo directory.

       --clean
              Clean the demo directory given by the --dir option (or the default directory if --dir is not given).  This option causes example_num, test_num, --batch, and --driver to be ignored.

       --dir dir
              Specify  the  directory  in  which  to  run the PAW demos, relative to $HOME.  If it does not already exist, it will be created and the demos copied to it from the directory /usr/share/doc/paw-
              demos/examples.  The default is $HOME/paw-demos.

       --display display
              Specify the display to use.  The default is the current value of the $DISPLAY environment variable.

       --driver driver
              Specify a graphics driver.  Available options are "X11" for pawX11 and "++" for paw++.

       --help Show a summary of options.

FILES
       /usr/share/paw-demos contains the PAW demonstrations.
       $HOME/paw-demos is the default directory in which to run the demos.
