NAME
       vfind - find attributed software objects (ASOs)

SYNOPSIS
       vfind [ options ] pathname-list expression

DESCRIPTION
       Vfind recursively descends the directory hierarchy for each pathname in the pathname-list seeking asos that match a boolean expression written in the primaries given below. In the description, the ar‐
       gument n is used as a decimal integer where +n means more than n, -n means less than n and n means exactly n.

OPTIONS
       -version
              print version information about the vfind program itself. No other action given will be performed.

       -?, -help
              print brief instructions about using vfind.

       -cache match a boolean expression also for aso residing in the derived object cache.

       -cut nesting depth
              causes vfind to descend the filesystem hierarchy down to nesting depth nesting depth.

       -force Vfind normally ignores saved asos iff a AtFS directory is a symbolic link. If the -force option is given vfind takes also symbolic AtFS directories into consideration.

       -hits  causes vfind to return the number of expressions yielding true during evaluation.

       -xdev  causes vfind not to traverse down into a file system different from the one on which current argument pathname resides.

PRIMARIES
       -atime n
              True if the aso has been accessed in n days.

       -ctime n
              True if status of the aso has been changed in n days.

       -mtime n
              True if the aso has been modified in n days.

       -stime n
              True if the aso has been saved in n days.

       -ltime n
              True if the aso has been locked in n days.

       -exec command
              True if the executed command returns a zero value as exit status. The end of the command must be punctated by an ecscaped semicolon. A command argument `{}' is replaced by the  system  name  of
              the current aso.

       -exit n
              Terminates vfind and returns n as the exit status.

       -vl    Always  true;  causes  the current aso to be printed together with its associated statistics. This includes protection mode, AtFS version state, user, host, size in bytes, modification time re‐
              spectively saving time. The format is identical to that of ``vl -l''.

       -name name
              True if the name argument matches the filename component of the current aso. Normal Shell argument syntax may be used if escaped.

       -perm onum
              True if the aso permission flags exactly match the octal numer onum. If onum  is  prefixed  by  a  minus  sign,  more  flag  bits  (017777)  become  significant  and  the  flags  are  compared:
              (flags&onum)==onum.

       -print Always true; causes the relative path of the current aso to be printed.

       -prune Always true; has the side effect of pruning the tree, iff the current file is a directory.

       -SinceName name
              True if the current aso is older than the corresponding aso having the symbolic name name.

       -symbolic name
              True if the current aso has the symbolic name name. See vadm(1) or save(1) on how to attach a symbolic name to an aso.

       -state state
              True if the state of the current aso matches state state, where state is busy, save, proposed, published, accessed, or frozen.

       -type c
              True if the type of the current aso is c, where c is b, c, d, f, l, or s for block special file, character special file, directory, plain file, symbolic link, or socket.

       -uda uda
              True if the current aso has an user defined attribute matching uda uda, where uda is of the form name[=value].

       -user user
              True if the current aso belongs to user user, where user is a login name optinally followed by a domainname (e.g. uli@cs.tu-berlin.de).

       -last  True if the current aso is the last version of the development line.

       -first True if the current aso is the first version of the development line.

       -locked
              True if the current aso is locked.

       -locker user
              True if the current aso is locked by user user, where user is a login name optionally followed by a domainname.

       -eq vnum
              True if the version number of the current aso matches version number vnum, where vnum is generation.revision.

       -lt vnum
              True if the version number of the current aso is less than the version number vnum.

       -le vnum
              True if the version number of the current aso is less equal than the version number vnum.

       -gt vnum
              True if the version number of the current aso is greater than the version number vnum.

       -ge vnum
              True if the version number of the current aso is greater equal than the version number vnum.

       -newer file
              True if the current aso is more recently than the argument file which can be an aso (e.g. vfind.c[1.6]).

       -size n
              True if the file is n blocks long (512 bytes per block).

       The primaries may be combined using the operators (, ) for grouping, ! for negation, -a for concatenation (may be omitted) and -o for alternation of primaries. Parentheses and the exclamation mark are
       special to the Shell and must be escaped.

       vfind does not descent AtFS directories, so the AtFS archives are never selected.

EXAMPLES
       To find all asos whose state is busy and that have the symbolic name "foobar":

              vfind / -state busy -symbolic foobar -print

       To find the latest proposed version of foo.c in the current directory:

              vfind -prune 0 . -name foo.c -state proposed -last -print

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       The following find(1) primaries are not recognized or implemented: -link, -nouser, -group, -nogroup, -inum, and -ok.
