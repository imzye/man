NAME
       HTML::Lint::HTML4 -- Rules for HTML 4 as used by HTML::Lint.

SYNOPSIS
       Collection of tags and attributes for use by HTML::Lint.  You can add your own tags and attributes if you like.

           # Add an attribute that your company uses.
           HTML::Lint::HTML4::add_attribute( 'body', 'proprietary-attribute' );

           # Add the HTML 5 <canvas> tag.
           HTML::Lint::HTML4::add_tag( 'canvas' );
           HTML::Lint::HTML4::add_attribute( 'canvas', $_ ) for qw( height width );

       This must be done before HTML::Lint does any validation.  Note also that this modifies a global table, and is not on a per-object basis.

FUNCTIONS
       The functions below are very specifically not exported, and need to be called with a complete package reference, so as to remind the programmer that she is monkeying with the entire package.

   add_tag( $tag );
       Adds a tag to the list of tags that HTML::Lint knows about.  If you specify a tag that HTML::Lint already knows about, then nothing is changed.

           HTML::Lint::HTML4::add_tag( 'canvas' );

   add_attribute( $tag, $attribute );
       Adds an attribute to a tag that HTML::Lint knows about.  The tag must already be known to HTML::Lint or else this function will die.

           HTML::Lint::HTML4::add_attribute( 'canvas', $_ ) for qw( height width );
