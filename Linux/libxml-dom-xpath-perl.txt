NAME
       XML::DOM::XPath - Perl extension to add XPath support to XML::DOM, using XML::XPath engine

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::DOM::XPath;

         my $parser= XML::DOM::Parser->new();
         my $doc = $parser->parsefile ("file.xml");

         # print all HREF attributes of all CODEBASE elements
         # compare with the XML::DOM version to see how much easier it is to use
         my @nodes = $doc->findnodes( '//CODEBASE[@HREF]/@HREF');
         print $_->getValue, "\n" foreach (@nodes);

DESCRIPTION
       XML::DOM::XPath allows you to use XML::XPath methods to query a DOM. This is often much easier than relying only on getElementsByTagName.

       It lets you use all of the XML::DOM methods.

METHODS
       Those methods can be applied to a whole dom object or to a node.

   findnodes($path)
       return a list of nodes found by $path.

   findnodes_as_string($path)
       return the nodes found reproduced as XML. The result is not guaranteed to be valid XML though.

   findvalue($path)
       return the concatenation of the text content of the result nodes

   exists($path)
       return true if the given path exists.

   matches($path)
       return true if the node matches the path.
