NAME
       oddjobd.conf - configuration for oddjobd

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/oddjobd.conf configuration file specifies which services the oddjobd server provides over the D-Bus, and authorization rules which are enforced in addition to those enforced by the system
       message bus.

       The  configuration file is an XML document.  The top-level element type is <oddjobconfig>, which contains one or more <service> elements.  Each <service> describes a service which will be provided
       on the system-wide message bus.

       Each <object> describes an object path which will will be recognized by the specified service.  The object path may include wildcards, in which case any call to an object with a  path  name  which
       matches the specified path will be accepted.  An object contains one or more <interface> elements, each of which describes a group of methods described in <method> elements.

       Each  <method> element must specify the method name as a value for its name attribute and may include a <helper> element which the name of an executable to run as its exec attribute and the number
       of arguments which will be expected from the D-Bus client and passed to the helper as its argument_count attribute.  The <helper>'s exec attribute can include one or more command  line  arguments,
       separated  from  the  executable  by whitespace.  A <helper> may also include attributes indicating whether or not the invoking user's name should be prepended to the list of arguments received as
       part of the D-Bus request (prepend_user_name, with recognized values "yes" or "no"), and whether that set of arguments should be passed in to the helper via stdin (the default) or on  its  command
       line (argument_passing_method, with recognized values "stdin" and "cmdline").

       Each  <oddjobconfig>, <service>, <object>, <interface>, or <method> element may also include authorization elements <allow> and <deny>.  Each <allow> or <deny> rule specifies some combination of a
       user name and/or a UID range which the invoking user must match for the rule to apply.  A rule can also specify the caller's SELinux context, user, role, or execution domain, and be applied or not
       based on whether or not policy is being enforced.  All <deny> rules for the method are checked first, followed by all of its <allow> rules.  If no matches are found, the <deny> rules for the  con‐
       taining <interface> element are checked, followed by its <allow> rules, and so on.  If all ACLs are searched and no matches turn up, access is denied.

       The  oddjobd server will automatically supply information used by the D-Bus introspection mechanism on behalf of your objects, but only if the client which is requesting the information is allowed
       to invoke the Introspect method of the org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable interface provided by the object.

       The configuration file may also indicate that the contents of other files should be read by the configuration parser, using an <include> element.

       Here is an example file:
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <oddjobconfig/>

       Another:
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <oddjobconfig>
         <allow user="wally"/>
         <service name="com.redhat.oddjob">
          <allow user="polly"/>
          <object name="/com/redhat/oddjob">
           <allow user="holly"/>
           <interface name="com.redhat.oddjob">
            <allow user="bob"/>
            <method name="pwd">
             <helper exec="/bin/pwd" argument_count="0" prepend_user_name="no"/>
             <allow user="jimmy"/>
             <allow user="billy"/>
             <allow min_uid="0" max_uid="1000"/>
            </method>
            <method name="reboot">
             <helper exec="/sbin/reboot" argument_count="0"/>
            </method>
            <method name="flush-nscd">
             <helper exec="/sbin/nscd -i passwd -i group -i hosts" argument_count="0"/>
            </method>

           <interface name="org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable">

           </interface>
          </object>
         </service>
         <include ignore_missing="yes">/etc/oddjobd-local.conf</include>
         <include ignore_missing="yes">/etc/oddjobd.conf.d/*.conf</include>
        </oddjobconfig>

       And another:
