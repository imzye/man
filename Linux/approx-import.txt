APPROX-IMPORT(8)                                                                            System Manager's Manual                                                                            APPROX-IMPORT(8)

NAME
       approx-import - copy local .deb files into the approx cache

SYNOPSIS
       approx-import [OPTION]... file.deb ...

DESCRIPTION
       approx-import copies local .deb files, such as those found in /var/cache/apt/archives, into the approx(8) cache.

       It  does  so  by  computing  the MD5 checksum of each argument.  If it matches a package in one of the Packages files in the approx(8) cache, then the file is copied to the appropriate location in the
       cache.

       Note that all Packages files must be scanned, regardless of how many .deb files are being imported, and this process may take several minutes.

       The approx-import command must be run by the superuser or the approx(8) user.

OPTIONS
       -c file, --config file
              Specify an additional configuration file.  May be used multiple times.

       -s, --simulate
              Process files but do not actually copy them into the cache.

       -q, --quiet
              Don't print the names of files that are imported.

       -v, --verbose
              Print the disposition of each file.

EXAMPLES
       To import packages from the local apt(8) cache:

              approx-import /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb

       To import packages from another proxy's cache:

              find other-cache -name "*.deb" | xargs approx-import

       (where other-cache is the pathname of the other proxy's cache directory)

FILES
       /etc/approx/approx.conf
              Configuration file for approx and related programs.

       /var/cache/approx
              Default cache directory for archive files.
