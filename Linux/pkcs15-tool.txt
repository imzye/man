NAME
       pkcs15-tool - utility for manipulating PKCS #15 data structures on smart cards and similar security tokens

SYNOPSIS
       pkcs15-tool [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The pkcs15-tool utility is used to manipulate the PKCS #15 data structures on smart cards and similar security tokens. Users can list and read PINs, keys and certificates stored on the token. User PIN
       authentication is performed for those operations that require it.

OPTIONS
       --version,
           Print the OpenSC package release version.

       --aid aid
           Specify in a hexadecimal form the AID of the on-card PKCS#15 application to bind to.

       --auth-id id, -a id
           Specifies the auth id of the PIN to use for the operation. This is useful with the --change-pin operation.

       --change-pin
           Changes a PIN or PUK stored on the token. User authentication is required for this operation.

       --dump, -D
           List all card objects.

       --list-info
           List card objects.

       --list-applications
           List the on-card PKCS#15 applications.

       --list-certificates, -c
           List all certificates stored on the token.

       --list-data-objects, -C
           List all data objects stored on the token. For some cards the PKCS#15 attributes of the private data objects are protected for reading and need the authentication with the User PIN. In such a case
           the --verify-pin option has to be used.

       --list-keys, -k
           List all private keys stored on the token. General information about each private key is listed (eg. key name, id and algorithm). Actual private key values are not displayed. For some cards the
           PKCS#15 attributes of the private keys are protected for reading and need the authentication with the User PIN. In such a case the --verify-pin option has to be used.

       --list-secret-keys
           List all secret (symmetric) keys stored on the token. General information about each secret key is listed (eg. key name, id and algorithm). Actual secret key values are not displayed. For some
           cards the PKCS#15 attributes of the private keys are protected for reading and need the authentication with the User PIN. In such a case the --verify-pin option has to be used.

       --list-pins
           List all PINs stored on the token. General information about each PIN is listed (eg. PIN name). Actual PIN values are not shown.

       --list-public-keys
           List all public keys stored on the token, including key name, id, algorithm and length information.

       --short -s
           Output lists in compact format.

       --no-cache
           Disables token data caching.

       --clear-cache
           Removes the user's cache directory. On Windows, this option additionally removes the system's caching directory (requires administrator privileges).

       --clear-cache
           Removes the user's cache directory. On Windows, this option additionally removes the system's caching directory (requires administrator privileges).

       --output filename, -o filename
           Specifies where key output should be written. If filename already exists, it will be overwritten. If this option is not given, keys will be printed to standard output.

       --raw
           Changes how --read-data-object prints the content to standard output. By default, when --raw is not given, it will print the content in hex notation. If --raw is set, it will print the binary data
           directly. This does not affect the output that is written to the file specified by the --output option. Data written to a file will always be in raw binary.

       --read-certificate cert
           Reads the certificate with the given id.

       --read-data-object cert, -R data
           Reads data object with OID, applicationName or label. The content is printed to standard output in hex notation, unless the --raw option is given. If an output file is given with the --output
           option, the content is additionally written to the file. Output to the file is always written in raw binary mode, the --raw only affects standard output behavior.

       --read-public-key id
           Reads the public key with id id, allowing the user to extract and store or use the public key.

       --read-ssh-key id
           Reads the public key with id id, writing the output in format suitable for $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys.

           The key label, if any will be shown in the 'Comment' field.

           --rfc4716
               When used in conjunction with option --read-ssh-key the output format of the public key follows rfc4716.

           The default output format is a single line (openssh).

       --test-update, -T,
           Test if the card needs a security update

       --update, -U,
           Update the card with a security update

       --reader arg
           Number of the reader to use. By default, the first reader with a present card is used. If arg is an ATR, the reader with a matching card will be chosen.

       --unblock-pin, -u
           Unblocks a PIN stored on the token. Knowledge of the Pin Unblock Key (PUK) is required for this operation.

       --verbose, -v
           Causes pkcs15-tool to be more verbose. Specify this flag several times to enable debug output in the OpenSC library.

       --pin pin, --new-pin newpin --puk puk
           These options can be used to specify the PIN/PUK values on the command line. If the value is set to env:VARIABLE, the value of the specified environment variable is used. By default, the code is
           prompted on the command line if needed.

           Note that on most operation systems, any user can display the command line of any process on the system using utilities such as ps(1). Therefore, you should prefer passing the codes via an
           environment variable on an unsecured system.

       --new-pin pin
           Specify New PIN (when changing or unblocking)

       --verify-pin
           Verify PIN after card binding and before issuing any command (without 'auth-id' the first non-SO, non-Unblock PIN will be verified)

       --test-session-pin
           Equivalent to --verify-pin with additional session PIN generation

       --wait, -w
           Causes pkcs15-tool to wait for a card insertion.

       --use-pinpad
           Do not prompt the user; if no PINs supplied, pinpad will be used.
