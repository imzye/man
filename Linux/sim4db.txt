NAME
       sim4dbutils - utilities to work with sim4db-generated alignment files

       convertPolishes - convert between sim4db and GFF3 formats
       filterPolishes - filter alignments based on sequence identity, coverage and length.
       mergePolishes - merge alignments from multiple files
       sortPolishes - sort alignments by cDNA or genomic sequence index or sequence name
       convertToExtent - Convert from sim4db format to a single-line tab-delimited format
       fixPolishesIID - Updates a sim4db file to use the sequence index of a specific fasta file. Can also be used to extract a subset of the alignments from the sim4db file.
       depthOfPolishes - Outputs a tab-delimited histogram of the depth of polishes at various window sizes.
       headPolishes - print the first N alignments in a file, similar to head(1)
       pickBestPolish - report only the 'best' alignment for each cDNA
       pickUniquePolish - reports alignments where there is a clear single best alignment for each cDNA.
       plotCoverageVsIdentity - Generates (1) a histogram of the percent identity, (2) a histogram of the percent coverage, and (3) a list of percent identity and coverage (for use in a scatter plot).
       uniqPolishes - Filters out all alignments for cDNA with multiple alignments (-uniq) or with a single alignment (-dupl). Similar to uniq(1)
       realignPolishes - recompute the alignments listed in a sim4db file.
       reportAlignmentDifferences - generates a histogram of the types of errors in a set of alignments Unsupported and Deprecated
       comparePolishes - Correlate alignments in two files.
       convertToAtac - Converts from sim4db format to ATAC format.
       detectChimera - Examines alignments for sequences that might be chimeric.
       mappedCoverage - Reports the amount of the query sequence (EST, cDNA) that is covered by alignments.
       parseSNP - Analyzes alignments for SNPs.
       removeDuplicate - searches the input for duplicate alignments.
       vennPolishes - Generates a Venn diagram for multiple sim4db files.  Used internally by ESTMapper cleanPolishes
       summarizePolishes

DESCRIPTION
       These programs are a range of utilities to work with sim4db(1)-generated alignment files.
