NAME
       dokujclient - interact (read, write, ...) with an instance of Dokuwiki

SYNOPSIS
       dokujclient GENERAL_OPTIONS COMMAND COMMAND_OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
       Dokuwiki is an open source wiki engine.  It's hence meant to be mainly used through a web browser.  However, it also has an xmlrpc API.
       Dokujclient uses this xmlrpc API, so that it's possible to interact with an instance of Dokuwiki through a console or a shell script.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       --url URL
              The url to the xmlrpc interface. Should look like http[s]://server/mywiki/lib/exe/xmlrpc.php.
              Obviously, the wiki should be configured to accept incoming xmlrpc queries.  See Dokuwiki's remote config.
              This parameter is mandatory.

       -u USER, --user USER
              Specify the username USER to use to connect to the server.
              Obviously, the USER should be authorized to use the xmlrpc interface.  See Dokuwiki's remoteuser config.

       -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
              The password of the USER

       --password-interactive
              You will be prompted to enter the user's password interactively.  Useful to avoid writing the password in clear text in the command line.

       --version
              Prints the version of dokujclient

       -h --help
              Prints the general help

       --debug
              Enable debug mode, which will print more information

COMMANDS
       help   Prints the general help

       help COMMAND
              Prints the help and the COMMAND_OPTIONS for COMMAND

       Other commands are:

FILES
       To avoid typing your url, user, and password each time, you may create in your home a file .dokujclientrc, and put some or all of this info in it.

        echo "url=http://myhost/mywiki/lib/exe/xmlrpc.php" > ~/.dokujclientrc
        echo "user=toto" >> ~/.dokujclientrc
        echo "password=myPassword" >> ~/.dokujclientrc

EXAMPLES
        dokujclient --user myUser --password myPassword --url http://mywiki/lib/exe/xmlrpc.php getTitle
        > myWiki title

        dokujclient help
        > [(-u|--user) <user>] --url <url> [(-p|--password) <password>] [-h|--help] [--version] [--password-interactive] command
        >
        > Available commands:

        #put user, password, and url, in the config file
        vim ~/.dokujclientrc

        > Build launched at 12:23 took 3'24

        > Syntax for putAttachment: [-f|--force] <attachmentId> <localFile>
