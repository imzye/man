NAME
       mktunes.pl - manual page for mktunes.pl 1.00

SYNOPSIS
       mktunes.pl [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Convert GNUtunesDB.xml into iTunesDB format

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       -m, --mount=DIRECTORY
              iPod mountpoint. Default is $IPOD_MOUNTPOINT

       -n, --ipod-name=NAME
              iPod Name (For unlabeled iPods). iTunes displays this name, not the label.

       -v, --volume=VALUE
              Adjust volume +-VALUE% (example: --volume +5)

       -e, --energy
              Save energy (= Disable scrolling title)

       -g, --fwguid=HEXVAL
              Enforce iPod serial/firewire-guid. Late 2007 iPod models (3gen Nano, Classic, Touch) refuse to work unless the iTunesDB has been signed with a sha1 hash. This hash helps to detect corrupted
              databases,  prevents sharing an iTunesDB between multiple iPods and locks out non-apple software.  GNUpod is able to create the required hash value if it knows the iPods serial number, this
              is a 16 chars long hex value such as: '000ba3100310abcf' and should be autodetected on GNU/Linux (via /proc/bus/usb/devices) and Solaris (via prtconf -v). Use this switch to set the  serial
              if  the  autodetection  somehow  fails  to  find  the  correct  serial  number  of  your  iPod.   You  can also specify  the value in your configuration file (gnupodrc) as 'mktunes.fwguid =
              000ba3100310abcf'.
