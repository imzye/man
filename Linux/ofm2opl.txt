NAME
       ofm2opl - convert Omega and TeX font-metric files to property-list files

SYNOPSIS
       ofm2opl [options] ofmname[.ofm] [oplfile[.opl]]

DESCRIPTION
       ofm2opl  translates  a binary Omega Font Metrics file, ofmname, into a human-readable property-list form.  The program writes to standard output (by default)
       or to a file specified as oplfile.

       The program also works with TeX TFM files, producing TeX PL files.

OPTIONS
       (Same as ovf2ovp).

       -charcode-format=type
              output character codes according to type, either `hex', `octal' or `ascii'.  Default is `hex'; `ascii' says to use ASCII for letters and  digits,  hex
              for all else.

       -char-format=stype
              output  character  codes  according to stype, either `num' or `ascii'. Default is `num'; `ascii' as in -charcode-format.  (These two redundant options
              both exist only for historical compatibility.)

       -num-format=ntype
              output numbers according to ntype, either `hex' or `octal'; default is hex.

       -text-format=ttype
              output coding scheme and family according to ttype, either `mixed' or `upper' case; default is mixed.

       -help  display a brief summary of syntax and options

       -verbose
              display progress reports

       -version
              output version information and exit

FILES
       OFMNAME
              an Omega Font Metric file

       OPLFILE
              an Omega Property List file

BUGS
       Email bug reports to <https://lists.tug.org/tex-k> (mailing list); good to check if the same bug is present in tftopl(1).

       General discussion of Omega (and Aleph) can take place on the <https://lists.tug.org/omega> mailing list.

AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              The first TFtoPL program was designed by Leo Guibas in the summer of 1978.  Contributions by Frank Liang, Doug Wyatt, and Lyle Ramshaw also had a sig‐
              nificant effect on the evolution of the present code.

              Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added by D.E. Knuth in 1989.

              Extensions  to  handle  extended font metric files (``OFM'') were added by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996, resulting in the new program
              OFM2OPL.

       ofm2opl is based on the WEB source code for tftopl(1), although nowadays it is a link to omfonts, implemented entirely in C.

       The primary authors of Omega were John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous.  Omega (and Aleph) are now maintained as part of TeX Live.

       This manual page was written by C.M. Connelly for the Debian GNU/Linux system. It is also now maintained as part of TeX Live.
