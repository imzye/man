NAME
       openms-doc - library for LC/MS data management and analysis - documentation

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the openms-doc package that brings a full set of documentation and tutorials to the OpenMS software framework. OpenMS offers an infrastructure for the develop‐
       ment of mass spectrometry-related software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization solutions. OpenMS offers analyses for various quantitation  protocols,  including  label-free  quantitation,  SILAC,
       iTRAQ, SRM, SWATH… It provides build-in algorithms for de-novo identification and database search, as well as adapters to other state-of-the art tools like X!Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA… OpenMS supports
       the  Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) formats for MS data and supports easy integration of tools into workflow engines like Knime, Galaxy, WS-Pgrade, and TOPPAS via the TOPPtools concept and a
       unified parameter handling.
