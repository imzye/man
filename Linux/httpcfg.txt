NAME
       httpcfg - Mono Certificate Management for HttpListener

SYNOPSIS
       httpcfg [options] certificate

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool  is used to manage the certificates used by the HttpListener
       embeddable server class when the HttpListener is configured as an HTTPS
       server instead of an HTTP server.

       You must select one of the possible actions: add, delete or list.

       When adding a certificate (-add), you must provide the following infor‐
       mation: a certificate (with the -cert flag) a Private  Key  file  (with
       the  -pvk  argument, the filename is typically "key") and a port number
       (with the -port flag).

       When deleting a certificate (-del or -delete) you need to  provide  the
       port number.

PARAMETERS
       -add   Adds a new certificate/private key combination for being used at
              a given port by the HttpListener API.

       -del, -delete
              Deletes the certificates associated for the port specified (must
              be specified separatedly).

       -list  List all known certificates.

       -port PORT
              Specifies  the  port  to add certificates to, or remove certifi‐
              cates from.

       -pvk FILE
              Specifies the Private Key file.

       -cert CERT
              Specifies the certificate file to use.

EXAMPLES
       httpcfg -add -port 8081 -pvk myfile.pvk -cert MyCert
