NAME
       botch-remove-virtual-disjunctions - remove virtual dependency disjunctions

SYNOPSIS
       botch-remove-virtual-disjunctions [options] inPackages inSources outPackages outSources

DESCRIPTION
       For binary packages: remove virtual packages from disjunctions with real packages.

       For source packages: remove all but the first alternative of disjunctions just as sbuild does it. This is useful to emulate sbuild behaviour with dependency solvers like dose3 and aspcud which do not
       respect the order of dependency disjunctions.

       This program is meant to modify a set of Packages and Sources files. If you only want to modify one, specify /dev/null as input and output for the one you do not want in the command line arguments.

OPTIONS
       --remove-nonvirtual
           Also remove all but the first alternative from binary packages. This applies the same algorithm to binary packages as is applied to source packages.

       -h, --help
           Show help.

       --verbose
           Be verbose.
