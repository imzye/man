NAME
       clojurec - Clojure compiler

SYNOPSIS
       clojurec [-d destination-directory] [-W/-Wreflect] [-cp/-classpath classpath] lib1 [lib2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the clojurec command.

       clojurec  compiles  libs and generates class files stored within the directory named by the -d option, or . if not specified.  Arguments are strings naming the libs to be compiled.  Note that libs
       are specified in dotted notation and are loaded from a classpath, for example my.lib refers to a file my/lib.clj contained within a classpath.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -d destination-directory
              Specifies the destination directory for compiled class files.

       -W, -Wreflect
              Causes the compiler to emit warnings when reflection is needed to resolve Java method calls or field accesses.

       -cp classpath, -classpath classpath
              Specifies additional classpath elements.  This option overrides the $CLASSPATH environment variable.
