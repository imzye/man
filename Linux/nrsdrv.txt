NRSDRV(8)                Linux System Managers Manual                NRSDRV(8)

NAME
       nrsdrv - KISS to NET/ROM serial converter

SYNOPSIS
       nrsdrv [-f] [-l] [-s speed] [-v] kissdev nrsdev

DESCRIPTION
       Nrsdrv  is  a program designed to convert from the KISS protocol to the
       NET/ROM serial protocol used by real NET/ROM's and TheNet's. The proto‐
       cols  are fairly similar, although the NET/ROM serial protocol does in‐
       clude a one byte checksum which KISS does not.

       Typically nrsdrv will be attached to one end of a pseudo-tty  of  which
       the  other end has been attached to a KISS capable program. The NET/ROM
       device will probably be a real serial port attached to a TNC or a Hexi‐
       pus. The full specification of the NET/ROM serial protocol can be found
       in the original Software 2000 documentation that accompanied NET/ROMs.

OPTIONS
       -f        Flow control enabled for use with a Hexipus, the  default  is
                 disabled.   See  the file hexipus.txt in the source distribu‐
                 tion for wiring details.

       -l        Log messages to the system log, the default is not to.

       -s speed  Sets the speed of both interfaces. If no value  is  specified
                 then no speed will be set.

       -v        Display the version.

BUGS
       None known.
