NAME
       dtconf - Display the contents of a DNSSEC-Tools configuration file

SYNOPSIS
         dtconf [options] [config_file]

DESCRIPTION
       dtconf displays the key/value pairs of a DNSSEC-Tools configuration
       file.  If a configuration file isn't specified, the system
       configuration file will be displayed.

       Without the -key option, dtconf displays all the key/value pairs in the
       configuration file.  Comments are never displayed.  If the -key option
       is given, then only that key/value pair is displayed.  If the key isn't
       defined, then the value will be "(undefined)."

OPTIONS
       -key
           The value of the specified key will be printed.  If the key is not
           defined, then the value will be given as "(undefined)".

       -Version
           Displays the version information for dtconf and the DNSSEC-Tools
           package.

       -help
           Display a usage message.
