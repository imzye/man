NAME
       vreg_latex2html - Register configuration utility

SYNOPSIS
         vreg_latex2html --help
         vreg_latex2html {filename}.tex

DESCRIPTION
       Vreg_latex2html is a simple script to read LaTex documents that use the vregs Latex definitions and write out HTML code that can then be parsed by the Vreg program.

       An alternative path is to use the regular latex2html program to convert the entire document to HTML format, then run vregs on that.  Using this package is much more restricted in how you write the
       definitions, but doesn't cause latex2html errors with unknown packages and such as they are simply ignored.

ARGUMENTS
       --output
           Specifies the output filename.

       -I  Specifies path to include files.

       --version
           Displays program version and exits.

ENVIRONMENT
       TEXINPUTS
           If set, colon separated directory names are used as -I include paths.
