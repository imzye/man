NAME
       chsh.ldap - change login shell in LDAP

SYNOPSIS
       chsh.ldap [options] [LOGIN]

DESCRIPTION
       The chsh.ldap command can be used to change user's login shell (command interpreter).

       The actual change in LDAP is performed by the nslcd daemon and is subject to the access controls configured in the LDAP server.

OPTIONS
       The options that may be specified to the chsh.ldap command are:

       -s, --shell SHELL
              The name of the user's new login shell.  Setting this field to blank causes the system to select the default login shell.

       -l, --list-shells
              Print the list of shells found in /etc/shells and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display short help and exit.

       -V, --version
              Output version information and exit.

       If no option is specified chsh.ldap will prompt the user to enter a value for the shell.

FILES
       /etc/shells - list of valid login shells
