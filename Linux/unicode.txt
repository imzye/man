NAME
       paracode - command line Unicode conversion tool

SYNOPSIS
       paracode [-t tables] string

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the paracode command.

       paracode  exploits the full power of the Unicode standard to convert the text into visually similar stream of glyphs, while using completely different codepoints.  It is an excellent didactic tool
       demonstrating the principles and advanced use of the Unicode standard.

       paracode is a command line tool working as a filter, reading standard input in UTF-8 encoding and writing to standard output.

OPTIONS
       -ttables
              --tablestables

              Use given list of conversion tables, separated by a plus sign.

              Special name 'all' selects all the tables.

              Note that selecting 'other', 'cyrillic_plus' and 'cherokee' tables (and 'all') makes use of rather esoteric characters, and not all fonts contain them.

              Special table 'mirror' uses quite different character substitution, is not selected automatically with 'all' and does not work well with anything except plain ascii alphabetical characters.

              Example:

              paracode -t cyrillic+greek+cherokee

              paracode -t cherokee  <input >output

              paracode -r -t mirror  <input >output

              Possible tables are:

              cyrillic

              cyrillic_plus

              greek

              other

              cherokee

              all

       -r

              Display text in reverse order after conversion, best used together with -t mirror.
