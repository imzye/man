NAME
       les, bus - ATM LAN Emulation service demons

SYNOPSIS
       lecs [-l listen_address] [-f configuration_file] [-d ]

DESCRIPTION
       LE Service consists of three components: LAN Emulation Configuration Server (lecs), LAN Emulation Server ( les(8)) and Broadcast and Unknown Server (bus(8)).

       Lecs implements the distribution of LECs to different emulated LANs. This is done by giving different LAN Emulation Server ATM addresses to LECs. Distribution is based on lecs's configuration database
       and information provided by the LE client. It is not required that a lecs exists for all emulated LANs. It is possible to bypass this configuration phase by directly telling ATM address of the  les(8)
       to the LEC.

       Configuration file example for lecs:
         # Our ATM address (should be included to differentiate us from
         # e.g. LEC)
         # Must be before ELAN definitions
         470023000000030300010002010020ea000ae905

         # ELAN name is inside brackets.
         # Parameters below are for Ethernet type LE (Linux & almost all
         # other LE clients)
         [tut-lane1]
         # Address of the LES
         LES:=470023000000030300010002010020ea000ae901
         # 802_3 or 802_5 (802_3 = Ethernet)
         Type:=802_3
         # 1515, 4544, 9234 or 18190 (1516= Ethernet)
         Max_Frame:=1516

         # ATM address for hosts that are guided to this ELAN.
         # Wildcard is x or X.
         470023000000030300010002010020ea0005aax0
         470023000000030000010002010020ea0005bx00
         47.002300000003030001000201.00603E2FDX23.00
         470023000000030300010002010020ea000Xxx00
         DEFAULT
         # Another ELAN, which has empty name
         [asdf]
         # This directive sets this elan as the default i.e. it will be
         # included if LEC's configure request could not be matched to
         # other ELANs
         #DEFAULT
         LES= 470023000000030300010002010020ea000ae902
         Type=Ethernet

       Rules for finding ELAN definitions using information provided in LE_CONFIGURE_REQUEST and the configuration file are as follows:

         1. Find an entry where ELAN-NAME matches exactly and an
            ATM address of the LEC is found in ELAN definition.
            These are to match exactly with the information given in
            LE_CONFIGURE_REQUEST. If ELAN-NAME is found, but ATM
            address doesn't match then reject with reason "Permission
            denied".
         2. Search for first ELAN which matches in type of emulated LAN,
            maximum frame size and ATM address of the LEC.
         3. If matching ELAN was not found, return default ELAN
            definitions.
         4. No match, so request is rejected with reason "No
            Configuration".

         SIGHUP restarts the server.

OPTIONS
       -d     Reads the configuration file, dumps its contents and exits.

       -l listen_address
              Use the listen_address to where wait connections.

       -f configuration_file
              Use the specified configuration file instead of .lecs_conf.

FILES
       .lecs_conf               configuration file

BUGS
       Undocumented.
