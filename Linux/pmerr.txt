NAME
       pmerr - translate Performance Co-Pilot error codes into error messages

SYNOPSIS
       pmerr [-?]  code ...
       pmerr -l

DESCRIPTION
       pmerr  accepts  standard Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) error codes via the
       code argument(s) and generates the corresponding error text.

       Each code may be an integer, a hexadecimal value or a hexadecimal value
       prefixed by either ``0x'' or ``0X''.

       Error  codes must be less than zero, so if code is a positive number, a
       warning message is produced, and the negated value is used.

OPTIONS
       The available command line options are:

       -l, --list
            This alternative invocation causes all known  error  codes  to  be
            listed, along with their symbolic names and error text.

       -?, --help
            Display usage message and exit.

PCP ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the
       file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installation,  the  file
       /etc/pcp.conf  contains  the  local  values  for  these variables.  The
       $PCP_CONF variable may be used to specify an alternative  configuration
       file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
