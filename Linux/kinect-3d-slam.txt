NAME
       kinect-3d-slam - Demo for Kinect sensor and 3D SLAM

SYNOPSIS
       kinect-3d-slam

DESCRIPTION
       kinect-3d-slam is a very simple implementation of 3D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a live Kinect sensor. It tracks image features and employ the depth information to estimate the
       motion of the sensor and reconstruct a 3D point cloud of the environment.
