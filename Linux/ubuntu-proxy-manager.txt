NAME
       ubuntu-proxy-manager - Manage Ubuntu system proxy settings

SYNOPSIS
       ubuntu-proxy-manager [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       Ubuntu Proxy Manager is a D-Bus mediated service that allows for managing system proxy settings via multiple backends (APT, environment variables and GSettings).

       This program is not intended to be run by hand, rather by a D-Bus activated systemd service.

       When  activated,  it  will listen for D-Bus calls to set the system proxy configuration (APT, environment, GSettings). The program will exit if no D-Bus call is received shortly after activa‐
       tion.

OPTIONS
       -d --debug
              enable debug logging

       -v --version
              print version and exit

       -h --help
              print help message and exit

COMMANDS
       This program does not take any arguments.
