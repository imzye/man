NAME
       starplot - view 3d perspective maps of stars

SYNOPSIS
       starplot [ GTK+ opts ] [ datafile1 [ datafile2 [...] ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       StarPlot is a GTK+ based program, written in C++, that can be used interactively to view three-dimensional perspective charts of stars.  It is licensed under the GNU General Public License.

       Currently StarPlot does not have any command-line flags other than those built into all GTK+ applications.  One or more data files to open can be specified at the command line.  If none are specified,
       and this is the first time using StarPlot, the program will open the default file, /usr/share/starplot/examples/sample.stars.  StarPlot saves its settings on exit to an rc  file,  ~/.starplotrc.   For
       detailed information on how to use the program, see the HTML documentation.

FILES
       /usr/share/starplot/ - Contains StarPlot data files
       /usr/share/doc/starplot/ - Contains documentation
       ~/.starplotrc - Saved program settings for each user
