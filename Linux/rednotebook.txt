NAME
       rednotebook - daily journal with calendar, templates and keyword searching

SYNOPSIS
       rednotebook [options] [journal-path]

DESCRIPTION
       RedNotebook  is  a  desktop diary that makes it very easy for you to keep track of the stuff you do and the thoughts you have. This journal software helps you to write whole passages or just facts
       and does so in style.

OPTIONS
       --date=DATE
              Open RedNotebook on the specified date (format YYYY-MM-DD)

       -h, --help
              Show help text and exit

       --version
              Show version number and exit

       journal-path can be one of the following:
        - An absolute path (e.g. /home/username/myjournal)
        - A relative patch (e.g. ../dir/myjournal)
        - The name of a directory under $HOME/.rednotebook/ (e.g. myjournal)

       If the journal-path is omitted the last session's journal will be used.  At the first program start this defaults to $HOME/.rednotebook/data.

       Configuration is stored in the file ~/.rednotebook/configuration.cfg.

FILES
       /usr/bin/rednotebook - RedNotebook executable
       ~/.rednotebook - per-user configuration and notebooks
