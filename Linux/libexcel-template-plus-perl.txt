NAME
       Excel::Template::Plus - An extension to the Excel::Template module

SYNOPSIS
         use Excel::Template::Plus;

         my $template = Excel::Template::Plus->new(
             engine   => 'TT',
             template => 'greeting.tmpl',
             config   => { INCLUDE  => [ '/templates' ] },
             params   => { greeting => 'Hello' }
         );

         $template->param(location => 'World');

         $template->write_file('greeting.xls');

DISCLAIMER
       This is the very first release of this module, it is an idea that I and Rob Kinyon (the author of Excel::Template) had discussed many times, but never got around to doing. This is the first
       attempt at bring this to reality, it may change radically as it evolves, so be warned.

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an extension of the Excel::Template module, which allows the user to use various "engines" from which you can create Excel files through Excel::Template.

       The idea is to use the existing (and very solid) excel file generation code in Excel::Template, but to extend its more templatey bits with more powerful options.

       The only engine currently provided is the Template Toolkit engine, which replaces Excel::Template's built in template features (the LOOP, and IF constructs) with the full power of TT. This is
       similar to the module Excel::Template::TT, but expands on that even further to try and create a more extensive system.

       You can use this module to create Excel::Template-compatible XML files using one of the supported engines. For example, with the TT engine you could create a Excel::Template XML file like:

         <workbook>
           <worksheet name="[% worksheet_name %]">
            [% my_cols = get_list_of_columns %]
             <row>
            [% FOR col = my_cols %]
              <bold><cell>[% col %]</cell></bold>
            [% END %]
             </row>
            [% FOR my_row = get_list_of_objects %]
             <row>
                [% FOR col = my_cols %]
                 <cell>[% my_row.$col %]</cell>
                [% END %]
             </row>
            [% END %]
           </worksheet>
         </workbook>

       Your TT template thus creates a XML file suitable to handing over to Excel::Template for processing. Excel::Template::Plus simplifies the template-creation and handing-over process.

       Future engine/plans include:

       Pure Perl
           This  would  allow  you  to  write you Excel::Template files using Perl itself which would then output the XML for Excel::Template to consume. This would be modeled after the recently released
           Template::Declare module perhaps.

       TT Plugins/Macros/Wrappers
           This is basically anything which will make the TT engine easier to write templates for. I have experimented with some of these things, but I was not happy with any of them  enough  to  release
           them yet.

       HTML::Template
           Excel::Template's templating features are based on HTML::Template, but the HTML::Template plugins and other goodies are not compatible. This engine would bring those things to Excel::Template.

METHODS
       new (%options)
           This  method basically serves as a factory for creating new engine instances (for which Excel::Template::Plus::TT is the only one currently). The only parameter that it requires is engine, all
           other parameters are passed onto the engine's constructor (see the individual docs for more details on what is required).

       meta
           Access to the metaclass.

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to cpan-RT.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       This module came out of several discussions I had with Rob Kinyon.
