MALMAKE(1)                  Malaga quick reference                  MALMAKE(1)

NAME
       malmake - compile a Malaga project

SYNOPSIS
       malmake [-new] project-file

DESCRIPTION
       Malaga is a development environment for natural-language grammars based
       on the Left-Associative Grammar formalism.  Malaga grammars can be used
       for automatic morphological and/or syntactic analysis.

       The  program  malmake reads a project file, checks if all grammar files
       needed do exist, and translates all grammar files  that  have  not  yet
       been translated or whose source files have changed since they have been
       translated. It calls the programs malsym(1), mallex(1) and malrul(1) if
       needed.   It  is  in  essence a make(1) for the Malaga programming lan‐
       guage.

       See info Malaga for details.
