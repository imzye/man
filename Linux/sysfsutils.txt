NAME
       sysfs.conf, sysfs.d/*.conf - Linux sysfs attributes setting configuration files

DESCRIPTION
       These configuration files are used to set sysfs attribute values and modify their file mode or owner, during the system boot.

       Note that these configuration files are concerned with the /sys filesystem and should not be confused with the /etc/sysctl.conf configuration which is concerned with the /proc/sys filesystem
       instead.

FORMAT
       The syntax consists on a series of line based directives for sysfs attributes, those being pathnames within that filesystem, with the following format:

       attribute = value
           Set value for the sysfs attribute.

       mode attribute = mode
           Set the mode for the sysfs attribute.  Where mode is any mode accepted by chmod(1).

       owner attribute = owner[:group]
           Set the owner (and/or group) for the sysfs attribute.  Where owner (and/or group) are any specification accepted by chown(1).

       Leading and trailing whitespace (SPACE, TAB), and whitespace around the = character are ignored.

       Comments start with a # character until the end of line.  Empty or whitespace-only lines are also ignored.

       The attribute paths support glob(7) wildcard patterns.

       Any attribute that does not exist will be warned about, but will not cause the loading to fail.

FILES
       /etc/sysfs.conf
           The main configuration file.  It gets loaded first if readable.

       /etc/sysfs.d/*.conf
           The optional configuration fragment files.  These get loaded after the main configuration file, if readable, in glob order.

EXAMPLES
       Always use the powersave CPU frequency governor.

         devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor = powersave

       Use userspace CPU frequency governor and set initial speed.

         devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor = userspace
         devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed = 600000

       Set permissions of suspend control file.

         mode power/state = 0660
         owner power/state = root:power
