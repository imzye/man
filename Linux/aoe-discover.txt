NAME
       aoe-discover - tell aoe driver to discover AoE devices

SYNOPSIS
       aoe-discover

DESCRIPTION
       The aoe-discover command tells the aoe driver to discover ATA over Ethernet (AoE) devices on the network.  All network interfaces will be probed with a AoE config query broadcast.

       If  the  aoe-interfaces  command has limited the allowable network interfaces, only devices discovered via allowable interfaces will become available.  The default is to make available all AoE devices
       found on all accessible ethernet networks.

       It's good to run the aoe-discover command after running aoe-interfaces.

EXAMPLE
       In this example, the root user on a host named nai loads the aoe module with only eth0 allowable for AoE traffic.  After remembering that shelf 7 is on eth3, this sysadmin uses aoe-interfaces  to  add
       eth3 to the list of allowable network interfaces and then calls aoe-discover to ask the aoe driver to look for new AoE devices.

              nai:~# modprobe aoe aoe_iflist="eth0"
              nai:~# aoe-stat
                 e10.9            eth0              up
              nai:~# aoe-interfaces eth0 eth3
              nai:~# aoe-discover
              nai:~# aoe-stat
                  e7.0            eth3              up
                  e7.1            eth3              up
                  e7.2            eth3              up
                  e7.3            eth3              up
                  e7.4            eth3              up
                  e7.5            eth3              up
                  e7.6            eth3              up
                  e7.7            eth3              up
                  e7.8            eth3              up
                  e7.9            eth3              up
                 e10.9            eth0              up
