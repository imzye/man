NAME
       64tass - A multi pass optimizing macro assembler for the 65xx series of processors

SYNOPSIS
       64tass [OPTION]... [SOURCES]...

DESCRIPTION
       64tass is cross assembler targeting the 65xx series of micro processors. This manual is only describing the command line options. The many features are described in the HTML manual.

OPTIONS
   Output options
       -o filename, --output filename
            Place  output  into  filename.  The default output filename is 'a.out', this option changes it. May be used multiple times. The format is remembered but section and memory map file reverts to
            global after each file.

       --output-append filename
            Append to output file instead of overwriting it.

       --no-output
            Same as output but no file will be written.

       --map filename
            Place memory map into filename instead of displaying it.

       --map-append filename
            Append memory map to a file instead of displaying it.

       --no-map
            The memory map won't be displayed or recorded.

       --output-section sectionname
            Output this section instead of everything

       --output-exec expression
            Sets execution address for output formats which support this.

       -X, --long-address
            Use 3 byte address/length for CBM and nonlinear output instead of 2 bytes. Also increases the size of raw output to 16 MiB.

       --cbm-prg
            Generate CBM format binaries (default).  The first 2 bytes are the little endian address of the first valid byte (start address). Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory  is
            filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the last valid bytes are not saved. Up to 64 KiB or 16 MiB with long address.

       -b, --nostart
            Output  raw data only without start address.  Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the last valid
            bytes are not saved. Up to 64 KiB or 16 MiB with long address.

       -f, --flat
            Flat address space output mode.  Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory after the last valid byte is not saved.  Up to 4 GiB.

       -n, --nonlinear
            Generate nonlinear output file.  Overlapping blocks are flattened. Blocks are saved in sorted order and uninitialized memory is skipped. Up to 64 KiB or 16 MiB with long address.

       --atari-xex
            Generate a Atari XEX output file.  Overlapping blocks are kept, continuing blocks are concatenated. Saving happens in the definition order without sorting, and uninitialized memory is skipped
            in the output. Up to 64 KiB.

       --apple-ii
            Generate a Apple II output file (DOS 3.3).  Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the  last  valid
            bytes are not saved. Up to 64 KiB.  --c256-pgx Generate a C256 Foenix PGX output file.  Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory
            before the first and after the last valid bytes are not saved. Up to 16 MiB.

       --c256-pgz
            Generate a C256 Foenix PGZ output file.  Overlapping blocks are flattened. Blocks are saved in sorted order and uninitialized memory is skipped. Up to 16 MiB.

       --cody-bin
            Generate  a  Cody  binary output file.  Overlapping blocks are flattened and uninitialized memory is filled up with zeros. Uninitialized memory before the first and after the last valid bytes
            are not saved. Up to 64 KiB.

       --wdc-bin
            Generate WDC binary output file. Also known as zardoz binary.  Overlapping blocks are flattened. Blocks are saved in sorted order and uninitialized memory is skipped. Up to 16 MiB.

       --intel-hex
            Use Intel HEX output file format.  Overlapping blocks are kept, data is stored in the definition order, and uninitialized areas are skipped. I8HEX up to 64 KiB, I32HEX up to 4 GiB.

       --s-record
            Use Motorola S-record output file format.  Overlapping blocks are kept, data is stored in the definition order, and uninitialized memory areas are skipped. S19 up to 64 KiB, S28 up to 16  MiB
            and S37 up to 4 GiB.

   Operation options
       -a, --ascii
            Use  ASCII/Unicode  text  encoding  instead  of raw 8-bit.  Normally no conversion takes place, this is for backwards compatibility with a DOS based Turbo Assembler editor, which could create
            PETSCII files for 6502tass. (including control characters of course) Using this option will change the default 'none' and 'screen' encodings to  map  'a'-'z'  and  'A'-'Z'  into  the  correct
            PETSCII  range  of $41-$5A and $C1-$DA, which is more suitable for an ASCII editor. It also adds predefined petcat style PETSCII literals to the default encodings, and enables Unicode letters
            in symbol names.  For writing sources in UTF-8/UTF-16 encodings this option is required!

       -B, --long-branch
            Automatic BXX *+5 JMP xxx. Branch too long messages can be annoying sometimes, usually they'll need to be rewritten to BXX *+5 JMP xxx. 64tass can do this  automatically  if  this  option  is
            used. But BRA is not converted.

       -C, --case-sensitive
            Make all symbols (variables, opcodes, directives, operators, etc.) case sensitive. Otherwise everything is case insensitive by default.

       -D label=value
            Defines a label to a value. Same syntax is allowed as in source files. Be careful with string quoting, the shell might eat some of the characters.

       -q, --quiet
            Suppress messages. Disables header and summary messages.

       -T, --tasm-compatible
            Enable  TASM  compatible  operators  and precedence Switches the expression evaluator into compatibility mode. This enables '.', ':' and '!' operators and disables 64tass specific extensions,
            disables precedence handling and forces 16 bit unsigned evaluation (see 'differences to original Turbo Assembler' below)

       -I path
            Specify include search path.  If an included source or binary file can't be found in the directory of the source file then this path is tried. More than one directories can  be  specified  by
            repeating this option. If multiple matches exist the first one is used.

       -M file, --dependencies file
            Specify make rule output file.  Writes a dependency rule suitable for 'make' from the list of files used during compilation.

       --dependencies-append file
            Append to dependencies file instead of overwriting it.

       --make-phony
            Enable phony target generation for dependencies.

   Diagnostic options
       -E file, --error file
            Specify  error  output  file.   Normally compilation errors a written to the standard error output. It's possible to redirect them to a file or to the standard output by using '-' as the file
            name.

       --error-append file
            Append to error file instead of overwriting it.

       --no-error
            Do not output any errors, just count them.

       -w, --no-warn
            Suppress warnings. Disables warnings during compile. Finer grained warning control is available by using the -W options.

       --no-caret-diag
            Suppress displaying of faulty source line and fault position after fault messages.

       --macro-caret-diag
            Restrict source line and fault position display to macro expansions only.

       -Wall
            Enable most diagnostic warnings, except those individually disabled. Or with the 'no-' prefix disable all except those enabled.

       -Werror
            Make all diagnostic warnings to an error, except those individually set to a warning.

       -Werror=<name>
            Change a diagnostic warning to an error.  For example '-Werror=implied-reg' makes this check an error. The '-Wno-error=' variant is useful with '-Werror' to set some to warnings.

       -Walias
            Warns about alias opcodes.

       -Walign
            Warns whenever padding bytes were added for an alignment.

       -Waltmode
            Warn about alternative address modes.  Sometimes alternative addressing modes are used as the fitting one is not available. For example there's no lda direct page y so instead data bank y  is
            used with a warning.

       -Wbranch-page
            Warns if a branch is crossing a page.  Page crossing branches execute with a penalty cycle. This option helps to locate them.

       -Wcase-symbol
            Warn if symbol letter case is used inconsistently.

       -Wimmediate
            Warns  for cases where immediate addressing is more likely.  -Wimplied-reg Warns if implied addressing is used instead of register.  Some instructions have implied aliases like 'asl' for 'asl
            a' for compatibility reasons, but this shorthand not the preferred form.

       -Wleading-zeros
            Warns if about leading zeros.  A leading zero could be a prefix for an octal number but as octals are not supported so the result will be decimal.

       -Wlong-branch
            Warns when a long branch is used.  This option gives a warning for instructions which were modified by the long branch function.  Less intrusive than disabling long branches and see where  it
            fails.

       -Wmacro-prefix
            Warn  about  macro call without prefix.  Such macro calls can easily be mistaken to be labels if invoked without parameters.  Also it's hard to notice that an unchanged call turned into label
            after the definition got renamed. This warning helps to find such calls so that prefixes can be added.

       -Wno-deprecated
            Don't warn about deprecated features.  Unfortunately there were some features added previously which shouldn't have been included. This option disables warnings about their uses.

       -Wno-float-compare
            Don't warn if floating point comparisons are only approximate.  Floating point numbers have a finite precision and comparing them might give unexpected results.

       -Wno-float-round
            Don't warn when floating point numbers are implicitly rounded.  A lot of parameters are expecting integers but floating point numbers are accepted as well. The style of rounding used  may  or
            may not be what you wanted.

       -Wno-ignored
            Don't warn about ignored directives.

       -Wno-jmp-bug
            Don't warn about the jmp ($xxff) bug.  It's fine that the high byte is read from the 'wrong' address on 6502, NMOS 6502 and 65DTV02.

       -Wno-label-left
            Don't warn about certain labels not being on left side.  You may disable this if you use labels which look like mistyped versions of implied addressing mode instructions and you don't want to
            put them in the first column.

       -Wno-page
            Don't do an error for page crossing.

       -Wno-pitfalls
            Don't note on common pitfalls.  Experts don't need notes about how to fix things ;)

       -Wno-portable
            Don't warn about source portability problems.

       -Wno-size-larger
            Don't warn if size is larger due to negative offset Negative offsets add space in front of memory area that's out of bound. Sometimes this may be fine.

       -Wno-priority
            Don't warn about operator priority problems.  Not all of the unary operators are strongly binding and this may cause surprises.

       -Wno-star-assign
            Don't warn about ignored compound multiply.

       -Wno-wrap-addr
            Don't warn about address space calculation wrap around.  If a memory location ends up outside of the processors address space then just wrap it around.

       -Wno-wrap-bank0
            Don't warn for bank 0 address calculation wrap around.

       -Wno-wrap-dpage
            Don't warn for direct page address calculation wrap around.

       -Wno-wrap-mem
            Don't warn for compile offset wrap around.  Continue from the beginning of image file once it's end was reached.

       -Wno-wrap-pbank
            Don't warn for program bank address calculation wrap around.

       -Wno-wrap-pc
            Don't warn for program counter bank crossing.  If it's data only and the programmer deals with it then this might be ok.

       -Wold-equal
            Warn about old equal operator.  The single '=' operator is only there for compatibility reasons and should be written as '==' normally.

       -Woptimize
            Warn about optimizable code.  Warns on things that could be optimized, at least according to the limited analysis done.

       -Wshadow
            Warn about symbol shadowing.  Checks if local variables 'shadow' other variables of same name in upper scopes in ambiguous ways.

       -Wstrict-bool
            Warn about implicit boolean conversions.  Boolean values can be interpreted as numeric 0/1 and other types as booleans. This is convenient but may cause mistakes.

       -Wunused
            Warn about unused constant symbols, any type.

       -Wunused-const
            Warn about unused constants.

       -Wunused-label
            Warn about unused labels.

       -Wunused-macro
            Warn about unused macros.

       -Wunused-variable
            Warn about unused variables.

   Target selection options
       --m65xx

       --m45gs02
            45GS02. Enables extra opcodes and addressing modes specific to this CPU. Useful for MEGA65 projects.

   Symbol listing options
       -l file, --labels=file
            List labels into file. May be used multiple times. The format is remembered but root reverts to global after each file.

       --labels-append=file
            Append labels to file instead of overwriting it.

       --labels-root=<expression>
            Specify the scope to list labels from.

       --labels-section=<sectionname>
            Specify the section to list labels from.

       --labels-add-prefix=<prefix>
            Adds a prefix for some output formats.

       --normal-labels
            Lists labels in a 64tass readable format. (default)

       --export-labels
            List labels for include in a 64tass readable format. This will always compile exported .proc/.pend blocks assuming they're needed externally.

       --vice-labels
            List labels in a VICE readable format.

       --vice-labels-numeric
            List labels in a VICE readable format, including numeric constants.

       --dump-labels
            List labels for debugging.

            List labels in ctags format.

   Assembly listing options
       -L file, --list=file
            List into file. Dumps source code and compiled code into file. Useful for debugging, it's much easier to identify the code in memory within the source files.

       --list-append=file
            Append list to file instead of overwriting it.

       -m, --no-monitor
            Don't put monitor code into listing. There won't be any monitor listing in the list file.

       -s, --no-source
            Don't put source code into listing. There won't be any source listing in the list file.

       --line-numbers
            This option creates a new column for showing line numbers for easier identification of source origin.

       --tab-size=number
            By  default  the listing file is using a tab size of 8 to align the disassembly. This can be changed to other more favorable values like 4.  Only spaces are used if 1 is selected. Please note
            that this has no effect on the source code on the right hand side.

       --verbose-list
            Normally the assembler tries to minimize listing output by omitting 'unimportant' lines. But sometimes it's better to just list everything including comments and empty lines.

   Other options
       -?, --help
            Give this help list. Prints help about command line options.

       --usage
            Give a short usage message. Prints short help about command line options.

       -V, --version
            Print program version.

EXIT STATUS
       Normally the exit status is 0 if no error occurred.
