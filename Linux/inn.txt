NAME
       nntpsend.ctl - list of sites to feed via nntpsend

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/news/nntpsend.ctl specifies the default list of sites to be fed by nntpsend(8).

       Comments begin with a number sign (``#'') and continue through the end of the line.  Blank lines and comments are ignored.  All other lines should consist of four fields separated by a colon.

       The first field is the name of the site as specified in the newsfeeds(5) file.

       The second field should be the hostname or IP address of the remote site.

       The  third  field, if non-empty, specifies the default tail truncation size of site's batchfile.  If this field is empty, no truncation is performed.  If this field is of the form ``maxsize-trunc‐
       size'' then it is passed to shrinkfile as ``-m maxsize -s truncsize'', otherwise is of the form ``truncsize'' then it is passed as ``-s truncsize''.

       The fourth field specifies some default flags passed to innxmit(8).  The flag ``-a'' is always given to innxmit and need not appear hear.  If no ``-t timeout'' flag is given in this field  and  on
       the nntpsend command line, ``-t 180'' will be given to innxmit.
