MYSQL_SECURE_INSTALLATION(1)                                                                 MySQL Database System                                                                 MYSQL_SECURE_INSTALLATION(1)

NAME
       mysql_secure_installation - improve MySQL installation security

SYNOPSIS
       mysql_secure_installation

DESCRIPTION
       This program enables you to improve the security of your MySQL installation in the following ways:

       •   You can set a password for root accounts.

       •   You can remove root accounts that are accessible from outside the local host.

       •   You can remove anonymous-user accounts.

       •   You can remove the test database (which by default can be accessed by all users, even anonymous users), and privileges that permit anyone to access databases with names that start with test_.

       mysql_secure_installation helps you implement security recommendations similar to those described at Section 2.10.4, “Securing the Initial MySQL Account”.

       Normal usage is to connect to the local MySQL server; invoke mysql_secure_installation without arguments:

           mysql_secure_installation

       When executed, mysql_secure_installation prompts you to determine which actions to perform.

       The validate_password component can be used for password strength checking. If the plugin is not installed, mysql_secure_installation prompts the user whether to install it. Any passwords entered
       later are checked using the plugin if it is enabled.

       Most of the usual MySQL client options such as --host and --port can be used on the command line and in option files. For example, to connect to the local server over IPv6 using port 3307, use this
       command:

           mysql_secure_installation --host=::1 --port=3307

       mysql_secure_installation supports the following options, which can be specified on the command line or in the [mysql_secure_installation] and [client] groups of an option file. For information about
       option files used by MySQL programs, see Section 4.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”.

       •   --help, -?  Display a help message and exit.

       •   --defaults-extra-file=file_name Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix) before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible, an error
           occurs. If file_name is not an absolute path name, it is interpreted relative to the current directory.

           For additional information about this and other option-file options, see Section 4.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”.

       •   --defaults-file=file_name Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs. If file_name is not an absolute path name, it is interpreted
           relative to the current directory.

           For additional information about this and other option-file options, see Section 4.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”.

       •   --defaults-group-suffix=str Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with the usual names and a suffix of str. For example, mysql_secure_installation normally reads the [client] and
           [mysql_secure_installation] groups. If this option is given as --defaults-group-suffix=_other, mysql_secure_installation also reads the [client_other] and [mysql_secure_installation_other] groups.

           For additional information about this and other option-file options, see Section 4.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”.

       •   --host=host_name, -h host_name Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       •   --no-defaults Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to reading unknown options from an option file, --no-defaults can be used to prevent them from being read.

           The exception is that the .mylogin.cnf file is read in all cases, if it exists. This permits passwords to be specified in a safer way than on the command line even when --no-defaults is used. To
           create .mylogin.cnf, use the mysql_config_editor utility. See mysql_config_editor(1).

           For additional information about this and other option-file options, see Section 4.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”.

       •   --password=password, -p password This option is accepted but ignored. Whether or not this option is used, mysql_secure_installation always prompts the user for a password.

       •   --port=port_num, -P port_num For TCP/IP connections, the port number to use.

       •   --print-defaults Print the program name and all options that it gets from option files.

           For additional information about this and other option-file options, see Section 4.2.2.3, “Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling”.

       •   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY} The transport protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is useful when the other connection parameters normally result in use of a protocol other than
           the one you want. For details on the permissible values, see Section 4.2.7, “Connection Transport Protocols”.

       •   --socket=path, -S path For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

           On Windows, this option applies only if the server was started with the named_pipe system variable enabled to support named-pipe connections. In addition, the the connection must be a member of
           the Windows group specified by the named_pipe_full_access_group system variable.

       •   --ssl* Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect to the server using encryption and indicate where to find SSL keys and certificates. See the section called “Command Options for
           Encrypted Connections”.

       •   --ssl-fips-mode={OFF|ON|STRICT} Controls whether to enable FIPS mode on the client side. The --ssl-fips-mode option differs from other --ssl-xxx options in that it is not used to establish
           encrypted connections, but rather to affect which cryptographic operations to permit. See Section 6.8, “FIPS Support”.

           These --ssl-fips-mode values are permitted:

           •   OFF: Disable FIPS mode.

           •   ON: Enable FIPS mode.

           •   STRICT: Enable “strict” FIPS mode.

               Note
               If the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module is not available, the only permitted value for --ssl-fips-mode is OFF. In this case, setting --ssl-fips-mode to ON or STRICT causes the client to produce a
               warning at startup and to operate in non-FIPS mode.

       •   --tls-ciphersuites=ciphersuite_list The permissible ciphersuites for encrypted connections that use TLSv1.3. The value is a list of one or more colon-separated ciphersuite names. The ciphersuites
           that can be named for this option depend on the SSL library used to compile MySQL. For details, see Section 6.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”.

           This option was added in MySQL 8.0.16.

       •   --tls-version=protocol_list The permissible TLS protocols for encrypted connections. The value is a list of one or more comma-separated protocol names. The protocols that can be named for this
           option depend on the SSL library used to compile MySQL. For details, see Section 6.3.2, “Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers”.

       •   --use-default Execute noninteractively. This option can be used for unattended installation operations.

       •   --user=user_name, -u user_name The user name of the MySQL account to use for connecting to the server.
