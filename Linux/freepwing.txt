NAME
       fpwmake - a wrapper for FreePWING

SYNOPSIS
       fpwmake [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the fpwmake and bar commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it
       has documentation in HTML format; see /usr/share/doc/freepwing/.

AUTHOR
       This manual page was written by Masayuki Hatta (mhatta) <mhatta@debian.org>, for the Debian project (but may be used by others).
