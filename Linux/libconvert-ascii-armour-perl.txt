DESCRIPTION
       This module converts hashes of binary octets into ASCII messages suitable for transfer over 6-bit clean transport channels. The encoded ASCII resembles PGP's armoured messages, but are in no way
       compatible with PGP.

METHODS
   new()
       Constructor.

   armour()
       Converts a hash of binary octets into an ASCII encoded message. The encoded message has 4 parts: head and tail strings that act as identifiers and delimiters, a cluster of headers at top of the
       message, Base64 encoded message body and a Base64 encoded MD5 digest of the message body. armour() takes a hash as argument with following keys:

       Object
           An identification string embedded in head and tail strings.

       Content
           Content  is a hashref that contains the binary octets to be encoded. This hash is serialized, compressed (if specified) and encoded into ASCII with MIME::Base64.  The result is the body of the
           encoded message.

       Headers
           Headers is a hashref that contains ASCII headers that are placed at top of the encoded message. Headers are encoded as RFC822 headers.

       Compress
           A boolean parameter that forces armour() to compress the message body.

   unarmour()
       Decodes an armoured ASCII message into the hash provided as argument to armour(). The hash contains Content, Object, and Headers.  unarmour() performs several consistency checks and returns a non-
       true value on failure.

   errstr()
       Returns the error message set by unarmour() on failure.
