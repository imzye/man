STRESS-NG(1)                                                                              General Commands Manual                                                                              STRESS-NG(1)

NAME
       stress-ng - stress "next generation", a tool to load and stress a computer system

SYNOPSIS
       stress-ng [OPTION [ARG]] ...

DESCRIPTION
       stress-ng  will  stress  test  a computer system in various selectable ways. It was designed to exercise physical subsystems of a computer as well as operating system kernel interfaces.  stress-ng
       also has a wide range of CPU specific stress tests that exercise floating point, integer, bit manipulation, cache, vector instructions and control flow.

       stress-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip hardware issues such as thermal overruns as well as operating system bugs that only occur when a  system  is  being  thrashed
       hard. Use stress-ng with caution as some of the tests can make a system run hot on poorly designed hardware and also can cause excessive system thrashing which may be difficult to stop.

       stress-ng  can also measure test throughput rates; this can be useful to observe performance changes across different operating system releases or types of hardware. However, it has never been in‐
       tended to be used as a precise benchmark test suite, so do NOT use it in this manner.

       Running stress-ng with root privileges will adjust out of memory settings on Linux systems to make the stressors unkillable in low memory situations, so use this judiciously.  With the appropriate
       privilege, stress-ng can allow the ionice class and ionice levels to be adjusted, again, this should be used with care.

       One can specify the number of processes to invoke per type of stress test; specifying a zero value will select the number of processors available as defined  by  sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF),  if
       that  can't be determined then the number of online CPUs is used.  If the value is less than zero then the number of online CPUs is used. Specifying the number as a percentage will select the per‐
       centage of configured CPUs (truncated down to nearest whole number).

OPTIONS
       General stress-ng control options:

       --abort
              this option will force all running stressors to abort (terminate) if any other stressor terminates prematurely because of a failure.

       --aggressive
              enables more file, cache and memory aggressive options as well as forcing processes to change CPU affinity very frequently. This will slow tests down, increase latencies and reduce the num‐
              ber of bogo ops as well as changing the balance of user time vs system time used depending on the type of stressor being used.

       -a N, --all N, --parallel N
              start N instances of all stressors in parallel. If N is less than zero, then the number of CPUs online is used for the number of instances.  If N is zero, then the number of configured CPUs
              in the system is used.

       -b N, --backoff N
              wait N microseconds between the start of each stress worker process. This allows one to ramp up the stress tests over time.

       --buildinfo
              report build information such as build date and time, compiler used, compilation and linker flags, standard C version used.

       --c-states
              report CPU C-state residencies.

       --change-cpu
              this forces child processes of some stressors to change to a different CPU from the parent on startup. Note that during the execution of the stressor the scheduler may choose move the  par‐
              ent  onto  the  same CPU as the child. The stressors affected by this option are client/server style stressors, such as the network stressors (sock, sockmany, udp, etc) or context switching
              stressors (switch, pipe, etc).

       --class name
              specify the class of stressors to run. Stressors are classified into one or more of the following classes: compute, cpu, cpu-cache, device, fp, gpu, interrupt, integer, ipc, io, filesystem,
              memory, network, os, pipe, scheduler, search, signal, sort, vector and vm.  Some stressors fall into just one class. For example the `get' stressor is just in the `os' class.  Other  stres‐
              sors  fall  into  more than one class, for example, the `lsearch' stressor falls into the `cpu', `cpu-cache', `memory' and `search' classes as it exercises all these four.  Selecting a spe‐
              cific class will run all the stressors that fall into that class only when run with the --sequential option.

              Specifying a name followed by an escaped question mark (for example --class vm\?) will print out all the stressors in that specific class.

       --config
              print out the configuration used to build stress-ng.

       -n, --dry-run
              parse options, but do not run stress tests. A no-op.

       --ftrace
              enable kernel function call tracing (Linux only).  This will use the kernel debugfs ftrace mechanism to record all the kernel functions used on the system while stress-ng is running.   This
              is only as accurate as the kernel ftrace output, so there may be some variability on the data reported.

       -h, --help
              show help.

       --ignite-cpu
              alter kernel controls to try and maximize the CPU. This requires root privilege to alter various /sys interface controls.  Currently this only works for Intel P-State enabled x86 systems on
              Linux.

       --interrupts
              check  for  any  system  management interrupts or error interrupts that occur, for example thermal overruns, machine check exceptions, etc. Note that the interrupts are accounted to all the
              concurrently running stressors, so total count for all stressors is over accounted.

       --ionice-class class
              specify ionice class (only on Linux). Can be idle (default), besteffort, be, realtime, rt.

       --ionice-level level
              specify ionice level (only on Linux). For idle, 0 is the only possible option. For besteffort or realtime values 0 (highest priority) to 7 (lowest priority). See ionice(1) for more details.

       --iostat S
              every S seconds show I/O statistics on the device that stores the stress-ng temporary files. This is either the device of the current working directory or the  --temp-path  specified  path.
              Currently a Linux only option.  The fields output are:

              Column Heading   Explanation
              Inflight         number of I/O requests that have been issued to the device driver but have not yet completed
              Rd K/s           read rate in 1024 bytes per second
              Wr K/s           write rate in 1024 bytes per second
              Rd/s             reads per second
              Wr/s             writes per second

       --job jobfile
              run  stressors  using a jobfile.  The jobfile is essentially a file containing stress-ng options (without the leading --) with one option per line. Lines may have comments with comment text
              proceeded by the # character. A simple example is as follows:

              run sequential   # run stressors sequentially
              verbose          # verbose output
              metrics-brief    # show metrics at end of run
              timeout 60s      # stop each stressor after 60 seconds
              #
              # vm stressor options:
              #
              vm 2             # 2 vm stressors
              vm-bytes 128M    # 128 MB available memory shared by 2 vm stressors
              vm-keep          # keep vm mapping
              vm-populate      # populate memory
              #
              # memcpy stressor options:
              #
              memcpy 5         # 5 memcpy stressors

              The job file introduces the run command that specifies how to run the stressors:

              run sequential - run stressors sequentially
              run parallel - run stressors together in parallel

              Note that `run parallel' is the default.

       --keep-files
              do not remove files and directories created by the stressors. This can be useful for debugging purposes. Not generally recommended as it can fill up a file system.

       -k, --keep-name
              by default, stress-ng will attempt to change the name of the stress processes according to their functionality; this option disables this and keeps the process names to be the name  of  the
              parent process, that is, stress-ng.

       -K, --klog-check
              check the kernel log for kernel error and warning messages and report these as soon as they are detected. Linux only and requires root capability to read the kernel log.

       --ksm  enable kernel samepage merging (Linux only). This is a memory-saving de-duplication feature for merging anonymous (private) pages.

       --limit-as
              set  stressor  process's  maximum  size of the virtual memory (address space), see rlimit(2) RLIMIT_AS. The parameter can be specified as an absolute number of bytes (e.g. 1G for 1 GB) or a
              percentage of the current free memory, e.g. 20%

       --limit-data
              set stressor process's maximum size of the data segment (initialized data, uninitialized data, and heap), see rlimit(2) RLIMIT_DATA. The parameter can be specified as an absolute number  of
              bytes (e.g. 128M for 128 MB) or a percentage of the current free memory, e.g. 5%

       --limit-stack
              set stressor process's maximum size of the stack, see rlimit(2) RLIMIT_STACK. The parameter can be specified as an absolute number of bytes (e.g. 2M for 2 MB) or a percentage of the current
              free memory, e.g. 1%

       --log-brief
              by  default stress-ng will report the name of the program, the message type and the process id as a prefix to all output. The --log-brief option will output messages without these fields to
              produce a less verbose output.

       --log-file filename
              write messages to the specified log file, this does not replace the output from stdout, but creates a logged copy of it in the specified file. Lines of output are automatically  fsync'd  to
              the log file to try to reduce data loss.

       --log-lockless
              log  messages  use  a  lock  to avoid intermingling of blocks of stressor messages, however this may cause contention when emitting a high rate of logging messages in verbose mode with many
              stressors are running, for example when testing CPU scaling with many processes on many CPUs. This option disables log message locking.

       --maximize
              overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the maximum settings allowed.  These defaults can always be overridden by the per stressor settings options if required.

       --max-fd N
              set the maximum limit on file descriptors (value or a % of system allowed maximum).  By default, stress-ng can use all the available file descriptors; this option  sets  the  limit  in  the
              range  from  10  up  to the maximum limit of RLIMIT_NOFILE.  One can use a % setting too, e.g. 50% is half the maximum allowed file descriptors.  Note that stress-ng will use about 5 of the
              available file descriptors so take this into consideration when using this setting.

       --mbind list
              set strict NUMA memory allocation based on the list of NUMA nodes provided; page allocations will come from the node with sufficient free memory closest to the specified node(s)  where  the
              allocation  takes  place.  This uses the Linux set_mempolicy(2) call using the MPOL_BIND mode.  The NUMA nodes to be used are specified by a comma separated list of node (0 to N-1). One can
              specify a range of NUMA nodes using `-', for example: --mbind 0,2-3,6,7-11

       -M, --metrics
              output number of bogo operations in total performed by the stress processes.  Note that these are not a reliable metric of performance or throughput and have not been designed  to  be  used
              for  benchmarking  whatsoever.   Some stressors have additional metrics that are more useful than bogo-ops, and these are generally more useful for observing how a system behaves when under
              various kinds of load.

              The following columns of information are output:

              Column Heading              Explanation
              bogo ops                    number of iterations of the stressor during the run. This is metric of how much overall "work" has been achieved in bogo operations.  Do not use this as a  reli‐
                                          able measure of throughput for benchmarking.
              real time (secs)            average  wall clock duration (in seconds) of the stressor. This is the total wall clock time of all the instances of that particular stressor divided by the num‐
                                          ber of these stressors being run.
              usr time (secs)             total user time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the stressor.
              sys time (secs)             total system time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the stressor.
              bogo ops/s (real time)      total bogo operations per second based on wall clock run time. The wall clock time reflects the apparent run time. The more processors one has on  a  system  the
                                          more  the work load can be distributed onto these and hence the wall clock time will reduce and the bogo ops rate will increase.  This is essentially the "appar‐
                                          ent" bogo ops rate of the system.
              bogo ops/s (usr+sys time)   total bogo operations per second based on cumulative user and system time.  This is the real bogo ops rate of the system taking  into  consideration  the  actual
                                          time  execution  time  of the stressor across all the processors.  Generally this will decrease as one adds more concurrent stressors due to contention on cache,
                                          memory, execution units, buses and I/O devices.
              CPU used per instance (%)   total percentage of CPU used divided by number of stressor instances. 100% is 1 full CPU. Some stressors run multiple threads so it is possible to have a  figure
                                          greater than 100%.
              RSS Max (KB)                resident set size (RSS), the portion of memory (measured in Kilobytes) occupied by a process in main memory.

       --metrics-brief
              show shorter list of stressor metrics (no CPU used per instance).

       --minimize
              overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the minimum settings allowed.  These defaults can always be overridden by the per stressor settings options if required.

       --no-madvise
              from version 0.02.26 stress-ng automatically calls madvise(2) with random advise options before each mmap and munmap to stress the vm subsystem a little harder. The --no-advise option turns
              this default off.

       --no-oom-adjust
              disable  any  form of out-of-memory score adjustments, keep the system defaults.  Normally stress-ng will adjust the out-of-memory scores on stressors to try to create more memory pressure.
              This option disables the adjustments.

       --no-rand-seed
              Do not seed the stress-ng pseudo-random number generator with a quasi random start seed, but instead seed it with constant values. This forces tests to run each time using  the  same  start
              conditions which can be useful when one requires reproducible stress tests.

       --oom-avoid
              Attempt to avoid out-of-memory conditions that can lead to the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer terminating stressors. This checks for low memory scenarios and swapping before making memory allo‐
              cations and hence adds some overhead to the stressors and will slow down stressor allocation speeds.

       --oom-avoid-bytes N
              Specify  a low memory threshold to avoid making any further memory allocations.  The parameter can be specified as an absolute number of bytes (e.g. 2M for 2 MB) or a percentage of the cur‐
              rent free memory, e.g. 5% (the default is 2.5%).  This option implicitly enables --oom-avoid.  The option allows the system to have enough free memory to  try  to  avoid  the  out-of-memory
              killer terminating processes.

       --oomable
              Do  not  respawn  a  stressor  if it gets killed by the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer.  The default behaviour is to restart a new instance of a stressor if the kernel OOM killer terminates the
              process. This option disables this default behaviour.

       --page-in
              touch allocated pages that are not in core, forcing them to be paged back in.  This is a useful option to force all the allocated pages to be paged in when using the bigheap,  mmap  and  vm
              stressors.  It will severely degrade performance when the memory in the system is less than the allocated buffer sizes.  This uses mincore(2) to determine the pages that are not in core and
              hence need touching to page them back in.

       --pathological
              enable  stressors  that  are  known to hang systems. Some stressors can rapidly consume resources that may hang a system, or perform actions that can lock a system up or cause it to reboot.
              These stressors are not enabled by default, this option enables them, but you probably don't want to do this.  You have been  warned.  This  option  applies  to  the  stressors:  bad-ioctl,
              bind-mount, cpu-online, mlockmany, oom-pipe, smi, sysinval and watchdog.

       --pause T
              pause T seconds between each stressor. This is useful for allowing systems to cool down between each stressor invocation. By default this option is disabled.

       --perf measure  processor  and  system activity using perf events. Linux only and caveat emptor, according to perf_event_open(2): "Always double-check your results! Various generalized events have
              had wrong values".  Note that with Linux 4.7 one needs to have CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities for this option to work, or adjust  /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid to below  2  to  use  this
              without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

       --permute N
              run  all  permutations  of the selected stressors with N instances of the permutated stressors per run.  If N is less than zero, then the number of CPUs online is used for the number of in‐
              stances. If N is zero, then the number of configured CPUs in the system is used.  This will perform multiple runs with all the permutations of the stressors up to  2↑20  permumtations.  Use
              this in conjunction with the --with or --class option to specify the stressors to permute.

       --progress
              display the run progress when running stressors with the --sequential option.

       -q, --quiet
              do not show any output.

       -r N, --random N
              start N random stress workers. If N is 0, then the number of configured processors is used for N.

       --rapl Report  the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) energy measurements of stressor instances. Currently Linux and x86 only, requires root access rights to read RAPL kernel interfaces. Note that
              the RAPL domains supported may vary between devices.

       --raplstat S
              every S seconds show RAPL energy measurements. Currently Linux and x86 only, requires root access rights to read RAPL kernel interfaces.

       --sched scheduler
              select the named scheduler (only on Linux). To see the list of available schedulers use: stress-ng --sched which

       --sched-prio prio
              select the scheduler priority level (only on Linux). If the scheduler does not support this then the default priority level of 0 is chosen.

       --sched-period period
              select the period parameter for deadline scheduler (only on Linux). Default value is 0 (in nanoseconds).

       --sched-runtime runtime
              select the runtime parameter for deadline scheduler (only on Linux). Default value is 99999 (in nanoseconds).

       --sched-deadline deadline
              select the deadline parameter for deadline scheduler (only on Linux). Default value is 100000 (in nanoseconds).

       --sched-reclaim
              use cpu bandwidth reclaim feature for deadline scheduler (only on Linux).

       --seed N
              set the random number generate seed with a 64 bit value. Allows stressors to use the same random number generator sequences on each invocation.

       --settings
              show the various option settings.

       --sequential N
              sequentially run all the stressors one by one for a default of 60 seconds. The number of instances of each of the individual stressors to be started is N.  If N is less than zero, then  the
              number of CPUs online is used for the number of instances.  If N is zero, then the number of CPUs in the system is used.  Use the --timeout option to specify the duration to run each stres‐
              sor.

       --skip-silent
              silence  messages  that  report that a stressor has been skipped because it requires features not supported by the system, such as unimplemented system calls, missing resources or processor
              specific features.

       --smart
              scan the block devices for changes S.M.A.R.T. statistics (Linux only). This requires root privileges to read the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology data from all  block  de‐
              vies  and  will  report any changes in the statistics. One caveat is that device manufacturers provide different sets of data, the exact meaning of the data can be vague and the data may be
              inaccurate.

       --sn   use scientific notation (e.g. 2.412e+01) for metrics.

       --status N
              report every N seconds the number of running, exiting, reaped and failed stressors, number of stressors that received SIGARLM termination signal as well as the current run duration.

       --stderr
              write messages to stderr. With version 0.15.08 output is written to stdout, previously due to a historical oversight output went  to  stderr.  This  option  allows  one  to  revert  to  the
              pre-0.15.08 behaviour.

       --stdout
              all output goes to stdout. This is the new default for version 0.15.08. Use the --stderr option for the original behaviour.

       --stressor-time
              (requires  -v flag) log as debug the start and finish run times of each stressor instance, logged in the format: stressor [start|finish] HR:MN:SS.HS YYYY:MM:DD where HR is hours, MN is min‐
              utes, SS is seconds, HS is hundredths of seconds, YYYY is years, MM is months, DD is day of the month. If localtime(2) is not supported the time is logged as seconds past the Epoch.

       --stressors
              output the names of the available stressors.

       --sync-start
              synchromize start, wait for stressors to be created and start all stressors once they are all in a ready to run state.

       --syslog
              log output (except for verbose -v messages) to the syslog.

       --taskset list
              set CPU affinity based on the list of CPUs provided; stress-ng is bound to just use these CPUs (for systems that provide sched_setaffinity(2)). The CPUs to be used are specified by a  comma
              separated list of CPU (0 to N-1). One can specify a range of CPUs using `-', for example: --taskset 0,2-3,6,7-11 or the following keywords:

              Keyword   Description
              even      even numbered CPUs
              odd       odd numbered CPUs
              all       all CPUs
              random    random selection of CPUs
              packageN  CPUs in package N as specified by /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/package_cpus_list
              clusterN  CPUs in package N as specified by /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/cluster_cpus_list
              dieN      CPUs in package N as specified by /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/die_cpus_list
              coreN     CPUs in package N as specified by /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/topology/core_cpus_list

       --taskset-random
              randomly change stressor CPU affinity at five times the clock tick rate (if defined) or at 400Hz while waiting for stressors to complete.

       --temp-path path
              specify  a  path  for  stress-ng  temporary  directories and temporary files; the default path is the current working directory.  This path must have read and write access for the stress-ng
              stress processes.

       --thermalstat S
              every S seconds show CPU and thermal load statistics. This option shows average CPU frequency in GHz (average of online-CPUs), the minimum CPU frequency, the maximum CPU frequency, load av‐
              erages (1 minute, 5 minute and 15 minutes) and available thermal zone temperatures in degrees Centigrade.

       --thrash
              This can only be used when running on Linux and with root privilege. This option starts a background thrasher process that works through all the processes on a system and tries  to  page-in
              as  many  pages  in the processes as possible. It also periodically drops the page cache, frees reclaimable slab objects and pagecache as well as assign pages to different NUMA nodes.  This
              will cause considerable amount of thrashing of swap on an over-committed system.

       -t N, --timeout T
              run each stress test for at least T seconds. One can also specify the units of time in seconds, minutes, hours, days or years with the suffix s, m, h, d or y. Each stressor will be  sent  a
              SIGALRM  signal at the timeout time, however if the stress test is swapped out, in an uninterruptible system call or performing clean up (such as removing hundreds of test file) it may take
              a while to finally terminate.  A 0 timeout will run stress-ng for ever with no timeout. The default timeout is 24 hours.

       --times
              show the cumulative user and system times of all the child processes at the end of the stress run.  The percentage of utilisation of available CPU time is also calculated from the number of
              on-line CPUs in the system.

       --timestamp
              add a timestamp in hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of a second to the log output.

       --timer-slack N
              adjust the per process timer slack to N nanoseconds (Linux only). Increasing the timer slack allows the kernel to coalesce timer events by adding some fuzziness to  timer  expiration  times
              and hence reduce wakeups.  Conversely, decreasing the timer slack will increase wakeups.  A value of 0 for the timer-slack will set the system default of 50000 nanoseconds.

       --tz   collect temperatures from the available thermal zones on the machine (Linux only).  Some devices may have one or more thermal zones, where as others may have none.

       -v, --verbose
              show all debug, warnings and normal information output.

       --verify
              verify  results  when  a  test is run. This is not available on all tests. This will sanity check the computations or memory contents from a test run and report with the `fail' tag failures
              that are detected.

       --verifiable
              print the names of stressors that can be verified with the --verify option.

       -V, --version
              show version of stress-ng, version of toolchain used to build stress-ng and system information.

       --vmstat S
              every S seconds show statistics about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, interrupts, context switches, disks and cpu activity.  The output is similar that to  the  output  from  the  vm‐
              stat(8) utility. Not fully supported on various UNIX systems.

       --vmstat-units [ k | m | g | t | p | e ]
              specify vmstat memory units in terms of kilobytes (k), megabytes (m), gigabytes (g), terabytes (t), petabytes (p) or exabytes (e). Default is in kilobytes.

       -w, --with list
              specify  stressors  to  run  when  using the --all, --seq or --permute options.  For example to run 5 instances of the cpu, hash, nop and vm stressors one after another (sequentially) for 1
              minute per stressor use:

                 stress-ng --seq 5 --with cpu,hash,nop,vm --timeout 1m

       -x, --exclude list
              specify a list of one or more stressors to exclude (that is, do not run them).  This is useful to exclude specific stressors when one selects many stressors to run using the --class option,
              --sequential, --all and --random options. Example, run the cpu class stressors concurrently and exclude the numa and search stressors:

                 stress-ng --class cpu --all 1 -x numa,bsearch,hsearch,lsearch

       -Y, --yaml filename
              output gathered statistics to a YAML formatted file named `filename'.

       Stressor specific options:

       Access stressor
            --access N
                   start N workers that work through various settings of file mode bits (read, write, execute) for the file owner and checks if the user permissions of the file using access(2)  and  fac‐
                   cessat(2) are sane.

            --access-ops N
                   stop access workers after N bogo access sanity checks.

       POSIX Access Control List Stressor
            --acl N
                   start N workers that exercise permutations of ACL access permission settings on user, group and other tags.

            --acl-rand
                   randomize (by shuffling) the order of the ACL access permissions before exercising ACLs.

            --acl-ops N
                   stop acl workers after N bogo acl settings have been set.

       Affinity stressor
            --affinity N
                   start  N workers that run 16 processes that rapidly change CPU affinity (for systems that provide sched_setaffinity(2)). Rapidly switching CPU affinity can contribute to poor cache be‐
                   haviour and high context switch rate.

            --affinity-delay N
                   delay for N nanoseconds before changing affinity to the next CPU.  The delay will spin on CPU scheduling yield operations for N nanoseconds before the process is moved to another  CPU.
                   The default is 0 nanosconds.

            --affinity-ops N
                   stop affinity workers after N bogo affinity operations.

            --affinity-pin
                   pin all the 16 per stressor processes to a CPU. All 16 processes follow the CPU chosen by the main parent stressor, forcing heavy per CPU loading.

            --affinity-rand
                   switch CPU affinity randomly rather than the default of sequentially.

            --affinity-sleep N
                   sleep for N nanoseconds before changing affinity to the next CPU.

       Kernel crypto AF_ALG API stressor
            --af-alg N
                   start  N  workers  that exercise the AF_ALG socket domain by hashing and encrypting various sized random messages. This exercises the available hashes, ciphers, rng and aead crypto en‐
                   gines in the Linux kernel.

            --af-alg-dump
                   dump the internal list representing cryptographic algorithms parsed from the /proc/crypto file to standard output (stdout).

            --af-alg-ops N
                   stop af-alg workers after N AF_ALG messages are hashed.

       Asynchronous I/O stressor (POSIX AIO)
            --aio N
                   start N workers that issue multiple small asynchronous I/O writes and reads on a relatively small temporary file using the POSIX aio interface.  This will  just  hit  the  file  system
                   cache and soak up a lot of user and kernel time in issuing and handling I/O requests.  By default, each worker process will handle 16 concurrent I/O requests.

            --aio-ops N
                   stop POSIX asynchronous I/O workers after N bogo asynchronous I/O requests.

            --aio-requests N
                   specify the number of POSIX asynchronous I/O requests each worker should issue, the default is 16; 1 to 4096 are allowed.

       Asynchronous I/O stressor (Linux AIO)
            --aiol N
                   start  N workers that issue multiple 4 K random asynchronous I/O writes using the Linux aio system calls io_setup(2), io_submit(2), io_getevents(2) and io_destroy(2).  By default, each
                   worker process will handle 16 concurrent I/O requests.

            --aiol-ops N
                   stop Linux asynchronous I/O workers after N bogo asynchronous I/O requests.

            --aiol-requests N
                   specify the number of Linux asynchronous I/O requests each worker should issue, the default is 16; 1 to 4096 are allowed.

       Alarm stressor
            --alarm N
                   start N workers that exercise alarm(2) with MAXINT, 0 and random alarm and sleep delays that get prematurely interrupted. Before each alarm is scheduled any previous pending alarms are
                   cancelled with zero second alarm calls.

            --alarm-ops N
                   stop after N alarm bogo operations.

       AppArmor stressor
            --apparmor N
                   start N workers that exercise various parts of the AppArmor interface. Currently one needs root permission to run this particular test. Only available on Linux  systems  with  AppArmor
                   support and requires the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability.

            --apparmor-ops
                   stop the AppArmor workers after N bogo operations.

       Atomic stressor
            --atomic N
                   start  N  workers  that  exercise various GCC __atomic_*() built in operations on 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit integers that are shared among the N workers. This stressor is only available for
                   builds using GCC 4.7.4 or higher. The stressor forces many front end cache stalls and cache references. Note that 32 bit systems do not currently exercise 64 bit integers.

            --atomic-ops N
                   stop the atomic workers after N bogo atomic operations.

       Bad alternative stack stressor
            --bad-altstack N
                   start N workers that create broken alternative signal stacks for SIGSEGV and SIGBUS handling that in turn create secondary SIGSEGV/SIGBUS errors.  A variety of randomly selected nefar‐
                   ious methods are used to create the stacks:

                   • Unmapping the alternative signal stack, before triggering the signal handling.
                   • Changing the alternative signal stack to just being read only, write only, execute only.
                   • Using a NULL alternative signal stack.
                   • Using the signal handler object as the alternative signal stack.
                   • Unmapping the alternative signal stack during execution of the signal handler.
                   • Using a read-only text segment for the alternative signal stack.
                   • Using an undersized alternative signal stack.
                   • Using the VDSO as an alternative signal stack.
                   • Using an alternative stack mapped onto /dev/zero.
                   • Using an alternative stack mapped to a zero sized temporary file to generate a SIGBUS error.

            --bad-altstack-ops N
                   stop the bad alternative stack stressors after N SIGSEGV bogo operations.

       Bad ioctl stressor
            --bad-ioctl N
                   start N workers that perform a range of illegal bad read ioctl(2) calls (using _IOR) and write ioctls (using _IOR with PROT_NONE mapped pages) across the device drivers. This exercises
                   page size, 64 bit, 32 bit, 16 bit and 8 bit reads as well as NULL addresses, non-readable pages and PROT_NONE mapped pages. Currently only for Linux and requires the --pathological op‐
                   tion.

            --bad-ioctl-method [ inc | random | random-inc | stride ]
                   select the method of changing the ioctl command (number, type) tuple per iteration, the default is random-inc.  Available bad-ioctl methods are described as follows:

                   Method         Description
                   inc            increment ioctl command by 1
                   random         use a random ioctl command
                   random-inc     increment ioctl command by a random value
                   random-stride  increment ioctl command number by 1 and decrement command type by 3

            --bad-ioctl-ops N
                   stop the bad ioctl stressors after N bogo ioctl operations.

       Bessel functions
            --besselmath N
                   start N workers that exercise various Bessel functions.  Results are sanity checked to ensure no variation occurs after each round of 10000 computations.

            --besselmath-ops N
                   stop after N bessel bogo-operation loops.

            --besselmath-method method
                   specify a Bessel function to exercise. Available bessel stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method  Description
                   all     iterate over all the below Bessel functions methods
                   j0      double precision Bessel function of the first kind of order 0

                   ynl     long double precision Bessel function of the second kind of order n (where n = 5 for this test)

       Big heap stressor
            -B N, --bigheap N
                   start N workers that grow their heaps by reallocating memory. If the out of memory killer (OOM) on Linux kills the worker or the allocation fails then the allocating process starts all
                   over again.  Note that the OOM adjustment for the worker is set so that the OOM killer will treat these workers as the first candidate processes to kill.

            --bigheap-bytes N
                   maximum heap growth as N bytes per bigheap worker. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k,  m  or
                   g.

            --bigheap-growth N
                   specify amount of memory to grow heap by per iteration. Size can be from 4 K to 64 MB. Default is 64 K.

            --bigheap-mlock
                   attempt  to  mlock(2)  future allocated pages into memory causing more memory pressure. If mlock(MCL_FUTURE) is implemented then this will stop newly allocated pages from being swapped
                   out.

            --bigheap-ops N
                   stop the big heap workers after N bogo allocation operations are completed.

       Binderfs stressor
            --binderfs N
                   start N workers that mount, exercise and unmount binderfs. The binder control device is exercised with 256 sequential BINDER_CTL_ADD ioctl(2) calls per loop.

            --binderfs-ops N
                   stop after N binderfs cycles.

       Bind mount stressor
            --bind-mount N
                   start N workers that repeatedly bind mount / to / inside a user namespace. This can consume resources rapidly, forcing out of memory situations. Do not use  this  stressor  unless  you
                   want to risk hanging your machine.

            --bind-mount-ops N
                   stop after N bind mount bogo operations.

       Bitonic sort stressor
            --bitonicsort N
                   start N workers that sort 32 bit integers using bitonic sort.

            --bitonicsort-ops N
                   stop bitonic sort stress workers after N bogo bitonic sorts.

            --bitonicsort-size N
                   specify number of 32 bit integers to sort, default is 262144 (256 × 1024).

       Bit Manipulation Operations
            --bitops N
                   start  N workers that perform various calculations using 32 bit integer manipulation operations. Many of these are derived from the Standford "Bit Twiddling Hacks" (Sean Eron Anderson)
                   and Hacker's Delight (Henry S. Warren, Jr.)

            --bitops-ops N
                   stop after N bitop operations.

            --bitops-method method
                   specify bitops stress method. By default, all the bitops stress methods are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if  required.   Available  bitops
                   stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method     Description
                   all        iterate over all the below bitops stress methods.
                   abs        calculate the absolute value of a 32 bit signed integer. Computed two different ways, one with masking and addition, one with masking and subtraction.
                   countbits  count  the  number  of  bits set to 1 in a 32 bit unsigned integer. Computed six different ways, two with bit counting, one with 64 bit multiplication, one with parallelised
                              masking and shifting, one using triple masking and shifts, one using a builtin popcount function.
                   clz        count the number of leading zero bits in a 32 bit unsigned integer. Computed four different ways, one with bit counting, one with log2 shifting, one using a builtin popcount
                              function, one using a builtin clz function,
                   ctz        count the number of trailing zero bits in a 32 bit unsigned integer. Computed five different ways, one with bit cointing, one using masking and shifting, one using the mask‐
                              ing and ternary operator Gaudet method, one using a builtin clz function, one using a builtin popcount function.

       Branch stressor
            --branch N
                   start N workers that randomly branch to 1024 randomly selected locations and hence exercise the CPU branch prediction logic.

            --branch-ops N
                   stop the branch stressors after N × 1024 branches

       Brk stressor
            --brk N
                   start N workers that grow the data segment by one page at a time using multiple brk(2) calls. Each successfully allocated new page is touched to ensure it is resident in memory.  If an
                   out of memory condition occurs then the test will reset the data segment to the point before it started and repeat the data segment resizing over again.  The process adjusts the out of
                   memory setting so that it may be killed by the out of memory (OOM) killer before other processes.  If it is killed by the OOM killer then it will be automatically re-started by a moni‐
                   toring parent process.

            --brk-bytes N
                   maximum brk growth as N bytes per brk worker. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --brk-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) future brk pages into memory causing more memory pressure. If mlock(MCL_FUTURE) is implemented then this will stop new brk pages from being swapped out.

            --brk-notouch
                   do not touch each newly allocated data segment page. This disables the default of touching each newly allocated page and hence avoids the kernel from necessarily backing the page  with
                   physical memory.

            --brk-ops N
                   stop the brk workers after N bogo brk operations.

       Binary search stressor
            --bsearch N
                   start  N  workers  that binary search a sorted array of 32 bit integers using bsearch(3). By default, there are 65536 elements in the array.  This is a useful method to exercise random
                   access of memory and processor cache.

            --bsearch-method [ bsearch-libc | bsearch-nonlibc | ternary ]
                   select either the libc implementation of bsearch or a slightly optimized non-libc implementation of bsearch or a 3-day ternary search. The default is the libc implementation if it  ex‐
                   ists, otherwise the non-libc version.

            --bsearch-ops N
                   stop the bsearch worker after N bogo bsearch operations are completed.

            --bsearch-size N
                   specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to bsearch. Size can be from 1 K to 4 M.

       bubblesort stressor
            --bubblesort N
                   start N workers that sort 32 bit integers using bubblesort.

            --bubblesort-method [ bubblesort-fast | bubblesort-naive ]
                   select either a standard optimized implementation of bubblesort or a naive unoptimized implementation of bubblesort. The default is the standard optimized version.

            --bubblesort-ops N
                   stop bubblesort stress workers after N bogo bubblesorts.

            --bubblesort-size N
                   specify number of 32 bit integers to sort, default is 16384.

       Cache stressor
            -C N, --cache N
                   start  N workers that perform random wide spread memory read and writes to thrash the CPU cache.  The code does not intelligently determine the CPU cache configuration and so it may be
                   sub-optimal in producing hit-miss read/write activity for some processors.  Note: to exercise cache misses it is recommended to instead use  the  matrix-3d  stressor  using  the  --ma‐
                   trix-3d-zyx option.

            --cache-cldemote
                   cache line demote (x86 only). This is a no-op for non-x86 architectures and older x86 processors that do not support this feature.

            --cache-clflushopt
                   use optimized cache line flush (x86 only). This is a no-op for non-x86 architectures and older x86 processors that do not support this feature.

            --cache-clwb
                   cache line writeback (x86 only). This is a no-op for non-x86 architectures and older x86 processors that do not support this feature.

            --cache-enable-all
                   where appropriate exercise the cache using cldemote, clflushopt, fence, flush, sfence and prefetch.

            --cache-fence
                   force write serialization on each store operation (x86 only). This is a no-op for non-x86 architectures.

            --cache-flush
                   force flush cache on each store operation (x86 only). This is a no-op for non-x86 architectures.

            --cache-level N
                   specify level of cache to exercise (1 = L1 cache, 2 = L2 cache, 3 = L3/LLC cache (the default)).  If the cache hierarchy cannot be determined, built-in defaults will apply.

            --cache-no-affinity
                   do not change processor affinity when --cache is in effect.

            --cache-ops N
                   stop cache thrash workers after N bogo cache thrash operations.

            --cache-permute
                   permute the selected cache flags when exercising cache for an improved mix of cache operations. Recommend also using --cache-enable-all with this option.

            --cache-prefetch
                   force read prefetch on read address on architectures that support prefetching.

            --cache-prefetchw
                   force a redundant write prefetch on architectures that support write prefetching.

            --cache-sfence
                   force write serialization on each store operation using the sfence instruction (x86 only). This is a no-op for non-x86 architectures.

            --cache-size N
                   override the default cache size setting to N bytes. One can specify the in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --cache-ways N
                   specify the number of cache ways to exercise. This allows a subset of the overall cache size to be exercised.

       Cache hammering stessor
            --cachehammer N
                   start N workers that exercise the cache with a randomized mix of memory read/writes and where possible cache prefetches and cache flushes to random addresses in three memory mapped re‐
                   gions,  one  of  which  is shared among all the cache stressors and is the size of the L3 cache, one is local to each instance and is 4 times the L3 cache size and one is a single page
                   mapping that cannot be read or written.

            --cachehammer-numa
                   periodically assign exercised pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --cachehammer-ops N
                   stop after N cache hammer operations.

       Cache line stressor
            --cacheline N
                   start N workers that exercise reading and writing individual bytes in a shared buffer that is the size of a cache line. Each stressor will run 1 or more  processes  to  exercise  bytes
                   that  are next to each other. The number of per stressor processes run will be scaled so that at least all N bytes of a N byte cache line are exercised.  The intent is to try and trig‐
                   ger cacheline corruption, stalls and misses with shared memory accesses.

            --cacheline-affinity
                   frequently change CPU affinity, spread cacheline processes evenly across all online CPUs to try and maximize lower-level cache activity. Attempts to keep adjacent cachelines being  ex‐
                   ercised by adjacent CPUs.

            --cacheline-method method
                   specify  a  cacheline stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if required.  Available cacheline
                   stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method     Description
                   all        iterate over all the below cpu stress methods.

                   copy       copy an adjacent byte to a specific byte in a cacheline.
                   inc        increment and read back a specific byte in a cacheline and check for corruption every 7 increments.

                   rdfwd64    increment a specific byte in a cacheline and then read in forward direction an entire cacheline using 64 bit reads.
                   rdints     increment a specific byte in a cacheline and then read data at that byte location in naturally aligned locations integer values of size 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 bits.
                   rdrev64    increment a specific byte in a cacheline and then read in reverse direction an entire cacheline using 64 bit reads.
                   rdwr       read and write the same 8 bit value into a specific byte in a cacheline and check for corruption.

            --cacheline-ops N
                   stop cacheline workers after N loops of the byte exercising in a cacheline.

       Process capabilities stressor
            --cap N
                   start N workers that read per process capabilities via calls to capget(2) (Linux only).

            --cap-ops N
                   stop after N cap bogo operations.

       Cgroup stressor
            --cgroup N
                   start N workers that mount a cgroup, move a child to the cgroup, read, write and remove the child from the cgroup and umount the cgroup per bogo-op iteration.  This uses cgroup v2  and
                   is only available for Linux systems.

            --cgroup-ops N
                   stop after N cgroup bogo operations.

       Chattr stressor
            --chattr N
                   start  N workers that attempt to exercise file attributes via the EXT2_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctl(2). This is intended to be intentionally racy and exercise a range of chattr attributes by en‐
                   abling and disabling them on a file shared amongst the N chattr stressor processes. (Linux only).

            --chattr-ops N
                   stop after N chattr bogo operations.

       Chdir stressor
            --chdir N
                   start N workers that change directory between directories using chdir(2).

            --chdir-dirs N
                   exercise chdir on N directories. The default is 8192 directories, this allows 64 to 65536 directories to be used instead.

            --chdir-ops N
                   stop after N chdir bogo operations.

            --chmod N
                   start N workers that change the file mode bits via chmod(2) and fchmod(2) on the same file. The greater the value for N then the more contention on the single file.  The stressor  will
                   work through all the combination of mode bits.

            --chmod-ops N
                   stop after N chmod bogo operations.

            --chown-ops N
                   stop the chown workers after N bogo chown(2) operations.

       Chroot stressor
            --chroot N
                   start N workers that exercise chroot(2) on various valid and invalid chroot paths. Only available on Linux systems and requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

            --chroot-ops N
                   stop the chroot workers after N bogo chroot(2) operations.

       Complex hyperbolic functions stressor
            --chyperbolic N
                   start  N  workers that exercise complex sinh, cosh, and tanh libm complex hyperbolic functions using complex float, complex double and complex long double floating point variants. Each
                   function is exercised 10000 times per bogo-operation.

            --chyperbolic-method function
                   specify a complex hyperbolic stress function. By default, all the functions are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one function to be used if required.  Available op‐
                   tions are as follows:

                   Method   Description
                   all      iterate through all of the following complex hyperbolic functions
                   ccosh    complex hyperbolic cosine (complex double precision)

                   csinhf   complex hyperbolic sine (complex float precision)
                   csinhl   complex hyperbolic sine (complex long double precision)
                   ctanh    complex hyperbolic tangent (complex double precision)
                   ctanhf   complex hyperbolic tangent (complex float precision)
                   ctanhl   complex hyperbolic tangent (complex long double precision)

            --chyperbolic-ops N
                   stop after N bogo-operations.

       Clock stressor
            --clock N
                   start N workers exercising clocks and POSIX timers. For all known clock types this will exercise clock_getres(2), clock_gettime(2) and clock_nanosleep(2).  For all known timers it will
                   create a random duration timer and busy poll this until it expires. This stressor will cause frequent context switching.

            --clock-ops N
                   stop clock stress workers after N bogo operations.

       Clone stressor
            --clone N
                   start N workers that create clones (via the clone(2) and clone3(2) system calls).  This will rapidly try to create a default of 8192 clones that immediately die and wait  in  a  zombie
                   state  until  they  are  reaped.   Once the maximum number of clones is reached (or clone fails because one has reached the maximum allowed) the oldest clone thread is reaped and a new
                   clone is then created in a first-in first-out manner, and then repeated.  A random clone flag is selected for each clone to try to  exercise  different  clone  operations.   The  clone
                   stressor is a Linux only option.

            --clone-max N
                   try to create as many as N clone threads. This may not be reached if the system limit is less than N.

            --clone-ops N
                   stop clone stress workers after N bogo clone operations.

       Close stressor
            --close N
                   start  N  workers  that  try  to force race conditions on closing opened file descriptors.  These file descriptors have been opened in various ways to try and exercise different kernel
                   close handlers.

            --close-ops N
                   stop close workers after N bogo close operations.

       Swapcontext stressor
            --context N
                   start N workers that run three threads that use swapcontext(3) to implement the thread-to-thread context switching. This exercises rapid process context saving  and  restoring  and  is
                   bandwidth limited by register and memory save and restore rates.

            --context-ops N
                   stop context workers after N bogo context switches.  In this stressor, 1 bogo op is equivalent to 1000 swapcontext calls.

       Copy file stressor
            --copy-file N
                   start  N stressors that copy a file using the Linux copy_file_range(2) system call. 128 KB chunks of data are copied from random locations from one file to random locations to a desti‐
                   nation file.  By default, the files are 256 MB in size. Data is sync'd to the filesystem after each copy_file_range(2) call.

            --copy-file-bytes N
                   copy file size, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --copy-file-ops N
                   stop after N copy_file_range() calls.

       CPU stressor
            -c N, --cpu N
                   start N workers exercising the CPU by sequentially working through all the different CPU stress methods. Instead of exercising all the CPU stress methods, one can  specify  a  specific
                   CPU stress method with the --cpu-method option.

            -l P, --cpu-load P
                   load  CPU with P percent loading for the CPU stress workers. 0 is effectively a sleep (no load) and 100 is full loading.  The loading loop is broken into compute time (load%) and sleep
                   time (100% - load%). Accuracy depends on the overall load of the processor and the responsiveness of the scheduler, so the actual load may be different from  the  desired  load.   Note
                   that the number of bogo CPU operations may not be linearly scaled with the load as some systems employ CPU frequency scaling and so heavier loads produce an increased CPU frequency and
                   greater CPU bogo operations.

                   Note: This option only applies to the --cpu stressor option and not to all of the cpu class of stressors.

            --cpu-load-slice S
                   note:  this  option  is only useful when --cpu-load is less than 100%. The CPU load is broken into multiple busy and idle cycles. Use this option to specify the duration of a busy time
                   slice.  A negative value for S specifies the number of iterations to run before idling the CPU (e.g. -30 invokes 30 iterations of a CPU stress loop).  A zero  value  selects  a  random
                   busy  time between 0 and 0.5 seconds.  A positive value for S specifies the number of milliseconds to run before idling the CPU (e.g. 100 keeps the CPU busy for 0.1 seconds).  Specify‐
                   ing small values for S lends to small time slices and smoother scheduling.  Setting --cpu-load as a relatively low value and --cpu-load-slice to be large will  cycle  the  CPU  between
                   long idle and busy cycles and exercise different CPU frequencies.  The thermal range of the CPU is also cycled, so this is a good mechanism to exercise the scheduler, frequency scaling
                   and passive/active thermal cooling mechanisms.

                   Note: This option only applies to the --cpu stressor option and not to all of the cpu class of stressors.

            --cpu-method method
                   specify  a cpu stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if required.  Available cpu stress meth‐
                   ods are described as follows:

                   Note  that  some of these methods try to exercise the CPU with computations found in some real world use cases. However, the code has not been optimised on a per-architecture basis, so
                   may be a sub-optimal compared to hand-optimised code used in some applications.  They do try to represent the typical instruction mixes found in these use cases.

            --cpu-old-metrics
                   as of version V0.14.02 the cpu stressor now normalizes each of the cpu stressor method bogo-op counters to try and ensure a similar bogo-op rate  for  all  the  methods  to  avoid  the
                   shorter  running  (and faster) methods from skewing the bogo-op rates when using the default "all" method.  This is based on a reference Intel i5-8350U processor and hence the bogo-ops
                   normalizing factors will be skew somewhat on different CPUs, but so significantly as the original bogo-op counter rates. To disable the normalization and fall back to the original met‐
                   rics, use this option.

            --cpu-ops N
                   stop cpu stress workers after N bogo operations.

       CPU onlining stressor
            --cpu-online N
                   start N workers that put randomly selected CPUs offline and online. This Linux only stressor requires root privilege to perform this action. By default the first CPU (CPU 0)  is  never
                   offlined as this has been found to be problematic on some systems and can result in a shutdown.

            --cpu-online-affinity
                   move the stressor worker to the CPU that will be next offlined.

            --cpu-online-all
                   The default is to never offline the first CPU.  This option will offline and online all the CPUs including CPU 0. This may cause some systems to shutdown.

            --cpu-online-ops N
                   stop after offline/online operations.

       CPU affinity scheduler stressor
            --cpu-sched N
                   start  N  workers  that exercise the scheduler by moving processes to different CPUs. Each worker starts 16 child processes and repeatedly moves the processes to different CPUs and at‐
                   tempts changes their scheduler policy using SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_BATCH, SCHED_IDLE, SCHED_EXT, SCHED_DEADLINE, SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO policies. The choice of CPU placement is based on 8
                   different mechanisms and is changed every second to mix process placements on all the available CPUS. The child processes are run with randomizied nice settings to  exercise  scheduler
                   prioritization.

            --cpu-sched-ops N
                   stop after N child process move attempts.

       Crypt stressor
            --crypt N
                   start N workers that encrypt a 16 character random password using crypt(3).  The password is encrypted using bcrypt bsdicrypt descrypt gost-yescrypt MD5 NT scrypt SHA-1 SHA-256 SHA-512
                   SunMD5 and yescrypt encryption methods.

            --crypt-method method
                   select  the  encryption  method, may be one of: bcrypt, bsdicrypt, descrypt, gost-yescrypt, MD5, NT, scrypt, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, SunMD5 and yescrypt.  The `all' method selects all
                   the methods and is the default.

            --crypt-ops N
                   stop after N bogo encryption operations.

       Complex trigonometric functions stressor
            --ctrig N
                   start N workers that exercise complex sin, complex cos and complex tan libm trigonometric functions using complex float, complex double and complex long double floating point variants.
                   Each function is exercised 10000 times per bogo-operation.

            --ctrig-method function
                   specify a trigonometric stress function. By default, all the functions are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one function to be used if required.  Available  options
                   are as follows:

                   Method  Description
                   all     iterate through all of the following complex trigonometric functions
                   ccos    complex cosine (complex double precision)

                   ctanf   complex tangent (complex float precision)
                   ctanl   complex tangent (complex long double precision)

       Cyclic stressor
            --cyclic N
                   start  N workers that exercise the real time FIFO or Round Robin schedulers with cyclic nanosecond sleeps. Normally one would just use 1 worker instance with this stressor to get reli‐
                   able statistics. By default this stressor measures the first 10 thousand latencies and calculates the mean, mode, minimum, maximum latencies along with various latency percentiles  for
                   the  just  the  first cyclic stressor instance. One has to run this stressor with CAP_SYS_NICE capability to enable the real time scheduling policies. The FIFO scheduling policy is the
                   default.

            --cyclic-dist N
                   calculate and print a latency distribution with the interval of N nanoseconds.  This is helpful to see where the latencies are clustering.

            --cyclic-method [ clock_ns | itimer | poll | posix_ns | pselect | usleep ]
                   specify the cyclic method to be used, the default is clock_ns. The available cyclic methods are as follows:

                   Method    Description
                   clock_ns  sleep for the specified time using the clock_nanosleep(2) high resolution nanosleep and the CLOCK_REALTIME real time clock.
                   itimer    wakeup a paused process with a CLOCK_REALTIME itimer signal.
                   poll      delay for the specified time using a poll delay loop that checks for time changes using clock_gettime(2) on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.
                   posix_ns  sleep for the specified time using the POSIX nanosleep(2) high resolution nanosleep.
                   pselect   sleep for the specified time using pselect(2) with null file descriptors.
                   usleep    sleep to the nearest microsecond using usleep(2).

            --cyclic-ops N
                   stop after N sleeps.

            --cyclic-policy [ deadline | fifo | rr ]
                   specify the desired real time scheduling policy, deadline, fifo (first-in, first-out) or rr (round-robin).

            --cyclic-prio P
                   specify the scheduling priority P. Range from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest).

            --cyclic-samples N
                   measure N samples. Range from 1 to 100000000 samples.

            --cyclic-sleep N
                   sleep for N nanoseconds per test cycle using clock_nanosleep(2) with the CLOCK_REALTIME timer. Range from 1 to 1000000000 nanoseconds.

       Daemon stressor
            --daemon N
                   start N workers that each create a daemon that dies immediately after creating another daemon and so on. This effectively works through the process table  with  short  lived  processes
                   that  do  not have a parent and are waited for by init.  This puts pressure on init to do rapid child reaping.  The daemon processes perform the usual mix of calls to turn into typical
                   UNIX daemons, so this artificially mimics very heavy daemon system stress.

            --daemon-ops N
                   stop daemon workers after N daemons have been created.

            --daemon-wait
                   wait for daemon child processes rather than let init handle the waiting. Enabling this option will reduce the daemon fork rate because of the synchronous wait delays.

       Datagram congestion control protocol (DCCP) stressor
            --dccp N
                   start N workers that send and receive data using the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) (RFC4340). This involves a pair of client/server processes  performing  rapid  connect,
                   send and receives and disconnects on the local host.

            --dccp-domain D
                   specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4 and ipv6 are supported.

            --dccp-if NAME
                   use network interface NAME. If the interface NAME does not exist, is not up or does not support the domain then the loopback (lo) interface is used as the default.

            --dccp-msgs N
                   send N messages per connect, send/receive, disconnect iteration. The default is 10000 messages. If N is too small then the rate is throttled back by the overhead of dccp socket connect
                   and disconnects.

            --dccp-port P
                   start DCCP at port P. For N dccp worker processes, ports P to P − 1 are used.

            --dccp-ops N
                   stop dccp stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --dccp-opts [ send | sendmsg | sendmmsg ]
                   by  default,  messages  are sent using send(2). This option allows one to specify the sending method using send(2), sendmsg(2) or sendmmsg(2).  Note that sendmmsg is only available for
                   Linux systems that support this system call.

       Mutex using Dekker algorithm stressor
            --dekker N
                   start N workers that exercises mutex exclusion between two processes using shared memory with the Dekker Algorithm. Where possible this uses memory fencing and falls back to using  GCC
                   __sync_synchronize if they are not available. The stressors contain simple mutex and memory coherency sanity checks.

            --dekker-ops N
                   stop dekker workers after N mutex operations.

       Dentry stressor
            -D N, --dentry N
                   start  N  workers  that create and remove directory entries.  This should create file system meta data activity. The directory entry names are suffixed by a gray-code encoded number to
                   try to mix up the hashing of the namespace.

            --dentry-ops N
                   stop denty thrash workers after N bogo dentry operations.

            --dentry-order [ forward | reverse | stride | random ]
                   specify unlink order of dentries, can be one of forward, reverse, stride or random.  By default, dentries are unlinked in random order.  The forward order will unlink them  from  first
                   to  last,  reverse order will unlink them from last to first, stride order will unlink them by stepping around order in a quasi-random pattern and random order will randomly select one
                   of forward, reverse or stride orders.

            --dentries N
                   create N dentries per dentry thrashing loop, default is 2048.

       /dev stressor
            --dev N
                   start N workers that exercise the /dev devices. Each worker runs 5 concurrent threads that perform open(2), fstat(2), lseek(2), poll(2),  fcntl(2),  mmap(2),  munmap(2),  fsync(2)  and
                   close(2) on each device.  Note that watchdog devices are not exercised.

            --dev-file filename
                   specify  the  device  file  to exercise, for example, /dev/null. By default the stressor will work through all the device files it can fine, however, this option allows a single device
                   file to be exercised.

            --dev-ops N
                   stop dev workers after N bogo device exercising operations.

       /dev/shm stressor
            --dev-shm N
                   start N workers that fallocate large files in /dev/shm and then mmap these into memory and touch all the pages. This exercises pages being moved to/from the buffer cache. Linux only.

            --dev-shm-ops N
                   stop after N bogo allocation and mmap /dev/shm operations.

       Decimal floating point operations stressor
            --dfp N
                   start N workers that exercise addition, multiplication and division operations on a range of decimal floating point types. For each type, 8 floating  point  values  are  operated  upon
                   65536 times in a loop per bogo op.

            --dfp-method method
                   select the decimal floating point method to use, available methods are:

                   Method    Description
                   all       iterate over all the following floating point methods:
                   df32add   32 bit decimal floating point add (_Decimal32)
                   df64add   64 bit decimal floating point add (_Decimal64)
                   df128add  128 bit decimal floating point add (_Decimal128)
                   df32mul   32 bit decimal floating point multiply (_Decimal32)
                   df64mul   64 bit decimal floating point multiply (_Decimal64)
                   df128mul  128 bit decimal floating point multiply (_Decimal128)
                   df32div   32 bit decimal floating point divide (_Decimal32)
                   df64div   64 bit decimal floating point divide (_Decimal64)
                   df128div  128 bit decimal floating point divide (_Decimal128)

                   Note that some of these decimal floating point methods may not be available on some systems.

            --dfp-ops N
                   stop after N decimal floating point bogo ops.

       Directories stressor
            --dir N
                   start N workers that create, rename and remove directories using mkdir(2), rename(2) and rmdir(2).

            --dir-dirs N
                   exercise dir on N directories. The default is 8192 directories, this allows 64 to 65536 directories to be used instead.

            --dir-ops N
                   stop directory thrash workers after N bogo directory operations.

       Deep directories stressor
            --dirdeep N
                   start  N  workers that create a depth-first tree of directories to a maximum depth as limited by PATH_MAX or ENAMETOOLONG (which ever occurs first).  By default, each level of the tree
                   contains one directory, but this can be increased to a maximum of 10 sub-trees using the --dirdeep-dir option.  To stress inode creation, a symlink and a hardlink to a file at the root
                   of the tree is created in each level.

            --dirdeep-bytes N
                   allocated file size, the default is 0. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b,  k,  m  or  g.
                   Used in conjunction with the --dirdeep-files option.

            --dirdeep-dirs N
                   create N directories at each tree level. The default is just 1 but can be increased to a maximum of 36 per level.

            --dirdeep-files N
                   create N files  at each tree level. The default is 0 with the file size specified by the --dirdeep-bytes option.

            --dirdeep-inodes N
                   consume  up  to  N  inodes  per dirdeep stressor while creating directories and links. The value N can be the number of inodes or a percentage of the total available free inodes on the
                   filesystem being used.

            --dirdeep-ops N
                   stop directory depth workers after N bogo directory operations.

       Maximum files creation in a directory stressor
            --dirmany N
                   start N stressors that create as many files in a directory as possible and then remove them. The file creation phase stops when an error occurs (for example, out of  inodes,  too  many
                   files,  quota  reached, etc.) and then the files are removed. This cycles until the run time is reached or the file creation count bogo-ops metric is reached. This is a much faster and
                   light weight directory exercising stressor compared to the dentry stressor.

            --dirmany-bytes N
                   allocated file size, the default is 0. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --dirmany-ops N
                   stop dirmany stressors after N empty files have been created.

       Dnotify stressor
            --dnotify N
                   start N workers performing file system activities such as making/deleting files/directories, renaming files, etc. to stress exercise the various dnotify events (Linux only).

            --dnotify-ops N
                   stop dnotify stress workers after N dnotify bogo operations.

       Dup stressor
            --dup N
                   start N workers that perform dup(2) and then close(2) operations on /dev/zero.  The maximum opens at one time is system defined, so the test will run up to this maximum, or 65536  open
                   file descriptors, which ever comes first.

            --dup-ops N
                   stop the dup stress workers after N bogo open operations.

       Dynamic libraries loading stressor
            --dynlib N
                   start  N workers that dynamically load and unload various shared libraries. This exercises memory mapping and dynamic code loading and symbol lookups. See dlopen(3) for more details of
                   this mechanism.

            --dynlib-ops N
                   stop workers after N bogo load/unload cycles.

       Easy CPU opcode stressor
            --easy-opcode N
                   start N workers that exercise 64 continuous pages of radomly selected simple CPU opcodes.  For example, for x86 processors this just exercises single byte opcodes such as nop  and  op-
                   codes that set/clear CPU flags to put pressure on the front-end decoder and instruction cache. For RISC processors opcodes such as nop and simple register moves to/from the same regis‐
                   ters are used. Smart emulators may remove some of these opcodes (e.g move r0,r0) and hence opcode rates may be artificially high.

            --easy-opcode-ops N
                   stop after N executions of 64 continuous pages of opcodes.

       Eigen C++ matrix library stressor
            --eigen N
                   start N workers that exercise the Eigen C++ matrix library for 2D matrix addition, multiplication, determinant, inverse and transpose operations on long double, double and float matri‐
                   ces. This currently is only available for gcc/g++ builds.

            --eigen-method method
                   select the floating point method to use, available methods are:

                   Method                   Description
                   all                      iterate over all the Eigen 2D matrix operations
                   add-longdouble           addition of two matrices of long double floating point values
                   add-double               addition of two matrices of double floating point values
                   add-float                addition of two matrices of floating point values
                   determinant-longdouble   determinant of matrix of long double floating point values
                   determinant-double       determinant of matrix of double floating point values
                   determinant-float        determinant of matrix of floating point values
                   inverse-longdouble       inverse of matrix of long double floating point values
                   inverse-double           inverse of matrix of double floating point values
                   inverse-float            inverse of matrix of floating point values
                   multiply-longdouble      multiplication of two matrices of long double floating point values
                   multiply-doublee         multiplication of two matrices of double floating point values
                   multiply-float           multiplication of two matrices of floating point values
                   transpose-longdouble     transpose of matrix of long double floating point values
                   transpose-double         transpose of matrix of double floating point values
                   transpose-float          transpose of matrix of floating point values

            --eigen-ops N
                   stop after N Eigen matrix computations

            --eigen-size N
                   specify the 2D matrix size N × N. The default is a 32 × 32 matrix.

       EFI variables stressor
            --efivar N
                   start  N  workers  that  exercise the Linux /sys/firmware/efi/efivars and /sys/firmware/efi/vars interfaces by reading the EFI variables. This is a Linux only stress test for platforms
                   that support the EFI vars interface and may require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

            --efivar-ops N
                   stop the efivar stressors after N EFI variable read operations.

       Non-functional system call (ENOSYS) stressor
            --enosys N
                   start N workers that exercise non-functional system call numbers. This calls a wide range of system call numbers to see if it can break a system where these are not wired up correctly.
                   It also keeps track of system calls that exist (ones that don't return ENOSYS) so that it can focus on purely finding and exercising non-functional system calls.  This  stressor  exer‐
                   cises  system calls from 0 to __NR_syscalls + 1024, random system calls within constrained in the ranges of 0 to 2↑8, 2↑16, 2↑24, 2↑32, 2↑40, 2↑48, 2↑56 and 2↑64 bits, high system call
                   numbers and various other bit patterns to try to get wide coverage. To keep the environment clean, each system call being tested runs in a child process with reduced capabilities.

            --enosys-ops N
                   stop after N bogo enosys system call attempts

       Environment variables stressor
            --env N
                   start N workers that creates numerous large environment variables to try to trigger out of memory conditions using setenv(3).  If ENOMEM occurs then the environment is emptied and  an‐
                   other memory filling retry occurs.  The process is restarted if it is killed by the Out Of Memory (OOM) killer.

            --env-ops N
                   stop after N bogo setenv/unsetenv attempts.

       Epoll stressor
            --epoll N
                   start  N  workers  that perform various related socket stress activity using epoll_wait(2) to monitor and handle new connections. This involves client/server processes performing rapid
                   connect, send/receives and disconnects on the local host.  Using epoll allows a large number of connections to be efficiently handled, however, this can lead to  the  connection  table
                   filling  up  and  blocking further socket connections, hence impacting on the epoll bogo op stats.  For ipv4 and ipv6 domains, multiple servers are spawned on multiple ports. The epoll
                   stressor is for Linux only.

            --epoll-domain D
                   specify the domain to use, the default is unix (aka local). Currently ipv4, ipv6 and unix are supported.

            --epoll-ops N
                   stop epoll workers after N bogo operations.

            --epoll-port P
                   start at socket port P. For N epoll worker processes, ports P to (P × 4) − 1 are used for ipv4, ipv6 domains and ports P to P − 1 are used for the unix domain.

            --epoll-sockets N
                   specify the maximum number of concurrently open sockets allowed in server.  Setting a high value impacts on memory usage and may trigger out of memory conditions.

       Event file descriptor (eventfd) stressor
            --eventfd N
                   start N parent and child worker processes that read and write 8 byte event messages between them via the eventfd mechanism (Linux only).

            --eventfd-nonblock
                   enable EFD_NONBLOCK to allow non-blocking on the event file descriptor. This will cause reads and writes to return with EAGAIN rather the blocking and hence  causing  a  high  rate  of
                   polling I/O.

            --eventfd-ops N
                   stop eventfd workers after N bogo operations.

       Exec processes stressor
            --exec N
                   start  N  workers  continually  forking  children  that exec stress-ng and then exit almost immediately. If a system has pthread support then 1 in 4 of the exec's will be from inside a
                   pthread to exercise exec'ing from inside a pthread context.

            --exec-fork-method [ clone | fork | rfork | spawn | vfork ]
                   select the process creation method using clone(2), fork(2), BSD rfork(2), posix_spawn(3) or vfork(2). Note that vfork will only exec programs using execve due to the constraints on the
                   shared stack between the parent and the child process.

            --exec-max P
                   create P child processes that exec stress-ng and then wait for them to exit per iteration. The default is 4096; higher values may create many temporary zombie processes that are  wait‐
                   ing to be reaped. One can potentially fill up the process table using high values for --exec-max and --exec.

            --exec-method [ all | execve | execveat | fexecve ]
                   select  the exec system call to use; all will perform a random choice between execve(2), execveat(2) and fexecve(3), execve will use execve(2), execveat will use execveat(2) (if avail‐
                   able) and fexecve will use fexecve(3) (if available).

            --exec-no-pthread
                   do not use pthread_create(3).

            --exec-ops N
                   stop exec stress workers after N bogo operations.

       Exiting pthread groups stressor
            --exit-group N
                   start N workers that create 16 pthreads and terminate the pthreads and the controlling child process using exit_group(2). (Linux only stressor).

            --exit-group-ops N
                   stop after N iterations of pthread creation and deletion loops.

       Exponential functions
            --expmath N
                   start N workers that exercise various exponential functions with input values 0 to 1 in steps of 0.001; the results are sanity checked to ensure no variation occurs after each round of
                   10000 computations.

            --expmath-ops N
                   stop after N exponential bogo-operation loops.

            --expmath-method method
                   specify a exponential function to exercise. Available exponential stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method  Description
                   all     iterate over all the below exponential functions methods
                   cexp    double complex natural exponential
                   cexpf   float complex natural exponential
                   cexpl   long double complex natural exponential
                   exp     double natural exponential

                   expl    long double natural exponential
                   exp10   double base-10 exponential
                   exp10f  float base-10 exponential
                   exp10l  long double base-10 exponential
                   exp2    double base-2 exponential
                   exp2f   float base-2 exponential
                   exp2l   long double base-2 exponential

       Factorization of large integers stressor
            --factor N
                   start N workers that factorize large integers using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library. Randomized values to be factorized are computed so that an N digit value is comprised
                   of about 0.4 × N random factors, for N > 100. The default number of digits in the value to be factorized is 10.

            --factor-digits N
                   select the number of digits in the values to be factorized. Range 8 to 100000000 digits, default is 10.

            --factor-ops N
                   stop after N factorizations.

       File space allocation (fallocate) stressor
            -F N, --fallocate N
                   start N workers continually fallocating (preallocating file space) and ftruncating (file truncating) temporary files.  If the file is larger than the free space, fallocate will produce
                   an ENOSPC error which is ignored by this stressor.

            --fallocate-bytes N
                   allocated file size, the default is 1 GB. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --fallocate-ops N
                   stop fallocate stress workers after N bogo fallocate operations.

       Filesystem notification (fanotify) stressor
            --fanotify N
                   start N workers performing file system activities such as creating, opening, writing, reading and unlinking files to exercise the fanotify event monitoring interface (Linux only). Each
                   stressor runs a child process to generate file events and a parent process to read file events using fanotify. Has to be run with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

            --fanotify-ops N
                   stop fanotify stress workers after N bogo fanotify events.

       CPU branching instruction cache stressor
            --far-branch N
                   start N workers that exercise calls to tens of thousands of functions that are relatively far from the caller. All functions are 1 op instructions that return to the caller. The  func‐
                   tions  are  placed in pages that are memory mapped with a wide spread of fixed virtual addresses.  Function calls are pre-shuffled to create a randomized mix of addresses to call. This
                   stresses the instruction cache and any instruction TLBs.

            --far-branch-flush
                   attempt to periodically flush instruction cache to produce instruction cache misses.

            --far-branch-ops N
                   stop after N far branch bogo-ops. One full cycle of calling all the tens of thousands of functions equates to one bogo-op.

            --far-branch-pageout
                   where possible pageout and soft-offline randomly selected pages that contain the far branch functions. This uses madvise(2) MADV_PAGEOUT and MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE to perform these actions.

            --far-branch-pages N
                   specify the number of pages to allocate for far branch functions. The number for functions per page depends on the processor architecture, for example, x86 will have 4096 x 1 byte  re‐
                   turn instructions per 4 K page, where as SPARC64 will have only 512 x 8 byte return instructions per 4 K page.

       Page fault stressor
            --fault N
                   start N workers that generates minor and major page faults.

            --fault-ops N
                   stop the page fault workers after N bogo page fault operations.

       Fcntl stressor
            --fcntl N
                   start  N  workers  that  perform fcntl(2) calls with various commands.  The exercised commands (if available) are: F_CREATED_QUERY, F_DUPFD, F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC, F_GETFD, F_SETFD, F_GETFL,
                   F_SETFL, F_GETOWN, F_SETOWN, F_GETOWN_EX, F_SETOWN_EX, F_GETSIG, F_SETSIG, F_GETOWNER_UIDS, F_GETLEASE, F_GETLK, F_SETLK, F_SETLKW,  F_UNLCK,  F_OFD_GETLK,  F_OFD_SETLK,  F_OFD_SETLKW,
                   F_GET_FILE_RW_HINT, F_SET_FILE_RW_HINT, F_GET_RW_HINT and F_SET_RW_HINT.

            --fcntl-ops N
                   stop the fcntl workers after N bogo fcntl operations.

       File descriptor abusing stressor
            --fd-abuse N
                   start  N  workers  that open file descriptors using various ways (file, dup, socket, pipe, timerfd, pidfd, userfaultfd, etc.) and perform valid and invalid file operations on these de‐
                   scriptors. This exercises a mix of successful and failed file operations on a wide range of file descriptor types.

            --fd-abuse-ops N
                   stop after N file abuse file operation bogo-ops.

       File descriptor duplication and closing stressor
            --fd-fork N
                   start N workers that open files using dup(2) on a file (/dev/zero by default) and then copies these using multiple fork'd child processes and closes them with the  fast  clone_range(2)
                   or  close(2)  or  by  directly  ending the processes using _exit(2). For every bogo-op, the stressor attempts to dup(2) another 10000 file descriptors up to the maximum allowed, fork 8
                   child processes that then close their copies of the file descriptors.

            --fd-fork-fds N
                   specify maximum number of file descriptors to be opened. The default is 2 million, with a range of 1000 to 16 million. The actual number used may be less depending on  the  system  de‐
                   fined limits of the number of open files per process.

            --fd-fork-file [ null | random | stdin | stdout | zero ]
                   specify file to dup: null for /dev/null, random for /dev/random, stdin for standard input, stdout for standard output, zero for /dev/zero.  Default is /dev/zero.

            --fd-fork-ops N
                   stop  after  N rounds of 10000 dups, forking/closing/exiting and waiting for the child processes. Note that the bogo-ops metric rate will slow down over time as this stressor increases
                   the number of open files per bogo-loop and this increases the fork and close run times.

       File descriptor race stressor
            --fd-race N
                   start N workers that attempt to force race conditions on opened file descriptors.  Opened file descriptors are passed from a server to a client over a  socket.  At  periodic  intervals
                   batches  of  the  file  descriptors are duplicated by creating multiple pthreads and then closed en-masse with synchronized pthread termination. Also other concurrent pthreads exercise
                   various file based system calls on file descriptors that are in the process of being created. By default a single file is used for the open calls, however /dev and /proc files  can  be
                   exercised using the appropriate fd-race options.

            --fd-race-dev
                   exercise /dev files for race conditions.

            --fd-race-race-ops N
                   stop after N file descriptors have been exercised.

            --fd-race-proc
                   exercise /proc files for race conditions.

       Fibonacci search stressor
            --fibsearch N
                   start  N  workers  that use a search a sorted array of 32 bit integers using a Fibonacci search. A Fibonacci seaarch is similar to a bsearch except that it uses the Fibonacci series to
                   divide the search into unequal sized spaces. It avoids the costly division operator found in bsearches and examines closer elements on each search step so there is a slight compute and
                   cache advantage over bsearch.  By default, there are 65536 elements in the array.  This is a useful method to exercise random access of memory and processor cache.

            --fibsearch-ops N
                   stop the fibsearch worker after N bogo fibsearch operations are completed.

            --fibsearch-size N
                   specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to fibsearch. Size can be from 1 K to 4 M.

       File extent (fiemap) stressor
            --fiemap N
                   start N workers that each create a file with many randomly changing extents and has 4 child processes per worker that gather the extent information using the FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl(2).

            --fiemap-bytes N
                   specify the size of the fiemap'd file in bytes.  One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m
                   or g.  Larger files will contain more extents, causing more stress when gathering extent information.

            --fiemap-ops N
                   stop after N fiemap bogo operations.

       FIFO named pipe stressor
            --fifo N
                   start N workers that exercise a named pipe by transmitting 64 bit integers.

            --fifo-data-size N
                   set the byte size of the fifo write/reads, default is 8, range 8..4096.

            --fifo-ops N
                   stop fifo workers after N bogo pipe write operations.

            --fifo-readers N
                   for each worker, create N fifo reader workers that read the named pipe using simple blocking reads. Default is 4, range 1..64.

       File I/O control (ioctl) stressor
            --file-ioctl N
                   start N workers that exercise various file specific ioctl(2) calls. This will attempt to use the FIONBIO, FIOQSIZE, FIGETBSZ, FIOCLEX, FIONCLEX, FIONBIO, FIOASYNC, FIOQSIZE,  FIFREEZE,
                   FITHAW, FICLONE, FICLONERANGE, FIONREAD, FIONWRITE and FS_IOC_RESVSP ioctls if these are defined.

            --file-ioctl-ops N
                   stop file-ioctl workers after N file ioctl bogo operations.

       Filename stressor
            --filename N
                   start N workers that exercise file creation using various length filenames containing a range of allowed filename characters.  This will try to see if it can exceed the file system al‐
                   lowed filename length was well as test various filename lengths between 1 and the maximum allowed by the file system.

            --filename-ops N
                   stop filename workers after N bogo filename tests.

            --filename-opts opt
                   use characters in the filename based on option `opt'. Valid options are:

                   Option      Description
                   probe       default option, probe the file system for valid allowed characters in a file name and use these
                   posix       use characters as specified by The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, POSIX.1-2008, 3.278 Portable Filename Character Set
                   ext         use characters allowed by the ext2, ext3, ext4 file systems, namely any 8 bit character apart from NUL and /
                   utf8        use struct utf8 characters in filename
                   urf8-like   use utf8 like characters with illegal utf8 encodings when generating random filenames

       File race stressor
            --filerace N
                   start  N  workers that each run 8 concurrent processes that exercise a randomized set of file related system calls on 64 random files. This attempts to trip any file system race condi‐
                   tions while files are being operated upon. The randomized operations will cause some invalid file operations to fail, these failures are silently ignored.

            --filerace-ops N
                   stop after N randomized file bogo-operations, this is not a reliable metric of performance because of the highly randomized actions occurring on randomly selected files.

       Single cacheline coherency scalability stressor
            --flipflop N
                   start N workers where each worker creates two groups of threads of the same size where each group is affined to a set of CPUs. A continuous bitmap that has enough bits for each  thread
                   pair is exercised, each thread pair tries to flip/flop their specific bit using cmpxchg (compare/exchange); one thread tries to flip the bit from 0 to 1 and the other tries to flop the
                   bit  from  1  to 0.  This stressor makes threads compete on the same cacheline and measures the total number of flip/flop operations and the distribution of successful flip/flops among
                   the threads (to see if thread pairs get starved in favour of others).

            --flipflop-bits N
                   specifies number of bits in the bitmap (and hence number of flip/flop thread pairs).

            --flipflop-taskset1 list
                   list of CPUs to affine the flip threads to. Refer to the --taskset option description for the syntax of the list argument.

            --flipflop-taskset2 list
                   list of CPUs to affine the flop threads to. Refer to the --taskset option description for the syntax of the list argument.

            --flipflop-ops N
                   stop after N bogo-ops, in this case a bogo-op is 100000 flip-flop operations.

       BSD File locking (flock) stressor
            --flock N
                   start N workers locking on a single file.

            --flock-ops N
                   stop flock stress workers after N bogo flock operations.

       Cache flushing stressor
            --flush-cache N
                   start N workers that flush the data and instruction cache (where possible).  Some architectures may not support cache flushing on either cache, in which case these become no-ops.

            --flush-cache-ops N
                   stop after N cache flush iterations.

       Fused Multiply/Add floating point operations (fma) stressor
            --fma N
                   start N workers that exercise single and double precision floating point multiplication and add operations on arrays of 512  floating  point  values.   More  modern  processors  (Intel
                   Haswell, AMD Bulldozer and Piledriver) and modern C compilers these will be performed by fused-multiply-add (fma3) opcodes. Operations used are:

                   a = (a × b) + c
                   a = (b × a) + c
                   a = (b × c) + a
                   a = (a × b) − c
                   a = (b × a) − c
                   a = (b × c) − a

            --fma-libc
                   use  libc fma math functions if they are available. These use either the libc FMA macros if defined, the  __builtin libc functions or the fma libc functions. Generally these are slower
                   than directly multiply/add fused code generated by the compiler.

            --fma-ops N
                   stop after N bogo-loops of the 3 above operations on 512 single and double precision floating point numbers.

       Process forking stressor
            -f N, --fork N
                   start N workers continually forking children that immediately exit.

            --fork-max P
                   create P child processes and then wait for them to exit per iteration. The default is just 1; higher values will create many temporary zombie processes that are waiting to  be  reaped.
                   One can potentially fill up the process table using high values for --fork-max and --fork.

            --fork-ops N
                   stop fork stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --fork-pageout
                   enable force paging-out of memory resident pages in fork stressor instances.

            --fork-unmap
                   attempt  to unmap unused non-memory resident shared library pages to try and reduced anonymous vma copying. This is an ugly hack for benchmarking reduced vma copying and not guaranteed
                   to work. Linux only.

            --fork-vm
                   enable detrimental performance virtual memory advice using madvise(2) on all pages of the forked process. Where possible this will try to set every page in the new process  with  using
                   madvise(2) MADV_MERGEABLE, MADV_WILLNEED, MADV_HUGEPAGE and MADV_RANDOM flags. Linux only.

       Heavy process forking stressor
            --forkheavy N
                   start  N workers that fork child processes from a parent that has thousands of allocated system resources. The fork becomes a heavyweight operations as it has to duplicate the resource
                   references of the parent. Each stressor instance creates and reaps up to 4096 child processes that are created and reaped in a first-in first-out manner.

            --forkheavy-allocs N
                   attempt N resource allocation loops per stressor instance. Resources include pipes, file descriptors, memory mappings, pthreads, timers, ptys, semaphores, message queues and  temporary
                   files. These create heavyweight processes that are more time expensive to fork from. Default is 16384.

            --forkheavy-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) future allocated pages into memory causing more memory pressure. If mlock(MCL_FUTURE) is implemented then this will stop new brk pages from being swapped out.

            --forkheavy-ops N
                   stop after N fork calls.

            --forkheavy-procs N
                   attempt to fork N processes per stressor. The default is 4096 processes.

       Floating point operations stressor
            --fp N start  N workers that exercise addition, multiplication and division operations on a range of floating point types. For each type, 8 floating point values are operated upon 65536 times
                   in a loop per bogo op.

            --fp-method method
                   select the floating point method to use, available methods are:

                   Note that some of these floating point methods may not be available on some systems.

            --fp-ops N
                   stop after N floating point bogo ops. Note that bogo-ops are counted for just standard float, double and long double floating point types.

       Floating point exception stressor
            --fp-error N
                   start N workers that generate floating point exceptions. Computations are performed to force and check for the FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INEXACT, FE_INVALID, FE_OVERFLOW and FE_UNDERFLOW excep‐
                   tions.  EDOM and ERANGE errors are also checked.

            --fp-error-ops N
                   stop after N bogo floating point exceptions.

       File punch and hole filling stressor
            --fpunch N
                   start N workers that punch and fill holes in a 16 MB file using five concurrent processes per stressor exercising on the  same  file.  Where  available,  this  uses  fallocate(2)  FAL‐
                   LOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE, FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE, FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE and FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE to make and fill holes across the file and breaks it into multiple ex‐
                   tents.

            --fpunch-bytes N
                   set  maximum size of each file for each fpunch worker process, the default is 16 MB. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes
                   and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --fpunch-ops N
                   stop fpunch workers after N punch and fill bogo operations.

       Fractal Stressor
            --fractal N
                   start N workers that generate 2D fractals. By default a 1024 x 1024 point Mandelbrot set is computed with a maximum of 256 iterations per point in the iterative compute loop. The frac‐
                   tal is computed row by row with multiple rows shared amongst the N fractal stressor instances. Double precision floating point values are used for the points in the complex set of val‐
                   ues. Naive computation is used with no special algorithmic short-cuts or interpolation.

            --fractal-iterations N
                   specify the maximum number of iterations for the quadratic map computation of each point, default is 256 iterations.

            --fractal-method [ julia | mandelbrot ]
                   select the method of fractal generation, Julia set or Mandelbrot set, default is the Mandelbrot set.

            --fractal-ops N
                   stop after N fractals have been generated.

            --fractal-sizex N
                   set the maximum width of the fractal, default is 1024 points.

            --fractal-sizey N
                   set the maximum height of the fractal, default is 1024 points.

       File size limit stressor
            --fsize N
                   start N workers that exercise file size limits (via setrlimit(2) RLIMIT_FSIZE) with file sizes that are fixed, random and powers of 2. The files are truncated and allocated to  trigger
                   SIGXFSZ signals.

            --fsize-ops N
                   stop after N bogo file size test iterations.

       File stats (fstat) stressor
            --fstat N
                   start N workers fstat'ing files in a directory (default is /dev).

            --fstat-dir directory
                   specify the directory to fstat to override the default of /dev.  All the files in the directory will be fstat'd repeatedly.

            --fstat-ops N
                   stop fstat stress workers after N bogo fstat operations.

       /dev/full stressor
            --full N
                   start  N  workers that exercise /dev/full.  This attempts to write to the device (which should always get error ENOSPC), to read from the device (which should always return a buffer of
                   zeros) and to seek randomly on the device (which should always succeed).  (Linux only).

            --full-ops N
                   stop the stress full workers after N bogo I/O operations.

       Function argument passing stressor
            --funccall N
                   start N workers that call functions of 1 through to 9 arguments. By default all functions with a range of argument types are called, however, this can  be  changed  using  the  --func‐
                   call-method option. This exercises stack function argument passing and re-ordering on the stack and in registers.

            --funccall-ops N
                   stop the funccall workers after N bogo function call operations. Each bogo operation is 1000 calls of functions of 1 through to 9 arguments of the chosen argument type.

            --funccall-method method
                   specify  the method of funccall argument type to be used. The default is all the types but can be one of bool, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uint128, float, double, longdouble, cfloat
                   (complex float), cdouble (complex double), clongdouble (complex long double), float16, float32, float64, float80, float128, decimal32, decimal64 and  decimal128.   Note  that  some  of
                   these types are only available with specific architectures and compiler versions.

       Function return stressor
            --funcret N
                   start N workers that pass and return by value various small to large data types.

            --funcret-ops N
                   stop the funcret workers after N bogo function call operations.

            --funcret-method method
                   specify  the method of funcret argument type to be used. The default is uint64_t but can be one of uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uint128 float double longdouble float80 float128 decimal32
                   decimal64 decimal128 uint8x32 uint8x128 uint64x128.

       Fast mutex (futex) stressor
            --futex N
                   start N workers that rapidly exercise the futex system call. Each worker has two processes, a futex waiter and a futex waker. The waiter waits with a very small timeout to  stress  the
                   timeout and rapid polled futex waiting. This is a Linux specific stress option.

            --futex-ops N
                   stop futex workers after N bogo successful futex wait operations.

       Fetching data from kernel stressor
            --get N
                   start  N  workers  that  call system calls that fetch data from the kernel, currently these are: getpid(2), getppid(2), getcwd(3), getgid(2), getegid(2), getuid(2), getgroups(2), getp‐
                   grp(2), getpgid(2), getpriority(2), getresgid(2), getresuid(2), getrlimit(2),  prlimit(2),  getrusage(2),  getsid(2),  gettid(2),  getcpu(2),  gettimeofday(2),  uname(2),  adjtimex(2),
                   sysfs(2). Some of these system calls are OS specific.

            --get-ops N
                   stop get workers after N bogo get operations.

            --get-slow-sync
                   attempt  to synchronize system calls across the N get workers to try to force forms of locking contention in the kernel on the more complex cases. Each system call is exercised concur‐
                   rently with the N workers for 0.1 seconds at a time, so it takes a 3-4 seconds to work through all the system calls.

       Get directory entries stressor (Linux)
            --getdent N
                   start N workers that recursively read directories /proc, /dev/, /tmp, /sys and /run using getdents(2) and getdents64(2) (Linux only).

            --getdent-ops N
                   stop getdent workers after N bogo getdent bogo operations.

       Random data (getrandom) stressor
            --getrandom N
                   start N workers that get 8192 random bytes from the /dev/urandom pool using the getrandom(2) system call (Linux) or getentropy(2) (OpenBSD).

            --getrandom-ops N
                   stop getrandom workers after N bogo get operations.

       CPU pipeline and branch prediction stressor
            --goto N
                   start N workers that perform 1024 forward branches (to next instruction) or backward branches (to previous instruction) for each bogo operation loop.  By default, every  1024  branches
                   the direction is randomly chosen to be forward or backward.  This stressor exercises suboptimal pipelined execution and branch prediction logic.

            --goto-direction [ forward | backward | random ]
                   select the branching direction in the stressor loop, forward for forward only branching, backward for a backward only branching, random for a random choice of forward or random branch‐
                   ing every 1024 branches.

            --goto-ops N
                   stop goto workers after N bogo loops of 1024 branch instructions.

       2D GPU stressor
            --gpu N
                   start  N  worker  that exercise the GPU. This specifies a 2-D texture image that allows the elements of an image array to be read by shaders, and render primitives using an opengl con‐
                   text.

            --gpu-devnode DEVNAME
                   specify the device node name of the GPU device, the default is /dev/dri/renderD128.

            --gpu-frag N
                   specify shader core usage per pixel, this sets N loops in the fragment shader.

            --gpu-ops N
                   stop gpu workers after N render loop operations.

            --gpu-tex-size N
                   specify upload texture N × N, by default this value is 4096 × 4096.

            --gpu-xsize X
                   use a framebuffer size of X pixels. The default is 256 pixels.

            --gpu-ysize Y
                   use a framebuffer size of Y pixels. The default is 256 pixels.

            --gpu-upload N
                   specify upload texture N times per frame, the default value is 1.

       Handle stressor
            --handle N
                   start N workers that exercise the name_to_handle_at(2) and open_by_handle_at(2) system calls. (Linux only).

            --handle-ops N
                   stop after N handle bogo operations.

       String hashing stressor
            --hash N
                   start N workers that exercise various hashing functions. Random strings from 1 to 128 bytes are hashed and the hashing rate and chi squared is calculated from the number of hashes per‐
                   formed over a period of time. The chi squared value is the goodness-of-fit measure, it is the actual distribution of items in hash buckets versus the expected  distribution  of  items.
                   Typically a chi squared value close to 1.0 indicates a good hash distribution.

            --hash-method method
                   specify the hashing method to use, by default all the hashing methods are cycled through. Methods available are:

                   Method      Description

       File-system stressor
            -d N, --hdd N
                   start N workers continually writing, reading and removing temporary files. The default mode is to stress test sequential writes and reads.  With the --aggressive option enabled without
                   any --hdd-opts options the hdd stressor will work through all the --hdd-opt options one by one to cover a range of I/O options.

            --hdd-bytes N
                   write N bytes for each hdd process, the default is 1 GB. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix
                   b, k, m or g.

            --hdd-opts list
                   specify various stress test options as a comma separated list. Options are as follows:

                   Option          Description
                   direct          try  to minimize cache effects of the I/O. File I/O writes are performed directly from user space buffers and synchronous transfer is also attempted.  To guarantee syn‐
                                   chronous I/O, also use the sync option.
                   dsync           ensure output has been transferred to underlying hardware and file metadata has been updated (using the O_DSYNC open flag). This is equivalent to  each  write(2)  being
                                   followed by a call to fdatasync(2). See also the fdatasync option.
                   fadv-dontneed   advise kernel to expect the data will not be accessed in the near future.
                   fadv-noreuse    advise kernel to expect the data to be accessed only once.
                   fadv-normal     advise kernel there are no explicit access pattern for the data. This is the default advice assumption.
                   fadv-rnd        advise kernel to expect random access patterns for the data.
                   fadv-seq        advise kernel to expect sequential access patterns for the data.
                   fadv-willneed   advise kernel to expect the data to be accessed in the near future.
                   fsync           flush all modified in-core data after each write to the output device using an explicit fsync(2) call.
                   fdatasync       similar  to  fsync,  but do not flush the modified metadata unless metadata is required for later data reads to be handled correctly. This uses an explicit fdatasync(2)
                                   call.
                   iovec           use readv/writev multiple buffer I/Os rather than read/write. Instead of 1 read/write operation, the buffer is broken into an iovec of 16 buffers.
                   noatime         do not update the file last access timestamp, this can reduce metadata writes.
                   sync            ensure output has been transferred to underlying hardware (using the O_SYNC open flag). This is equivalent to a each write(2) being followed by a call to fsync(2).  See
                                   also the fsync option.
                   rd-rnd          read data randomly.
                   rd-seq          read data sequentially.
                   syncfs          write all buffered modifications of file metadata and data on the filesystem that contains the hdd worker files.
                   utimes          force update of file timestamp which may increase metadata writes.
                   wr-rnd          write data randomly. The wr-seq option cannot be used at the same time.
                   wr-seq          write data sequentially. This is the default if no write modes are specified.

            Note that some of these options are mutually exclusive, for example, there can be only one method of writing or reading.  Also, fadvise flags may be mutually exclusive, for example fadv-will‐
            need cannot be used with fadv-dontneed.

            --inode-flags N
                   start N workers that exercise inode flags using the FS_IOC_GETFLAGS and FS_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctl(2) and inode attributes using file_getattr(2) and file_getatt(2).  This attempts to  apply
                   all  the available inode flags onto a directory and file even if the underlying file system may not support these flags (errors are just ignored). Each worker runs 4 threads that exer‐
                   cise the flags on the same directory and file to try to force races. This is a Linux only stressor, see ioctl_iflags(2) for more details.

       IO scheduling class and priority stressor
            --ioprio N
                   start N workers that exercise the ioprio_get(2) and ioprio_set(2) system calls (Linux only).

            --ioprio-ops N
                   stop after N io priority bogo operations.

       Io-uring stressor
            --io-uring N

                   specify the number of io-uring ring entries.

            --io-uring-ops
                   stop after N rounds of io-uring operations.

            --io-uring-rand
                   randomize order of io-uring operations and file seek locations.

       Ipsec multi-buffer cryptographic stressor
            --ipsec-mb N
                   start N workers that perform cryptographic processing using the highly optimized Intel Multi-Buffer Crypto for IPsec library. Depending on the features available,  SSE,  AVX,  AVX  and
                   AVX512  CPU  features  will be used on data encrypted by SHA, DES, CMAC, CTR, HMAC MD5, HMAC SHA1 and HMAC SHA512 cryptographic routines. This is only available for x86-64 modern Intel
                   CPUs.

            --ipsec-mb-feature [ sse | avx | avx2 | avx512 | noaesni ]
                   Just use the specified processor CPU feature. By default, all the available features for the CPU are exercised.

            --ipsec-mb-jobs N
                   Process N multi-block rounds of cryptographic processing per iteration. The default is 256.

            --ipsec-mb-method [ all | cmac | ctr | des | hmac-md5 | hmac-sha1 | hmac-sha512 | sha ]

       System interval timer stressor
            --itimer N
                   start N workers that exercise the system interval timers. This sets up an ITIMER_PROF itimer that generates a SIGPROF signal.  The default frequency for the itimer is 1  MHz,  however,
                   the Linux kernel will set this to be no more that the jiffy setting, hence high frequency SIGPROF signals are not normally possible.  A busy loop spins on getitimer(2) calls to consume
                   CPU and hence decrement the itimer based on amount of time spent in CPU and system time.

            --itimer-freq F
                   run  itimer  at  F Hz; range from 1 to 1000000 Hz. Normally the highest frequency is limited by the number of jiffy ticks per second, so running above 1000 Hz is difficult to attain in
                   practice.

            --itimer-ops N
                   stop itimer stress workers after N bogo itimer SIGPROF signals.

            --itimer-rand
                   select an interval timer frequency based around the interval timer frequency ±12.5% random jitter. This tries to force more variability in the timer interval  to  make  the  scheduling
                   less predictable.

       Jpeg compression stressor
            --jpeg N
                   start  N  workers  that use jpeg compression on a machine generated plasma field image. The default image is a plasma field, however different image types may be selected. The starting
                   raster line is changed on each compression iteration to cycle around the data.

            --jpeg-height H
                   use a RGB sample image height of H pixels. The default is 512 pixels.

            --jpeg-image [ brown | flat | gradient | noise | plasma | xstripes ]
                   select the source image type to be compressed. Available image types are:

                   flat      a single random colour for the entire image.
                   gradient  linear gradient of the red, green and blue components across the width and height of the image.
                   noise     random white noise for red, green, blue values.
                   plasma    plasma field with smooth colour transitions and hard boundary edges.
                   xstripes  a random colour for each horizontal line.

            --jpeg-ops N
                   stop after N jpeg compression operations.

            --jpeg-quality Q
                   use the compression quality Q. The range is 1..100 (1 lowest, 100 highest), with a default of 95

            --jpeg-width H
                   use a RGB sample image width of H pixels. The default is 512 pixels.

       Judy array stressor
            --judy N
                   start N workers that insert, search and delete 32 bit integers in a Judy array using a predictable yet sparse array index. By default, there are 131072 integers used in the Judy array.
                   This is a useful method to exercise random access of memory and processor cache.

            --judy-ops N
                   stop the judy workers after N bogo judy operations are completed.

            --judy-size N
                   specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the Judy array to exercise.  Size can be from 1 K to 4 M 32 bit integers.

       Kcmp stressor (Linux)
            --kcmp N
                   start N workers that use kcmp(2) to compare parent and child processes to determine if they share kernel resources. Supported only for Linux and requires CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability.

            --kcmp-ops N
                   stop kcmp workers after N bogo kcmp operations.

       Kernel key management stressor
            --key N
                   start N workers that create and manipulate keys using add_key(2) and ketctl(2). As many keys are created as the per user limit allows and then the following keyctl commands  are  exer‐
                   cised on each key: KEYCTL_SET_TIMEOUT, KEYCTL_DESCRIBE, KEYCTL_UPDATE, KEYCTL_READ, KEYCTL_CLEAR and KEYCTL_INVALIDATE.

            --key-ops N
                   stop key workers after N bogo key operations.

       Process signals stressor
            --kill N
                   start N workers sending SIGUSR1 kill(2) signals to a SIG_IGN signal handler in the stressor and SIGUSR1 kill signal to a child stressor with a SIGUSR1 handler. Most of the process time
                   will end up in kernel space.

            --kill-ops N
                   stop kill workers after N bogo kill operations.

       Syslog stressor (Linux)
            --klog N
                   start N workers exercising the kernel syslog(2) system call.  This will attempt to read the kernel log with various sized read buffers. Linux only.

            --klog-ops N
                   stop klog workers after N syslog operations.

       KVM stressor
            --kvm N
                   start  N  workers  that create, run and destroy a minimal virtual machine. The virtual machine reads, increments and writes to port 0x80 in a spin loop and the stressor handles the I/O
                   transactions. Currently for x86 and Linux only.

            --kvm-ops N
                   stop kvm stressors after N virtual machines have been created, run and destroyed.

       CPU L1 cache stressor
            --l1cache N
                   start N workers that exercise the CPU level 1 cache with reads and writes. A cache aligned buffer that is twice the level 1 cache size is read and then written in  level  1  cache  set
                   sized  steps over each level 1 cache set. This is designed to exercise cache block evictions. The bogo-op count measures the number of million cache lines touched.  Where possible, the
                   level 1 cache geometry is determined from the kernel, however, this is not possible on some architectures or kernels, so one may need to specify these manually. One can specify  3  out
                   of the 4 cache geometric parameters, these are as follows:

            --l1cache-line-size N
                   specify the level 1 cache line size (in bytes)

            --l1cache-method [ forward | random | reverse ]
                   select the method of exercising a l1cache sized buffer. The default is a forward scan, random picks random bytes to exercise, reverse scans in reverse.

            --l1cache-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) the l1cache size buffer into memory to prevent it from being swapped out.

            --l1cache-ops N
                   specify the number of cache read/write bogo-op loops to run

            --l1cache-sets N
                   specify the number of level 1 cache sets

            --l1cache-size N
                   specify the level 1 cache size (in bytes)

            --l1cache-ways N
                   specify the number of level 1 cache ways

       Landlock stressor (Linux ≥ 5.13)
            --landlock N
                   start  N  workers that exercise Linux 5.13 landlocking. A range of landlock_create_ruleset(2) flags are exercised with a read only file rule to see if a directory can be accessed and a
                   read-write file create can be blocked. Each ruleset attempt is exercised in a new child context and this is the limiting factor on the speed of the stressor.

            --landlock-ops N
                   stop the landlock stressors after N landlock ruleset bogo operations.

       File lease stressor
            --lease N
                   start N workers locking, unlocking and breaking leases via the fcntl(2) F_SETLEASE operation. The parent processes continually lock and unlock a lease on a file while a user selectable
                   number of child processes open the file with a non-blocking open to generate SIGIO lease breaking notifications to the parent.  This stressor is only available if  F_SETLEASE,  F_WRLCK
                   and F_UNLCK support is provided by fcntl(2).

            --lease-breakers N
                   start N lease breaker child processes per lease worker.  Normally one child is plenty to force many SIGIO lease breaking notification signals to the parent, however, this option allows
                   one to specify more child processes if required.

            --lease-ops N
                   stop lease workers after N bogo operations.

       LED stressor (Linux)
            --led N
                   start N workers that exercise the /sys/class/leds interfaces to set LED brightness levels and the various trigger settings. This needs to be run with root privilege to be able to write
                   to these settings successfully. Non-root privilege will ignore failed writes.

            --led-ops N
                   stop after N interfaces are exercised.

       Hardlink stressor
            --link N
                   start N workers creating and removing hardlinks.

            --link-ops N
                   stop link stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --link-sync
                   sync dirty data and metadata to disk.

       List data structures stressor
            --list N
                   start  N  workers  that exercise list data structures. The default is to add, find and remove 5000 64 bit integers into circleq (doubly linked circle queue), list (doubly linked list),
                   slist (singly linked list), slistt (singly linked list using tail), stailq (singly linked tail queue) and tailq (doubly linked tail queue) lists. The intention of this stressor  is  to
                   exercise memory and cache with the various list operations.

            --list-method [ all | circleq | list | slist | stailq | tailq ]
                   specify the list to be used. By default, all the list methods are used (the `all' option).

            --list-ops N
                   stop list stressors after N bogo ops. A bogo op covers the addition, finding and removing all the items into the list(s).

            --list-size N
                   specify the size of the list, where N is the number of 64 bit integers to be added into the list.

       Last level of cache stressor
            --llc-affinity N
                   start  N  workers  that exercise the last level of cache (LLC) by read/write activity across a LLC sized buffer and then changing CPU affinity after each round of read/writes. This can
                   cause non-local memory stalls and LLC read/write misses.

            --llc-affinity-clflush
                   where possible, flush cachelines after each cacheline write, x86 and ppc64 only.

            --llc-affinity-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) the LLC sized buffer into memory to prevent it from being swapped out.

            --llc-affinity-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --llc-affinity-ops N
                   stop after N rounds of LLC read/writes.

            --llc-affinity-size N
                   override the default LLC cache size setting to N bytes. One can specify the in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

       Load average (loadavg) stressor
            --loadavg N
                   start N workers that attempt to create thousands of pthreads that run at the lowest nice priority to force very high load averages. Linux systems will also perform some I/O  writes  as
                   pending I/O is also factored into system load accounting.

            --loadavg-max N
                   set the maximum number of pthreads to create to N. N may be reduced if there is as system limit on the number of pthreads that can be created.

            --loadavg-ops N
                   stop loadavg workers after N bogo scheduling yields by the pthreads have been reached.

       Lock and increment memory stressor (x86 and ARM)
            --lockbus N
                   start  N  workers  that  rapidly  lock  and increment 64 bytes of randomly chosen memory from a 16 MB mmap'd region (Intel x86 and ARM CPUs only).  This will cause cacheline misses and
                   stalling of CPUs. Pages are spread randomly across NUMA nodes to exercise NUMA bus locking for NUMA systems.

            --lockbus-nosplit
                   disable split locks that lock across cache line boundaries.

            --lockbus-ops N
                   stop lockbus workers after N bogo operations.

       POSIX lock (F_SETLK/F_GETLK) stressor
            --locka N
                   start N workers that randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the POSIX advisory locking mechanism (see fcntl(2), F_SETLK, F_GETLK). Each worker creates a 1024 KB file and  at‐
                   tempts to hold a maximum of 1024 concurrent locks with a child process that also tries to hold 1024 concurrent locks. Old locks are unlocked in a first-in, first-out basis.

            --locka-ops N
                   stop locka workers after N bogo locka operations.

       POSIX lock (lockf) stressor
            --lockf N
                   start N workers that randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the POSIX lockf(3) locking mechanism. Each worker creates a 64 KB file and attempts to hold a maximum of 1024 con‐
                   current locks with a child process that also tries to hold 1024 concurrent locks. Old locks are unlocked in a first-in, first-out basis.

            --lockf-nonblock
                   instead of using blocking F_LOCK lockf(3) commands, use non-blocking F_TLOCK commands and re-try if the lock failed.  This creates extra system call overhead and CPU utilisation as the
                   number of lockf workers increases and should increase locking contention.

            --lockf-ops N
                   stop lockf workers after N bogo lockf operations.

       mixed file lock stressor (locka, lockf, lockofd)
            --lockmix N
                   start  N  workers  that randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the BSD flock(2), locka (advisory), POSIX lockf(3) and Linux open file lock (lockofd) locking mechanisms.  Each
                   worker creates a 1024 KB file and attempts to hold a maximum of 1024 concurrent locks with a child process that also tries to hold 1024 concurrent locks. Old locks are  unlocked  in  a
                   first-in, first-out basis.

            --lockmix-ops N
                   stop lockmix workers after N bogo lockmix operations.

       Linux open file lock (ofd F_OFD_SETLK/F_OFD_GETLK) stressor
            --lockofd N
                   start  N  workers  that  randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the Linux open file description locks (see fcntl(2), F_OFD_SETLK, F_OFD_GETLK).  Each worker creates a 1024 KB
                   file and attempts to hold a maximum of 1024 concurrent locks with a child process that also tries to hold 1024 concurrent locks. Old locks are unlocked in a first-in, first-out basis.

            --lockofd-ops N
                   stop lockofd workers after N bogo lockofd operations.

       Logarithmic functions
            --logmath N
                   start N workers that exercise various libm logarithmic functions with input values 1 to 10000.  Results are sanity checked to ensure no variation occurs after each round of 10000  com‐
                   putations.

            --logmath-ops N
                   stop after N logarithmic bogo-operation loops.

            --logmath-method method
                   specify a logarithmic function to exercise. Available logarithmic stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method  Description
                   all     iterate over all the below logarithmic functions methods
                   clog    double complex natural logarithm
                   clogf   float complex natural logarithm
                   clogl   long double complex natural logarithm
                   log     double natural logarithm
                   logf    float natural logarithm
                   logl    long double natural logarithm
                   logb    get exponent of a double
                   logbf   get exponent of a float
                   logbl   get exponent of a long double
                   log10   double base-10 logarithm
                   log10f  float base-10 logarithm
                   log10l  long double base-10 logarithm
                   log2    double base-2 logarithm
                   log2f   float base-2 logarithm
                   log2l   long double base-2 logarithm

       Long jump (longjmp) stressor
            --longjmp N
                   start N workers that exercise setjmp(3)/longjmp(3) by rapid looping on longjmp calls.

            --longjmp-ops N
                   stop longjmp stress workers after N bogo longjmp operations (1 bogo op is 1000 longjmp calls).

       Loopback stressor (Linux)
            --loop N
                   start  N  workers  that exercise the loopback control device. This creates 2 MB loopback devices, expands them to 4 MB, performs some loopback status information get and set operations
                   and then destroys them. Linux only and requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

            --loop-ops N
                   stop after N bogo loopback creation/deletion operations.

       Linear search stressor
            --lsearch N
                   start N workers that linear search a unsorted array of 32 bit integers using lsearch(3). By default, there are 8192 elements in the array.  This is a useful method to exercise  sequen‐
                   tial access of memory and processor cache.

            --lsearch-method [ lsearch-libc | lsearch-nonlibc | lsearch-sentinel ]
                   select either the libc implementation of lsearch or a slightly optimized non-libc implementation of lsearch or a lsearch that uses the search key as the end of array sentinel to remove
                   an index compare per loop. The default is the libc implementation if it exists, otherwise the non-libc version.

            --lsearch-ops N
                   stop the lsearch workers after N bogo lsearch operations are completed.

            --lsearch-size N
                   specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to lsearch. Size can be from 1 K to 4 M.

       Linux Security Modules system call stressor
            --lsm N
                   start  N  workers  that  exercise  the  LSM system calls lsm_list_modules(2) and lsm_get_self_attr(2), (Linux only).  Each bogo-op loop fetches a list of available security modules and
                   fetching LSM attributes as well as some invalid LSM system calls to exercise error handling.

            --lsm-ops N
                   stop after N loops of fetching security modules lists and fetching LSM attributes.

       Madvise stressor
            --madvise N
                   start N workers that apply random madvise(2) advise settings on pages of a 4 MB file backed shared memory mapping.

            --madvise-hwpoison
                   enable MADV_HWPOISON page poisoning (if available, only when run as root). This will page poison a few pages and will cause kernel error messages to be reported.

            --madvise-ops N
                   stop madvise stressors after N bogo madvise operations.

       Memory allocation stressor
            --malloc N
                   start N workers continuously calling malloc(3), calloc(3), realloc(3), posix_memalign(3), aligned_alloc(3), memalign(3) and free(3). By default, up to 65536 allocations can  be  active
                   at any point, but this can be altered with the --malloc-max option.  Allocation, reallocation and freeing are chosen at random; 50% of the time memory is allocation (via one of malloc,
                   calloc  or  realloc, posix_memalign, aligned_alloc, memalign) and 50% of the time allocations are free'd.  Allocation sizes are also random, with the maximum allocation size controlled
                   by the --malloc-bytes option, the default size being 64 K.  The worker is re-started if it is killed by the out of memory (OOM) killer.

            --malloc-bytes N
                   maximum per allocation/reallocation size. Allocations are randomly selected from 1 to N bytes. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in  units  of  Bytes,  KBytes,
                   MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.  Large allocation sizes cause the memory allocator to use mmap(2) rather than expanding the heap using brk(2).

            --malloc-max N
                   maximum  number  of active allocations allowed. Allocations are chosen at random and placed in an allocation slot. Because about 50%/50% split between allocation and freeing, typically
                   half of the allocation slots are in use at any one time.

            --malloc-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) the allocations into memory to prevent them from being swapped out.

            --malloc-ops N
                   stop after N malloc bogo operations. One bogo operations relates to a successful malloc(3), calloc(3), realloc(3), posix_memalign(3), aligned_alloc(3) or memalign(3) call.

            --malloc-pthreads N
                   specify number of malloc stressing concurrent pthreads to run. The default is 0 (just one main process, no pthreads). This option will do nothing if pthreads are not supported.

            --malloc-thresh N
                   specify the threshold where malloc uses mmap(2) instead of sbrk(2) to allocate more memory. This is only available on systems that provide the GNU C mallopt(3) tuning function.

            --malloc-touch
                   touch every allocated page to force pages to be populated in memory. This will increase the memory pressure and exercise the virtual memory harder. By default the malloc stressor  will
                   madvise pages into memory or use mincore to check for non-resident memory pages and try to force them into memory; this option aggressively forces pages to be memory resident.

            --malloc-trim
                   periodically  trim  memory allocation by attempting to release free memory from the heap every 65536 allocation iterations. This can be a time consuming operation. It is only available
                   with libc malloc implementations that support malloc_trim(3).

            --malloc-zerofree
                   zero allocated memory before free'ing. This can be useful in touching broken allocations and triggering failures. Also useful for forcing extra cache/memory writes.

       2D Matrix stressor
            --matrix N
                   start N workers that perform various matrix operations on floating point values. Testing on 64 bit x86 hardware shows that this provides a good mix of memory, cache and floating  point
                   operations and is an excellent way to make a CPU run hot.

                   By default, this will exercise all the matrix stress methods one by one on a 128 × 128 element matrix. One can specify a specific matrix stress method with the --matrix-method option.

            --matrix-method method
                   specify a matrix stress method. Available matrix stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method     Description
                   all        iterate over all the below matrix stress methods
                   add        add two N × N matrices
                   copy       copy one N × N matrix to another
                   div        divide an N × N matrix by a scalar
                   frobenius  Frobenius product of two N × N matrices
                   hadamard   Hadamard product of two N × N matrices
                   identity   create an N × N identity matrix
                   mean       arithmetic mean of two N × N matrices
                   mult       multiply an N × N matrix by a scalar
                   negate     negate an N × N matrix
                   prod       product of two N × N matrices
                   sub        subtract one N × N matrix from another N × N matrix
                   square     multiply an N × N matrix by itself
                   trans      transpose an N × N matrix
                   zero       zero an N × N matrix

            --matrix-ops N
                   stop matrix stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --matrix-size N
                   specify  the  N  × N size of the matrices.  Smaller values result in a floating point compute throughput bound stressor, where as large values result in a cache and/or memory bandwidth
                   bound stressor.

            --matrix-yx
                   perform matrix operations in order y by x rather than the default x by y. This is suboptimal ordering compared to the default and will perform more data cache stalls.

       3D Matrix stressor
            --matrix-3d N
                   start N workers that perform various 3D matrix operations on floating point values. Testing on 64 bit x86 hardware shows that this provides a good mix of  memory,  cache  and  floating
                   point operations and is an excellent way to make a CPU run hot.

                   By  default,  this  will  exercise  all  the  3D matrix stress methods one by one on a 128 × 128 × 128 element matrix. One can specify a specific 3D matrix stress method with the --ma‐
                   trix-3d-method option.

            --matrix-3d-method method
                   specify a 3D matrix stress method. Available 3D matrix stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method     Description
                   all        iterate over all the below matrix stress methods
                   add        add two N × N × N matrices

                   identity   create an N × N × N identity matrix
                   mean       arithmetic mean of two N × N × N matrices

            --matrix-3d-size N
                   specify the N × N × N size of the matrices.  Smaller values result in a floating point compute throughput bound stressor, where as large values result in a cache  and/or  memory  band‐
                   width bound stressor.

            --matrix-3d-zyx
                   perform matrix operations in order z by y by x rather than the default x by y by z. This is suboptimal ordering compared to the default and will perform more data cache stalls.

       Memory contention stressor
            --mcontend N
                   start  N  workers  that  produce  memory contention read/write patterns. Each stressor runs with 5 threads that read and write to two different mappings of the same underlying physical
                   page. Various caching operations are also exercised to cause sub-optimal memory access patterns.  The threads also randomly change CPU affinity to exercise  CPU  and  memory  migration
                   stress.

            --mcontend-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --mcontend-ops N
                   stop mcontend stressors after N bogo read/write operations.

            --memcpy N
                   start  N  workers  that  copies  data to and from a buffer using memcpy(3) and then move the data in the buffer with memmove(3) with 3 different alignments. This will exercise the data
                   cache and memory copying.

            --memcpy-method [ all | libc | builtin | naive | naive_o0 .. naive_o3 ]
                   specify a memcpy copying method. Available memcpy methods are described as follows:

                   Method    Description
                   all       use libc, builtin and naïve methods
                   libc      use libc memcpy and memmove functions, this is the default
                   builtin   use the compiler built in optimized memcpy and memmove functions
                   naive     use naïve byte by byte copying and memory moving build with default compiler optimization flags
                   naive_o0  use unoptimized naïve byte by byte copying and memory moving
                   naive_o1  use unoptimized naïve byte by byte copying and memory moving with -O1 optimization
                   naive_o2  use optimized naïve byte by byte copying and memory moving build with -O2 optimization and where possible use CPU specific optimizations
                   naive_o3  use optimized naïve byte by byte copying and memory moving build with -O3 optimization and where possible use CPU specific optimizations

            --memcpy-ops N
                   stop memcpy stress workers after N bogo memcpy operations.

       Anonymous file (memfd) stressor
            --memfd N
                   start N workers that create allocations of 1024 pages using memfd_create(2) and ftruncate(2) for allocation and mmap(2) to map the allocation into the process  address  space.   (Linux
                   only).

            --memfd-bytes N
                   allocate  N  bytes  per memfd stress worker, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size in as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the
                   suffix b, k, m or g.

            --memfd-fds N
                   create N memfd file descriptors, the default is 256. One can select 8 to 4096 memfd file descriptions with this option.

            --memfd-madvise
                   enable random madvise page advice on memfd memory mapped regions to add a little more VM exercising.

            --memfd-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --memfd-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --memfd-ops N
                   stop after N memfd-create(2) bogo operations.

            --memfd-zap-pte
                   exercise zapping page-table-entries to try to reproduce a Linux kernel bug that was fixed by commit 5abfd71d936a8aefd9f9ccd299dea7a164a5d455 "mm: don't skip swap entry even if  zap_de‐
                   tails specified". This will slow the stressor down significantly and hence is an opt-in memfd stressor option.

       Memory hotplug stressor (Linux)
            --memhotplug N
                   start N workers that offline and online memory hotplug regions. Linux only and requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.

            --memhotplug-mmap
                   enable random 1 K to 1 MB memory mapping/unmappings before each offline event.

            --memhotplug-ops N
                   stop memhotplug stressors after N memory offline and online bogo operations.

       Memory read/write stressor
            --memrate N
                   start N workers that exercise a buffer with 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16 and 8 bit reads and writes. 1024, 512 and 256 reads and writes are available with compilers that support in‐
                   teger vectors.  x86-64 cpus that support uncached (non-temporal "nt") writes also exercise 128, 64 and 32 writes providing higher write rates than the normal cached writes. x86-64 also
                   exercises  repeated  string  stores  using 64, 32, 16 and 8 bit writes.  CPUs that support prefetching reads also exercise 64 prefetched "pf" reads.  This memory stressor allows one to
                   also specify the maximum read and write rates. The stressors will run at maximum speed if no read or write rates are specified.

            --memrate-bytes N
                   specify the size of the memory buffer being exercised. The default size is 256 MB. One can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or  g,
                   or cache sizes with L1, L2, L3 or LLC (lower level cache size).

            --memrate-flush
                   flush cache between each memory exercising test to remove caching benefits in memory rate metrics.

            --memrate-method
                   specify a memrate stress method, some methods are available to specific architectures or toolchains that support them. Available memrate stress methods are described as follows:

            --memthrash N
                   start N workers that thrash and exercise a 16 MB buffer in various ways to try and trip thermal overrun.  Each stressor will start 1 or more threads.  The number of threads  is  chosen
                   so that there will be at least 1 thread per CPU. Note that the optimal choice for N is a value that divides into the number of CPUs.

            --memthrash-method method
                   specify a memthrash stress method. Available memthrash stress methods are described as follows:

                   select either the libc implementation of mergesort or an unoptimized implementation of mergesort. The default is the libc implementation if it is available.

            --mergesort-ops N
                   stop mergesort stress workers after N bogo mergesorts.

            --mergesort-size N
                   specify number of 32 bit integers to sort, default is 262144 (256 × 1024).

                   set the size of metamix files, the default is 1 MB. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the  suffix  b,
                   k, m or g.

            --metamix-ops N
                   stop the metamix stressor after N bogo metafile operations.

       Resident memory (mincore) stressor
            --mincore N
                   start N workers that walk through all of memory 1 page at a time checking if the page mapped and also is resident in memory using mincore(2). It also maps and unmaps a page to check if
                   the page is mapped or not using mincore(2).

            --mincore-ops N
                   stop after N mincore bogo operations. One mincore bogo op is equivalent to a 300 mincore(2) calls.

            --mincore-random
                   instead  of  walking  through pages sequentially, select pages at random. The chosen address is iterated over by shifting it right one place and checked by mincore until the address is
                   less or equal to the page size.

       Minimum sleep time in nanosleep stressor
            --min-nanosleep N
                   start M workers that exercise nanosecond sleeps using powers of two nanosecond sleep delays. Once all the instances have completed, the minimum, maximum and mean sleep  times  are  re‐
                   ported for the sleep delays across all the min-nanosleep stressor instances.

            --min-nanosleep-ops N
                   stop after N rounds of measurements across all the sleeps are completed.

            --min-nanosleep-max N
                   set the maximum nanosleep delay to use. If this is not a power of two then the previous power of two nanosecond delay time is used, e.g. specifying 10000 will select 8192 nanoseconds.

            --min-nanosleep-sched [ batch | deadline | fifo | idle | other | rr ]
                   select scheduling policy. Note that deadline, fifo and rr require root privilege.

       Misaligned read/write stressor
            --misaligned N
                   start  N workers that perform misaligned read and writes. By default, this will exercise 128 bit misaligned read and writes in 8 × 16 bits, 4 × 32 bits, 2 × 64 bits and 1 × 128 bits at
                   the start of a page boundary, at the end of a page boundary and over a cache boundary. Misaligned read and writes operate at 1 byte offset from the natural alignment of the data  type.
                   On some architectures this can cause SIGBUS, SIGILL or SIGSEGV, these are handled and the misaligned stressor method causing the error is disabled.

            --misaligned-method method
                   Available misaligned stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method        Description

            Note that some of these options (128 bit integer and/or atomic operations) may not be available on some systems.

            --misaligned-ops N
                   stop after N misaligned bogo operation. A misaligned bogo op is equivalent to 65536 × 128 bit reads or writes.

       Mknod/unlink stressor
            --mknod N
                   start N workers that create and remove fifos, empty files and named sockets using mknod(2) and unlink(2).

            --mknod-ops N
                   stop directory thrash workers after N bogo mknod operations.

       Memory mapped pages lock/unlock stressor
            --mlock N
                   start  N  workers that lock and unlock memory mapped pages using mlock(2), munlock(2), mlockall(2) and munlockall(2). This is achieved by the mapping of three contiguous pages and then
                   locking the second page, hence ensuring non-contiguous pages are locked . This is then repeated until the maximum allowed mlocks or a maximum of 262144 mappings are  made.   Next,  all
                   future mappings are mlocked and the worker attempts to map 262144 pages, then all pages are munlocked and the pages are unmapped.

            --mlock-ops N
                   stop after N mlock bogo operations.

       Many child memory mapped page lock/unlock process stressor
            --mlockmany N
                   start  N  workers  that fork off a default of 1024 child processes in total; each child will attempt to anonymously mmap(2) and mlock(2) the maximum allowed mlockable memory size.  The
                   stress test attempts to avoid swapping by tracking low memory and swap allocations (but some swapping may occur). Once either the maximum number of child  process  is  reached  or  all
                   mlockable in-core memory is locked then child processes are killed and the stress test is repeated.

            --mlockmany-ops N
                   stop after N mlockmany (mmap and mlock) operations.

            --mlockmany-procs N
                   set the number of child processes to create per stressor. The default is to start a maximum of 1024 child processes in total across all the stressors. This option allows the setting of
                   N child processes per stressor.

       Memory mapping (mmap/munmap) stressor
            --mmap N
                   start  N  workers  continuously calling mmap(2)/munmap(2).  The initial mapping is a large chunk (size specified by --mmap-bytes) followed by pseudo-random 4 K unmappings, then pseudo-
                   random 4 K mappings, and then linear 4 K unmappings.  Note that this can cause systems to trip the kernel OOM killer on Linux systems if not enough physical  memory  and  swap  is  not
                   available.   The  MAP_POPULATE  option  is  used  to  populate  pages  into  memory on systems that support this.  By default, anonymous mappings are used, however, the --mmap-file and
                   --mmap-async options allow one to perform file based mappings if desired.

                   Note that since stress-ng 0.17.05 the --mmap-madvise, --mmap-mergeable, --mmap-mprotect, --mmap-slow-munmap and --mmap-write-check options should be used to enable the pre-0.17.05 mmap
                   stressor behaviour.

            --mmap-async
                   enable file based memory mapping and use asynchronous msync'ing on each page, see --mmap-file.

            --mmap-bytes N
                   allocate N bytes in total for all the mmap stressor instances, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes,  MBytes  and
                   GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --mmap-file
                   enable file based memory mapping and by default use synchronous msync'ing on each page.

            --mmap-madvise
                   enable randomized madvise(2) settings on pages.

            --mmap-mergeable
                   mark pages as mergeable via madvise(2) where possible.

            --mmap-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --mmap-mmap2
                   use mmap2(2) for 4 K page aligned offsets if mmap2 is available, otherwise fall back to mmap.

            --mmap-mprotect
                   change  protection  settings on each page of memory.  Each time a page or a group of pages are mapped or remapped then this option will make the pages read-only, write-only, exec-only,
                   and read-write.

            --mmap-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --mmap-odirect
                   enable file based memory mapping and use O_DIRECT direct I/O.

            --mmap-ops N
                   stop mmap stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --mmap-osync
                   enable file based memory mapping and used O_SYNC synchronous I/O integrity completion.

            --mmap-slow-munmap
                   enable page-by-page memory unmapping rather than attempting to memory unmap contiguous pages in one large unmapping. This can cause lock contention when running  with  many  concurrent
                   mmap stressors and will slow down the stressor.

            --mmap-stressful
                   enable --mmap-file, --mmap-madvise, --mmap-mergeable, --mmap-mlock, --mmap-mprotect, --mmap-odirect, --mmap-slow-munmap

            --mmap-write-check
                   write  into  each page a unique 64 bit check value for all pages and then read the value for a sanity check. This will force newly memory mapped pages to be faulted-in which slows down
                   mmap bogo-op rate. This can also cause lock contention on page allocation and page unmapping on systems with many CPU threads and with cgroup memory accounting.

       Random memory map/unmap stressor
            --mmapaddr N
                   start N workers that memory map pages at a random memory location that is not already mapped.  On 64 bit machines the random address is randomly chosen 32 bit or 64 bit address. If the
                   mapping works a second page is memory mapped from the first mapped address. The stressor exercises mmap/munmap, mincore and segfault handling.

            --mmapaddr-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --mmapaddr-ops N
                   stop after N random address mmap bogo operations.

       Memory map Copy-on-Write and unmap stressor
            --mmapcow N
                   start N workers that exercise page allocation, modification (forcing copy-on-write) and page unmapping. Regions of memory from 1 page to the maximum mappable size are  allocated.  Each
                   page  in the regions are then modified, cache flushed (where possible) and unmapped. This stressor produces a high page fault rate. For each region mapped there are 6 different random‐
                   ized strategies taken to exercise each page:

                   Sequential page modify and unmap
                   Sequential page modify and unmap (even pages, then odd pages)
                   Prime size page strides, page modify and unmap
                   Reverse sequential page modify and unmap
                   Reverse sequential page modify and unmap (even pages, then odd pages)
                   Single random page modify and unmap all pages
                   Randomly selected page modify and modify

            --mmapcow-fork
                   fork child process to exercise pages in parallel with parent to exercice page handling harder.

            --mmapcow-free
                   after each page is modified and before each page is unmapped use madvise(2) MADV_FREE (if it is available) to indicate the page is free

            --mmapcow-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) each modified page, this can increase the number of page faults. Only available with the mlock2 system call.

            --mmapcow-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --mmapcow-ops N
                   stop after N pages are modified  and unmapped

       Forked memory map stressor
            --mmapfork N
                   start N workers that each fork off 32 child processes, each of which tries to allocate some of the free memory left in the system  (and  trying  to  avoid  any  swapping).   The  child
                   processes  then hint that the allocation will be needed with madvise(2) and then memset it to zero and hint that it is no longer needed with madvise before exiting.  This produces sig‐
                   nificant amounts of VM activity, a lot of cache misses and with minimal swapping.

            --mmapfork-bytes N
                   specify the size of memory mapped fork region size. One can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --mmapfork-ops N
                   stop after N mmapfork bogo operations.

       Memory map files stressor
            --mmapfiles N
                   start N workers that attempt to memory map and then unmap up to 512 × 1024 files into memory. The stressor will traverse /lib, /lib32, /lib64, /boot, /bin,  /etc,  /sbin,  /usr,  /var,
                   /sys and /proc and attempt to memory map files in these directories. Note that mapping bogo-ops rate will depend on the speed of access to files on these file systems.

            --mmapfiles-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --mmapfiles-ops N
                   stop after N memory map/unmap operations.

            --mmapfiles-populate
                   The  default is to perform a memory mapping and not fault any pages into physical memory. This option uses MAP_POPULATE when available and will also read the first byte in each page to
                   ensure pages are faulted into memory to force memory population from file.

            --mmapfiles-shared
                   The default is for private memory mapped files, however, with this option will use shared memory mappings.

       Fixed address memory map stressor
            --mmapfixed N
                   start N workers that perform fixed address allocations from the top virtual address down to 128 K.  The allocated sizes are from 1 page to 8 pages and various  random  mmap  flags  are
                   used  MAP_SHARED/MAP_PRIVATE,  MAP_LOCKED, MAP_NORESERVE, MAP_POPULATE. If successfully map'd then the allocation is remap'd first to a large range of addresses based on a random start
                   and finally an address that is several pages higher in memory. Mappings and remappings are madvised with random madvise options to further exercise the mappings.

            --mmapfixed-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --mmapfixed-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --mmapfixed-ops N
                   stop after N mmapfixed memory mapping bogo operations.

       Huge page memory mapping stressor
            --mmaphuge N
                   start N workers that attempt to mmap a set of huge pages and large huge page sized mappings. Successful mappings are madvised with MADV_NOHUGEPAGE and MADV_HUGEPAGE settings  and  then
                   1/64th  of the normal small page size pages are touched. Finally, an attempt to unmap a small page size page at the end of the mapping is made (these may fail on huge pages) before the
                   set of pages are unmapped. By default 8192 mappings are attempted per round of mappings or until swapping is detected.

            --mmaphuge-file
                   attempt to mmap on a 16 MB temporary file and random 4 K offsets. If this fails, anonymous mappings are used instead.

            --mmaphuge-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd huge pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --mmaphuge-mmaps N
                   set the number of huge page mappings to attempt in each round of mappings. The default is 8192 mappings.

            --mmaphuge-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --mmaphuge-ops N
                   stop after N mmaphuge bogo operations

       Maximum memory mapping per process stressor
            --mmapmany N
                   start N workers that attempt to create the maximum allowed per-process memory mappings. This is achieved by mapping 3 contiguous pages and then unmapping the middle page  hence  split‐
                   ting the mapping into two. This is then repeated until the maximum allowed mappings or a maximum of 262144 mappings are made.

            --mmapmany-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd huge pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --mmapmany-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --mmapmany-ops N
                   stop after N mmapmany bogo operations

       Memory map random mapping operations
            --mmaprandom N
                   start  N  workers that exercise a random mix of memory map related system calls on randonmly sized mappings. The mappings are either anonymous mapped or file mapped (on a small file or
                   on a memfd file where available). This exercises mmap(2) (random options and flags), munmap(2), mlock(2), munlock(2), madvise(2),  posix_madvise(3),  mincore(2),  mremap(2),  msync(2),
                   mprotect(2),  remap_file_pages(2), memory read, memory write and cache flushing. Where possible, randomized options are used to generate a mix of mostly valid (and some invalid) memory
                   mapping operations. Metrics are reported for all successfull system calls and memory operations.

            --mmaprandom-ops N
                   stop after N random memory mapping bogo-operations. Generally, 1 bogo-op is one memory related system call (except for read/write/cache operations).

            --mmaprandom-mappings N
                   select maximum number of memory mappings, the default is 1024, range 1 to 65536.

            --mmaprandom-maxpages N
                   select maxiumum number of pages to be memory mapped, the default is 8, range 2 to 1024. The pages mapped are randomly chosen from 1 to maxpages.

            --mmaprandom-numa
                   assign randomly chosen memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes.  This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

       Memory map torture stressor
            --mmaptorture N
                   start N workers that exercise memory mapping operations on a shared file.  Mappings of various random sizes are tortured with calls to  madvise(2),  mremap(2),  mprotect(2),  msync(2),
                   mlock(2),  munlock(2),  mseal(2)  and mincore(2) while the underlying file is modified by writes, truncation and hole punching. Mapped data is read and written and sync'd back to file.
                   For NUMA systems, pages are randomly placed across NUMA nodes. All this activity causes cache misses, exercises the TLB and causes IPI interrupts between CPUs.

            --mmaptorture-bytes N
                   allocate N bytes in total for all the mmaptorture stressor instances, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size as % of total available memory  or  in  units  of  Bytes,  KBytes,
                   MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --mmaptorture-msync N
                   memory mapped pages are msync'd various times per bogo-operation, this option specifies the percentage amount of the pages per msync operation are msync'd. The default is 10%. Specify‐
                   ing zero will disabled msync'ing.

            --mmaptorture-ops N
                   stop after N iterations of memory mapping torture operations.

       Kernel module loading stressor (Linux)
            --module N
                   start  N  workers that use finit_module() to load the module specified or the hello test module, if is available. There are different ways to test loading modules. Using modprobe calls
                   in a loop, using the kernel kernel module autoloader, and this stress-ng module stressor. To stress tests modprobe we can simply run the userspace modprobe program in a loop. To stress
                   test the kernel module autoloader we can stress tests using the upstream kernel tools/testing/selftests/kmod/kmod.sh. This ends up calling modprobe in the end, and it has its own  caps
                   built-in  to  self protect the kernel from too many requests at the same time. The userspace modprobe call will also prevent calls if the same module exists already. The stress-ng mod‐
                   ules stressor is designed to help stress test the finit_module() system call even if the module is already loaded, testing races that are otherwise hard to reproduce.

            --module-name NAME
                   NAME of the module to use, for example: test_module, xfs, ext4. By default test_module is used so CONFIG_TEST_LKM must be enabled in the kernel.  The module dependencies must be loaded
                   prior to running these stressor tests, as this stresses running finit_module() not using modprobe.

            --module-no-modver
                   ignore module modversions when using finit_module().

            --module-no-vermag
                   ignore module versions when using finit_module().

            --module-no-unload
                   do not unload the module right after loading it with finit_module().

            --module-ops N
                   stop after N module load/unload cycles

       Monte Carlo computations of π and e and various integrals
            --monte-carlo N
                   start N stressors that compute π and e (Euler's number) using Monte Carlo computational experiments with various random number generators.

            --monte-carlo-method [ all | e | exp | pi | sin | sqrt | squircle ]
                   specify the computation to perform, options are as follows:

                   Method    Description
                   all       use all monte carlo computation methods

            --mpfr-precision N
                   specify the precision in binary digits of the floating point operations. The default is 1000 bits, the allowed range is 32 to 1000000 (very slow).

       Memory protection stressor
            --mprotect N
                   start N workers that exercise changing page protection settings and access memory after each change. 8 processes per worker contend with each other changing page protection settings on
                   a shared memory region of just a few pages to cause TLB flushes. A read and write to the pages can cause segmentation faults and these are handled by the stressor. All combinations  of
                   page protection settings are exercised including invalid combinations.

            --mprotect-ops N
                   stop after N mprotect calls.

       POSIX message queue stressor (Linux)

            --mq-ops N
                   stop after N bogo POSIX message send operations completed.

            --mq-size N
                   specify size of POSIX message queue. The default size is 10 messages and most Linux systems this is the maximum allowed size for normal users. If the given size is greater than the al‐
                   lowed message queue size then a warning is issued and the maximum allowed size is used instead.

       Memory remap stressor (Linux)
            --mremap N
                   start N workers continuously calling mmap(2), mremap(2) and munmap(2).  The initial anonymous mapping is a large chunk (size specified by --mremap-bytes) and then iteratively halved in
                   size by remapping all the way down to a page size and then back up to the original size.  This worker is only available for Linux.

            --mremap-bytes N
                   initially allocate N bytes per remap stress worker, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --mremap-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) remap'd pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --mreamp-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --mremap-ops N
                   stop mremap stress workers after N bogo operations.

       Memory Sealing
            --mseal N
                   start N memory sealing stressors that exercise madvise(2), mremap(2), mprotect(2) and mseal(2) operations on two pages of of memory mapped anonymous private memory. Linux 6.10+ kernels
                   only.

            --mseal-ops N
                   stop after N msealed memory operations.

       System V message IPC stressor
            --msg N
                   start N sender and receiver processes that continually send and receive messages using System V message IPC.

            --msg-bytes N
                   specify the size of the message being sent and received. Range 4 to 8192 bytes, default is 4 bytes.

            --msg-ops N
                   stop after N bogo message send operations completed.

            --msg-types N
                   select the quality of message types (mtype) to use. By default, msgsnd sends messages with a mtype of 1, this option allows one to send messages types in the range 1..N to exercise the
                   message queue receive ordering. This will also impact throughput performance.

       Synchronize file with memory map (msync) stressor
            --msync N
                   start  N  stressors  that  msync data from a file backed memory mapping from memory back to the file and msync modified data from the file back to the mapped memory. This exercises the
                   msync(2) MS_SYNC and MS_INVALIDATE sync operations.

            --msync-bytes N
                   allocate N bytes for the memory mapped file, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and  GBytes  using  the
                   suffix b, k, m or g.

            --msync-ops N
                   stop after N msync bogo operations completed.

       Synchronize file with memory map (msync) coherency stressor
            --msyncmany N
                   start N stressors that memory map up to 32768 pages on the same page of a temporary file, change the first 32 bits in a page and msync the data back to the file.  The other 32767 pages
                   are examined to see if the 32 bit check value is msync'd back to these pages.

            --msyncmany-ops N
                   stop after N msync calls in the msyncmany stressors are completed.

       ISO C mtx (mutex) stressor
            --mtx N
                   start N stressors that exercise ISO C mutex locking and unlocking.

            --mtx-ops N
                   stop after N bogo mutex lock/unlock operations.

            --mtx-procs N
                   By default 2 threads are used for locking/unlocking on a single mutex. This option allows the default to be changed to 2 to 64 concurrent threads.

       Unmapping shared non-executable memory stressor (Linux)
            --munmap N
                   start  N  stressors  that exercise unmapping of shared non-executable mapped regions of child processes (Linux only). The unmappings map shared memory regions page by page with a prime
                   sized stride that creates many temporary mapping holes.  One the unmappings are complete the child will exit and a new one is started.  Note that this may trigger  segmentation  faults
                   in the child process, these are handled where possible by forcing the child process to call _exit(2).

            --munmap-ops N
                   stop after N page unmappings.

       Pthread mutex stressor
            --mutex N
                   start N stressors that exercise pthread mutex locking and unlocking. If run with enough privilege then the FIFO scheduler is used and a random priority between 0 and 80% of the maximum
                   FIFO  priority  level  is selected for the locking operation.  The minimum FIFO priority level is selected for the critical mutex section and unlocking operation to exercise random in‐
                   verted priority scheduling.

            --mutex-affinity
                   enable random CPU affinity changing between mutex lock and unlock.

            --mutex-ops N
                   stop after N bogo mutex lock/unlock operations.

            --mutex-procs N
                   By default 2 threads are used for locking/unlocking on a single mutex. This option allows the default to be changed to 2 to 64 concurrent threads.

       High resolution and scheduler stressor via nanosleep calls
            --nanosleep N
                   start N workers that each run pthreads that call nanosleep(2) with random delays from 1 to 2↑18 nanoseconds. This should exercise the high resolution timers and scheduler.

            --nanosleep-method [ all | cstate | random | ns | us | ms ]
                   select the nanosleep sleep duration method.  By default, cstate residency durations (if they exist) and random durations are used.  This option allows one to select one  of  the  three
                   methods:

                   Method  Description
                   all     use cstate and random nanosecond durations.
                   cstate  use cstate nanosecond durations. It is recommended to also use --nanosleep-threads 1 to exercise less conconcurrent nanosleeps to allow CPUs to drop into deep C states.
                   random  use random nanosecond durations between 1 and 2↑18 nanoseconds.
                   ns      use 1ns (nanosecond) nanosleeps
                   us      use 1μs (microsecond) nanosleeps
                   ms      use 1ms (millisecond) nanosleeps

            --nanosleep-ops N
                   stop the nanosleep stressor after N bogo nanosleep operations.

            --nanosleep-threads N
                   specify the number of concurrent pthreads to run per stressor. The default is 8 and the allowed range is 1 to 1024.

       Network device ioctl stressor
            --netdev N
                   start  N  workers  that  exercise  various  netdevice  ioctl(2)  commands  across  all the available network devices. The ioctls exercised by this stressor are as follows: SIOCGIFCONF,
                   SIOCGIFINDEX, SIOCGIFNAME, SIOCGIFFLAGS, SIOCGIFADDR, SIOCGIFNETMASK, SIOCGIFMETRIC, SIOCGIFMTU, SIOCGIFHWADDR, SIOCGIFMAP and SIOCGIFTXQLEN. See netdevice(7) for more details of these
                   ioctl commands.

            --netdev-ops N
                   stop after N netdev bogo operations completed.

       Netlink proc stressor (Linux)
            --netlink-proc N
                   start N workers that spawn child processes and monitor fork/exec/exit process events via the proc netlink connector. Each event received is counted as a bogo op. This stressor can only
                   be run on Linux and requires CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.

            --netlink-proc-ops N
                   stop the proc netlink connector stressors after N bogo ops.

       Netlink task stressor (Linux)
            --netlink-task N
                   start N workers that collect task statistics via the netlink taskstats interface.  This stressor can only be run on Linux and requires CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.

            --netlink-task-ops N
                   stop the taskstats netlink connector stressors after N bogo ops.

       Nice stressor
            --nice N
                   start N cpu consuming workers that exercise the available nice levels. Each iteration forks off a child process that runs through the all the nice levels running a busy  loop  for  0.1
                   seconds per level and then exits.

            --nice-ops N
                   stop after N nice bogo nice loops

       NO-OP CPU instruction stressor
            --nop N
                   start N workers that consume cpu cycles issuing no-op instructions. This stressor is available if the assembler supports the "nop" instruction.

            --nop-instr INSTR
                   use  alternative nop instruction INSTR. For x86 CPUs INSTR can be one of nop, pause, nop2 (2 byte nop) through to nop15 (15 byte nop) and fnop. For ARM CPUs, INSTR can be one of nop or
                   yield. For PPC64 CPUs, INSTR can be one of nop, mdoio, mdoom or yield. For S390 CPUs, INSTR can be one of nop or nopr. For other processors, INSTR is only nop. The random INSTR  option
                   selects a random mix of the available nop instructions. If the chosen INSTR generates an SIGILL signal, then the stressor falls back to the vanilla nop instruction.

            --nop-ops N
                   stop nop workers after N no-op bogo operations. Each bogo-operation is equivalent to 256 loops of 256 no-op instructions.

       /dev/null stressor
            --null N
                   start N workers that exercise /dev/null with write(2), lseek(2), ioctl(2), fcntl(2), fallocate(2) and fdatasync(2) calls. For just /dev/null write benchmarking use the --null-write op‐
                   tion.

            --null-ops N
                   stop null stress workers after N /dev/null bogo operations.

            --null-write
                   just write to /dev/null with 4 K writes with no additional exercising on /dev/null.

       Migrate memory pages over NUMA nodes stressor
            --numa N
                   start  N  workers  that  migrate  stressors  and  a  4  MB  memory mapped buffer around all the available NUMA nodes.  This uses migrate_pages(2) to move the stressors and mbind(2) and
                   move_pages(2) to move the pages of the mapped buffer. After each move, the buffer is written to force activity over the bus which results cache misses.  This  test  will  only  run  on
                   hardware with NUMA enabled.

            --numa-bytes N
                   specify  the  total  number  bytes  to be exercised by all the workers, the given size is divided by the number of workers and rounded to the nearest page size. The default is 4 MB per
                   worker. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --numa-ops N
                   stop NUMA stress workers after N bogo NUMA operations.

            --numa-shuffle-addr
                   shuffle page order for the address list when calling move_pages(2)

            --numa-shuffle-node
                   shuffle node order for the address list when calling move_pages(2)

       Large Pipe stressor
            --oom-pipe N
                   start N workers that create as many pipes as allowed and exercise expanding and shrinking the pipes from the largest pipe size down to a page size. Data is written into the  pipes  and
                   read  out again to fill the pipe buffers. With the --aggressive mode enabled the data is not read out when the pipes are shrunk, causing the kernel to OOM processes aggressively.  Run‐
                   ning many instances of this stressor will force kernel to OOM processes due to the many large pipe buffer allocations.

            --oom-pipe-ops N
                   stop after N bogo pipe expand/shrink operations.

       Illegal instructions stressors
            --opcode N
                   start N workers that fork off children that execute randomly generated executable code.  This will generate issues such as illegal instructions, bus errors, segmentation faults, traps,
                   floating point errors that are handled gracefully by the stressor.

            --opcode-method [ inc | mixed | random | text ]
                   select the opcode generation method.  By default, random bytes are used to generate the executable code. This option allows one to select one of the three methods:

                   Method  Description
                   inc     use incrementing 32 bit opcode patterns from 0x00000000 to 0xfffffff inclusive.
                   mixed   use a mix of incrementing 32 bit opcode patterns and random 32 bit opcode patterns that are also inverted, encoded with gray encoding and bit reversed.
                   random  generate opcodes using random bytes from a mwc random generator.
                   text    copies random chunks of code from the stress-ng text segment and randomly flips single bits in a random choice of 1/8th of the code.

            --opcode-ops N
                   stop after N attempts to execute illegal code.

       Opening file (open) stressor
            -o N, --open N
                   start N workers that perform open(2) and then close(2) operations on /dev/zero. The maximum opens at one time is system defined, so the test will run up to this maximum, or 65536  open
                   file descriptors, which ever comes first.

            --open-fd
                   run a child process that scans /proc/$PID/fd and attempts to open the files that the stressor has opened. This exercises racing open/close operations on the proc interface.

            --open-max N
                   try  to  open  a maximum of N files (or up to the maximum per-process open file system limit). The value can be the number of files or a percentage of the maximum per-process open file
                   system limit.

            --open-ops N
                   stop the open stress workers after N bogo open operations.

       Page table and TLB stressor
            --pagemove N
                   start N workers that mmap a memory region (default 4 MB) and then shuffle pages to the virtual address of the previous page. Each page shuffle uses 3 mremap operations to move a  page.
                   This exercises page tables and Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) flushing.

            --pagemove-bytes
                   specify  the  size of the memory mapped region to be exercised. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix
                   b, k, m or g.

            --pagemove-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd and mremap'd pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --pagemove-numa
                   assign memory mapped pages to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --pagemove-ops N
                   stop after N pagemove shuffling operations, where suffling all the pages in the mmap'd region is equivalent to 1 bogo-operation.

       Memory page swapping stressor
            --pageswap N
                   start N workers that exercise page swap in and swap out. Pages are allocated and paged out using madvise(2) MADV_PAGEOUT. One the maximum per process number of  mmaps  are  reached  or
                   65536 pages are allocated the pages are read to page them back in and unmapped in reverse mapping order.

            --pageswap-ops N
                   stop after N page allocation bogo operations.

       PCI sysfs stressor (Linux)
            --pci N
                   exercise  PCI  sysfs  by  running N workers that read data (and mmap/unmap PCI config or PCI resource files). Linux only. Running as root will allow config and resource mmappings to be
                   read and exercises PCI I/O mapping.

            --pci-dev xxxx:xx:xx.x
                   specify a PCI device to exercise rather than exercise all PCI devices. The device is specified using the PCI device name xxxx:xx:xx.x where x is a hexadecimal digit.

            --pci-ops N
                   stop pci stress workers after N PCI subdirectory exercising operations.

            --pci-ops-rate N
                   specify the PCI bogo-ops per second rate. This is useful for PCI bandwidth limiting and on x86 systems this may reduce uncore transactions.

       Personality stressor
            --personality N
                   start N workers that attempt to set personality and get all the available personality types (process execution domain types) via the personality(2) system call. (Linux only).

            --personality-ops N
                   stop personality stress workers after N bogo personality operations.

       Mutex using Peterson algorithm stressor
            --peterson N
                   start N workers that exercises mutex exclusion between two processes using shared memory with the Peterson Algorithm. Where possible this uses memory fencing and falls  back  to  using
                   GCC __sync_synchronize if they are not available. The stressors contain simple mutex and memory coherency sanity checks.

            --peterson-ops N
                   stop peterson workers after N mutex operations.

       Page mmap stressor
            --physpage N
                   start  N  workers that use /proc/self/pagemap and /proc/kpagecount to determine the physical page and page count of a virtual mapped page and a page that is shared among all the stres‐
                   sors. Linux only and requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.

            --physpage-mtrr
                   enable setting various memory type rage register (MTRR) types on physical pages (Linux and x86 only).

            --physpage-ops N
                   stop physpage stress workers after N bogo physical address lookups.

       Physical page mmap stressor (using /dev/mem)
            --physmmap N
                   start N workers that try to mmap available System RAM (as specified by /proc/iomem) using /dev/mem and randomized private or shared pages. This requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN  capabilities  to
                   fully read /proc/iomem and mmap onto /dev/mem. Note systems may be fully locked down and mmapping onto /dev/mem is impossible.

            --physmmap-ops N
                   stop physmmap stress workers after N bogo mmap attempts.

            --physmmap-read
                   perform 64 bit reads of all the data in each mmap'd page.

       Process signals (pidfd_send_signal) stressor
            --pidfd N
                   start N workers that exercise signal sending via the pidfd_send_signal(2) system call.  This stressor creates child processes and checks if they exist and can be stopped, restarted and
                   killed using the pidfd_send_signal(2) system call.

            --pidfd-ops N
                   stop pidfd stress workers after N child processes have been created, tested and killed with pidfd_send_signal.

       Localhost ICMP (ping) stressor
            --ping-sock N
                   start  N  workers that send small randomized ICMP messages to the localhost across a range of ports (1024..65535) using a "ping" socket with an AF_INET domain, a SOCK_DGRAM socket type
                   and an IPPROTO_ICMP protocol.

            --ping-sock-ops N
                   stop the ping-sock stress workers after N ICMP messages are sent.

       Large pipe stressor
            -p N, --pipe N
                   start N workers that perform large pipe writes and reads to exercise pipe I/O.  This exercises memory write and reads as well as context switching.  Each worker has  two  processes,  a
                   reader and a writer.

            --pipe-data-size N
                   specifies  the  size  in bytes of each write to the pipe (range from 4 bytes to 4096 bytes). Setting a small data size will cause more writes to be buffered in the pipe, hence reducing
                   the context switch rate between the pipe writer and pipe reader processes. Default size is the page size.

            --pipe-ops N
                   stop pipe stress workers after N bogo pipe write operations.

            --pipe-vmsplice
                   use vmsplice(2) to splice data pages to/from pipe. Requires pipe packet mode using O_DIRECT and buffer twice the size of the pipe to ensure verification data sequences.

            --pipe-size N
                   specifies the size of the pipe in bytes (for systems that support the F_SETPIPE_SZ fcntl() command). Setting a small pipe size will cause the pipe to fill and  block  more  frequently,
                   hence increasing the context switch rate between the pipe writer and the pipe reader processes. As of version 0.15.11 the default size is 4096 bytes.

       Shared pipe stressor
            --pipeherd N
                   start  N  workers that pass a 64 bit token counter to/from 100 child processes over a shared pipe. This forces a high context switch rate and can trigger a "thundering herd" of wakeups
                   on processes that are blocked on pipe waits.

            --pipeherd-ops N
                   stop pipe stress workers after N bogo pipe write operations.

            --pipeherd-yield
                   force a scheduling yield after each write, this increases the context switch rate.

       Memory protection key mechanism stressor (Linux)
            --pkey N
                   start N workers that change memory protection using a protection key pkey(2) and the pkey_mprotect(2) call (Linux only). This will try to allocate a pkey and use this for the page pro‐
                   tection, however, if this fails then the special pkey -1 will be  used  (and  the  kernel  will  use  the  normal  mprotect  mechanism  instead).   Various  page  protection  mixes  of
                   read/write/exec/none will be cycled through on randomly chosen pre-allocated pages.

            --pkey-ops N
                   stop after N pkey_mprotect page protection cycles.

       Stress-ng plugin stressor
            --plugin N
                   start  N  workers  that  run user provided stressor functions loaded from a shared library. The shared library can contain one or more stressor functions prefixed with stress_ in their
                   name. By default the plugin stressor will find all functions prefixed with stress_ in their name and exercise these one by one in a round-robin loop, but a specific stressor can be se‐
                   lected using the --plugin-method option.  The stressor function takes no parameters and returns 0 for success and non-zero for failure (and will terminate the  plugin  stressor).  Each
                   time a stressor function is executed the bogo-op counter is incremented by one. The following example performs 10000 nop instructions per bogo-op:

                      int stress_example(void)
                      {
                              int i;

                              for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                                      __asm__ __volatile__("nop");
                              }
                              return 0;  /* Success */
                      }

                   and compile the source into a shared library as, for example:

                      gcc -fpic -shared -o example.so example.c

                   and run as using:

                      stress-ng --plugin 1 --plugin-so ./example.so

            --plugin-method function
                   run a specific stressor function, specify the name without the leading stress_ prefix.

            --plugin-ops N
                   stop after N iterations of the user provided stressor function(s).

            --plugin-so name
                   specify the shared library containing the user provided stressor function(s).

       Polling stressor
            -P N, --poll N
                   start N workers that perform zero timeout polling via the poll(2), ppoll(2), select(2), pselect(2) and sleep(3) calls. This wastes system and user time doing nothing.

            --poll-fds N
                   specify  the  number  of  file descriptors to poll/ppoll/select/pselect on.  The maximum number for select/pselect is limited by FD_SETSIZE and the upper maximum is also limited by the
                   maximum number of pipe open descriptors allowed.

            --poll-ops N
                   stop poll stress workers after N bogo poll operations.

            --poll-random-us N
                   use a random timeout of N microseconds for ppoll(2) and pselect(2) calls instead of the default of 20000 microseconds.

       Power maths functions
            --powmath N
                   start N workers that exercise various libm power functions with input values 0 to 1 in steps of 0.001; the results are sanity checked to ensure no variation occurs after each round  of
                   10000 computations.

            --powmath-ops N
                   stop after N power function bogo-operation loops.

            --powmath-method method
                   specify a power function to exercise. Available power function stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method  Description
                   all     iterate over all the below power functions methods
                   cpow    complex double power function
                   cpowf   complex float power function
                   cpowl   complex long double power function
                   csqrt   complex double square root function (1/2 power)
                   csqrtf  complex float square root function (1/2 power)
                   csqrtl  complex long double square root function (1/2 power)
                   cbrt    double cube root function (1/3 power)
                   cbrtf   float cube root function (1/3 power)
                   cbrtl   long double cube root function (1/3 power)
                   hypot   double Euclidean distance function (hypotenuse)
                   hypotf  float Euclidean distance function (hypotenuse)
                   hypotl  long double Euclidean distance function (hypotenuse)
                   pow     double power function
                   powf    float power function
                   powl    long double power function
                   sqrt    double square root function (1/2 power)
                   sqrtf   float square root function (1/2 power)
                   sqrtl   long double square root function (1/2 power)

       Prctl stressor
            --prctl N
                   start  N  workers that exercise the majority of the prctl(2) system call options. Each batch of prctl calls is performed inside a new child process to ensure the limit of prctl is con‐
                   tained inside a new process every time.  Some prctl options are architecture specific, however, this stressor will exercise these even if they are not implemented.

            --prctl-ops N
                   stop prctl workers after N batches of prctl calls

       L3 cache prefetching stressor
            --prefetch N
                   start N workers that benchmark prefetch and non-prefetch reads of a L3 cache sized buffer. The buffer is read with loops of 8 × 64 bit reads per iteration. In the prefetch cases,  data
                   is prefetched ahead of the current read position by various sized offsets, from 64 bytes to 8 K to find the best memory read throughput. The stressor reports the non-prefetch read rate
                   and the best prefetched read rate. It also reports the prefetch offset and an estimate of the amount of time between the prefetch issue and the actual memory read operation. These sta‐
                   tistics will vary from run-to-run due to system noise and CPU frequency scaling.

            --prefetch-l3-size N
                   specify the size of the l3 cache

            --prefetch-method N
                   select the prefetching method. Available methods are:

                   Method          Description
                   builtin         Use the __builtin_prefetch(3) function for prefetching. This is the default.

                   prefetcht2      Use the x86 prefetcht2 instruction (temporal data with respect to second level cache) to prefetch data into level 2 cache and higher (x86 only).
                   prefetchnta     Use the x86 prefetchnta instruction (non-temporal data with respect to all cache levels) into a location close to the processor, minimizing cache pollution (x86 only).
                   prfm_pldl1keep  Use the aarch64 prfm instruction with pld1keep operation (retained or temporal prefetch, allocated in the cache normally) to prefetch data into level 1 of the cache hi‐
                                   erarchy (aarch64 only).
                   prfm_pldl2keep  Use the aarch64 prfm instruction with pld1keep operation (retained or temporal prefetch, allocated in the cache normally) to prefetch data into level 2 of the cache hi‐

                                   cache hierarchy (aarch64 only).

            --prefetch-ops N
                   stop prefetch stressors after N benchmark operations

       Search for prime numbers using large integers
            --prime N
                   start N workers that find prime numbers using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library for large integers. The GMP mpz_nextprime function is used to find  primes  and  it  uses  a
                   probabilistic  algorithm  to  identify primes, but there is a extremely small chance that the values found are non-prime. The search becomes computationally more expensive over time to
                   find larger and larger primes, hence the bogo-op rate will reduce over time.

            --prime-method [ factorial | inc | pwr2 | pwr10 ]
                   selects the method of calculating the next value from where to start searching primes and hence how large the primes get. The default is inc, the methods to start searching for  primes
                   are described as follows.

                   Method     Description
                   factorial  start of search based on factorial expansion. This grows rapidly.
                   inc        start of search based on increments by 2. This grows very slowly.
                   pwr2       start of search based on powers of 2. Grows relatively quickly.
                   pwr10      start of search based on powers of 10. Grows by 1 digit per iteration and grows quickly.

            --prime-ops N
                   stop after finding N prime numbers.

            --prime-progress
                   show the number of primes found and length of largest prime found. This is displayed either every 60 seconds or more than 60 seconds if it takes longer to find the next prime.

            --prime-start N
                   start the prime search from value N. The value may be expressed as an integer value or as a floating point value (e.g. 1e200 to express a very large starting value).

       Priority inversion stressor
            --prio-inv N
                   start  N workers that exercise mutex lock priority inversion scheduling.  Three child process run with low, medium and high FIFO scheduling priorities.  The processes with low and high
                   priorities share a mutex lock that both try to lock and unlock, aiming to make the low priority process block the high priority process. Meanwhile the middle priority process will  run
                   in priority over the low priority process, causing the high priority process to become unrunnable.

            --prio-inv-ops N
                   stop after N bogo lock/unlock operations.

            --prio-inv-type [ inherit | none | protect ]
                   select the mutex lock priority inversion type, described as follows:

                   Type     Description
                   inherit  The priority of the process owning the mutex lock is run with highest priority of any other process waiting on the lock to avoid priority inversion deadlock.
                   none     The  priority  of  the process owning the mutex lock is not affected by its mutex ownership. This may lead to the high priority process to become unrunnable on a single thread
                            system.
                   protect  The priority of the process owning the mutex lock is given the priority of the mutex (in this stress test case, the maximum priority) during the lock ownership.

            --prio-inv-policy [ batch | idle | fifo | other | rr ]
                   select the scheduling policy. "Normal" policies (batch, idle and other) can be selected as an unprivileged user, however "Real Time" policies (fifo and rr) can only  be  selected  with
                   the appropriate privilege.  By default "fifo" is selected but it will fall back to "other" for unprivileged users.

       Privileged CPU instructions stressor
            --priv-instr N
                   start  N  workers that exercise various architecture specific privileged instructions that cannot be executed by userspace programs. These instructions will be trapped and processed by
                   SIGSEGV or SIGILL signal handlers.

            --priv-instr-ops N
                   stop priv-instr stressors after N rounds of executing privileged instructions.

       /proc stressor
            --procfs N
                   start N workers that read files from /proc and recursively read files from /proc/self (Linux only).

            --procfs-ops N
                   stop procfs reading after N bogo read operations. Note, since the number of entries may vary between kernels, this bogo ops metric is probably very misleading.

       pwrite/pread lseek I/O stressor
            --pseek N
                   start N workers that exercise pwrite(2) and pread(2) with lseek(2) positioning tests.  Each worker has 4 sub-processes that perform repeated pwrite and pread operations using the  same
                   shared  file descriptor. Two of the processes are started using pthreads (if available), another two processes are started with fork(2). Using pwrite and pread should perform I/O with‐
                   out altering the shared file descriptor file offset. The main worker process performs I/O using lseek(2)/write(2) and lseek(2)/read(2) calls that change the  file  offset;  lseeks  are
                   sanity checked to see if they are being altered by pwrite and pread calls.

            --pseek-io-size N
                   specify size of each write/read I/O operation in bytes. Size can be from 1 byte to 1 MB.

            --pseek-ops N
                   stop after N writes by the main worker process.

            --pseek-rand
                   normally each sub-process writes to a fix file offset, using this option will randomize the offset on each write/read cycle.

       Pthread stressor
            --pthread N
                   start  N  workers  that  iteratively  creates  and terminates multiple pthreads (the default is 1024 pthreads per worker). In each iteration, each newly created pthread waits until the
                   worker has created all the pthreads and then they all terminate together.

            --pthread-max N
                   create N pthreads per worker. If the product of the number of pthreads by the number of workers is greater than the soft limit of allowed pthreads then the maximum is re-adjusted  down
                   to the maximum allowed.

            --pthread-ops N
                   stop pthread workers after N bogo pthread create operations.

       Ptrace stressor
            --ptrace N
                   start N workers that fork and trace system calls of a child process using ptrace(2).

            --ptrace-ops N
                   stop ptracer workers after N bogo system calls are traced.

       Pointer Chasing stressor
            --ptr-chase N
                   start N workers that chase memory pointers around page sized nodes of pointers.  By default each stressor instance allocates 4096 pages of nodes, each node is an array of pointers that
                   are  randomly  set  to  point to other node pages.  The stressors follow randomly chosen pointers from each node, chasing around the entire node space. This exercises pointer fetching,
                   pointer dereferencing and is a cache-read exercising stressor. The nodes are allocated with 50% of pages from the heap and 50% from mmap'd memory.

            --ptr-chase-ops N
                   stop after N pointer chases

            --ptr-chase-pages N

            --pty-max N
                   try to open a maximum of N pseudoterminals, the default is 65536. The allowed range of this setting is 8..65536.

            --pty-ops N
                   stop pty workers after N pty bogo operations.

       Qsort stressor
            -Q, --qsort N
                   start N workers that sort 32 bit integers using qsort(3).

            --qsort-method [ qsort-libc | qsort-bm ]
                   select either the libc implementation of qsort or the J. L. Bentley and M. D. McIlroy implementation of qsort. The default is the libc implementation.

            --qsort-ops N
                   stop qsort stress workers after N bogo qsorts.

            --qsort-size N
                   specify number of 32 bit integers to sort, default is 262144 (256 × 1024).

       Quota stressor
            --quota N
                   start N workers that exercise the Q_GETQUOTA, Q_GETFMT, Q_GETINFO, Q_GETSTATS and Q_SYNC quotactl(2)  commands  on  all  the  available  mounted  block  based  file  systems.  Requires
                   CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to run.

            --quota-ops N
                   stop quota stress workers after N bogo quotactl operations.

       Process scheduler stressor
            --race-sched N
                   start  N  workers  that  exercise  rapid changing CPU affinity child processes both from the controlling stressor and by the child processes. Child processes are created and terminated
                   rapidly with the aim to create race conditions where affinity changing occurs during process run states.

            --race-sched-method [ all | next | prev | rand | randinc | syncnext | syncprev ]
                   Select the method moving a process to a specific CPU.  Available methods are described as follows:

                   all       iterate over all the race-sched methods as listed below:
                   next      move a process to the next CPU, wrap around to zero when maximum CPU is reached.
                   prev      move a process to the previous CPU, wrap around to the maximum CPU when the first CPU is reached.
                   rand      move a process to any randomly chosen CPU.
                   randinc   move a process to the current CPU + a randomly chosen value 1..4, modulo the number of CPUs.
                   syncnext  move synchronously all the race-sched stressor processes to the next CPU every second; this loads just 1 CPU at a time in a round-robin method.
                   syncprev  move synchronously all the race-sched stressor processes to the previous CPU every second; this loads just 1 CPU at a time in a round-robin method.

            --race-sched-ops N
                   stop after N process creation bogo-operations.

            --radixsort N
                   start N workers that sort random 8 byte strings using radixsort(3)

            --radixsort-method [ radixsort-libc | radixsort-nonlibc ]
                   select either the libc implementation of radixsort or an optimized implementation of radixsort. The default is the libc implementation if it is available.

            --radixsort-ops N
                   stop radixsort stress workers after N bogo radixsorts.

            --radixsort-size N
                   specify number of strings to sort, default is 262144 (256 × 1024).

            --ramfs N
                   start N workers mounting a memory based file system using ramfs and tmpfs (Linux only). This alternates between mounting and umounting a ramfs or tmpfs file  system  using  the  tradi‐
                   tional  mount(2)  and umount(2) system call as well as the newer Linux 5.2 fsopen(2), fsmount(2), fsconfig(2) and move_mount(2) system calls if they are available. The default ram file
                   system size is 2 MB.

            --ramfs-fill
                   fill ramfs with zero'd data using fallocate(2) if it is available or multiple calls to write(2) if not.

            --ramfs-ops N
                   stop after N ramfs mount operations.

            --ramfs-size N
                   set the ramfs size (must be multiples of the page size).

       Raw device stressor
            --rawdev N
                   start N workers that read the underlying raw drive device using direct IO reads. The device (with minor number 0) that stores the current working directory is the raw device to be read
                   by the stressor.  The read size is exactly the size of the underlying device block size.  By default, this stressor will exercise all the of the rawdev methods (see the --rawdev-method
                   option). This is a Linux only stressor and requires root privilege to be able to read the raw device.

            --rawdev-method method
                   Available rawdev stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method  Description
                   all     iterate over all the rawdev stress methods as listed below:
                   sweep   repeatedly read across the raw device from the 0th block to the end block in steps of the number of blocks on the device / 128 and back to the start again.
                   wiggle  repeatedly read across the raw device in 128 evenly steps with each step reading 1024 blocks backwards from each step.
                   ends    repeatedly read the first and last 128 start and end blocks of the raw device alternating from start of the device to the end of the device.
                   random  repeatedly read 256 random blocks
                   burst   repeatedly read 256 sequential blocks starting from a random block on the raw device.

            --rawdev-ops N
                   stop the rawdev stress workers after N raw device read bogo operations.

       Random list stressor
            --randlist N
                   start N workers that creates a list of objects in randomized memory order and traverses the list setting and reading the objects. This is designed to exerise memory and  cache  thrash‐
                   ing.  Normally the objects are allocated on the heap, however for objects of page size or larger there is a 1 in 16 chance of objects being allocated using shared anonymous memory map‐
                   ping to mix up the address spaces of the allocations to create more TLB thrashing.

            --randist-compact
                   Allocate all the list objects using one large heap allocation and divide this up for all the list objects. This removes the overhead of the heap keeping  track  of  each  list  object,
                   hence uses less memory.

            --randlist-items N
                   Allocate N items on the list. By default, 100000 items are allocated.

            --randlist-ops N
                   stop randlist workers after N list traversals

            --randlist-size N
                   Allocate each item to be N bytes in size. By default, the size is 64 bytes of data payload plus the list handling pointer overhead.

                   stop rawpkt workers after N packets from the sender process are received.

            --rawpkt-port N
                   start at port P. For N rawpkt worker processes, ports P to (P × 4) − 1 are used. The default starting port is port 14000.

            --rawpkt-rxring N
                   setup raw packets with RX ring with N number of blocks, this selects TPACKET_V. N must be one of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16.

       Localhost raw UDP packet stressor
            --rawudp N
                   start N workers that send and receive UDP packets using raw sockets on the localhost. Requires CAP_NET_RAW to run.

            --rawudp-if NAME
                   use network interface NAME. If the interface NAME does not exist, is not up or does not support the domain then the loopback (lo) interface is used as the default.

            --rawudp-ops N
                   stop rawudp workers after N packets are received.

            --rawudp-port N
                   start at port P. For N rawudp worker processes, ports P to (P × 4) - 1 are used. The default starting port is port 13000.

       Random number generator stressor
            --rdrand N
                   start  N  workers  that read a random number from an on-chip random number generator This uses the rdrand instruction on Intel x86 processors or the darn instruction on PowerPC proces‐
                   sors.

            --rdrand-ops N
                   stop rdrand stress workers after N bogo rdrand operations (1 bogo op = 2048 random bits successfully read).

            --rdrand-seed
                   use rdseed instead of rdrand (x86 only).

       Read-ahead stressor
            --readahead N
                   start N workers that randomly seek and perform 4096 byte read/write I/O operations on a file with readahead(2). The default file size is 64 MB.  Readaheads and reads are  batched  into
                   16 readaheads and then 16 reads.

            --readahead-bytes N
                   set  the size of readahead file, the default is 1 GB. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b,
                   k, m or g.

            --readahead-ops N

       Reboot stressor
            --reboot N
                   start N workers that exercise the reboot(2) system call. When possible, it will create a process in a PID namespace and perform a reboot power off  command  that  should  shutdown  the
                   process.  Also, the stressor exercises invalid reboot magic values and invalid reboots when there are insufficient privileges that will not actually reboot the system.

            --reboot-ops N
                   stop the reboot stress workers after N bogo reboot cycles.

       POSIX regular expressions stressor
            --regex N
                   start  N  workers  that  compile various POSIX regular expressions and execute them against a set of text strings. This exercises the regex C library with a range of various simple and
                   complex regex expressions.

            --regex-ops N
                   stop after N regex compilations.

       CPU registers stressor
            --regs N
                   start N workers that shuffle data around the CPU registers exercising register move instructions.  Each bogo-op represents 1000 calls of a shuffling function that shuffles  the  regis‐
                   ters 32 times. Only implemented for the GCC compiler since this requires register annotations and optimization level 0 to compile appropriately.

            --regs-ops N
                   stop regs stressors after N bogo operations.

       Memory page reordering stressor

                   many pages to 1 page.

            --remap-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd huge pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --remap-ops N
                   stop after N remapping bogo operations.

            --remap-pages N

                   stop rename stress workers after N bogo rename operations.

       Process rescheduling stressor
            --resched N
                   start N workers that exercise process rescheduling. Each stressor spawns a child process for each of the positive nice levels and iterates over the nice levels from  0  to  the  lowest
                   priority  level  (highest  nice  value).  For  each  of  the  nice  levels 1024 iterations over 3 non-real time scheduling polices SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_BATCH and SCHED_IDLE are set and a
                   sched_yield(2) occurs to force heavy rescheduling activity.  When the -v verbose option is used the distribution of the number of yields across the nice levels is printed for the first
                   stressor out of the N stressors.

            --resched-ops N
                   stop after N rescheduling sched_yield calls.

       System resources stressor
            --resources N
                   start N workers that consume various system resources. Each worker will spawn 1024 child processes that iterate 1024 times consuming shared memory, heap,  stack,  temporary  files  and
                   various file descriptors (eventfds, memoryfds, userfaultfds, pipes and sockets).

            --resources-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) mmap'd pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --resources-ops N
                   stop after N resource child forks.

       Writing temporary files in reverse position stressor
            --revio N
                   start  N  workers  continually writing in reverse position order to temporary files. The default mode is to stress test reverse position ordered writes with randomly sized sparse holes
                   between each write.  With the --aggressive option enabled without any --revio-opts options the revio stressor will work through all the --revio-opt options one by one to cover a  range
                   of I/O options.

            --revio-bytes N
                   write N bytes for each revio process, the default is 1 GB. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suf‐
                   fix b, k, m or g.

            --revio-opts list
                   specify  various  stress test options as a comma separated list. Options are the same as --hdd-opts but without the iovec option and with a readahead option to force a readahead action
                   over the entire file once it has been completely written.

            --revio-ops N
                   stop revio stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --revio-write-size N
                   specify size of each write in bytes. Size can be from 1 byte to 4 MB.

       Ring pipes stressor
            --ring-pipe N
                   start N workers that move data around a ring of pipes using poll to detect when data is ready to copy. By default, 256 pipes are used with two 4096 byte  items  of  data  being  copied
                   around  the ring of pipes. Data is copied using read and write system calls. If the splice system call is available then one can use splice to use more efficient in-kernel data passing
                   instead of buffer copying.

            --ring-pipe-num N
                   specify the number of pipes to use. Ranges from 4 to 262144, default is 256.

            --rlimit N
                   start N workers that exceed CPU and file size resource imits, generating SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ signals.

            --rlimit-ops N
                   stop after N bogo resource limited SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ signals have been caught.

       VM reverse-mapping stressor
            --rmap N
                   start N workers that exercise the VM reverse-mapping. This creates 16 processes per worker that write/read multiple file-backed memory mappings. There are 64 lots of  4  page  mappings
                   made  onto  the  file, with each mapping overlapping the previous by 3 pages and at least 1 page of non-mapped memory between each of the mappings. Data is synchronously msync'd to the
                   file 1 in every 256 iterations in a random manner.

                   stop after N bogo rmap memory writes/reads.

       1 bit rotation stressor
            --rotate N
                   start N workers that exercise 1 bit rotates left and right of unsigned integer variables.  The default will rotate four 8, 16, 32, 64 (and if supported 128) bit values 10000 times in a
                   loop per bogo-op.

            --rotate-method method
                   specify the method of rotation to use. The `all' method uses all the methods and is the default.

                   Method  Description
                   all     exercise with all the rotate stressor methods (see below):
                   rol8    8 bit unsigned rotate left by 1 bit
                   ror8    8 bit unsigned rotate right by 1 bit
                   rol16   16 bit unsigned rotate left by 1 bit
                   ror16   16 bit unsigned rotate right by 1 bit
                   rol32   32 bit unsigned rotate left by 1 bit
                   ror32   32 bit unsigned rotate right by 1 bit
                   rol64   64 bit unsigned rotate left by 1 bit
                   ror64   64 bit unsigned rotate right by 1 bit
                   rol128  128 bit unsigned rotate left by 1 bit
                   ror128  128 bit unsigned rotate right by 1 bit

            --rotate-ops N
                   stop after N bogo rotate operations.

       Restartable sequences (rseq) stressor (Linux)
            --rseq N
                   start N workers that exercise restartable sequences via the rseq(2) system call.  This loops over a long duration critical section that is likely to be interrupted.  A rseq abort  han‐
                   dler keeps count of the number of interruptions and a SIGSEGV handler also tracks any failed rseq aborts that can occur if there is a mismatch in a rseq check signature. Linux only.

            --rseq-ops N
                   stop after N bogo rseq operations. Each bogo rseq operation is equivalent to 10000 iterations over a long duration rseq handled critical section.

       Real-time clock stressor
            --rtc N
                   start N workers that exercise the real time clock (RTC) interfaces via /dev/rtc and /sys/class/rtc/rtc0. No destructive writes (modifications) are performed on the RTC. This is a Linux
                   only stressor.

            --rtc-ops N
                   stop after N bogo RTC interface accesses.

       Fast process rescheduling stressor
            --schedmix N
                   start N workers that each start child processes that repeatedly select random a scheduling policy and then executes a short duration randomly chosen time consuming activity. This exer‐
                   cises rapid re-scheduling of processes and generates a large amount of scheduling timer interrupts.

            --schedmix-ops N
                   stop after N scheduling mixed operations.

            --schedmix-procs N
                   specify the number of chid processes to run for each stressor instance, range from 1 to 64, default is 16.

       Scheduling policy stressor
            --schedpolicy N
                   start  N  workers  that set the worker to various available scheduling policies out of SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_BATCH, SCHED_IDLE, SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, SCHED_DEADLINE and SCHED_EXT. For the
                   real time scheduling policies a random sched priority is selected between the minimum and maximum scheduling priority settings.

            --schedpolicy-ops N
                   stop after N bogo scheduling policy changes.

            --schedpolicy-rand
                   Select scheduling policy randomly so that the new policy is always different to the previous policy. The default is to work through the scheduling policies sequentially.

       Stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) stressor
            --sctp N
                   start N workers that perform network sctp stress activity using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).   This  involves  client/server  processes  performing  rapid  connect,
                   send/receives and disconnects on the local host.

            --sctp-domain D
                   specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4 and ipv6 are supported.

            --sctp-if NAME
                   use network interface NAME. If the interface NAME does not exist, is not up or does not support the domain then the loopback (lo) interface is used as the default.

            --sctp-ops N
                   stop sctp workers after N bogo operations.

            --sctp-port P
                   start at sctp port P. For N sctp worker processes, ports P to (P × 4) − 1 are used for ipv4, ipv6 domains and ports P to P − 1 are used for the unix domain.

            --sctp-sched [ fc | fcfs | prio | rr | wfq ]
                   specify SCTP scheduler, one of fc (fair capacity), fcfs (first come first served, the default), prio (priority), rr (round-robin) or wfq (weighted fair queueing)

       File sealing (SEAL) stressor (Linux)
            --seal N
                   start  N workers that exercise the fcntl(2) SEAL commands on a small anonymous file created using memfd_create(2).  After each SEAL command is issued the stressor also sanity checks if
                   the seal operation has sealed the file correctly.  (Linux only).

            --seal-ops N
                   stop after N bogo seal operations.

       Secure computing stressor
            --seccomp N
                   start N workers that exercise Secure Computing system call filtering. Each worker creates child processes that write a short message to /dev/null  and  then  exits.  2%  of  the  child
                   processes have a seccomp filter that disallows the write system call and hence it is killed by seccomp with a SIGSYS.  Note that this stressor can generate many audit log messages each
                   time the child is killed.  Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN to run.

            --seccomp-ops N
                   stop seccomp stress workers after N seccomp filter tests.

       Secret memory stressor (Linux ≥ 5.11)
            --secretmem N
                   start N workers that mmap pages using file mapping off a memfd_secret(2) file descriptor. Each stress loop iteration will expand the mappable region by 3 pages using ftruncate and mmap
                   and  touches  the  pages. The pages are then fragmented by unmapping the middle page and then umapping the first and last pages. This tries to force page fragmentation and also trigger
                   out of memory (OOM) kills of the stressor when the secret memory is exhausted.  Note this is a Linux 5.11+ only stressor and the kernel needs to be booted with "secretmem="  option  to
                   allocate a secret memory reservation.

            --secretmem-ops N
                   stop secretmem stress workers after N stress loop iterations.

       IO seek stressor
            --seek N
                   start N workers that randomly seeks and performs 512 byte read/write I/O operations on a file. The default file size is 16 GB.

            --seek-ops N
                   stop seek stress workers after N bogo seek operations.

            --seek-punch
                   punch randomly located 8 K holes into the file to cause more extents to force a more demanding seek stressor, (Linux only).

            --seek-size N
                   specify  the size of the file in bytes. Small file sizes allow the I/O to occur in the cache, causing greater CPU load. Large file sizes force more I/O operations to drive causing more
                   wait time and more I/O on the drive. One can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

       POSIX semaphore stressor
            --sem N
                   start N workers that perform POSIX semaphore wait and post operations. By default, a parent and 4 children are started per worker to provide some  contention  on  the  semaphore.  This
                   stresses fast semaphore operations and produces rapid context switching.

            --sem-ops N
                   stop semaphore stress workers after N bogo semaphore operations.

            --sem-procs N
                   start N child workers per worker to provide contention on the semaphore, the default is 4 and a maximum of 64 are allowed.

            --sem-shared
                   share  the  semaphore  across all sem stressor instances. Normally each semaphore stressor shares a semaphore with its child processes, this option produces more locking contention and
                   less throughput by sharing a semaphore across all semaphore stressor processes.

       System V semaphore stressor
            --sem-sysv N
                   start N workers that perform System V semaphore wait and post operations. By default, a parent and 4 children are started per worker to provide some contention on the  semaphore.  This
                   stresses fast semaphore operations and produces rapid context switching.

            --sem-sysv-ops N
                   stop semaphore stress workers after N bogo System V semaphore operations.

            --sem-sysv-procs N
                   start N child processes per worker to provide contention on the System V semaphore, the default is 4 and a maximum of 64 are allowed.

            --sem-sysv-setall
                   sets the semval values for all the semaphores in the child's semaphore set.  This depends on the semctl SETALL op being defined and GETALL succeeding and is an opt-in option as it will
                   affect the semaphore being exercised.

       Sendfile stressor
            --sendfile N
                   start N workers that send an empty file to /dev/null using the sendfile(2) call. This operation spends nearly all the time in the kernel.  The default sendfile size is 4 MB.  The send‐
                   file options are for Linux only.

            --sendfile-ops N
                   stop sendfile workers after N sendfile bogo operations.

            --sendfile-size S
                   specify the size to be copied with each sendfile call. The default size is 4 MB. One can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

       Sessions stressor
            --session N
                   start  N  workers that create child and grandchild processes that set and get their session ids. 25% of the grandchild processes are not waited for by the child to create orphaned ses‐
                   sions that need to be reaped by init.

            --session-ops N
                   stop session workers after N child processes are spawned and reaped.

       Setting data in the Kernel stressor
            --set N
                   start N workers that call system calls that try to set data in the kernel, currently these are: setgid(2), sethostname(2), setpgid(2), setpgrp(2), setuid(2), setgroups(2), setreuid(2),
                   setregid(2), setresuid(2), setresgid(2) and setrlimit(2).  Some of these system calls are OS specific.

            --set-ops N
                   stop set workers after N bogo set operations.

       Shellsort stressor

                   start N workers that sort 32 bit integers using shellsort(3).

            --shellsort-ops N
                   stop shellsort stress workers after N bogo shellsorts.

            --shellsort-size N
                   specify number of 32 bit integers to sort, default is 262144 (256 × 1024).

       POSIX shared memory stressor
            --shm N
                   start N workers that open and allocate shared memory objects using the POSIX shared memory interfaces.  By default, the test will repeatedly create and destroy  32  shared  memory  ob‐
                   jects, each of which is 8 MB in size.

            --shm-bytes N
                   specify  the  size  of  the POSIX shared memory objects to be created. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the
                   suffix b, k, m or g.

            --shm-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) shared memory objects into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --shm-objs N
                   specify the number of shared memory objects to be created.

            --shm-ops N
                   stop after N POSIX shared memory create and destroy bogo operations are complete.

       System V shared memory stressor
            --shm-sysv N
                   start N workers that allocate shared memory using the System V shared memory interface.  By default, the test will repeatedly create and destroy 8 shared memory segments, each of which
                   is 8 MB in size.

            --shm-sysv-bytes N
                   specify the size of the shared memory segment to be created. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b,
                   k, m or g.

            --shm-sysv-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) shared memory segment into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --shm-sysv-ops N
                   stop after N shared memory create and destroy bogo operations are complete.

            --shm-sysv-segs N
                   specify the number of shared memory segments to be created. The default is 8 segments.

       SIGBUS stressor
            --sigbus N
                   start N workers that rapidly create and catch bus errors generated via misaligned access and accessing a file backed memory mapping that does not have file storage to back the page be‐
                   ing accessed.

            --sigbus-ops N
                   stop sigbus stress workers after N bogo bus errors.

       SIGCHLD stressor
            --sigchld N
                   start N workers that create children to generate SIGCHLD signals. This exercises children that exit (CLD_EXITED), get  killed  (CLD_KILLED),  get  stopped  (CLD_STOPPED)  or  continued
                   (CLD_CONTINUED).

            --sigchld-ops N
                   stop the sigchld workers after N SIGCHLD signals are successfully handled.

       SIGFD stressor (Linux)
            --sigfd N
                   start N workers that generate SIGRT signals and are handled by reads by a child process using a file descriptor set up using signalfd(2).  (Linux only). This will generate a heavy con‐
                   text switch load when all CPUs are fully loaded.

            --sigfd-ops
                   stop sigfd workers after N bogo SIGUSR1 signals are sent.

       SIGFPE stressor
            --sigfpe N
                   start N workers that rapidly cause division by zero SIGFPE faults.

            --sigfpe-ops N
                   stop sigfpe stress workers after N bogo SIGFPE faults.

       SIGHUP stressor
            --sighup N
                   start N workers that generate SIGHUP signals using raise(2) and by killing a group leader process with a child process indirectly receiving SIGHUP when it loses the group leader.

            --sighup-ops N
                   stop sighup stressor workers after N SIGHUP signals

       SIGILL stressor
            --sigill N
                   start N workers that execute illegal instructions to generate SIGILL signals.

       SIGIO stressor
            --sigio N
                   start N workers that read data from a child process via a pipe and generate SIGIO signals. This exercises asynchronous I/O via SIGIO.

            --sigio-ops N
                   stop sigio stress workers after handling N SIGIO signals.

       System signals stressor
            --signal N
                   start  N  workers  that exercise the signal system call three different signal handlers, SIG_IGN (ignore), a SIGCHLD handler and SIG_DFL (default action).  For the SIGCHLD handler, the
                   stressor sends itself a SIGCHLD signal and checks if it has been handled. For other handlers, the stressor checks that the SIGCHLD handler has not been called.  This stress test  calls
                   the signal system call directly when possible and will try to avoid the C library attempt to replace signal with the more modern sigaction system call.

            --signal-ops N
                   stop signal stress workers after N rounds of signal handler setting.

       Nested signal handling stressor
            --signest N
                   start  N  workers that exercise nested signal handling. A signal is raised and inside the signal handler a different signal is raised, working through a list of signals to exercise. An
                   alternative signal stack is used that is large enough to handle all the nested signal calls.  The -v option will log the approximate size of the stack required and  the  average  stack
                   size per nested call.

            --signest-ops N
                   stop after handling N nested signals.

       Pending signals stressor
            --sigpending N
                   start  N  workers that check if SIGUSR1 signals are pending. This stressor masks SIGUSR1, generates a SIGUSR1 signal and uses sigpending(2) to see if the signal is pending. Then it un‐
                   masks the signal and checks if the signal is no longer pending.

            --sigpending-ops N
                   stop sigpending stress workers after N bogo sigpending pending/unpending checks.

       SIGPIPE stressor
            --sigpipe N
                   start N workers that repeatedly spawn off child process that exits before a parent can complete a pipe write, causing a SIGPIPE signal.  The  child  process  is  either  spawned  using
                   clone(2) if it is available or use the slower fork(2) instead.

            --sigpipe-ops N
                   stop N workers after N SIGPIPE signals have been caught and handled.

       Signal queueing stressor
            --sigq N
                   start N workers that rapidly send SIGUSR1 signals using sigqueue(3) to child processes that wait for the signal via sigwaitinfo(2).

            --sigq-ops N
                   stop sigq stress workers after N bogo signal send operations.

       Real-time signals stressor
            --sigrt N
                   start  N  workers that each create child processes to handle SIGRTMIN to SIGRMAX real time signals. The parent sends each child process a RT signal via siqueue(2) and the child process
                   waits for this via sigwaitinfo(2).  When the child receives the signal it then sends a RT signal to one of the other child processes also via sigqueue(2).

            --sigrt-ops N
                   stop sigrt stress workers after N bogo sigqueue signal send operations.

       SIGSEGV stressor
            --sigsegv N
                   start N workers that rapidly create and catch segmentation faults generated via illegal memory access, illegal vdso system calls, illegal port reads, illegal interrupts  or  access  to
                   x86 time stamp counter.

            --sigsegv-ops N
                   stop sigsegv stress workers after N bogo segmentation faults.

       Waiting for process signals stressor
            --sigsuspend N
                   start  N  workers that each spawn off 4 child processes that wait for a SIGUSR1 signal from the parent using sigsuspend(2). The parent sends SIGUSR1 signals to each child in rapid suc‐
                   cession.  Each sigsuspend wakeup is counted as one bogo operation.

            --sigsuspend-ops N
                   stop sigsuspend stress workers after N bogo sigsuspend wakeups.

       SIGTRAP stressor
            --sigtrap N
                   start N workers that exercise the SIGTRAP signal. For systems that support SIGTRAP, the signal is generated using raise(SIGTRAP). Only x86 Linux systems the SIGTRAP is  also  generated
                   by an int 3 instruction.

            --sigtrap-ops N
                   stop sigtrap stress workers after N SIGTRAP signals have been handled.

       SIGURG stressor
            --sigurg N
                   start workers that exercise the SIGURG signal by sending out-of-band data over a TCP/IP IPv4 socket stream.

            --sigurg-ops N
                   stop sigurg stressor workers after N SIGURG signals have been handled.

       SIGVTARLM stressor
            --sigvtalrm N
                   start N workers that exercise the SIGVTALRM signal using an ITIMER_VIRTUAL itimer and a busy loop that consumes CPU time calling getitimer for the ITIMER_VIRTUAL timer.

            --sigvtalrm-ops N
                   stop sigvtalrm stress workers after N SIGVTALRM signals have been handled.

       SIGXCPU stressor
            --sigxcpu N
                   start N workers that exercise the SIGXCPU stressor. A busy loop generates SIGXCPU signals by setting a 0 second run time limit followed by a sched_yield(2) call.

            --sigxcpu-ops N
                   stop sigsxcpu stress workers after N bogo SIGXCPU signal attempts.

       SIGXFSZ stressor
            --sigxfsz N
                   start N workers that exercise the SIGXFSZ stressor. A random 32 bit file size limit is set and data is written outside this size limit to generate a SIGXFSZ signal.

            --sigxfsz-ops N
                   stop sigsxfsz stress workers after N bogo SIGXFSZ signal attempts.

       Random memory and processor cache line stressor via a skiplist
            --skiplist N
                   start N workers that store and then search for integers using a skiplist.  By default, 65536 integers are added and searched.  This is a useful method to exercise random access of mem‐
                   ory and processor cache.

            --skiplist-ops N
                   stop the skiplist worker after N skiplist store and search cycles are completed.

            --skiplist-size N
                   specify the size (number of integers) to store and search in the skiplist. Size can be from 1 K to 4 M.

       Time interrupts and context switches stressor
            --sleep N
                   start N workers that spawn off multiple threads that each perform multiple sleeps of ranges 1us to 0.1s.  This creates multiple context switches and timer interrupts.

            --sleep-max P
                   start P threads per worker. The default is 1024, the maximum allowed is 30000.

            --sleep-ops N
                   stop after N sleep bogo operations.

       System management interrupts (SMI) stressor
            --smi N
                   start  N  workers  that attempt to generate system management interrupts (SMIs) into the x86 ring -2 system management mode (SMM) by exercising the advanced power management (APM) port
                   0xb2. This requires the --pathological option and root privilege and is only implemented on x86 Linux platforms. This probably does not work in a virtualized environment.  The stressor
                   will attempt to determine the time stolen by SMIs with some naïve benchmarking.

            --smi-ops N
                   stop after N attempts to trigger the SMI.

       Network socket stressor
            -S N, --sock N
                   start N workers that perform various socket stress activity. This involves a pair of client/server processes performing rapid connect, send and receives and disconnects  on  the  local
                   host.

            --sock-domain D
                   specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4, ipv6 and unix are supported.

            --sock-if NAME
                   use network interface NAME. If the interface NAME does not exist, is not up or does not support the domain then the loopback (lo) interface is used as the default.

            --sock-msgs N
                   send  N  messages per connect, send/receive, disconnect iteration. The default is 1000 messages. If N is too small then the rate is throttled back by the overhead of socket connect and
                   disconnect (on Linux, one needs to increase /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_max to allow more connections).

            --sock-nodelay
                   This disables the TCP Nagle algorithm, so data segments are always sent as soon as possible.  This stops data from being buffered before being transmitted, hence  resulting  in  poorer
                   network utilisation and more context switches between the sender and receiver.

            --sock-ops N
                   stop socket stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --sock-opts [ random | send | sendmsg | sendmmsg ]
                   by default, messages are sent using send(2). This option allows one to specify the sending method using send(2), sendmsg(2), sendmmsg(2) or a random selection of one of these 3 on each
                   iteration.  Note that sendmmsg is only available for Linux systems that support this system call.

            --sock-port P
                   start at socket port P. For N socket worker processes, ports P to P − 1 are used.

            --sock-protocol P
                   Use the specified protocol P, default is tcp. Options are tcp and mptcp (if supported by the operating system).

            --sock-type [ stream | seqpacket ]
                   specify the socket type to use. The default type is stream. seqpacket currently only works for the unix socket domain.

            --sock-zerocopy
                   enable zerocopy for send and recv calls if the MSG_ZEROCOPY is supported.

       Socket abusing stressor
            --sockabuse N
                   start  N  workers  that  abuse  a  socket file descriptor with various file based system that don't normally act on sockets. The kernel should handle these illegal and unexpected calls
                   gracefully.

            --sockabuse-ops N
                   stop after N iterations of the socket abusing stressor loop.

            --sockabuse-port P
                   start at socket port P. For N sockabuse worker processes, ports P to P − 1 are used.

       Socket diagnostic stressor (Linux)
            --sockdiag N
                   start N workers that exercise the Linux sock_diag netlink socket diagnostics (Linux only).  This currently requests diagnostics using UDIAG_SHOW_NAME, UDIAG_SHOW_VFS,  UDIAG_SHOW_PEER,
                   UDIAG_SHOW_ICONS, UDIAG_SHOW_RQLEN and UDIAG_SHOW_MEMINFO for the AF_UNIX family of socket connections.

            --sockdiag-ops N
                   stop after receiving N sock_diag diagnostic messages.

       Socket file descriptor stressor
            --sockfd N
                   start  N  workers  that  pass  file  descriptors over a UNIX domain socket using the CMSG(3) ancillary data mechanism. For each worker, pair of client/server processes are created, the
                   server opens as many file descriptors on /dev/null as possible and passing these over the socket to a client that reads these from the CMSG data and immediately closes the files.

            --sockfd-ops N
                   stop sockfd stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --sockfd-port P
                   start at socket port P. For N socket worker processes, ports P to P − 1 are used.

            --sockfd-reuse
                   reuse the file descriptor by passing it back from the receiver to the sender and re-sending it again rather than opening /dev/null each time.

       Opening network socket stressor
            --sockmany N
                   start N workers that use a client process to attempt to open as many as 100000 TCP/IP socket connections to a server on port 10000.

            --sockmany-if NAME
                   use network interface NAME. If the interface NAME does not exist, is not up or does not support the domain then the loopback (lo) interface is used as the default.

            --sockmany-ops N
                   stop after N connections.

            --sockmany-port P
                   start at socket port P. For N sockmany worker processes, ports P to P − 1 are used.

       Socket I/O stressor
            --sockpair N
                   start N workers that perform socket pair I/O read/writes. This involves a pair of client/server processes performing randomly sized socket I/O operations.

            --sockpair-ops N
                   stop socket pair stress workers after N bogo operations.

       Softlockup stressor
            --softlockup N
                   start N workers that flip between with the "real-time" SCHED_FIO and SCHED_RR scheduling policies at the highest priority to force softlockups. This can only be run  with  CAP_SYS_NICE
                   capability  and for best results the number of stressors should be at least the number of online CPUs. Once running, this is practically impossible to stop and it will force softlockup
                   issues and may trigger watchdog timeout reboots.

            --softlockup-ops N
                   stop softlockup stress workers after N bogo scheduler policy changes.

       Sparse matrix stressor
            --sparsematrix N
                   start N workers that exercise 3 different sparse matrix implementations based on hashing, Judy array (for 64 bit systems), 2-d circular linked-lists, memory  mapped  2-d  matrix  (non-
                   sparse),  quick  hashing (on preallocated nodes) and red-black tree.  The sparse matrix is populated with values, random values potentially non-existing values are read, known existing
                   values are read and known existing values are marked as zero. This default 500 × 500 sparse matrix is used and 5000 items are put into the sparse matrix making it 2% utilized.

            --sparsematrix-items N
                   populate the sparse matrix with N items. If N is greater than the number of elements in the sparse matrix than N will be capped to create at 100% full sparse matrix.

            --sparsematrix-method [ all | hash | hashjudy | judy | list | mmap | qhash | rb ]
                   specify the type of sparse matrix implementation to use. The `all' method uses all the methods and is the default.

                   Method    Description
                   all       exercise with all the sparsematrix stressor methods (see below):
                   hash      use a hash table and allocate nodes on the heap for each unique value at a (x, y) matrix position.
                   hashjudy  use a hash table for x coordinates and a Judy array for y coordinates for values at a (x, y) matrix position.
                   judy      use a Judy array with a unique 1-to-1 mapping of (x, y) matrix position into the array.
                   list      use a circular linked-list for sparse y positions each with circular linked-lists for sparse x positions for the (x, y) matrix coordinates.
                   mmap      use a non-sparse mmap the entire 2-d matrix space. Only (x, y) matrix positions that are referenced will get physically mapped. Note that  large  sparse  matrices  cannot  be
                             mmap'd due to lack of virtual address limitations, and too many referenced pages can trigger the out of memory killer on Linux.
                   qhash     use  a  hash  table with pre-allocated nodes for each unique value. This is a quick hash table implementation, nodes are not allocated each time with calloc and are allocated
                             from a pre-allocated pool leading to quicker hash table performance than the hash method.
                   rb        use a red-black balanced tree using one tree node for each unique value at a (x, y) matrix position.
                   splay     use a splay tree using one tree node for each unique value at a (x, y) matrix position.

            --sparsematrix-ops N
                   stop after N sparsematrix test iterations.

            --sparsematrix-size N
                   use a N × N sized sparse matrix

       POSIX process spawn (posix_spawn) stressor (Linux)
            --spawn N
                   start N workers continually spawn children using posix_spawn(3) that exec stress-ng and then exit almost immediately. Currently Linux only.

            --spawn-ops N
                   stop spawn stress workers after N bogo spawns.

       Spinmem stressor
            --spinmem N
                   start N workers that use a shared memory page to keep two processes synchronized using busy spin loops. One process is a writer that increments a value in memory slot 0 and spin  waits
                   for  the  data  to  appear in memory slot 1. The other process spin waits for the data to change in slot 0 and copies the changed value into memory slot 1.  The stressor benchmarks the
                   time for the transactions to occur between both processes. Note that the optimal number of stressors is half the number of online CPUs in a system. By default 32  bit  write/reads  are
                   used.

            --spinmem-affinity
                   move spinmem stressor processes to randomly selected CPUs every million spinmem transactions.

            --spinmem-method [ 8bit | 16bit | 32bit | 64bit | 128bit ]
                   select the size of the memory write/reads, the default is 32 bit. 128 bit read/writes may not be supported by some toolchains.

            --spinmem-numa
                   assign shared memory page to randomly selected NUMA nodes. This is disabled for systems that do not support NUMA.

            --spinmem-ops N
                   stop after N spinmem bogo operations. A bogo operation is 1000 transactions betewen the two spinmem processes.

            --spinmem-yield
                   force scheduling yields after each spinmem read/write operation

       Splice stressor (Linux)
            --splice N
                   move data from /dev/zero to /dev/null through a pipe without any copying between kernel address space and user address space using splice(2). This is only available for Linux.

            --splice-bytes N
                   transfer  N bytes per splice call, the default is 64 K. One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m
                   or g.

            --splice-ops N
                   stop after N bogo splice operations.

       Stack stressor
            --stack N
                   start N workers that rapidly cause and catch stack overflows by use of large recursive stack allocations.  Much like the brk stressor, this can eat up pages rapidly and may trigger the
                   kernel OOM killer on the process, however, the killed stressor is respawned again by a monitoring parent process.

            --stack-fill
                   the default action is to touch the lowest page on each stack allocation. This option touches all the pages by filling the new stack allocation with zeros which forces physical pages to
                   be allocated and hence is more aggressive.

            --stack-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) stack pages into memory causing more memory pressure by preventing pages from swapped out.

            --stack-ops N
                   stop stack stress workers after N bogo stack overflows.

            --stack-pageout
                   force stack pages out to swap (available when madvise(2) supports MADV_PAGEOUT).

            --stack-unmap
                   unmap a single page in the middle of a large buffer allocated on the stack on each stack allocation. This forces the stack mapping into multiple separate allocation mappings.

       Dirty page and stack exception stressor
            --stackmmap N
                   start N workers that use a 2 MB stack that is memory mapped onto a temporary file. A recursive function works down the stack and flushes dirty stack pages back  to  the  memory  mapped
                   file using msync(2) until the end of the stack is reached (stack overflow). This exercises dirty page and stack exception handling.

            --stackmmap-ops N
                   stop workers after N stack overflows have occurred.

       Statmount and listmount system call stressor
            --statmount N
                   start N workers that find mounts on / via listmount and get mount information on the mount IDs using statmount. (Linux only).

            --statmount-ops N
                   stop workers after iterating on mounts N times.

       Libc string functions stressor
            --str N
                   start N workers that exercise various libc string functions on random strings.

            --str-method strfunc
                   select  a  specific  libc  string  function  to stress. Available string functions to stress are: all, index, rindex, strcasecmp, strcat, strchr, strcoll, strcmp, strcpy, strlen, strn‐
                   casecmp, strncat, strncmp, strrchr and strxfrm.  See string(3) for more information on these string functions.  The `all' method is the default and will exercise all the  string  meth‐
                   ods.

            --str-ops N
                   stop after N bogo string operations.

       STREAM memory stressor
            --stream N
                   start  N  workers  exercising a memory bandwidth stressor very loosely based on the STREAM "Sustainable Memory Bandwidth in High Performance Computers" benchmarking tool by John D. Mc‐
                   Calpin, Ph.D. This stressor allocates buffers that are at least 4 times the size of the CPU L2 cache and continually performs rounds of following computations on large arrays of double
                   precision floating point numbers:

                   Operation  Description
                   copy       c[i] = a[i]
                   scale      b[i] = scalar × c[i]
                   add        c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
                   triad      a[i] = b[i] + (c[i] × scalar)

                   Since this is loosely based on a variant of the STREAM benchmark code, DO NOT submit results based on this as it is intended to in stress-ng just to stress memory and compute  and  NOT
                   intended for STREAM accurate tuned or non-tuned benchmarking whatsoever. Use the official STREAM benchmarking tool if you desire accurate and standardised STREAM benchmarks.

                   The  stressor  calculates the memory read rate, memory write rate and floating point operations rate. These will differ from the maximum theoretical read/write/compute rates because of
                   loop overheads and the use of volatile pointers to ensure the compiler does not optimize out stores.

            --stream-index N
                   specify number of stream indices used to index into the data arrays a, b and c.  This adds indirection into the data lookup by using randomly shuffled indexing into the three data  ar‐
                   rays.  Level 0 (no indexing) is the default, and 3 is where all 3 arrays are indexed via 3 different randomly shuffled indexes. The higher the index setting the more impact this has on
                   L1, L2 and L3 caching and hence forces higher memory read/write latencies.

            --stream-l3-size N
                   Specify the CPU Level 3 cache size in bytes.  One can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.  If the L3 cache  size  is  not  pro‐
                   vided, then stress-ng will attempt to determine the cache size, and failing this, will default the size to 4 MB.

            --stream-mlock
                   attempt to mlock(2) the stream buffers into memory to prevent them from being swapped out.

            --stream-madvise [ collapse | hugepage | nohugepage | normal ]
                   Specify the madvise(2) options used on the memory mapped buffer used in the stream stressor. Non-linux systems will only have the `normal' madvise advice. The default is `normal'.

            --stream-ops N
                   stop after N stream bogo operations, where a bogo operation is one round of copy, scale, add and triad operations.

            --stream-prefetch
                   compilers  such as gcc have optimization options to insert prefetching into memory fetch loops that may improve read performance. This option enables this optimization, however, it may
                   lead to degraded performance if the compiler does not insert the prefetching in the correct places.  Best to enable this for the default --stream-index 0 setting.

       Swap partitions stressor (Linux)
            --swap N
                   start N workers that add and remove small randomly sizes swap partitions (Linux only).  Note that if too many swap partitions are added then the stressors may exit  with  exit  code  3
                   (not enough resources).  Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN to run.

            --swap-ops N
                   stop the swap workers after N swapon/swapoff iterations.

            --swap-self
                   attempt to swap out pages of the stressor.

       Context switching between mutually tied processes stressor
            -s N, --switch N
                   start  N  workers that force context switching between two mutually blocking/unblocking tied processes. By default message passing over a pipe is used, but different methods are avail‐
                   able.

            --switch-freq F
                   run the context switching at the frequency of F context switches per second. Note that the specified switch rate may not be achieved because of CPU speed and memory  bandwidth  limita‐
                   tions.

            --switch-method [ mq | pipe | sem-sysv ]
                   select the preferred context switch block/run synchronization method, these are as follows:

                   Method    Description
                   mq        use posix message queue with a 1 item size. Messages are passed between a sender and receiver process.
                   pipe      single character messages are passed down a single character sized pipe between a sender and receiver process.
                   sem-sysv  a SYSV semaphore is used to block/run two processes.

            --switch-ops N
                   stop context switching workers after N bogo operations.

       Symlink stressor
            --symlink N
                   start N workers creating and removing symbolic links.

            --symlink-ops N
                   stop symlink stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --symlink-sync
                   sync dirty data and metadata to disk.

       Partial file syncing (sync_file_range) stressor
            --sync-file N
                   start N workers that perform a range of data syncs across a file using sync_file_range(2).  Three mixes of syncs are performed, from start to the end of the file,  from end of the file
                   to  the  start,  and  a random mix. A random selection of valid sync types are used, covering the SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE, SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE and SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER flag
                   bits.

            --sync-file-bytes N
                   specify the size of the file to be sync'd. One can specify the size as % of free space on the file system in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --sync-file-ops N
                   stop sync-file workers after N bogo sync operations.

       CPU synchronized loads stressor
            --syncload N
                   start N workers that produce sporadic short lived loads synchronized across N stressor processes. By default repeated cycles of 125ms busy load followed by 62.5ms  sleep  occur  across
                   all the workers in step to create bursts of load to exercise C state transitions and CPU frequency scaling. The busy load and sleeps have ±10% jitter added to try exercising scheduling
                   patterns.

            --syncload-msbusy M
                   specify the busy load duration in milliseconds.

            --syncload-mssleep M
                   specify the sleep duration in milliseconds.

            --syncload-ops N
                   stop syncload workers after N load/sleep cycles.

       System calls bad address and fault handling stressor
            --sysbadaddr N
                   start  N  workers  that pass bad addresses to system calls to exercise bad address and fault handling. The addresses used are null pointers, read only pages, write only pages, unmapped
                   addresses, text only pages, unaligned addresses and top of memory addresses.

            --sysbadaddr-ops N
                   stop the sysbadaddr stressors after N bogo system calls.

       System calls stressor
            --syscall N
                   start N workers that exercise a range of available system calls. System calls that fail due to lack of capabilities or errors are ignored. The stressor will try to maximize the rate of
                   system calls being executed based the entire time taken to setup, run and cleanup after each system call.

            --syscall-method method
                   select the choice of system calls to executed based on the fastest test duration times.  Note that this includes the time to setup, execute the system call and cleanup afterwards.  The
                   available methods are as follows:

                   Method     Description
                   all        select all the available system calls
                   fast10     select the fastest 10% system call tests
                   fast25     select the fastest 25% system call tests
                   fast50     select the fastest 50% system call tests
                   fast75     select the fastest 75% system call tests
                   fast90     select the fastest 90% system call tests
                   geomean1   select tests that are less or equal to the geometric mean of all the test times
                   geomean1   select tests that are less or equal to 2 × the geometric mean of all the test times
                   geomean1   select tests that are less or equal to 3 × the geometric mean of all the test times

            --syscall-ops N
                   stop after N system calls

            --sycsall-top N
                   report the fastest top N system calls. Setting N to zero will report all the system calls that could be exercised.

       System information stressor
            --sysinfo N
                   start N workers that continually read system and process specific information.  This reads the process user and system times using the times(2) system call.  For Linux systems, it also
                   reads overall system statistics using the sysinfo(2) system call and also the file system statistics for all mounted file systems using statfs(2).

            --sysinfo-ops N
                   stop the sysinfo workers after N bogo operations.

       System calls with invalid arguments stressor (Linux)
            --sysinval N
                   start N workers that exercise system calls in random order with permutations of invalid arguments to force kernel error handling checks. The stress test autodetects system  calls  that
                   cause  processes to crash or exit prematurely and will blocklist these after several repeated breakages. System call arguments that cause system calls to work successfully are also de‐
                   tected an blocklisted too.  Linux only.

            --sysinval-ops N
                   stop sysinval workers after N system call attempts.

       /sys stressor (Linux)
            --sysfs N
                   start N workers that recursively read files from /sys (Linux only).  This may cause specific kernel drivers to emit messages into the kernel log.

            --sysfs-ops N
                   stop sysfs reading after N bogo read operations. Note, since the number of entries may vary between kernels, this bogo ops metric is probably very misleading.

       Tee stressor (Linux)
            --tee N
                   move data from a writer process to a reader process through pipes and to /dev/null without any copying between kernel address space and user address space using tee(2).  This  is  only
                   available for Linux.

            --tee-ops N
                   stop after N bogo tee operations.

       Timer event stressor (Linux)
            -T N, --timer N
                   start  N  workers creating timer events at a default rate of 1 MHz (Linux only); this can create a many thousands of timer clock interrupts. Each timer event is caught by a signal han‐
                   dler and counted as a bogo timer op.

            --timer-freq F
                   run timers at F Hz; range from 1 to 1000000000 Hz (Linux only). By selecting an appropriate frequency stress-ng can generate hundreds of thousands of interrupts per second.   Note:  it
                   is also worth using --timer-slack 0 for high frequencies to stop the kernel from coalescing timer events.

            --timer-ops N
                   stop timer stress workers after N bogo timer events (Linux only).

            --timer-rand
                   select a timer frequency based around the timer frequency ±12.5% random jitter. This tries to force more variability in the timer interval to make the scheduling less predictable.

       Timerfd stressor (Linux)
            --timerfd N
                   start  N  workers creating timerfd events at a default rate of 1 MHz (Linux only); this can create a many thousands of timer clock events. Timer events are waited for on the timer file
                   descriptor using select(2) and then read and counted as a bogo timerfd op.

            --timerfs-fds N
                   try to use a maximum of N timerfd file descriptors per stressor.

            --timerfd-freq F
                   run timers at F Hz; range from 1 to 1000000000 Hz (Linux only). By selecting an appropriate frequency stress-ng can generate hundreds of thousands of interrupts per second.

            --timerfd-ops N
                   stop timerfd stress workers after N bogo timerfd events (Linux only).

            --timerfd-rand
                   select a timerfd frequency based around the timer frequency ±12.5% random jitter. This tries to force more variability in the timer interval to make the scheduling less predictable.

       Time warp stressor
            --time-warp N
                   start N workers that read the system time and where appropriate for monotonic clocks perform a check for reverse time warping. At the end of the run there are time wrap-around  checks.
                   This stressor exercises clock_gettime(2) on all available clocks, gettimeofday(2), time(2) and getrusage(2) to check for unexpected time behaviour. Note that only some clocks are reli‐
                   ably monotonic.

            --time-warp-ops N
                   stop after N rounds of checking all the available clocks and time fetching system calls.

       Translation lookaside buffer shootdowns stressor
            --tlb-shootdown N
                   start  N  workers that force Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) shootdowns.  This is achieved by creating up to 16 child processes that all share a region of memory and these processes
                   are shared amongst the available CPUs.  The processes adjust the page mapping settings causing TLBs to be force flushed on the other processors, causing the TLB shootdowns.

            --tlb-shootdown-ops N
                   stop after N bogo TLB shootdown operations are completed.

       Tmpfs stressor
            --tmpfs N
                   start N workers that create a temporary file on an available tmpfs file system and perform various file based mmap operations upon it.

            --tmpfs-mmap-async
                   enable file based memory mapping and use asynchronous msync'ing on each page, see --tmpfs-mmap-file.

            --tmpfs-mmap-file
                   enable tmpfs file based memory mapping and by default use synchronous msync'ing on each page.

            --tmpfs-ops N
                   stop tmpfs stressors after N bogo mmap operations.

       Touching files stressor
            --touch N
                   touch files by using open(2) or creat(2) and then closing and unlinking them. The filename contains the bogo-op number and is incremented on each touch operation, hence this fills  the
                   dentry  cache.  Note  that the user time and system time may be very low as most of the run time is waiting for file I/O and this produces very large bogo-op rates for the very low CPU
                   time used.

            --touch-method [ random | open | creat ]
                   select the method the file is created, either randomly using open(2) or create(2), just using open(2) with the O_CREAT open flag, or with creat(2).

            --touch-ops N
                   stop the touch workers after N file touches.

            --touch-opts all, direct, dsync, excl, noatime, sync
                   specify various file open options as a comma separated list. Options are as follows:

                   Option    Description
                   all       use all the open options, namely direct, dsync, excl, noatime and sync
                   direct    try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and from this file, using the O_DIRECT open flag.
                   dsync     ensure output has been transferred to underlying hardware and file metadata has been updated using the O_DSYNC open flag.
                   excl      fail if file already exists (it should not).
                   noatime   do not update the file last access time if the file is read.
                   sync      ensure output has been transferred to underlying hardware using the O_SYNC open flag.

       Tree data structures stressor
            --tree N
                   start N workers that exercise tree data structures. The default is to add, find and remove 250000 64 bit integers into AVL (avl), Red-Black (rb), Splay (splay), btree and binary trees.
                   The intention of this stressor is to exercise memory and cache with the various tree operations.

            --tree-method [ all | avl | binary | btree | rb | splay ]
                   specify the tree to be used. By default, all the trees are used (the `all' option).

            --tree-ops N
                   stop tree stressors after N bogo ops. A bogo op covers the addition, finding and removing all the items into the tree(s).

            --tree-size N
                   specify the size of the tree, where N is the number of 64 bit integers to be added into the tree.

       Trigonometric functions stressor
            --trig N
                   start N workers that exercise sin, cos, sincos (where available) and tan libm trigonometric functions using float, double and long double floating point variants. Each function is  ex‐
                   ercised 10000 times per bogo-operation.

            --trig-method function
                   specify  a trigonometric stress function. By default, all the functions are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one function to be used if required.  Available options
                   are as follows:

                   Method   Description
                   all      iterate through all of the following trigonometric functions
                   cos      cosine (double precision)
                   cosf     cosine (float precision)
                   cosl     cosine (long double precision)
                   sin      sine (double precision)
                   sinf     sine (float precision)
                   sinl     sine (long double precision)
                   sincos   sine and cosine (double precision)
                   sincosf  sine and cosine (float precision)
                   sincosl  sine and cosine (long double precision)
                   tan      tangent (double precision)
                   tanf     tangent (float precision)
                   tanl     tangent (long double precision)

            --trig-ops N
                   stop after N bogo-operations.

       Time stamp counter (TSC) stressor
            --tsc N
                   start N workers that read the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) 256 times per loop iteration (bogo operation).  This exercises the tsc instruction for x86, the mftb instruction for  ppc64,  the
                   rdcycle instruction for RISC-V, the tick instruction on SPARC and the rdtime.d instruction for Loong64.

            --tsc-lfence
                   add lfence after each tsc read to force serialization (x86 only).

            --tsc-ops N
                   stop the tsc workers after N bogo operations are completed.

            --tsc-rdtscp
                   use the rdtscp instruction instead of rdtsc (x86 only). This also disables the --tsc-lfence option.

       Binary tree stressor
            --tsearch N
                   start  N  workers that insert, search and delete 32 bit integers on a binary tree using tsearch(3), tfind(3) and tdelete(3). By default, there are 65536 randomized integers used in the
                   tree.  This is a useful method to exercise random access of memory and processor cache.

            --tsearch-ops N
                   stop the tsearch workers after N bogo tree operations are completed.

            --tsearch-size N
                   specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to tsearch. Size can be from 1 K to 4 M.

       Network tunnel stressor
            --tun N
                   start N workers that create a network tunnel device and sends and receives packets over the tunnel using UDP and then destroys it. A new random 192.168.*.* IPv4 address  is  used  each
                   time a tunnel is created.

            --tun-ops N
                   stop after N iterations of creating/sending/receiving/destroying a tunnel.

            --tun-tap
                   use network tap device using level 2 frames (bridging) rather than a tun device for level 3 raw packets (tunnelling).

       UDP network stressor
            --udp N
                   start N workers that transmit data using UDP. This involves a pair of client/server processes performing rapid connect, send and receives and disconnects on the local host.

            --udp-domain D
                   specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4 and ipv6 are supported.

            --udp-gro
                   enable UDP-GRO (Generic Receive Offload) if supported.

            --udp-if NAME
                   use network interface NAME. If the interface NAME does not exist, is not up or does not support the domain then the loopback (lo) interface is used as the default.

            --udp-lite
                   use the UDP-Lite (RFC 3828) protocol (only for ipv4 and ipv6 domains).

            --udp-ops N
                   stop udp stress workers after N bogo operations.

            --udp-port P
                   start at port P. For N udp worker processes, ports P to P − 1 are used. By default, ports 7000 upwards are used.

       UDP flooding stressor
            --udp-flood N
                   start N workers that attempt to flood the host with UDP packets to random ports. The IP address of the packets are currently not spoofed. This is only available on systems that support
                   AF_PACKET.

            --udp-flood-domain D
                   specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4 and ipv6 are supported.

            --udp-flood-if NAME
                   use network interface NAME. If the interface NAME does not exist, is not up or does not support the domain then the loopback (lo) interface is used as the default.

            --udp-flood-ops N
                   stop udp-flood stress workers after N bogo operations.

       File umask stressor
            --umask N
                   start  N  workers  that  exercise setting umask and creating/fstat'ing/closing/unlinking a file and checking the file mode is set correctly. This exercises umask mask values from octal
                   0000 to 0777 inclusive.

            --umask-ops N
                   stop after N rounds of exercising umask values 0000 to 0777.

       Umount stressor
            --umount N
                   start N workers that exercise mounting and racying unmounting of small tmpfs and ramfs file systems. Three child processes are invoked, one to mount, another  to  force  umount  and  a
                   third to exercise /proc/mounts. Small random delays are used between mount and umount calls to try to trigger race conditions on the umount calls.

            --umount-ops N
                   stop umount workers after N successful bogo mount/umount operations.

       Unlink stressor
            --unlink N
                   start  N workers that each run 4 processes per worker that create, open, unlink and close 1024 files in randomized order to exercise unlinking (removal) of files. This attempts to cre‐
                   ate races on file creation, linking and unlinking.

            --unlink-ops N
                   stop after N bogo rounds of unlink operations on 1024 files by the controlling worker.

       Unshare stressor (Linux)
            --unshare N
                   start N workers that each fork off 32 child processes, each of which exercises the unshare(2) system call by disassociating parts of the process execution context. (Linux only).

            --unshare-ops N
                   stop after N bogo unshare operations.

       Uprobe stressor (Linux)
            --uprobe N
                   start N workers that trace the entry to libc function getpid(2) using the Linux uprobe kernel tracing mechanism. This requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities and a modern Linux uprobe  ca‐
                   pable kernel.

            --uprobe-ops N
                   stop uprobe tracing after N trace events of the function that is being traced.

       /dev/urandom stressor (Linux)
            -u N, --urandom N
                   start N workers reading /dev/urandom (Linux only). This will load the kernel random number source.

            --urandom-ops N
                   stop urandom stress workers after N urandom bogo read operations (Linux only).

       Page faults stressor (Linux)
            --userfaultfd N
                   start  N  workers  that generate write page faults on a small anonymously mapped memory region and handle these faults using the user space fault handling via the userfaultfd(2) mecha‐
                   nism.  This will generate a large quantity of major page faults and also context switches during the handling of the page faults.  (Linux only).

            --userfaultfd-bytes N
                   mmap N bytes per userfaultfd worker to page fault on, the default is 16 MB.  One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes us‐
                   ing the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --userfaultfd-ops N
                   stop userfaultfd stress workers after N page faults.

       SYGSYS stressor
            --usersyscall N
                   start N workers that exercise the Linux prctl userspace system call mechanism. A userspace system call is handled by a SIGSYS signal handler and exercised with the system call disabled
                   (ENOSYS) and enabled (via SIGSYS) using prctl PR_SET_SYSCALL_USER_DISPATCH.

            --usersyscall-ops N
                   stop after N successful userspace syscalls via a SIGSYS signal handler.

       File timestamp stressor
            --utime N
                   start N workers updating file timestamps. This is mainly CPU bound when the default is used as the system flushes metadata changes only periodically.

            --utime-fsync
                   force metadata changes on each file timestamp update to be flushed to disk.  This forces the test to become I/O bound and will result in many dirty metadata writes.

            --utime-ops N
                   stop utime stress workers after N utime bogo operations.

       Virtual dynamic shared object stressor
            --vdso N
                   start N workers that repeatedly call each of the system call functions in the vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object).  The vDSO is a shared library that the kernel maps into the  address
                   space of all user-space applications to allow fast access to kernel data to some system calls without the need of performing an expensive system call.

            --vdso-func F
                   Instead  of calling all the vDSO functions, just call the vDSO function F. The functions depend on the kernel being used, but are typically clock_gettime(2), getcpu(2), gettimeofday(2)
                   and time(2).

            --vdso-ops N
                   stop after N vDSO functions calls.

       Vector integer comparison operations stressor
            --veccmp N
                   start N workers that perform various unsigned integer math comparison operations on various 128 bit vectors. A mix of integer vector comparison operations are performed on the  follow‐
                   ing vectors: 16 × 8 bits, 8 × 16 bits, 4 × 32 bits, 2 × 64 bits and if supported 1 × 128 bits. The metrics produced by this mix depend on the processor architecture and the vector math
                   optimisations produced by the compiler.

            --veccmp-ops N
                   stop after N bogo vector integer comparison operations.

       Vector floating point operations stressor
            --vecfp N
                   start  N  workers that exericise floating point (single and double precision) addition, multiplication, division and negation on vectors of 128, 64, 32, 16 and 8 floating point values.
                   The -v option will show the approximate throughput in millions of floating pointer operations per second for each operation.  For x86, the gcc/clang target clones  attribute  has  been
                   used to produced vector optimizations for a range of mmx, sse, avx and processor features.

            --vecfp-method method
                   specify a vecfp stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if required.

                   doublev8neg    negation of a vector of 8 double precision floating point values

            --vecfp-ops N
                   stop  after  N  vector  floating  point bogo-operations. Each bogo-op is equivalent to 65536 loops of 2 vector operations. For example, one bogo-op on a 16 wide vector is equivalent to
                   65536 × 2 × 16 floating point operations.

       Vector math operations stressor
            --vecmath N
                   start N workers that perform various unsigned integer math operations on various 128 bit vectors. A mix of vector math operations are performed on the following vectors: 16 × 8 bits, 8
                   × 16 bits, 4 × 32 bits, 2 × 64 bits and where supported 1 × 128 bits. The metrics produced by this mix depend on the processor architecture and the vector math  optimisations  produced
                   by the compiler.

            --vecmath-ops N
                   stop after N bogo vector integer math operations.

       Shuffled vector math operations stressor
            --vecshuf N
                   start N workers that shuffle data on various 64 byte vectors comprised of 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 bit unsigned integers. The integers are shuffled around the vector with 4 shuffle opera‐
                   tions  per loop, 65536 loops make up one bogo-op of shuffling. The data shuffling rates and shuffle operation rates are logged when using the -v option.  This stressor exercises vector
                   load, shuffle/permute, packing/unpacking and store operations.

            --vecshuf-method method
                   specify a vector shuffling stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if required.

                   Method  Description
                   all     iterate through all of the following vector methods
                   u8x64   shuffle a vector of 64 unsigned 8 bit integers
                   u16x32  shuffle a vector of 32 unsigned 16 bit integers
                   u32x16  shuffle a vector of 16 unsigned 32 bit integers
                   u64x8   shuffle a vector of 8 unsigned 64 bit integers
                   u128x4  shuffle a vector of 4 unsigned 128 bit integers (when supported)

            --vecshuf-ops N
                   stop after N bogo vector shuffle ops. One bogo-op is equavlent of 4 × 65536 vector shuffle operations on 64 bytes of vector data.

       Wide vector math operations stressor
            --vecwide N
                   start N workers that perform various 8 bit math operations on vectors of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 bytes. With the -v option the relative  compute  performance  vs
                   the  expected  compute performance based on total run time is shown for the first vecwide worker. The vecwide stressor exercises various processor vector instruction mixes and how well
                   the compiler can map the vector operations to the target instruction set.

            --vecwide-ops N
                   stop after N bogo vector operations (2048 iterations of a mix of vector instruction operations).

       File based authenticy protection (verity) stressor
            --verity N
                   start N workers that exercise read-only file based authenticy protection using the verity ioctls FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY and FS_IOC_MEASURE_VERITY.  This requires file systems with verity
                   support (currently ext4 and f2fs on Linux) with the verity feature enabled. The test attempts to creates a small file with multiple small extents and enables verity  on  the  file  and
                   verifies it. It also checks to see if the file has verity enabled with the FS_VERITY_FL bit set on the file flags.

            --verity-ops N
                   stop the verity workers after N file create, enable verity, check verity and unlink cycles.

       vfork stressor
            --vfork N
                   start N workers continually vforking children that immediately exit.

            --vfork-max P
                   create P processes and then wait for them to exit per iteration. The default is just 1; higher values will create many temporary zombie processes that are waiting to be reaped. One can
                   potentially fill up the process table using high values for --vfork-max and --vfork.

            --vfork-ops N
                   stop vfork stress workers after N bogo operations.

       vfork processes as much as possible stressor
            --vforkmany N
                   start  N  workers  that spawn off a chain of vfork children until the process table fills up and/or vfork fails.  vfork can rapidly create child processes and the parent process has to
                   wait until the child dies, so this stressor rapidly fills up the process table.

            --vforkmany-ops N
                   stop vforkmany stressors after N vforks have been made.

            --vforkmany-vm
                   enable detrimental performance virtual memory advice using madvise(2) on all pages of the vforked process. Where possible this will try to set every page in the new process with  using
                   madvise(2) MADV_MERGEABLE, MADV_WILLNEED, MADV_HUGEPAGE and MADV_RANDOM flags. Linux only.

            --vforkmany-vm-bytes N
                   mmap  N  bytes per vm worker for more memory pressure, the default is 64 MB. This also enables the --vforkmany-vm option.  One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in
                   units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

       Memory allocate and write stressor
            -m N, --vm N
                   start N workers continuously calling mmap(2)/munmap(2) and writing to the allocated memory. Note that this can cause systems to trip the kernel OOM  killer  on  Linux  systems  if  not
                   enough physical memory and swap is not available.

            --vm-bytes N
                   mmap N bytes in total, this is shared by each vm worker, the default is 256 MB.  One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes
                   using the suffix b, k, m or g.

            --vm-flush
                   cache flush mapped memory after each memory region has been completely written to.

            --vm-hang N
                   sleep N seconds before unmapping memory, the default is zero seconds.  Specifying 0 will do an infinite wait.

            --vm-keep
                   do not continually unmap and map memory, just keep on re-writing to it.

            --vm-locked
                   Lock the pages of the mapped region into memory using mmap MAP_LOCKED (since Linux 2.5.37).  This is similar to locking memory as described in mlock(2).

            --vm-madvise advice
                   Specify the madvise `advice' option used on the memory mapped regions used in the vm stressor. Non-linux systems will only have the `normal' madvise advice, linux systems support `col‐
                   lapse',  `dontneed',  `hugepage',  `mergeable'  , `nohugepage', `normal', `random', `sequential', `unmergeable' and `willneed' advice. If this option is not used then the default is to
                   pick random madvise advice for each mmap call. See madvise(2) for more details.

            --vm-method method
                   specify a vm stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if required.  Each of the vm workers  have
                   3 phases:

                   1. Initialised. The anonymously memory mapped region is set to a known pattern.

                   2. Exercised. Memory is modified in a known predictable way. Some vm workers alter memory sequentially, some use small or large strides to step along memory.

                   3. Checked. The modified memory is checked to see if it matches the expected result.

                   The  vm methods containing `prime' in their name have a stride of the largest prime less than 2↑64, allowing to them to thoroughly step through memory and touch all locations just once
                   while also doing without touching memory cells next to each other. This strategy exercises the cache and page non-locality.

                   Since the memory being exercised is virtually mapped then there is no guarantee of touching page addresses in any particular physical order.  These workers should not be used  to  test
                   that all the system's memory is working correctly either, use tools such as memtest86 instead.

                   The vm stress methods are intended to exercise memory in ways to possibly find memory issues and to try to force thermal errors.

                   Available vm stress methods are described as follows:

                   Method        Description
                   all           iterate over all the vm stress methods as listed below.
                   cache-lines   work  through  memory  in  64 byte cache sized steps writing a single byte per cache line. Once the write is complete, the memory is read to verify the values are written
                                 correctly.
                   cache-stripe  work through memory in 64 byte cache sized chunks, writing in ascending address order on even offsets and descending address order on odd offsets.
                   checkboard    work through memory writing alternative zero/one bit values into memory in a mixed checkerboard pattern. Memory is swapped around to ensure every bit is read, bit flipped
                                 and re-written and then re-read for verification.
                   flip          sequentially work through memory 8 times, each time just one bit in memory flipped (inverted). This will effectively invert each byte in 8 passes.
                   fwdrev        write to even addressed bytes in a forward direction and odd addressed bytes in reverse direction. rhe contents are sanity checked once all the addresses have been  writ‐
                                 ten to.
                   galpat-0      galloping  pattern  zeros.  This sets all bits to 0 and flips just 1 in 4096 bits to 1. It then checks to see if the 1s are pulled down to 0 by their neighbours or of the
                                 neighbours have been pulled up to 1.
                   galpat-1      galloping pattern ones. This sets all bits to 1 and flips just 1 in 4096 bits to 0. It then checks to see if the 0s are pulled up to 1  by  their  neighbours  or  of  the
                                 neighbours have been pulled down to 0.
                   gray          fill the memory with sequential gray codes (these only change 1 bit at a time between adjacent bytes) and then check if they are set correctly.
                   grayflip      fill memory with adjacent bytes of gray code and inverted gray code pairs to change as many bits at a time between adjacent bytes and check if these are set correctly.
                   incdec        work sequentially through memory twice, the first pass increments each byte by a specific value and the second pass decrements each byte back to the original start value.
                                 The increment/decrement value changes on each invocation of the stressor.
                   inc-nybble    initialise  memory  to  a set value (that changes on each invocation of the stressor) and then sequentially work through each byte incrementing the bottom 4 bits by 1 and
                                 the top 4 bits by 15.

                   modulo-x      fill memory over 23 iterations. Each iteration starts one byte further along from the start of the memory and steps along in 23 byte strides. In each  stride,  the  first
                                 byte  is  set  to  a random pattern and all other bytes are set to the inverse.  Then it checks see if the first byte contains the expected random pattern. This exercises

                                 again check if the memory is set as expected.
                   mscan         fill each bit in each byte with 1s then check these are set, fill each bit in each byte with 0s and check these are clear.
                   one-zero      set all memory bits to one and then check if any bits are not one. Next, set all the memory bits to zero and check if any bits are not zero.

                                 to see if all bits are set to zero.
                   prime-gray-1  first  step through memory in very large prime strides setting just on bit (based on a gray code) in every byte. Next, repeat this but set the other 7 bits. Then check to

                   prime-incdec  step through memory in large prime steps incrementing bytes and then re-do again decrementing bytes.
                   rand-set      sequentially work through memory in 64 bit chunks setting bytes in the chunk to the same 8 bit random value.  The random value changes on each chunk.  Check that the val‐
                                 ues have not changed.
                   rand-sum      sequentially set all memory to random values and then summate the number of bits that have changed from the original set values.
                   read64        sequentially read memory using 32 × 64 bit reads per bogo loop. Each loop equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises raw memory reads.

                   rowhammer     try to force memory corruption using the rowhammer memory stressor. This fetches two 32 bit integers from memory and forces a cache flush on the  two  addresses  multiple
                                 times. This has been known to force bit flipping on some hardware, especially with lower frequency memory refresh cycles.
                   swap          fill memory in 64 byte chunks with random patterns. Then swap each 64 chunk with a randomly chosen chunk. Finally, reverse the swap to put the chunks back to their origi‐
                                 nal place and check if the data is correct. This exercises adjacent and random memory load/stores.
                   walk-0a       in  the  given memory mapping, work through a range of specially chosen addresses working through address lines to see if any address lines are stuck low. This works best
                                 with physical memory addressing, however, exercising these virtual addresses has some value too.
                   walk-0d       for each byte in memory, walk through each data line setting them to low (and the others are set high) and check that the written value is as expected. This checks if any

            --wait N
                   start N workers that spawn off two children; one spins in a pause(2) loop, the other continually stops and continues the first. The controlling process waits on the first child  to  be
                   resumed by the delivery of SIGCONT using waitpid(2) and waitid(2).

                   yield, mdoio and mdooom instructions are used. For RISC-V the pause instruction is used. For Loong64 the dbar instruction is used. For other architectures no-op instructions are used.

                   stop after N bogo processor wait operations.

       Watchdog stressor
            --watchdog N
                   start N workers that exercising the /dev/watchdog watchdog interface by opening it, perform various watchdog specific ioctl(2) commands on the device and close it.  Before closing  the
                   special  watchdog magic close message is written to the device to try and force it to never trip a watchdog reboot after the stressor has been run.  Note that this stressor needs to be
                   run as root with the --pathological option and is only available on Linux.

            --watchdog-ops N
                   stop after N bogo operations on the watchdog device.

       Libc wide characterstring function stressor
            --wcs N
                   start N workers that exercise various libc wide character string functions on random strings.

            --wcs-method wcsfunc
                   select a specific libc wide character string function to stress. Available string functions to stress are: all,  wcscasecmp,  wcscat,  wcschr,  wcscoll,  wcscmp,  wcscpy,  wcslen,  wc‐
                   sncasecmp, wcsncat, wcsncmp, wcsrchr and wcsxfrm.  The `all' method is the default and will exercise all the string methods.

            --wcs-ops N
                   stop after N bogo wide character string operations.

       scheduler workload stressor
            --workload N
                   start  N  workers  that exercise the scheduler with items of work that are started at random times with random sleep delays between work items. By default a 100000 microsecond slice of
                   time has 100 work items that start at random times during the slice. The work items by default run for a quanta of 1000 microseconds scaled by the  percentage  work  load  (default  of
                   30%).   For a slice of S microseconds and a work item quanta duration of Q microseconds, S / Q work items are executed per slice. For a work load of L percent, the run time per item is
                   the quanta Q × L / 100 microseconds.  The --workload-threads option allows work items to be taken from a queue and run concurrently if the scheduling run times overlap.
                   If a work item is already running when a new work item is scheduled to run then the new work item is delayed and starts directly after the completion of the currently running work item
                   when running with the default of zero worker threads.  This emulates bursty scheduled compute, such as handling input packets where one may have lots of work items bunched together  or
                   with random unpredictable delays between work items.

            --workload-load L
                   specify the percentage run time load of each work item with respect to the run quanta duration. Essentially the run duration of each work item is the quanta duration Q × L / 100.

            --workload-method method
                   select the workload method. Each quanta of execution time is consumed using a tight spin-loop executing a workload method. The available methods are described as follows:

                   Method  Description
                   all                  randomly select any one of all the following methods:
                   fma                  perform multiply-add operations, on modern processors these may be compiled into fused-multiply-add instructions.

            --workload-sched [ batch | deadline | fifo | idle | other | rr ]
                   select scheduling policy. Note that deadline, fifo and rr require root privilege.

            --workload-slice-us S
                   specify the duration of each scheduling slice in microseconds. The default is 100000 microseconds (0.1 seconds).

            --workload-quanta-us Q
                   specify the duration of each work item in microseconds. The default is 1000 microseconds (1 millisecond).

            --workload-threads N
                   use N process threads to take scheduler work items of a workqueue and run the work item (default is 2). When N is 0, no threads are used and the work items are run back-to-back sequen‐
                   tially without using work queue. Using more than 2 threads allows work items to be handled concurrently if enough idle processors are available.

            --workload-dist [ cluster | even | poisson | random1 | random2 | random3 ]
                   specify the scheduling distribution of work items, the default is cluster.  The distribution methods are described as follows:

                   Method   Description
                   cluster  cluster  2/3  of  the start times to try to start at the random time during the time slice, with the other 1/3 of start times evenly randomly distributed using a single random
                            variable. The clustered start times causes a burst of items to be scheduled in a bunch with no delays between each clustered work item.
                   even     evenly distribute scheduling start times across the workload slice
                   poisson  generate scheduling events that occur individually at random moments, but which tend to occur at an average rate (known as a Poisson process).
                   random1  evenly randomly distribute scheduling start times using a single random variable.
                   random2  randomly distribute scheduling start times using a sum of two random variables, much like throwing 2 dice.
                   random3  randomly distribute scheduling start times using a sum of three random variables, much like throwing 3 dice.

            --workload-ops N

                   Linux vsyscall handler. Only for Linux.

            --x86syscall-func F
                   Instead of exercising the 6 syscall system calls, just call the syscall function F. The function F must be one of getcpu, geteuid, getgid, getpid, gettimeofday or time.

            --x86syscall-ops N
                   stop after N x86syscall system calls.

       Extended file attributes stressor
            --xattr N

            --xattr-ops N
                   stop after N bogo extended attribute operations.

       Yield scheduling stressor
            -y N, --yield N
                   start  N  workers that call sched_yield(2). This stressor ensures that at least 2 child processes per CPU exercise shield_yield(2) no matter how many workers are specified, thus always
                   ensuring rapid context switching.

            --yield-ops N
                   stop yield stress workers after N sched_yield(2) bogo operations.

            --yield-procs N

            --yield-sched [ batch | deadline | fifo | idle | other | rr ]
                   select scheduling policy. Note that deadline, fifo and rr require root privilege.

       /dev/zero stressor
            --zero N
                   start N workers that exercise /dev/zero with read(2), lseek(2), ioctl(2) and mmap(2) calls. For just /dev/zero read benchmarking use the --zero-read option.

            --zero-ops N
                   stop zero stress workers after N /dev/zero bogo read operations.

            --zero-read
                   just read /dev/zero with 4 K reads with no additional exercising on /dev/zero.

       Zlib stressor
            --zlib N
                   start N workers compressing and decompressing random data using zlib. Each worker has two processes, one that compresses random data and pipes it to another process  that  decompresses
                   the data. This stressor exercises CPU, cache and memory.

            --zlib-level L
                   specify the compression level (0..9), where 0 = no compression, 1 = fastest compression and 9 = best compression.

            --zlib-mem-level L
                   specify the reserved compression state memory for zlib.  Default is 8.

                     9    maximum memory usage.

            --zlib-method method
                   specify  the  type  of random data to send to the zlib library.  By default, the data stream is created from a random selection of the different data generation processes.  However one
                   can specify just one method to be used if required.  Available zlib data generation methods are described as follows:

                   Method       Description
                   00ff         randomly distributed 0x00 and 0xFF values.

                   Once the maximum number of processes is reached (or fork fails because one has reached the maximum allowed number of children) the oldest child is reaped and a new process is then cre‐
                   ated in a first-in first-out manner, and then repeated.

            --zombie-max N
                   try to create as many as N zombie processes. This may not be reached if the system limit is less than N.

EXIT STATUS
         Status     Description
           0        Success.
           1        Error; incorrect user options or a fatal resource issue in the stress-ng stressor harness (for example, out of memory).
           2        One or more stressors failed.
           3        One or more stressors failed to initialise because of lack of resources, for example ENOMEM (no memory), ENOSPC (no space on file system) or a missing or unimplemented system call.
           4        One or more stressors were not implemented on a specific architecture or operating system.
           5        A stressor has been killed by an unexpected signal.
           6        A stressor exited by exit(2) which was not expected and timing metrics could not be gathered.
           7        The  bogo ops metrics maybe untrustworthy. This is most likely to occur when a stress test is terminated during the update of a bogo-ops counter such as when it has been OOM killed. A
                    less likely reason is that the counter ready indicator has been corrupted.

       Sending a SIGALRM, SIGINT or SIGHUP to stress-ng causes it to terminate all the stressor processes and ensures temporary files and shared memory segments are removed cleanly.

       Sending a SIGUSR2 to stress-ng will dump out the current load average and memory statistics.

       Note that the stress-ng cpu, io, vm and hdd tests are different implementations of the original stress tests and hence may produce different stress characteristics.

       The bogo operations metrics may change with each release  because of bug fixes to the code, new features, compiler optimisations, changes in support libraries or system call performance.
