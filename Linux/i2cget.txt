I2CGET(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  I2CGET(8)

NAME
       i2cget - read from I2C/SMBus chip registers

SYNOPSIS
       i2cget [-f] [-y] i2cbus chip-address [data-address [mode]]
       i2cget -V

DESCRIPTION
       i2cget  is a small helper program to read registers visible through the
       I2C bus (or SMBus).

OPTIONS
       -V     Display the version and exit.

       -f     Force access to the device  even  if  it  is  already  busy.  By
              default,  i2cget will refuse to access a device which is already
              under the control of a kernel driver. Using this flag is danger‐
              ous,  it can seriously confuse the kernel driver in question. It
              can also cause i2cget to return an invalid value. So use at your
              own risk and only if you know what you're doing.

       -y     Disable  interactive  mode.  By  default, i2cget will wait for a
              confirmation from the user before messing with the I2C bus. When
              this  flag is used, it will perform the operation directly. This
              is mainly meant to be used in scripts. Use with caution.

       There are two required options to i2cget. i2cbus indicates  the  number
       or name of the I2C bus to be scanned.  This number should correspond to
       one of the busses listed by i2cdetect -l.  chip-address  specifies  the
       address  of  the  chip  on that bus, and is an integer between 0x03 and
       0x77.

       data-address specifies the address on that chip to read from, and is an
       integer  between 0x00 and 0xFF. If omitted, the currently active regis‐
       ter will be read (if that makes sense for the considered chip).

       The mode parameter, if specified, is one of the letters b, w or c, cor‐
       responding  to  a read byte data, a read word data or a write byte/read
       byte transaction, respectively. A p can also be appended  to  the  mode
       parameter  to  enable  PEC.  If  the  mode parameter is omitted, i2cget
       defaults to a read byte data transaction, unless data-address  is  also
       omitted,  in  which  case the default (and only valid) transaction is a
       single read byte.

WARNING
       i2cget can be extremely dangerous if used improperly. I2C and SMBus are
       designed  in such a way that an SMBus read transaction can be seen as a
       write transaction by certain chips. This is particularly true  if  set‐
       ting  mode  to cp (write byte/read byte with PEC). Be extremely careful
       using this program.

EXAMPLES
       Get the value of 8-bit register 0x11 of the I2C device at 7-bit address
       0x2d on bus 1 (i2c-1), after user confirmation:
              # i2cget 1 0x2d 0x11

       Get  the  value  of  16-bit  register  0x00  of the I2C device at 7-bit
       address 0x48 on bus 1 (i2c-1), after user confirmation:
              # i2cget 1 0x48 0x00 w

       Set the internal pointer register of a 24C02 EEPROM  at  7-bit  address
       0x50  on  bus  9 (i2c-9) to 0x00, then read the first 2 bytes from that
       EEPROM:
              # i2cset -y 9 0x50 0x00 ; i2cget -y 9 0x50 ; i2cget -y 9 0x50
       This assumes that the  device  automatically  increments  its  internal
       pointer  register  on  every  read, and supports read byte transactions
       (read without specifying the register address, "Receive Byte" in  SMBus
       terminology.)   Most  EEPROM devices behave that way. Note that this is
       only safe as long as nobody else is accessing the  I2C  device  at  the
       same  time. A safer approach would be to use a "Read Word" SMBus trans‐
       action instead, or an I2C Block Read transaction to read  more  than  2
       bytes.

       Set  the  internal  pointer register of a 24C32 EEPROM at 7-bit address
       0x53 on bus 9 (i2c-9) to 0x0000, then read the first 2 bytes from  that
       EEPROM:
              # i2cset -y 9 0x53 0x00 0x00 ; i2cget -y 9 0x53 ; i2cget -y 9 0x53
       This  again assumes that the device automatically increments its inter‐
       nal pointer register on every read, and  supports  read  byte  transac‐
       tions.  While  the  previous example was for a small EEPROM using 8-bit
       internal addressing, this example is for a larger EEPROM  using  16-bit
       internal addressing. Beware that running this command on a small EEPROM
       using 8-bit internal addressing would actually write 0x00 to the  first
       byte of that EEPROM. The safety concerns raised above still stand, how‐
       ever in this case there is no SMBus equivalent, so this is the only way
       to  read  data from a large EEPROM if your master isn't fully I2C capa‐
       ble. With a fully I2C capable master,  you  would  use  i2ctransfer  to
       achieve the same in a safe and faster way.
