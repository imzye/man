NAME
       tolua++5.1 - lua language binding development helper program

SYNOPSIS
       tolua++5.1 [ options ] input_file

DESCRIPTION
       tolua++5.1 is a program to help in building applications using the tolua++5.1 library for the Lua scripting language.

OPTIONS
       Command line options are:

       -v     Print version information.

       -o file
              Set output file; default is stdout.

       -H file
              Create include file.

       -n name
              Set package name; default is input file root name.

       -p     Parse only.

       -P     Parse and print structure information (for debugging).

       -S     disable support for c++ strings

       -1     substract 1 to operator[] index (for compatibility with tolua5)

       -L file
              run lua file (with dofile()) before doing anything

       -D     disable automatic exporting of destructors for classes that have constructors (for compatibility with tolua5)

       -W     disable warnings for unsupported features (for compatibility with tolua5)

       -C     disable cleanup of included lua code (for easier debugging)

       -E value[=value]
              add extra values to the luastate

       -t     export a list of types asociates with the C++ typeid name

       -q     don't print warnings to the console

       -h     Print usage information.

       Should the input file be omitted, stdin is assumed; in that case, the package name must be explicitly set.
