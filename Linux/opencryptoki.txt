NAME
       openCryptoki - A PKCS#11 implementation.

DESCRIPTION
       openCryptoki  is an implementation of the PKCS#11 API standard. It provides an interface to the functions of underlying cryptographic tokens, which may be implemented via software or hardware. The
       PKCS#11 specification has been released by RSA Labs. More information on PKCS#11 can be found on the RSA labs website: http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs.

       To use openCryptoki, run the pkcsslotd daemon. The daemon will read the opencryptoki.conf file to collect information about the tokens and their slots.

       Use the pkcsconf utility to further configure openCryptoki once the daemon is running.

SECURITY NOTE
       All non-root users that require access to PKCS#11 tokens using openCryptoki must be assigned to the pkcs11 group to be able to communicate with the  pkcsslotd  daemon.  Only  fully  trusted  users
       should be granted membership in the group. Group members can block other openCryptoki users from accessing PKCS#11 tokens.
