NAME
       rotate - Rotate, mirror, and transpose JPEG images (losslessly whenever possible)

SYNOPSIS
       rotate { options } file [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       rotate is a convenience frontend to jpegtran, allowing JPEG images to be rotated, mirrored, or transposed in several ways.  These operations are conducted losslessly (i.e., no image recompression)
       and keep all EXIF metadata intact.

OPTIONS
       -f, -flip, --flip {horizontal | vertical}
              horizontal: Mirror image horizontally (left-right).
              vertical  : Mirror image vertically (top-bottom).

       -r, -rotate, --rotate {90 | 180 | 270}
              90 : Rotate image 90 degrees clockwise.
              180: Rotate image 180 degrees.
              270: Rotate image 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 ccw).

       -tp, -transpose, --transpose
              Transpose image (across UL-to-LR axis).

       -tv, -transverse, --transverse]
              Transverse transpose (across UR-to-LL axis).
