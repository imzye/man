CLAWS-MAIL-CLAMD-PLUGIN(7)                                                                       Claws Mail                                                                      CLAWS-MAIL-CLAMD-PLUGIN(7)

NAME
       claws-mail-clamd-plugin - scan mails for virus with ClamAV

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-clamd-plugin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-clamd-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claw Mail mailer.

       This plugin allows scanning of mails using the Clam AntiVirus.

       Due license restrictions no clamav library is used and it is required that the ClamAV daemon (clamd) is running on some computer, either localhost or a remote one. Mails to be scanned and scanning
       results will be sent to and received from this daemon using a socket.

       This may impose additional requirements for your home folder and Claws Mail resource folder (~/.claws-mail): global executable permission must be given to these folders if clamd is configured to
       use a Unix socket.

       To avoid changing permissions clamd can be configured to use a TCP socket instead, but notice that this requires enabling manual configuration in claws-mail-clamd-plugin.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named clamd.so, and press the “Open”
       button.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       Giving global executable permissions to your home and ~/.claws-mail folders allows other users of the system to browse the content of these folders. This may not be what you want, specially on
       shared machines.

SEE ALSO
       chmod(1), claws-mail(1), claws-mail-extra-plugins(7), clamd(8).
