NAME
       nmstate-autoconf - A nmstate command line tool to automatically config‐
       ure the network state using LLDP information

SYNOPSIS
       nmstate-autoconf [INTERFACE_NAME] [--dry-run]

DESCRIPTION
       nmstate-autoconf is a command line tool that uses libnmstate  in  order
       to  confgure  the  network  state automatically using LLDP information.
       This tool is experimental only.

       nmstate-autoconf will identify the interfaces connected to a  VLAN  and
       unify  them in a bond interface.  In addition, a vlan interface will be
       created in top of the bond.

       The bond state will be the following one:

       - name: bond50
         type: bond
         state: up
         link-aggregation:
           mode: balance-rr
           port:
           - enp4s0
           - enp4s0d1

       The host VLAN state will be the following one:

       - name: prod-net
         type: vlan
         state: up
         vlan:
           base-iface: bond50
           id: 50

       For multiple interface names, use comma to separate them. You can  also
       use patterns for interface names:
              * matches everything
              ? matches any single character
              [seq] matches any character in seq
              [!seq] matches any character not in seq

       For example, to enable LLDP auto configuration on all interfaces starts
       with eth:
              nmstate-autoconf eth\*
              # The backslash is required to stop shell expanding '*' to  file
              names.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run, -d
              Generate the network state that is going to be applied and print
              it out. It won't apply any changes in the host.

LIMITATIONS
       * This tool is experimental only.  * It is not  possible  to  configure
       automatically bond or vlan options.
