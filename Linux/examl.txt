OPTIONS
       -np NP NP is the number of processors to use for MPI.  If not specified some hopefully sensible guess is made.  This is a specific option of the Debian wrapper in /usr/bin.

       -a     use the median for the discrete approximation of the GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity

              DEFAULT: OFF

       -B     specify the number of best ML trees to save and print to file

       -c     Specify number of distinct rate catgories for ExaML when modelOfEvolution is set to GTRPSR Individual per-site rates are categorized into numberOfCategories rate  categories  to  accelerate
              computations.

              DEFAULT: 25

       -D     ML search convergence criterion. This will break off ML searches if the relative Robinson-Foulds distance between the trees obtained from two consecutive lazy SPR cycles is smaller or equal
              to  1%.  Usage  recommended  for very large datasets in terms of taxa.  On trees with more than 500 taxa this will yield execution time improvements of approximately 50% While yielding only
              slightly worse trees.

              DEFAULT: OFF

       -e     set model optimization precision in log likelihood units for final optimization of model parameters

              DEFAULT: 0.1

       -f     select algorithm:

       "-f d": new rapid hill-climbing
              DEFAULT: ON

              "-f e": compute the likelihood of a bunch of trees passed via -t

              this option will do a quick and dirty optimization without re-optimizng the model parameters for each tree

              "-f E": compute the likelihood of a bunch of trees passed via -t

              this option will do a thorough optimization that re-optimizes the model parameters for each tree

              "-f o": old and slower rapid hill-climbing without heuristic cutoff

              "-f q": fast quartet calculator

              DEFAULT for "-f": new rapid hill climbing

       -g     Pass a multi-furcating constraint tree to ExaML. The tree needs to contain all taxa of the alignment!  When using this option you also need to specify a random number seed via "-p"

       -h     Display this help message.

       -i     Initial rearrangement setting for the subsequent application of topological changes phase

       -I     Set after how many quartet evaluations a new checkpoint will be printed.

              DEFAULT: 1000

       -m     Model of rate heterogeneity

              select "-m PSR" for the per-site rate category model (this used to be called CAT in RAxML) select "-m GAMMA" for the gamma model of rate heterogeneity with 4 discrete rates

       -M     Switch on estimation of individual per-partition branch lengths. Only has effect when used in combination with "-q" Branch lengths for individual partitions  will  be  printed  to  separate
              files A weighted average of the branch lengths is computed by using the respective partition lengths

              DEFAULT: OFF

       -n     Specifies the name of the output file.

       -p     Specify a random number seed, required in conjunction with the "-g" option for constraint trees

       -R     read in a binary checkpoint file called ExaML_binaryCheckpoint.RUN_ID_number

       -r     Pass the number of quartets to randomly sub-sample from the possible number of quartets for the given taxon set.  Only works in combination with -f q !

       -s     Specify the name of the BINARY alignment data file generated by the parser component

       -S     turn  on  memory  saving  option for gappy multi-gene alignments. For large and gappy datasets specify -S to save memory This will produce slightly different likelihood values, may be a bit
              slower but can reduce memory consumption from 70GB to 19GB on very large and gappy datasets

       -t     Specify a user starting tree file name in Newick format

       -v     Display version information

       -w     FULL (!) path to the directory into which ExaML shall write its output files

              DEFAULT: current directory

       -Y     Pass a quartet grouping file name defining four groups from which to draw quartets The file input format must contain 4 groups in the following form: (Chicken, Human, Loach),  (Cow,  Carp),
              (Mouse, Rat, Seal), (Whale, Frog); Only works in combination with -f q !

       --auto-prot=ml|bic|aic|aicc When using automatic protein model selection you can chose the criterion for selecting these models.

              RAxML will test all available prot subst. models except for LG4M, LG4X and GTR-based models, with and without empirical base frequencies.  You can chose between ML score based selection and
              the BIC, AIC, and AICc criteria.

              DEFAULT: ml
