NAME
       dist - introduction to dist

DESCRIPTION
       The  dist  package  is  a set of tools meant to ease the construction and maintenance of portable software. There are four distinct parts in dist, and it is also meant to be used with two external
       products, which are publicly available: mailagent and patch.

       The first component is the Configure script generator, which is a portability tool. It is automatically build up by metaconfig from your sources and a set of units. Ideally, the end-user receiving
       your source code will simply have to read your README file, run the Configure script (which is self-documented), and then run make. Your package should then build cleanly on every UNIX platform.

       The second component is the Makefile.SH generator, which is a generic configured Makefile, reusing some of the information figured out by Configure.  Although you may write your own  Makefile  and
       then  use  makeSH to transform it into a Makefile.SH, it is better to write a generic Jmakefile description, which does not rely on a particular position within the source tree, and then use jmake
       to recursively build your Makefiles.

       The third component is the package generator, which is used when it's time to build up the shell archives used to distribute your program. Although you may use your own  archiving  mechanism,  the
       one  included  here knows about RCS files and will properly check out the lattest revisions, leaving your working files alone. The makedist program will also perform Copyright expansion, an useful
       feature when you share source files among more than one program, placed under distinct  Copyright information.

       The fourth and latest component is the patch generator, used to make updates of your sources, which can later be applied on the original distribution by using the patch program.

       Before using any of the dist programs, you should probably identify your package by running the packinit program, which will create a .package file in the top-level directory of your package.

COMMANDS
       The dist package implements the following commands (those tagged as library commands are to be found in the dist library and should not be made publicly available in everyone's path):

       bindex         builds the Index file (library).
       jmake          a Makefile.SH generator.
       jmkmf          bootstraps top-level Makefile.SH file.
       kitpost        posts distribution kits made by makedist.
       kitsend        sends distribution kits made by makedist.
       makeSH         wraps existing scripts into a .SH file.
       makedist       builds up distribution kits.
       makegloss      builds the Glossary file (library).

       metaxref       a metaconfig cross-reference builder.
       packinit       initializes a package (creates a  .package file).
       pat            main patch generator.
       patbase        resets patch base to current version.
       patcil         checks new version in.

       patcol         checks file out.
       patdiff        builds (contextual) diffs for the patch.
       patftp         copies patches to public ftp directory.
       patindex       builds a patch index.
       patlog         handles ChangeLog file updates.
       patmake        puts diffs together into a patch.
       patnotify      notifies users that new patches have been released.
       patpost        posts patch to some newsgroup.
       patsend        mails patch to some people.
       patsnap        builds a release snapshot with files and RCS revisions.

PROFILE
       Commands having a set of meaningful options (other than -h or -V) can also take arguments from the ~/.dist_profile file, or whatever file the DIST environment variable points to. Each line of  the
       file is in the format:

            profile-component: value

       with shell-style comments (#) allowed provided they start the line.

       Each  command  looks for a profile component entry matching its name and loads the value as if it were arguments specified on the command line. Those arguments precede any other argument specified
       manually, in case order is meaningful.

       Some commands may also be configured from within the profile, by setting a specific variable attached to the command by a profile entry looking like this:

            cmdname-variable: value

       For instance, assuming the variable c-files is recognized by the metaconfig program, its default value could be overwritten by this profile entry:

            metaconfig-c-files: suitable value

       Only the first '-' after the command name is part of the syntax, the other one used in the variable name is pure convention. Please refer to the manual page of each command for  a  list  of  valid
       profile variables which may be set.
