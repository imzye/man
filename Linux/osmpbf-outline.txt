NAME
       osmpbf-outline - outline the content of an .osm.pbf or .osh.pbf file

SYNOPSIS
       osmpbf-outline [ --color ] filename

DESCRIPTION
       osmpbf-outline  generates  a colored outline of an .osm.pbf or .osh.pbf file, revealing its inner structure.  It does not decode all information nor does it check for of possible mistakes, but it will
       warn on some bad mistakes one can make when generating .osm.pbf files.

       This tool can be used by authors of .osm.pbf readers and writers and is useful to understand the inner blob/block structure of .osm.pbf files.

       Its source code is heavily documented and can be used as a good starting point understanding on how to read and write .osm.pbf files with C++.

OPTIONS
       -c, --color
            usually colorization is disabled when writing to a file descriptor that is not a tty (eg. when the output is piped to a file or to a pager like more or less). Some pagers can  handle  ANSI  color
            code ( more can, less can when invoked as less -R ). To enforce colorization when working with such pagers, specify the --color flag.

EXAMPLES
       osmpbf-outline germany.osm.pbf
