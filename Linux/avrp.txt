NAME
       avrp - Atmel AVR programming software to use with Atmel's serial-port programmers

SYNOPSIS
       avrp [-s <serial port>] [-a <chip type>] [-prv] [-f <filename>]  [-e <filename>] [-d <deffile>] [-l <lockmode>] [--enable <fuse>] [--disable <fuse>] [--version] [--help] [-qIh]

DESCRIPTION
       avrp works on serial-port programmers which use Atmel's communication protocol for serial-port programmers.  These programmers can program AVR (and other) chips both in serial and parallel mode.

       These programmers are known:
           AVR ICP - Atmel In-circuit programmer
           AVR PPR - Atmel parallel programmer
           AVR DEV - Atmel development board
           AVR A.G - Parallel mode programmer by Adrian Godwin

       Adrian Godwin's programmer can be found on http://www.fangorn.demon.co.uk

       Instruction on how to build Atmel's in-circuit programmer can be found on Atmel's homepage (http://www.atmel.com). Look for application note avr910

       avrp is currently supporting these systems:
           Linux
           FreeBSD
           AmigaOS
           win32 (windows 95++ and NT)

       The source-code part of Atmel's application note AVR910 was used to determine how to communicate with these programmers.

OPTIONS
       Several option can be given after one '-', but if an option requires an argument; the argument must be given after that option.

       -s <serial port>
              Specifies which serial port to talk through.  This option can be avoided if you set the environment variable AVRP_SERIALPORT

       -a <chip type>
              Specifies what kind of chip to talk to.  Use '-a list' for chip type to get a list of supported devices.  You can use the shortest possible abbreviation to identify a chip.  This option can
              be avoided if you set the environment variable AVRP_AVRTYPE

       -p     Program a chip -f <filename> and/or -e <filename> must be specified to determine which files to read from.  (-f specifes flash, and -e eeprom)

       -r     Read a chip -f <filename> and/or -e <filename> must be specified to determine which files to write to.  (-f specifes flash, and -e eeprom)

       -v     Verify.   Performs  a  standalone  verify.  (The program function will always do a inline verify) -f <filename> and/or -e <filename> must be specified to determine which files to read from.
              (-f specifes flash, and -e eeprom)

       -f <filename>
              Specifies which flash-file to read/write.  Supportet formats are Intel HEX and Atmel's generic fileformat.

       -e <filename>
              Specifies which eeprom-file to read/write.  Supportet formats are Intel HEX and Atmel's generic fileformat.

       -l <lockmode>
              Specifies lockmode to progam into the chip. Use '-l list' to get a list of possible lockmodes.

       -q     Quiet.  Don't write any progress information.  Will speed up programming.

       -d <deffile>
              Specifies the path and filename of avrp.def if default location is not possible.  Can also be set with the environment variable AVRP_DEFFILE

       -I     Ignores the signature in the chip. This is very useful if the signature in the chip have been destroyed in some way.

       --enable <fuses>
              Enables specified fuses.

       --disable <fuses>
              Disables specified fuses.

       --autoinc
              You can use this to speed up programming on newer programmer firmware.

       --version
              Print out version information.

       --help -h
              Print out a short help text.

FILES
       /etc/avrp.def
              Definition file

ENVIRONMENT
       AVRP_SERIALPORT
              Specifies which serial port to use.

       AVRP_AVRTYPE
              Specifies chip to talk to.

       AVRP_DEFFILE
              Specifies the location of avrp.def

EXAMPLES
       Print out information on the programmer:
          avrp -s /dev/ttyS1

       Same as above, but also give information on the inserted chip:
          avrp -s /dev/ttyS1 -a AT90S1200-D/E/F

       Program a chip (flash only, and using a short chip-descriptor):
          avrp -s /dev/ttyS1 -a 1200-d -p -f avr910.rom

       Read a chip (flash and eeprom, AVRP_SERIALPORT is set):
          avrp -a 8515 -rf test.hex -e test.eep.hex
