NAME
       BOPM - Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor

DESCRIPTION
       BOPM, also known as the Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor, is an IRC bot which requires operator privileges to scan the clients connecting to your IRC server for open proxies.

       -c <name>
              Path  to  the  configuration file.  By default BOPM reads `/etc/bopm/bopm.conf', but `-c CONFNAME' will cause BOPM to read `/etc/bopm/CONFNAME.conf' instead.  The primary use for this is to run
              multiple BOPMs from one directory.

       -d     Debug mode. BOPM will not fork, and will write logs to stderr. Multiple -d increase the debug level.

       -v <directory>
              Specifies the path where the logfile should be saved to.  By default BOPM saves its logfile to `/var/log/bopm/CONFNAME.log'.  This option allows you to specify an alternative directory.
