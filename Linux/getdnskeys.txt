NAME
       getdnskeys - Manage lists of DNSKEYs from DNS zones

SYNOPSIS
           getdnskeys [-i file] [-o file] [-k] [-T] [-t] [-v] [zones]

DESCRIPTION
       getdnskeys manages lists of DNSKEYs from DNS zones.  It may be used to
       retrieve and compare DNSKEYs.  The output from getdnskeys may be
       included (directly or indirectly) in a named.conf file.

OPTIONS
       getdnskeys takes the following options:

       -i path
           Reads path as a named.conf with which to compare key lists.

       -k  Only looks for Key Signing Keys (KSKs); all other keys are ignored.

       -o file
           Writes the results to file.

       -T  Checks the current trusted key list from named.conf.

       -t  Encloses output in needed named.conf syntax markers.

       -v  Turns on verbose mode for additional output.

       -Version
           Displays the version information for getdnskeys and the DNSSEC-
           Tools package.

       -h  Gives a help message.

EXAMPLES
       This getdnskeys will retrieve the KSK for example.com:

           getdnskeys -o /etc/named.trustkeys.conf -k -v -t example.com

       This getdnskeys will check saved keys against a live set of keys:

           getdnskeys -i /etc/named.trustkeys.conf -T -k -v -t

       This getdnskeys will automatically update a set of saved keys:

           getdnskeys -i /etc/named.trustkeys.conf -k -t -T -v
                      -o /etc/named.trustkeys.conf

SECURITY ISSUES
       Currently this does not validate new keys placed in the file in any
       way, nor does it validate change over keys which have been added.

       It also does not handle revocation of keys.

       It should prompt you before adding a new key so that you can always run
       the auto-update feature.
