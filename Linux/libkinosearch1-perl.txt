NAME
       KinoSearch1::Search::SearchServer - make a Searcher remotely accessible

SYNOPSIS
           my $searcher = KinoSearch1::Searcher->new(
               analyzer => $analyzer,
               invindex => '/path/to/invindex',
           );
           my $server = KinoSearch1::Search::SearchServer->new(
               searchable => $searcher,
               port       => 7890,
               password   => $pass,
           );
           $server->serve;

DESCRIPTION
       The SearchServer class, in conjunction with SearchClient, makes it possible to run a search on one machine and report results on another.

       By aggregating several SearchClients under a MultiSearcher, the cost of searching what might have been a prohibitively large monolithic index can be distributed across multiple nodes, each with
       its own, smaller index.

METHODS
   new
       Constructor.  Takes hash-style parameters.

       •   searchable - The Searcher that the SearchServer will wrap.

       •   port - the port on localhost that the server should open and listen on.

       •   password - a password which must be supplied by clients.

   serve
       Open a listening socket on localhost and wait for SearchClients to connect.
