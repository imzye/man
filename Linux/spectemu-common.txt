NAME
       xspect, vgaspect - ZX Spectrum emulator

SYNOPSIS
       xspect [options] [[filetype] filename]

       vgaspect [options] [[filetype] filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Spectemu is a 48k Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator for Linux and other UNIX operating systems.

       The program xspect can be started in X11, and opens up a window to display the screen of the Spectrum. Do not start xspect in the background, because it uses the terminal to read filenames, and to
       print information on the state of the emulator.

       The vgaspect program can only be started on a Linux console, and uses the SVGALIB library. On non linux systems this program is not available.

OPERANDS
       For both xspect and vgaspect a snapshot file or a tape file can be specified on the command line. The file can have the extension .z80 , .sna , .tap or .tzx (the extension can be ommitted).

       The option -help displays a list of available options. For a more complete list, and description see the file README.

       For xspect The following options also have meaning:

       -display DISPLAYNAME
              Open the window on DISPLAYNAME instead of the default

       -name WINDOWNAME
              Change the title of the window to WINDOWNAME

KEYS
       You can press Ctrl-H to get help on what keys to use.

       For more information on the features available in Spectemu see the file README distributed with the emulator.

BUGS
       I  try  to  keep  nasty  bugs  like "Segmentation Fault" out of Spectemu, so if you notice one, STEP ON IT! There are some cuter and gentler bugs, which are kept in Spectemu to amuse the user (see
       TODO).
