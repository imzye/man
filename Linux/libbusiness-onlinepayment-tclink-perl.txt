DESCRIPTION
       For detailed information see Business::OnlinePayment.

NOTE
       To settle an authorization-only transaction (where you set action to 'Authorization Only'), submit the transaction id code in the field "order_number" with the action set to "Post Authorization".
       You can get the transaction id from the authorization by calling the order_number method on the object returned from the authorization.  You must also submit the amount field with a value less
       than or equal to the amount specified in the original authorization.

COMPATIBILITY
       This module relies on Net::TCLink for interacting with the TrustCommerce payment engine. See http://www.trustcommerce.com/tclink.html for details.
