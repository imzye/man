NAME
       dtest - simple uDAPL send/receive and RDMA test

SYNOPSIS
       dtest  [-P  provider] [-b buf size] [-B burst count][-v] [-c] [-p] [-d]
       [-s]

       dtest [-P provider] [-b buf size] [-B burst count][-v] [-c]  [-p]  [-d]
       [-h HOSTNAME]

DESCRIPTION
       dtest  is  a  simple  test used to exercise and verify the uDAPL inter‐
       faces.  At least two instantiations of the test must be run.  One  acts
       as  the  server  and the other the client. The server side of the test,
       once invoked listens for  connection  requests,  until  timing  out  or
       killed.  Upon receipt of a cd connection request, the connection is es‐
       tablished, the server and client sides exchange  information  necessary
       to perform RDMA writes and reads.

OPTIONS
       -P=PROVIDER
              use PROVIDER to specify uDAPL interface using /etc/dat.conf (de‐
              fault OpenIB-cma)

       -b=BUFFER_SIZE
              use buffer size BUFFER_SIZE for RDMA(default 64)

       -B=BURST_COUNT
              use busrt count BURST_COUNT for interations (default 10)

       -v, verbose output(default off)

       -c, use consumer notification events (default off)

       -p, use polling (default wait for event)

       -d, delay in seconds before close (default off)

       -s, run as server (default - run as server)

       -h=HOSTNAME
              use HOSTNAME to specify server hostname or IP address (default -
              none)

EXAMPLES
       dtest -P OpenIB-cma -v -s

            Starts a server process with debug verbosity using provider OpenIB-cma.

       dtest -P OpenIB-cma -h server1-ib0

            Starts a client process, using OpenIB-cma provider to connect to hostname server1-ib0.
