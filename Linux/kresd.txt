NAME
       kresd - full caching DNSSEC-enabled Knot Resolver 5.4.3.

SYNOPSIS
       kresd  [-a|--addr  addr[@port]]  [-t|--tls  addr[@port]]  [-S|--fd  fd]
       [-T|--tlsfd fd] [-c|--config config] [-n|--noninteractive] [-q|--quiet]
       [-v|--verbose] [-V|--version] [-h|--help] [rundir]

DESCRIPTION
       Knot Resolver is a DNSSEC-enabled full caching resolver.

       Default  mode of operation: when it receives a DNS query it iteratively
       asks authoritative nameservers starting from root zone (.)  and  ending
       with  a  nameservers  authoritative  for queried name. Automatic DNSSEC
       means verification of integrity of authoritative responses by following
       keys  and signatures starting from root. Root trust anchor is automati‐
       cally bootstrapped from IANA, or you can provide a file with root trust
       anchors (same format as Unbound or BIND9 root keys file).

       The  daemon  also  caches  intermediate  answers  into  cache, which by
       default uses LMDB memory-mapped database. This has a significant advan‐
       tage  over in-memory caches as the process may be stopped and restarted
       without loss of cache entries. In multi-user scenario a shared cache is
       potential  privacy/security  issue,  with  kresd  each  user  can  have
       resolver cache in their private directory and use it in similar fashion
       to keychain.

       To use a locally running kresd for resolving put

             nameserver 127.0.0.1

       into resolv.conf(5) and start kresd

       The  daemon  may  be  configured  also as a plain forwarder using query
       policies.  This requires using a config file. Please refer to  documen‐
       tation for configuration file options. It is available at https://knot-
       resolver.readthedocs.io or in package documentation (available as knot-
       resolver-doc package in most distributions).

       The available CLI options are:

       -a addr[@port], --addr=<addr[@port]>
              Listen on given address (and port) pair. If no port is given, 53
              is used as a default.  Option may be passed  multiple  times  to
              listen on more addresses.

       -t addr[@port], --tls=<addr[@port]>
              Listen using TLS on given address (and port) pair. If no port is
              given, 853 is used as a default.  Option may be passed  multiple
              times to listen on more addresses.

       -S fd, --fd=<fd>
              Listen  on  given  file  descriptor(s),  passed  by  supervisor.
              Option may be passed multiple  times  to  listen  on  more  file
              descriptors.

       -T fd, --tlsfd=<fd>
              Listen using TLS on given file descriptor(s), passed by supervi‐
              sor.  Option may be passed multiple times to listen on more file
              descriptors.

       -c config, --config=<config>
              Set  the  config file with settings for kresd to read instead of
              reading the file at the default location (config).

       -f N, --forks=<N>
              This option is deprecated since 5.0.0!

              With this option, the daemon is started in non-interactive  mode
              and  instead  creates  a UNIX socket in rundir that the operator
              can connect to for interactive session.  A number greater than 1
              forks  the daemon N times, all forks will bind to same addresses
              and the kernel will load-balance  between  them  on  Linux  with
              SO_REUSEPORT support.

              If  you  want  multiple  concurrent processes supervised in this
              way, they should be  supervised  independently  (see  kresd.sys‐
              temd(7)).

       -n, --noninteractive
              Daemon  will refrain from entering into read-eval-print loop for
              stdin+stdout.

       -q, --quiet
              Daemon will refrain from printing the command prompt.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase logging to debug level.

       -h     Show short command-line option help.

       -V     Show the version.
