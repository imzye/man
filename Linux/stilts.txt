DESCRIPTION
       plot2corner represents the relationships between multiple quantities by drawing a scatter-like plot of every pair of coordinates, and/or a histogram-like plot of every single coordinate, and plac‐
       ing  these  on (half or all of) a square grid. The horizontal coordinates of all the plots on each column, and the vertical coordinates of all the plots on each row, are aligned. Single-coordinate
       (histogram-like) plots appear on the diagonal, and coordinate-pair (scatter plot-like) plots appear off diagonal. By default only the diagonal and sub-diagonal part of the resulting plot matrix is
       shown, since the plots above the diagonal are equivalent to those below it, but this is configurable. This representation is variously known as a corner plot, scatter plot matrix, splom  or  pairs
       plot.

       In  principle any number of quantities can be simultaneously compared in this way, but depending on the output format, attempting to use too many may make the individual plots too small to be use‐
       ful.

       The number D of quantities to compare (the dimensionality of the space from which you want to plot 2- and 1-dimensional projections) is given by the nvar parameter. Each specified layer  then  re‐
       quires  D positional coordinates, given by the parameters x1, x2, ... xD. The resulting grid of plots will have a linear dimension of D if there are histogram-like layers included, or D-1 if there
       are only scatter-plot like layers. As well as the positional coordinate parameters xK themselves, some of the other parameters are indexed by the coordinate index K as well,  for  instance  xKlog,
       xKflip, xKmin and xKmax.

       Content  is  added to the plot by specifying one or more plot layers using the layerN parameter. The N part is a suffix applied to all the parameters affecting a given layer; any suffix (including
       the empty string) may be used. Available layers for this plot type are: mark, line, linearfit, label, contour, grid, fill, quantile, histogram, kde, knn, densogram, gaussian, function.

OPTIONS
       xpix=<int-value>
              Size of the output image in the X direction in pixels. This includes space for any axis labels, padding and other decoration outside the plot area itself. See also insets.

       ypix=<int-value>
              Size of the output image in the Y direction in pixels. This includes space for any axis labels, padding and other decoration outside the plot area itself. See also insets.

       insets=<top>,<left>,<bottom>,<right>
              Defines the amount of space in pixels around the actual plotting area. This space is used for axis labels, and other decorations and any left over forms an empty border.

              The size and position of the actual plotting area is determined by this parameter along with xpix and ypix.

              The value of this parameter is 4 comma separated integers: <top>,<left>,<bottom>,<right>. Any or all of these values may be left blank, in which case the corresponding margin will be calcu‐
              lated automatically according to how much space is required.

       omode=swing|out|cgi|discard|auto
              Determines how the drawn plot will be output, see SUN/256.

                * swing: Plot will be displayed in a window on the screen. This plot is "live"; it can be resized and (except for old-style plots) navigated around with mouse actions in the same  way  as
                  plots in TOPCAT.

                * out: Plot will be written to a file given by out using the graphics format given by ofmt.

                * cgi: Plot will be written in a way suitable for CGI use direct from a web server. The output is in the graphics format given by ofmt, preceded by a suitable "Content-type" declaration.

                * discard: Plot is drawn, but discarded. There is no output.

                * auto: Behaves as swing or out mode depending on presence of out parameter

       storage=simple|memory|disk|policy|cache|basic-cache|persistent|parallel
              Determines  the way that data is accessed when constructing the plot. There are two main options, cached or not. If no caching is used then rows are read sequentially from the specified in‐
              put table(s) every time they are required. This generally requires a small resource footprint (though that can depend on how the table is specified) and makes sense if the data  only  needs
              to be scanned once or perhaps if the table is very large. If caching is used then the required data is read once from the specified input table(s), then prepared and cached before any plot‐
              ting  is performed, and plots are done using this cached data. This may use a significant amount of storage for large tables but it's usually more sensible (faster) if the data will need to
              be scanned multiple times. There are various options for cache storage.

              The options are:

                * simple: no caching, data read directly from input table

                * memory: cached to memory; OutOfMemoryError possible for very large plots

                * disk: cached to disk

                * policy: cached using application-wide default storage policy, which is usually adaptive (memory/disk hybrid)

                * persistent: cached to persistent files on disk, in the system temporary directory (defined by system property java.io.tmpdir). If this is used, plot data will be stored on disk in a way
                  that means they can be re-used between STILTS invocations, so data preparation can be avoided on subsequent runs. Note however it can leave potentially large files in your temporary di‐
                  rectory.

                * cache: synonym for memory (backward compatibility)

                * basic-cache: dumber version of memory (no optimisation for constant-valued columns)

                * parallel: experimental version of memory-based cache that reads into the cache in parallel for large files. This will make the plot faster to prepare, but interaction is  a  bit  slower
                  and sequence-dependent attributes of the plot may not come out right. This experimental option may be withdrawn or modified in future releases.

              The  default value is memory if a live plot is being generated (omode=swing), since in that case the plot needs to be redrawn every time the user performs plot navigation actions or resizes
              the window, or if animations are being produced. Otherwise (e.g. output to a graphics file) the default is simple.

       seq=<suffix>[,...]
              Contains a comma-separated list of layer suffixes to determine the order in which layers are drawn on the plot. This can affect which symbol are plotted on top of, and  so  potentially  ob‐
              scure, which other ones.

              When  specifying  a  plot, multiple layers may be specified, each introduced by a parameter layer<N>, where <N> is a different (arbitrary) suffix labelling the layer, and is appended to all
              the parameters specific to defining that layer.

              By default the layers are drawn on the plot in the order in which the layer* parameters appear on the command line. However if this parameter is specified, each comma-separated  element  is
              interpreted  as  a layer suffix, giving the ordered list of layers to plot. Every element of the list must be a suffix with a corresponding layer parameter, but missing or repeated elements
              are allowed.

       legend=true|false|null
              Whether to draw a legend or not. If no value is supplied, the decision is made automatically: a legend is drawn only if it would have more than one entry.

       legborder=true|false
              If true, a line border is drawn around the legend.

       legopaque=true|false
              If true, the background of the legend is opaque, and the legend obscures any plot components behind it. Otherwise, it's transparent.

       legseq=<suffix>[,...]
              Determines which layers are represented in the legend (if present) and in which order they appear. The legend has a line for each layer label (as determined by the leglabelN parameter).  If
              multiple  layers  have  the  same label, they will contribute to the same entry in the legend, with style icons plotted over each other. The value of this parameter is a comma-separated se‐
              quence of layer suffixes, which determines the order in which the legend entries appear. Layers with suffixes missing from this list do not show up in the legend at all.

              If no value is supplied (the default), the sequence is the same as the layer plotting sequence (see seq).

       legpos=<xfrac,yfrac>
              Determines the internal position of the legend on the plot. The value is a comma-separated pair of values giving the X and Y positions of the legend within the plotting bounds, so  for  in‐
              stance "0.5,0.5" will put the legend right in the middle of the plot. If no value is supplied, the legend will appear outside the plot boundary.

       title=<value>
              Text of a title to be displayed at the top of the plot. If null, the default, no title is shown and there's more space for the graphics.

       auxmap=<map-name>|<color>-<color>[-<color>...]
              Color map used for Aux axis shading.

              A  mixed bag of colour ramps are available as listed in SUN/256: inferno, magma, plasma, viridis, cividis, cubehelix, sron, rainbow, rainbow2, rainbow3, pastel, cosmic, ember, gothic, rain‐
              forest, voltage, bubblegum, gem, chroma, sunset, neon, tropical, accent, gnuplot, gnuplot2, specxby, set1, paired, hotcold, guppy, iceburn, redshift, pride, rdbu, piyg, brbg,  cyan-magenta,
              red-blue,  brg,  heat,  cold,  light, greyscale, colour, standard, bugn, bupu, orrd, pubu, purd, painbow, huecl, infinity, hue, intensity, rgb_red, rgb_green, rgb_blue, hsv_h, hsv_s, hsv_v,
              yuv_y, yuv_u, yuv_v, scale_hsv_s, scale_hsv_v, scale_yuv_y, mask, blacker, whiter, transparency. Note: many of these, including rainbow-like ones, are frowned upon by the visualisation com‐
              munity.

              You can also construct your own custom colour map by giving a sequence of colour names separated by minus sign ("-") characters. In this case the ramp is a linear interpolation between each
              pair of colours named, using the same syntax as when specifying a colour value. So for instance "yellow-hotpink-#0000ff" would shade from yellow via hot pink to blue.

       auxclip=<lo>,<hi>
              Defines a subrange of the colour ramp to be used for Aux shading. The value is specified as a (low,high) comma-separated pair of two numbers between 0 and 1.

              If the full range 0,1 is used, the whole range of colours specified by the selected shader will be used. But if for instance a value of 0,0.5 is given, only those colours at the  left  hand
              end of the ramp will be seen.

              If  the  null  (default)  value is chosen, a default clip will be used. This generally covers most or all of the range 0-1 but for colour maps which fade to white, a small proportion of the
              lower end may be excluded, to ensure that all the colours are visually distinguishable from a white background. This default is usually a good idea if the colour  map  is  being  used  with
              something  like  a  scatter plot, where markers are plotted against a white background. However, for something like a density map when the whole plotting area is tiled with colours from the
              map, it may be better to supply the whole range 0,1 explicitly.

       auxflip=true|false
              If true, the colour map on the Aux axis will be reversed.

       auxquant=<number>
              Allows the colour map used for the Aux axis to be quantised. If an integer value N is chosen then the colour map will be viewed as N discrete evenly-spaced levels, so that only N  different
              colours will appear in the plot. This can be used to generate a contour-like effect, and may make it easier to trace the boundaries of regions of interest by eye.

              If left blank, the colour map is nominally continuous (though in practice it may be quantised to a medium-sized number like 256).

       auxfunc=log|linear|histogram|histolog|sqrt|square|acos|cos
              Defines the way that values in the Aux range are mapped to the selected colour ramp.

              The available options are:

                * log: Logarithmic scaling

                * linear: Linear scaling

                * histogram: Scaling follows data distribution, with linear axis

                * histolog: Scaling follows data distribution, with logarithmic axis

                * sqrt: Square root scaling

                * square: Square scaling

                * acos: Arccos Scaling

                * cos: Cos Scaling

              For  all  these  options, the full range of data values is used, and displayed on the colour bar if applicable. The Linear, Log, Square and Sqrt options just apply the named function to the
              full data range. The histogram options on the other hand use a scaling function that corresponds to the actual distribution of the data, so that there are about the same  number  of  points
              (or  pixels, or whatever is being scaled) of each colour. The histogram options are somewhat more expensive, but can be a good choice if you are exploring data whose distribution is unknown
              or not well-behaved over its min-max range. The Histogram and HistoLog options both assign the colours in the same way, but they display the colour ramp with linear or  logarithmic  annota‐
              tion respectively; the HistoLog option also ignores non-positive values.

       auxmin=<number>
              Minimum value of the data coordinate on the Aux axis. This sets the value before any subranging is applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

       auxmax=<number>
              Maximum value of the data coordinate on the Aux axis. This sets the value before any subranging is applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

       auxlabel=<text>
              Sets the label used to annotate the aux axis, if it is visible.

       auxcrowd=<factor>
              Determines  how  closely the tick marks are spaced on the Aux axis, if visible. The default value is 1, meaning normal crowding. Larger values result in more ticks, and smaller values fewer
              ticks. Tick marks will not however be spaced so closely that the labels overlap each other, so to get very closely spaced marks you may need to reduce the font size as well.

       auxwidth=<pixels>
              Determines the lateral size of the aux colour ramp, if visible, in pixels.

       auxvisible=true|false|null
              Determines whether the aux axis colour ramp is displayed alongside the plot.

              If not supplied (the default), the aux axis will be visible when aux shading is used in any of the plotted layers.

       forcebitmap=true|false
              Affects whether rendering of the data contents of a plot (though not axis labels etc) is always done to an intermediate bitmap rather than, where  possible,  being  painted  using  graphics
              primitives.  This is a rather arcane setting that may nevertheless have noticeable effects on the appearance and size of an output graphics file, as well as plotting time. For some types of
              plot (e.g. shadingN=auto or shadingN=density) it will have no effect, since this kind of rendering happens in any case.

              When writing to vector graphics formats (PDF and PostScript), setting it true will force the data contents to be bitmapped. This may make the output less beautiful (round  markers  will  no
              longer be perfectly round), but it may result in a much smaller file if there are very many data points.

              When writing to bitmapped output formats (PNG, GIF, JPEG, ...), it fixes shapes to be the same as seen on the screen rather than be rendered at the mercy of the graphics system, which some‐
              times introduces small distortions.

       compositor=0..1
              Defines how multiple overplotted partially transparent pixels are combined to form a resulting colour. The way this is used depends on the details of the specified plot.

              Currently,  this parameter takes a "boost" value in the range 0..1. If the value is zero, saturation semantics are used: RGB colours are added in proporition to their associated alpha value
              until the total alpha is saturated (reaches 1), after which additional pixels have no further effect. For larger boost values, the effect is similar, but any non-zero alpha in the output is
              boosted to the given minimum value. The effect of this is that even very slightly populated pixels can be visually distinguished from unpopulated ones which may not be the case for  satura‐
              tion composition.

       animate=<table>
              If  not  null, this parameter causes the command to create a sequence of plots instead of just one. The parameter value is a table with one row for each frame to be produced. Columns in the
              table are interpreted as parameters which may take different values for each frame; the column name is the parameter name, and the value for a given frame is its value from that  row.  Ani‐
              mating like this is considerably more efficient than invoking the STILTS command in a loop.

              The location of the animation control table. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "-", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given explicitly using the afmt parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form :<scheme-name>:<scheme-args>.

                * A system command line with either a "<" character at the start, or a "|" character at the end ("<syscmd" or "syscmd|"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard out‐
                  put. This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress or bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       afmt=<in-format>
              Specifies  the  format of the animation control table as specified by parameter animate. The known formats are listed in SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is
              in. If it has the special value (auto) (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format of the table automatically. This cannot always be done correctly  however,  in  which
              case the program will exit with an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored for scheme-specified tables.

       astream=true|false
              If  set true, the animation control table specified by the animate parameter will be read as a stream. It is necessary to give the afmt parameter in this case. Depending on the required op‐
              erations and processing mode, this may cause the read to fail (sometimes it is necessary to read the table more than once). It is not normally necessary to set this flag; in most cases  the
              data will be streamed automatically if that is the best thing to do. However it can sometimes result in less resource usage when processing large files in certain formats (such as VOTable).
              This parameter is ignored for scheme-specified tables.

       acmd=<cmds>
              Specifies  processing  to  be  performed on the animation control table as specified by parameter animate, before any other processing has taken place. The value of this parameter is one or
              more of the filter commands described in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by semicolon characters (";"). This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the  same
              command line to build up a list of processing steps. The sequence of commands given in this way defines the processing pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands may alternatively be supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character '@'. Thus a value of "@filename" causes the file filename to be read for a list of filter com‐
              mands  to  execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and lines which are blank or which start with a '#' character are ignored. A backslash
              character '\fR' at the end of a line joins it with the following line.

       parallel=<int-value>
              Determines how many threads will run in parallel if animation output is being produced. Only used if the animate parameter is supplied. The default value is the number of processors  appar‐
              ently available to the JVM.

       nvar=<int-value>
              Gives the number of quantities to be plotted against each other, which will be the number of cells along each side of the scatter plot matrix.

       matrixformat=<value>
              Configures  which  cells  of  the matrix grid will be filled in. Below-diagonal, above-diagonal, or the full matrix can be chosen. Given grid cells will only appear if there are appropriate
              plot layers specified, i.e. 2-coordinate (scatter-plot-like) plots for the off-diagonal cells and 1-coordinate (histogram-like) plots for the diagonal cells.

              The available options are:

                * lower: only the lower diagonal part of the matrix is populated, as well as the diagonal if diagonal elements are present

                * upper: only the upper diagonal part of the matrix is populated, as well as the diagonal if diagonal elements are present

                * full: all cells of the matrix are populated where present

       cellgap=<int-value>
              Gives the number of pixels between cells in the displayed matrix of plots.

       squares=true|false
              If true, each of the plotted panels in the matrix will have the same vertical and horizontal dimension. If false, the shape of each panel will be determined by  the  shape  of  the  overall
              plotting area.

       xKlog=true|false
              If false (the default), the scale on the xK axis is linear, if true it is logarithmic.

              The xK axis refers to any axes in the matrix on which input coordinate #K is plotted. Hence x2log affects the axes on which the x2 coordinates are plotted.

       xKflip=true|false
              If true, the scale on the xK axis will increase in the opposite sense from usual (e.g. right to left rather than left to right).

              The xK axis refers to any axes in the matrix on which input coordinate #K is plotted. Hence x2flip affects the axes on which the x2 coordinates are plotted.

       xKlabel=<text>
              Gives a label to be used for annotating axis xK A default value based on the plotted data will be used if no value is supplied.

              The xK axis refers to any axes in the matrix on which input coordinate #K is plotted. Hence x2label affects the axes on which the x2 coordinates are plotted.

       grid=true|false
              If true, grid lines are drawn on the plot at positions determined by the major tick marks. If false, they are absent.

       xcrowd=<number>
              Determines  how  closely  the tick marks are spaced on the xK axis. The default value is 1, meaning normal crowding. Larger values result in more ticks, and smaller values fewer ticks. Tick
              marks will not however be spaced so closely that the labels overlap each other, so to get very closely spaced marks you may need to reduce the font size as well.

              The xK axis refers to any axes in the matrix on which input coordinate #K is plotted. Hence xcrowd affects the axes on which the x2 coordinates are plotted.

       labelangle=horizontal|angled|adaptive
              Controls the orientation of numeric labels on the axes. In most cases labels are written horizontally on both horizontal and vertical axes, but this option provides the possibility to write
              them at an angle which may be able to accommodate more labels on the horizontal axis, especially if the labels are long or a high crowding factor is requested.

              Note that the adaptive option is currently not perfect, and can sometimes lead to suboptimal border placement.

              The available options are:

                * horizontal: axis labels are horizontal

                * angled: axis labels are angled

                * adaptive: axis labels are horizontal if possible, but angled if necessary to fit more in

       minor=true|false
              If true, minor tick marks are painted along the axes as well as the major tick marks. Minor tick marks do not have associated grid lines.

       shadow=true|false
              If true and no secondary axis is in use, then tick marks without numeric labels are painted along the axis opposite to the primary axis, so that tick marks are visible along all  edges  not
              just the ones with numeric labels. If a secondary axis is in use, this setting is ignored.

       gridcolor=<rrggbb>|red|blue|...
              The color of the plot grid, given by name or as a hexadecimal RGB value.

              The standard plotting colour names are red, blue, green, grey, magenta, cyan, orange, pink, yellow, black, light_grey, white. However, many other common colour names (too many to list here)
              are also understood. The list currently contains those colour names understood by most web browsers, from AliceBlue to YellowGreen, listed e.g. in the Extended color keywords section of the
              CSS3 standard.

              Alternatively,  a six-digit hexadecimal number RRGGBB may be supplied, optionally prefixed by "#" or "0x", giving red, green and blue intensities, e.g. "ff00ff", "#ff00ff" or "0xff00ff" for
              magenta.

       gridtrans=0..1
              Transparency of grid lines that may be drawn over the plot. The range is 0 (opaque) to 1 (invisible). This value is 1-alpha.

       labelcolor=<rrggbb>|red|blue|...
              The color of axis labels and other plot annotations, given by name or as a hexadecimal RGB value.

              The standard plotting colour names are red, blue, green, grey, magenta, cyan, orange, pink, yellow, black, light_grey, white. However, many other common colour names (too many to list here)
              are also understood. The list currently contains those colour names understood by most web browsers, from AliceBlue to YellowGreen, listed e.g. in the Extended color keywords section of the
              CSS3 standard.

              Alternatively, a six-digit hexadecimal number RRGGBB may be supplied, optionally prefixed by "#" or "0x", giving red, green and blue intensities, e.g. "ff00ff", "#ff00ff" or "0xff00ff"  for
              magenta.

       texttype=plain|antialias|latex
              Determines how to turn label text into characters on the plot. Plain and Antialias both take the text at face value, but Antialias smooths the characters. LaTeX interprets the text as LaTeX
              source code and typesets it accordingly.

              When  not  using  LaTeX,  antialiased text usually looks nicer, but can be perceptibly slower to plot. At time of writing, on MacOS antialiased text seems to be required to stop the writing
              coming out upside-down for non-horizontal text (MacOS java bug).

       fontsize=<int-value>
              Size of the text font in points.

       fontstyle=standard|serif|mono
              Font style for text.

              The available options are:

                * standard

                * serif

                * mono

       fontweight=plain|bold|italic|bold_italic
              Font weight for text.

              The available options are:

                * plain

                * bold

                * italic

                * bold_italic

       xKmin=<number>
              Minimum value of the data coordinate on the xK axis. This sets the value before any subranging is applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

              The xK axis refers to any axes in the matrix on which input coordinate #K is plotted. Hence x2min affects the axes on which the x2 coordinates are plotted.

       xKmax=<number>
              Maximum value of the data coordinate on the xK axis. This sets the value before any subranging is applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

              The xK axis refers to any axes in the matrix on which input coordinate #K is plotted. Hence x2max affects the axes on which the x2 coordinates are plotted.

       xKsub=<lo>,<hi>
              Defines a normalised adjustment to the data range of the XK axis. The value may be specified as a comma-separated pair of two numbers, giving the lower and upper bounds of the range  of  of
              interest  respectively. This sub-range is applied to the data range that would otherwise be used, either automatically calculated or explicitly supplied; zero corresponds to the lower bound
              and one to the upper.

              The default value "0,1" therefore has no effect. The range could be restricted to its lower half with the value 0,0.5.

              The xK axis refers to any axes in the matrix on which input coordinate #K is plotted. Hence x2sub affects the axes on which the x2 coordinates are plotted.

       navaxes=xy|x|y
              Determines the axes which are affected by the interactive navigation actions (pan and zoom). The default is xy, which means that the various mouse gestures will provide panning and  zooming
              in both X and Y directions. However, if it is set to (for instance) x then the mouse will only allow panning and zooming in the horizontal direction, with the vertical extent fixed.

       xKanchor=true|false
              If true, then zoom actions will work in such a way that the zero point on the xK axis stays in the same position on the plot.

              The xK axis refers to any axes in the matrix on which input coordinate #K is plotted. Hence x2anchor affects the axes on which the x2 coordinates are plotted.

       zoomfactor=<number>
              Sets  the amount by which the plot view zooms in or out for each unit of mouse wheel movement. A value of 1 means that mouse wheel zooming has no effect. A higher value means that the mouse
              wheel zooms faster and a value nearer 1 means it zooms slower. Values below 1 are not permitted.

       leglabelN=<text>
              Sets the presentation label for the layer with a given suffix. This is the text which is displayed in the legend, if present. Multiple layers may use the same label, in which case they will
              be combined to form a single legend entry.

              If no value is supplied (the default), the suffix itself is used as the label.

       layerN=<layer-type> <layerN-specific-params>
              Selects one of the available plot types for layerN. A plot consists of a plotting surface, set up using the various unsuffixed parameters of the plotting command, and zero or more plot lay‐
              ers. Each layer is introduced by a parameter with the name layer<N> where the suffix "<N>" is a label identifying the layer and is appended to all the parameter names which  configure  that
              layer. Suffixes may be any string, including the empty string.

              This parameter may take one of the following values, described in more detail in SUN/256:

                * mark

                * line

                * linearfit

                * label

                * contour

                * grid

                * fill

                * quantile

                * histogram

                * kde

                * knn

                * densogram

                * gaussian

                * function

              Each of these layer types comes with a list of type-specific parameters to define the details of that layer, including some or all of the following groups:

                * input table parameters (e.g. inN, icmdN)

                * coordinate params referring to input table columns (e.g. xN, yN)

                * layer style parameters (e.g. shadingN, colorN)

              Every  parameter  notionally carries the same suffix N. However, if the suffix is not present, the application will try looking for a parameter with the same name with no suffix instead. In
              this way, if several layers have the same value for a given parameter (for instance input table), you can supply it using one unsuffixed parameter to save having to supply  several  parame‐
              ters with the same value but different suffixes.
