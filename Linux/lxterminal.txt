NAME
       lxterminal - a lightweight terminal emulator based on GTK+ for the LXDE desktop.

SYNOPSIS

       lxterminal [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the lxterminal command.

       lxterminal is a program that provides a terminal emulator for the desktop, usually for LXDE.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

       -e STRING --command=STRING --command STRING
           This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be run in the terminal. Except in the --command= form, this must be the last option on the command line.

       --geometry=CHARACTERSxLINES
           Set the terminal's size in characters and lines.

       -l --loginshell
           Executes login shell.

       --no-remote
           Spawns an lxterminal window in a process that is separate from all other lxterminal windows. It ensures that environment variables are inherited from the launching process (such as the user's
           shell process).

       -t NAME[,NAME[,NAME[...]]] --title=NAME[,NAME[,NAME[...]]] --tabs=NAME[,NAME[,NAME[...]]]
           Set the terminal's title. Use comma for multiple tabs.

       --working-directory=DIRECTORY
           Set the terminal's working directory.

       --profile=NAME
           If set, then all instances of lxterminal invoked in the same way will share a config file named lxterminal-NAME.conf.
