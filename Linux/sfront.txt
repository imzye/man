NAME
       sfront -  MPEG 4 Structured Audio decoder.

SYNOPSIS
       sfront [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the sfront command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a general manual page.  Instead, it has
       documentation in the HTML format; see below.

       sfront is a program that compiles MPEG 4 Structured Audio (MP4-SA) bitstreams into efficient C programs that generate audio when executed. It supports real-time, low-latency audio input/output and
       MIDI input from soundcards.

       You must compile the C file generated after sfront execution with a C compiler, and execute the resulting program to get the audio output.

OPTIONS
       A summary of the most important options is included below. For a complete description, see the HTML manual.
