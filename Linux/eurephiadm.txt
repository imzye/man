NAME

SYNOPSIS
       eurephiadm  <command>  [-h|--help]  [-V|--version]  [<global  options>]
       [-l|--log <filename>]  [-L|--log-level  <log  level>]  [<command  argu‐

DESCRIPTION
       eurephiadm is a generic command line tool for administering and config‐
       uring the eurephia plug-in for OpenVPN.

COMMANDS
       Available commands in eurephiadm

       help [<command>]
              This help screen if no arguments are given.   If  a  command  is
              given, the help screen for that command is provided.

       logout Logout  from  an  active eurephiadm session.  Most of the opera‐
              tions in eurephiadm requires the user to  authenticate  him/her‐
              self.   The  session will then be active for a predefined amount
              of time, not requiring new authentications.  The user will  have
              to authenticate him/herself again if the session timesout or the
              logout command is used.

       users [<arguments>]
              User management module.  Lists, adds, removes, activates,  deac‐
              tivates  and  shows  user  account information for each eurephia
              user.

       lastlog
              Query the eurephia lastlog.  This log contains information about
              OpenVPN session authenticated via eurephia.

       attempts [<arguments>]
              Show or reset registered failed login attempts registrations.

       blacklist [<arguments>]
              Show,  add  or delete blacklisted user accounts, certificates or
              IP addresses.

       certs [<arguments>]
              SSL Certificate management for eurephia authentication.

       usercerts [<arguments>]
              Manages the relations between eurephia user  accounts  and  cer‐
              tificates.   This  combination  is called a user access, and de‐
              fines which access level the authenticated  eurephia  user  will
              have to the network.

       fwprofiles [<arguments>]
              Firewall  profile  management.   Add,  list or delete (iptables)
              profiles available for eurephia in the operating  system.   This
              feature  is only available if eurephiadm was compiled with fire‐
              wall support.

       adminaccess [<arguments>]
              Manages eurephia user accesses to administration utilities  like
              eurephiadm.

       show-config
              List  all  config settings set in the database and in the ~/.eu‐
              rephia/eurephiadm.cfg file.

       show-configfile
              Similar to the show-config command, but lists  only  the  parsed
              settings in the ~/.eurephia/eurephiadm.cfg file.

       config [<arguments>]
              Add,  delete  or  show eurephia configuration settings stored in
              the database.

FILES
       ~/.eurephia/eurephiadm.cfg
              Default configuration file which defines the database driver and
              the needed database parameters.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration  file  is  a simple key-value based text file, where
       keys and values are separated by an equal sign ("=").  All text  coming
       after  a  hash  ("#")  will be ignored and considered as comments.  The
       variables eurephiadm uses are:

       database_driver
              Contains a full path to the database driver eurephiadm  need  to
              use.

       database_params
              All  database arguments the database driver requires must be set
              here.  See the man page for the  corresponding  database  driver
              for more information about valid options.

       log    Defines  how  to  log.  If a file name is given, logging will be
              sent to this log file.  Other valid values are:

              stderr: or stdout:
              Logging will go directly to stderr or stdout

              syslog:[local0..local7 | daemon | authpriv]
              Logging will be sent to syslog.  The default syslog  destination
              is daemon.

       log_level
              Sets  the  log verbosity.  Normally the values will be from 0 to
              10, where 0 is as little logging as possible and 10 is very ver‐
              bose.  If eurephiadm or the database driver is compiled with de‐
              bug logging, values up to 50 will be valid.

       username
              eurephiadm will always be asking for a user  name  when  logging
              into  the administration application.  By setting this variable,
              you will set a default user name eurephiadm will use  when  log‐
              ging in and it will only ask for a password directly.

ENVIRONMENT
       EUREPHIA_DIR
              The eurephiadm utility looks for a configuration file by default
              in ~/.eurephia/eurephiadm.cfg.  This directory can be overridden
              by setting the EUREPHIA_DIR environment variable, and eurephiadm
              will use the eurephiadm.cfg file in this directory instead.
