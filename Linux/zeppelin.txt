DESCRIPTION
       A LAN Emulation Client is an entity in an ATM endstation that performs data forwarding, address resolution and other control functions. It uses the LUNI interface when communicating with other  compo‐
       nents in emulated LANs. It provides upper protocol layers a MAC like interface similar to IEEE 802.3/Ethernet or IEEE 802.5/Token Ring LAN.

       LAN  Emulation  client  code  is  divided  into two parts: user space application LAN Emulation Demon called (LED) zeppelin(8), and the kernel component. Zeppelin is responsible for control operations
       needed in LAN Emulation clienthood. It forms the necessary VCCs and receives all the LE control frames and acts accordingly. It also controls the operation of the LEC kernel component.

       Linux LEC supports only Ethernet type of emulated LAN.

       SIGHUP causes restart of the LEC. All resources are released and zeppelin is started.

OPTIONS
       -b     Run in background (i.e. in a forked child process) after initializing kernel interface.

       -c LECS_address
              ATM address of lecs(8) (Lan Emulation Configuration Server), if not set, Well-Known server address is used.

       -s LES_address
              ATM address of les(8) (Lan Emulation Server), can be used in bypassing configuration phase in joining emulated Lan i.e lecs address is not used.

       -e esi Mac address to use when communicating in Emulated LAN. E.g. 00:20:22:23:04:05 .

       -n VLAN_name
              Name of the virtual LAN to which joining is requested.  This is used in LE_CONFIGURE_REQUEST to LECS or LE_JOIN_RESPONSE to LES, if configuration phase is bypassed.

       -m mesg_mask
              Sometimes one wants to know more what is happening in LE daemon e.g. when nothing works. This is a hexadecimal long value setting global message mask. 0 = No messages, ffff = All messages.

       -l listen_address | selector
              Local ATM address that zeppelin uses as local binding point in signalling. Use this if you are running more than one client or a set of LE servers. The local ATM address can be specified by ei‐
              ther giving the full ATM address or the desired selector byte.

       -i interface_number
              Linux LEC supports up to 40+8 network interfaces. The interface_number tells zeppelin to which of these to attach. Ethernet type network interfaces are numbered from "lec0" to "lec39" and Token
              Ring interfaces are from "lec40" to "lec47". These parameters are tweakable during the kernel compile, see <linux/atmlec.h>.

       -I physical_interface_number
              The physical interface this LANE client should bind to. If your host has multiple ATM network cards, you can use this option to choose which card this zeppelin will use.

       -t MTU The MTU of ELAN to join. You need to also use ifconfig(8) to set the MTU of the LANE interface.

       -1     Run as LANEv1 client. This is the default.

       -2     Run as LANEv2 client. This is required by MPOA.

       -p     Enable proxy. When started with this option, it is possible to bridge packets between ATM and Ethernet. That is, you can use LANE interfaces with normal bridging. See  the  Bridging  mini-Howto
              for more info.

       -F logfile
              Instead of writing debug messages to stderr, write the messages to the file logfile. Use syslog as the file name to use the syslog(3) facility.

       -f Fore specific name
              The LANE servers on Fore ATM switches can display a special name if a client can supply one. This name shows with command ´conf lane les show advanced´.

TOKEN RING CONSIDERATIONS
       A  number  of  lec interfaces is reserved for Token Ring ELANs when the kernel is compiled with Token Ring (CONFIG_TR) support. See the discussion about interface_number command line option above. The
       Linux Token Ring LANE client does not support bridging between legacy Token Ring and ATM parts of the ELAN, so using the -p option is not recommended. Token Ring support has received less testing than
       its Ethernet counterpart.

FILES
       /var/run/lec[interface number].pid The file containing the process id of zeppelin.

BUGS
       John Bonham died 1980 and Led Zeppelin broke.
