NAME
       openslide-quickhash1sum - Print OpenSlide quickhash-1 checksums

SYNOPSIS
       openslide-quickhash1sum [--help] [--version] slide...

DESCRIPTION
       Print  OpenSlide  quickhash-1  checksums  for one or more virtual slide
       files, in a format similar to sha256sum(1).

       quickhash-1 is a non-cryptographic, 256-bit  hash  of  a  subset  of  a
       slide's  data.   It uniquely identifies a particular virtual slide, but
       cannot be used to detect corruption or modification of the slide file.

OPTIONS
       --help Display usage summary.

       --version
              Display version and copyright information.

EXIT STATUS
       openslide-quickhash1sum returns 0 on success, 1 if a quickhash-1  could
       not be calculated, or 2 if the arguments are invalid.

BUGS
       quickhash-1  is not defined for all slide files supported by OpenSlide.
       If a slide does not have a quickhash-1, "No quickhash-1 available" will
       be printed.
