INFORM(1)                                                                  Inform v6.36 - interactive fiction story file compiler                                                                 INFORM(1)

NAME
       inform - compile Inform interactive fiction story files to Z-machine or Glulx bytecode

SYNOPSIS
       inform [options...] infile [outfile]

DESCRIPTION
       inform  compiles  an  Inform version 6 story file (usually with the extension .inf) into Z-machine or Glulx bytecode which can then be executed by a variety of Z-machine or Glulx emulators. If the
       output filename is not explicitly given on the command line, it will be constructed from the input filename.

       inform's mode of operation can be controlled with switches (one or two-character expressions preceded by a dash), path modifiers (starting with a plus sign) and memory strategy modifiers (starting
       with a dollar sign).

   SWITCHES
       -a     trace assembly-language (without hex dumps; see -t)

       -c     more concise error messages

       -d     contract double spaces after full stops in text

       -d2    contract double spaces after exclamation and question marks, too

       -e     economy mode (slower): make use of declared abbreviations

       -f     frequencies mode: show how useful abbreviations are

       -g     traces calls to functions (except in the library)

       -g2    traces calls to all functions

       --help, -h, -h1, -h2
              print usage information

       -i     ignore default switches set within the file

       -j     list objects as constructed

       -k     output Infix debugging information to "gameinfo.dbg" (and switch -D on)

       -l     list every statement run through Inform

       -m     say how much memory has been allocated

       -n     print numbers of properties, attributes and actions

       -o     print offset addresses

       -p     give percentage breakdown of story file

       -q     keep quiet about obsolete usages

       -r     record all the text to "gametext.txt"

       -s     give statistics

       -t     trace assembly-language (with full hex dumps; see -a)

       -u     work out most useful abbreviations (very very slowly)

       -vn    compile to a specific Z-code version; the default is 5. Available versions are:

              3      version-3 ("Standard") story file

              4      version-4 ("Plus") story file

              5      version-5 ("Advanced") story file

              6      version-6 (graphical) story file

              8      version-8 (expanded "Advanced") story file

       -w     disable warning messages

       -x     print # for every 100 lines compiled

       -y     trace linking system

       -z     print memory map of the Z-machine

       -B     use big memory model (for large version-6/version-7 files)

       -Cn    select text character set (defaults to 1):

              0      plain ASCII only

              1      ISO 8859-1 (Latin1)

              0      Archimedes-style error messages

              1      Microsoft-style error messages

              2      Macintosh MPW-style error messages

       -F1    use temporary files to reduce memory consumption

       -G     compile a Glulx game file

       -H     use Huffman encoding to compress Glulx strings

       -M     compile as a Module for future linking

       -S     compile strict error-checking at run-time (on by default)

       -U     insert "Constant USE_MODULES;" automatically

       -V     display version and exit

INFORM COMMAND LANGUAGE
       The Switches directive, which enables certain compiler switches to be set from within the source file rather than on the compiler command line, has been superseded by a  more  powerful  mechanism.
       The  special comment characters "!%", occurring on the very first line or lines of the source file, enable you to specify Inform Command Language (ICL) commands to control the compilation. For ex‐
       ample:

           !% -E1G        ! Glulx, 'Microsoft' errors
           !% -~S         ! disable Strict mode
           !% +include_path=./test,./,../lib/contrib ! look in 'test' library
           !% $MAX_STATIC_MEMORY=20000
           Constant STORY "RUINS";
           ...

       ICL is described in Section 39 of the Inform Designer's Manual. In brief: each line specifies a single command, starting with "-" to define one or more switches, "+" to define a path variable,  or
       "$" to define a memory setting. Comments are introduced by "$". The ICL command "compile" is not permitted at the head of a source file.

CAVEATS
       inform is not capable of creating story files conforming to versions 1 or 2 of the Z-Machine.
       Modules cannot be used with Glulx and are deprecated for Z-Machine.

DOCUMENTATION
       The canonical documentation for Inform6 is the Inform_Designer's Manual.  This work can be browsed at
       <http://inform-fiction.org/manual/html/contents.html> downloaded from
       <http://inform-fiction.org/manual/DM4.pdf> and purchased in hardcopy at
       <http://amazon.com/>

       Another noteworthy and somewhat more up-to-date resource is the Inform Beginner's Guide.  This work can be downloaded at
