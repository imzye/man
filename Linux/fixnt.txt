NAME
       fixnt - Filter for the Windows NT postscript printer driver.

SYNOPSIS
       fixnt < BADFILE.ps > GOODFILE.ps

DESCRIPTION
       The Windows NT postscript driver has a tendency to make broken postscript files, that are incompatible with psutils.  fixnt is a filter that fixes these problems, allowing the use of psnup(1).

       The filter takes the broken postscript file on stdin, and outputs a fixed postscript file on stdout.  It has no other form for invocation and takes no options on the command-line.

OPTIONS
       fixnt  takes no options.

BUGS
       fixnt does not check for NTPSOct94.  For a workaround, use a sed(1) command to replace 'NTPSOct94' with 'NTPSOct95', like so:
              sed 's/NTPSOct94/NTPSOct95/g'
       This is particularly important for Windows NT 3.5 users.

REPORTING BUGS
       Report bugs to the Authors, but avoid sending large postscript files.

       Patches are always welcome; send to <bauer@itsm.uni-stuttgart.de>.
