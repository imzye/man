Text::CSV::Unicode(3pm)                                                             User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                             Text::CSV::Unicode(3pm)

NAME
       Text::CSV::Unicode -     comma-separated values manipulation routines                with potentially wide character data

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::CSV::Unicode;

           $csv = Text::CSV::Unicode->new();

           # then use methods from Text::CSV

           $version = Text::CSV::Unicode->VERSION();   # get the module version

           $csv = Text::CSV::Unicode->new();   # create a new object

           $status = $csv->combine(@columns);  # combine columns into a string
           $line = $csv->string();             # get the combined string

           $status = $csv->parse($line);       # parse a CSV string into fields
           @columns = $csv->fields();          # get the parsed fields

           $status = $csv->status();           # get the most recent status
           $bad_argument = $csv->error_input();# get the most recent bad argument

DESCRIPTION
       Text::CSV::Unicode provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of comma-separated values, based on Text::CSV.  Text::CSV::Unicode allows for input with wide character data but does
       not permit control characters.

Incompatible Changes
   Option always_quote=>1 (v0.300)
       Before v0.300, the module behaviour defaulted to "always_quote => 1" in Text::CSV.  This behaviour was only needed in tests.

       To recreate the old behaviour:

           $csv = Text::CSV::Unicode->new( { always_quote => 1 } );

DEPRECATED
       The option "binary => 1" does not require this module.

       This code issues a 'deprecated' warning and creates a Text::CSV object:

           $csv = Text::CSV::Unicode->new( { binary => 1 } );

METHODS
       VERSION
           This function may be called as a class or an object method.  As a class method, it returns the currrent module version.  As an object method, it returns the version of the underlying Text::CSV
           module.

       version
           An object method: it returns the backend module version.

       new
               $csv = Text::CSV::Unicode->new( [{ binary => 1 }] );

           This function may be called as a class method.  It returns a reference to a newly created object.

           "binary => 0" allows the same ASCII input as Text::CSV.

           "binary => 1" allows for all Unicode characters in the input (including \r and \n): the same functionality as "Text::CSV->new( { binary => 1 }".

       combine
               $status = $csv->combine(@columns);

           This object function constructs a CSV string from the arguments, returning success or failure.  Failure can result from lack of arguments or an argument containing an invalid character.

           Silently accepts undef values in input and treats as an empty string.

       parse
               $status = $csv->parse($line);

           This  object  function  decomposes  a  CSV  string into fields, returning success or failure.  Failure can result from a lack of argument or the given CSV string is improperly formatted.  Upon
           failure, the value returned by "fields()" is undefined and "error_input()" can be called to retrieve the invalid argument.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None
