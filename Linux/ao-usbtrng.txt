NAME
       ao-usbtrng - dump random numbers from USBtrng

SYNOPSIS
       ao-usbtrng [OPTION...] [KBYTES]

DESCRIPTION
       ao-usbtrng  dumps  random numbers from a USBtrng device. If provided KBYTES specifies the number of 1024 byte blocks to produce on standard output. Without KBYTES ao-usbtrng produces random bytes con‐
       tinuously until killed.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              increase verbosity

       -T, -tty=TTYDEVICE
              This selects which tty device the debugger uses to communicate with the target device. The special name 'BITBANG' directs ao-dbg to use the cp2103 connection, otherwise this should be a usb se‐
              rial port connected to a suitable cc1111 debug node.

       -D, --device=ALTOSDEVICE
              Search for a connected device. This requires an argument of one of the following forms:

              usbtrng:2
              usbtrng
              2

              Leaving out the product name will cause the tool to select a suitable product, leaving out the serial number will cause the tool to match one of the available devices.

USAGE
       ao-usbtrng opens the target device and reads the specified number of KBYTES of random data.
