NAME
       pass-extension-tail - a password-store extension to avoid printing the password

SYNOPSIS
       pass tail [ pass-name ]
       pass tailedit [ pass-name ]

DESCRIPTION
       pass(1)  proposes  a  format  to store meta data in the password file.  The password is stored in the first line followed by data like the URL, username and other meta data in the following lines.
       pass-extension-tail is an extension for the pass(1) that allows users to display and edit password meta data without displaying the password itself to bystanders.

COMMANDS
       tail pass-name
              Display the whole password file except for the first line. This allows users to inspect the meta data on the console without displaying the password in plain text.

       tailedit pass-name
              Open the password file in the editor omitting the first line. When saving the first line is prepended.
