NAME
       git-merge-into - Merge one branch into another

SYNOPSIS
       git merge-into [src] <dest> [--ff-only]

DESCRIPTION
       Merge  one branch into another, and keep yourself on current branch. If
       src branch not given, it will merge current one to dest.

OPTIONS
       <src>

       The name of the branch will be merged into. If this not given, use cur‐
       rent branch as default.

       <dest>

       The name of the branch to merge into.

       --ff-only

       Refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero status unless the current HEAD
       is already up-to-date or the merge can be resolved as a fast-forward.

EXAMPLES
       Assume the following history exists and the current branch is src:

                            A---B---C src(current)
                           /
                      D---E---F---G dest

       After running git merge-into dest, it will look like this:

                           A---B---C src(current)
                           /         \
                      D---E---F---G---H dest

       The H commit will record the merge result, just  like  what  git  merge
       does. And src is still the current branch.

       The  default  implementation  of  merge-into  use  git checkout and git
       merge, which may cause temporary change in the  working  tree.  If  you
       make  sure  your  branch  can  be merged fast-forward, add --ff-only to
       avoid files change.
