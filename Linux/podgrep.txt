NAME
       podgrep - grep in pod sections only

SYNOPSIS
       podgrep [-i] [-p] [-f] [-h] pattern [ files ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program searches each paragraph in a pod document and prints each
       paragraph that matches the supplied pattern.  This pod may be mixed
       with program code, such as in a module.

       Options are:

       -i  means case insensitive match

       -p  means page output though the user's pager.  The pager will be
           primed with an argument to search for the string.  This highlights
           the result.

       -f  means format output though the pod2text program.

       -h  means check for matches in pod "=head" and "=item" headers alone,
           and to keep printing podagraphs until the next header is found.

EXAMPLES
           $ podgrep mail `pmpath CGI`
           (prints out podagraphs from the CGI.pm manpage that mention mail)

           $ podgrep -i destructor `sitepods`
           (prints out podagraphs that mention destructors in the
            site-installed pods)

           $ podgrep -i 'type.?glob' `stdpods`

           (prints out podagraphs that mention typeglob in the
            standard pods)

           $ podgrep -hpfi "lock" `faqpods`

           (prints out all podagraphs with "lock" in the headers
           case-insensitively, then formats these with pod2text, then
           shows them in the pager with matches high-lighted)

           $ podgrep -fh seek `podpath perlfunc`
           (prints out and formats podagraphs from the standard perlfunc manpage
           whose headers or items contain "seek".)

NOTE
       For a pager, the author likes these environment settings (in the login
       startup, of course):

           $ENV{PAGER} = "less";
           $ENV{LESS}  = "MQeicsnf";
