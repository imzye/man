NAME
       sup-sync-back-maildir - Export Xapian entries to Maildir sources on disk

SYNOPSIS
       sup-sync-back-maildir [options] [source uri...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  script  parses the Xapian entries for a given Maildir source and renames (changes maildir flags) e-mail files on disk according to the labels stored in the index.  It will export all the changes
       you made in Sup to your Maildirs so that they can be propagated to your IMAP server with e.g. offlineimap.

       The script also merges some Maildir flags into Sup such as R (replied) and P (passed, forwarded), for instance suppose you have an e-mail file like this: foo_bar:2,FRS (flags  are  favorite,  replied,
       seen) and its Xapian entry has labels `starred', the merge operation will add the `replied' label to the Xapian entry.

       If you choose not to merge (-m) you will lose information (`replied'), and in the previous example the file will be renamed to foo_bar:2,FS.

       Running this script is strongly recommended when setting the “sync_back_to_maildir” option from false to true in config.yaml or changing the “sync_back” flag to true for a source in sources.yaml.

       If  no  source  is  given,  the  default  behavior  is  to  sync  back  all  Maildir sources marked as usual and that have not disabled sync back using the configuration parameter sync_back = false in
       sources.yaml.

OPTIONS
       -n, --no-confirm
              Don’t ask for confirmation before synchronizing

       -m, --no-merge
              Don’t merge new supported Maildir flags (R and P)

       -l, --list-sources
              List your Maildir sources and exit

       -u, --unusual-sources-too
              Sync unusual sources too if no specific source information is given

       --version
              Print version and exit

       -h, --help
              Show brief help message
