NAME
       borg-export-tar - Export archive contents as a tarball

SYNOPSIS
       borg [common options] export-tar [options] ARCHIVE FILE [PATH...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command creates a tarball from an archive.

       When giving '-' as the output FILE, Borg will write a tar stream to standard output.

       By default (--tar-filter=auto) Borg will detect whether the FILE should be compressed based on its file extension and pipe the tarball through an appropriate filter before writing it to FILE:

       • .tar.gz or .tgz: gzip

       • .tar.bz2 or .tbz: bzip2

       • .tar.xz or .txz: xz

       • .tar.zstd or .tar.zst: zstd

       • .tar.lz4: lz4

       Alternatively, a --tar-filter program may be explicitly specified. It should read the uncompressed tar stream from stdin and write a compressed/filtered tar stream to stdout.

       The generated tarball uses the GNU tar format.

       export-tar  is a lossy conversion: BSD flags, ACLs, extended attributes (xattrs), atime and ctime are not exported.  Timestamp resolution is limited to whole seconds, not the nanosecond resolution
       otherwise supported by Borg.

       A --sparse option (as found in borg extract) is not supported.

       By default the entire archive is extracted but a subset of files and directories can be selected by passing a list of PATHs as arguments.  The file selection can further be restricted by using the
       --exclude option.

       For more help on include/exclude patterns, see the borg_patterns command output.

       --progress can be slower than no progress display, since it makes one additional pass over the archive metadata.

OPTIONS
       See borg-common(1) for common options of Borg commands.

   arguments
       ARCHIVE
              archive to export

       FILE   output tar file. "-" to write to stdout instead.

       PATH   paths to extract; patterns are supported

   options
       --tar-filter
              filter program to pipe data through

       --list output verbose list of items (files, dirs, ...)

   Include/Exclude options
       -e PATTERN, --exclude PATTERN
              exclude paths matching PATTERN

       --exclude-from EXCLUDEFILE
              read exclude patterns from EXCLUDEFILE, one per line

       --pattern PATTERN
              include/exclude paths matching PATTERN

       --patterns-from PATTERNFILE
              read include/exclude patterns from PATTERNFILE, one per line

       --strip-components NUMBER
              Remove the specified number of leading path elements. Paths with fewer elements will be silently skipped.

EXAMPLES
          # export as uncompressed tar
          $ borg export-tar /path/to/repo::Monday Monday.tar

          # exclude some types, compress using gzip
          $ borg export-tar /path/to/repo::Monday Monday.tar.gz --exclude '*.so'

          # use higher compression level with gzip
          $ borg export-tar --tar-filter="gzip -9" testrepo::linux Monday.tar.gz

          # export a tar, but instead of storing it on disk,
          # upload it to a remote site using curl.
          $ borg export-tar /path/to/repo::Monday - | curl --data-binary @- https://somewhere/to/POST

          # remote extraction via "tarpipe"
          $ borg export-tar /path/to/repo::Monday - | ssh somewhere "cd extracted; tar x"
