NAME
       nutcracker - Fast, light-weight proxy for memcached and Redis

SYNOPSIS
       nutcracker [options]

DESCRIPTION
       nutcracker, also known as twemproxy (pronounced "two-em-proxy"), is a fast and lightweight proxy for the memcached and Redis protocols.

       It was primarily built to reduce the connection count on backend caching servers, but it has a number of features, such as:

       •      Maintains persistent server connections to backend servers.

       •      Enables pipelining of requests and responses.

       •      Supports multiple server pools simultaneously.

       •      Shard data automatically across multiple servers.

       •      Supports multiple hashing modes including consistent hashing and distribution.

       •      High-availability by disabling nodes on failures.

       •      Observability through stats exposed on stats monitoring port.
