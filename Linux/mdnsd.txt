NAME
       mdnsd.service — mdnsd service configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/mdns.d/*.service

DESCRIPTION
       mdnsd  needs  at  least  one  .service  file to actively announce itself.  The systems that mdnsd targets usually have an SSH or HTTP/HTTPS service, which can be located by end-users with mDNS-SD.
       E.g., mdnsd may be embedded in your printer, an access point, an industrial switch, or other headless network connected device.

       Services are defined one per .service file and only two fields are mandatory:

       type TYPE
             The TYPE can be any service type from /etc/services, prefixed with an underscore.  E.g., 'ipp' is port 631/tcp, which gives the type _ipp._tcp

       port PORT
             The port is the UDP or TCP port to announce.  This can also be found in the file /etc/services.

       There are also a few optional fields supported, see below for examples:

       name STRING
             Free form string to describe service.  Usually what is presented to end users by discovery agents.

       txt STRING
             Text records are free-form strings that are included in service announcements.  Useful for announcing meta data about your service.

       target URL
             URL to announce as canonical for this service.

       cname URL
             A cname is an alias that can be announced for unique service reqords.  E.g., if only one HTTP service is available on the LAN it can be reached through the full  name,  or  using  the  cname
             alias.

EXAMPLES
       This section has some examples of mDNS service definitions.

   SSH
             # mDNS-SD advertisement of SSH service
             type _ssh._tcp
             port 22

   FTP
             # mDNS-SD advertisement of FTP service
             name Troglobit FTP Server
             type _ftp._tcp
             port 21
             txt server=uftpd
             txt version=2.6
             target ftp.luthien.local

   HTTP
             # mDNS-SD advertisement of HTTP service
             type _http._tcp
             port 80
             txt server=merecat
             txt version=2.31
             cname home.local

   Printer
             # mDNS-SD advertisement of foo._printer._tcp.local.
             type _printer._tcp
             port 515

   IPP
             # mDNS-SD advertisement of foo._ipp._tcp.local.
             type _ipp._tcp
             port 631
