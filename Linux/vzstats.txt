NAME
       vzstats - report OpenVZ usage statistics

SYNOPSIS
       vzstats
       vzstats --view|--status
       vzstats --enable|--disable
       vzstats --help

DESCRIPTION
       Utility  vzstats,  installed  on an OpenVZ server, periodically collects some usage statistics and sends it to the OpenVZ stats server, http://stats.openvz.org, for processing and analysis. Aggregated
       statistics from all reports are available through the web interface.

       Statistics reported include some basic hardware information (CPU, RAM, file system and disk space usage for /vz), software information (distribution version, kernel version, OpenVZ software versions),
       and some OpenVZ-specific information (number of containers running/total, number of containers using vswap and ploop, used OS templates etc.). Information submission is anonymous; information that can
       be used to directly identify a particular host (i.e. MAC or IP addresses, hostnames etc.) is not being reported.

       For the server to anonymously identify reports from the same client, a unique random ID (UUID v4) is requested from the server during the first vzstats run. It is then  saved  locally  and  used  when
       sending reports.

       If run without any options and unless disabled, vzstats runs report scripts found in REPDIR (defined in vzstats.conf, default is /usr/lib/vzstats), collects their output and sends it, as a tarball, to
       stats server.

OPTIONS
       In case any option is provided, no report is being send, instead an action denoted by the option is performed.

       The following options are supported:

       --view Collect but do not send report, giving a user an ability to see what exact information would be send.

       --config
              Output current vzstats configuration, including:
              • current version number;
              • status (enabled or disabled);
              • an URL used to submit reports to;
              • vzstats UUID;
              • report scripts directory.

       --disable
              Disable reporting. This is performed by creating a marker file, /etc/vz/vzstats-disable.  vzstats checks this file upon start, and exits if it is present.

       --enable
              Re-enable reporting.

       --help Show usage.
