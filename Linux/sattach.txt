NAME
       sattach - Attach to a Slurm job step.

SYNOPSIS
       sattach [options] <jobid.stepid>

DESCRIPTION
       sattach  attaches to a running Slurm job step.  By attaching, it makes available the IO streams of all of the tasks of a running Slurm job step.  It also suitable for use with a parallel debugger like
       TotalView.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help information and exit.

       --input-filter[=]<task number>
       --output-filter[=]<task number>
       --error-filter[=]<task number>
              Only transmit standard input to a single task, or print the standard output or standard error from a single task.  The filtering is performed locally in sattach.

       -l, --label
              Prepend each line of task standard output or standard error with the task number of its origin.

       --layout
              Contacts the slurmctld to obtain the task layout information for the job step, prints the task layout information, and then exits without attaching to the job step.

       --pty  Execute task zero in pseudo terminal.  Not compatible with the --input-filter, --output-filter, or --error-filter options.  Notes: The terminal size and resize events are  ignored  by  sattach.
              Proper operation requires that the job step be initiated by srun using the --pty option.

       -Q, --quiet
              Suppress informational messages from sattach. Errors will still be displayed.

       -u, --usage
              Display brief usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display Slurm version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the verbosity of sattach's informational messages.  Multiple -v's will further increase sattach's verbosity.

PERFORMANCE
       Executing  sattach  sends a remote procedure call to slurmctld. If enough calls from sattach or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmctld daemon come in at once, it
       can result in a degradation of performance of the slurmctld daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run sattach or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmctld from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to sattach to the  mini‐
       mum necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

INPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Upon startup, salloc will read and handle the options set in the following environment variables.  Note: Command line options always override environment variables settings.

       SLURM_CONF
              The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       SLURM_EXIT_ERROR
              Specifies the exit code generated when a Slurm error occurs (e.g. invalid options).  This can be used by a script to distinguish application exit codes from various Slurm error conditions.

EXAMPLES
       Attach to job 15, step 0:

              $ sattach 15.0

       Limit the output to the 5th task of job 65386, step 15:

              $ sattach --output-filter 5 65386.15
