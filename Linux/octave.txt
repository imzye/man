NAME
       octave - A high-level interactive programming language for numerical computations.

SYNOPSIS
       octave [options]... [file]

DESCRIPTION
       Octave  is a high-level interactive scientific programming language.  It has a powerful mathematics-oriented syntax for solving problems numerically, as well as built-in 2-D/3-D plotting and visu‐
       alization tools.  Octave provides an integrated development environment in either graphical or command-line form.  Programs may also be run in batch mode to process data without interaction.

OPTIONS
       A list of the most useful command-line options for octave is available by running the following command from the shell.

       octave --help

DOCUMENTATION
       The primary documentation for Octave is written using Texinfo, the GNU documentation system, which allows the same source files to be used to produce online and printed versions of the manual.

       You can read the built-in copy of the Octave documentation by issuing the following command from within octave.

           octave:1> doc

       The Info files may also be read with a stand-alone program such as info or xinfo.  HTML, Postscript, or PDF versions of the documentation are installed on many systems as well.  The latest version
       of the documentation is available at https://docs.octave.org/latest.

BUGS
       The Octave project maintains a bug tracker at https://bugs.octave.org.  Before submitting a new item please read the instructions at https://www.octave.org/bugs.html on

FILES
       Upon startup Octave looks for four initialization files.  Each file may contain any number of valid Octave commands.

       octave-home/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc
              Site-wide initialization file which changes options for all users.  octave-home is the directory where Octave was installed such as /usr/local.

       octave-home/share/octave/version/m/startup/octaverc
              Site-wide initialization file for Octave version version.

       ~/.octaverc
              User's personal initialization file.

       .octaverc
              Project-specific initialization file located in the current directory.
