DESCRIPTION
       This module implements RFC 5322 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322> parser and formatter of email addresses and groups. It parses an input string from email headers which contain a list of email
       addresses or a groups of email addresses (like From, To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender, ...). Also it can generate a string value for those headers from a list of email addresses objects. Module is
       backward compatible with RFC 2822 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822> and RFC 822 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822>.

       Parser and formatter functionality is implemented in XS and uses shared code from Dovecot IMAP server.

       It is a drop-in replacement for the Email::Address module which has several security issues. E.g. issue CVE-2015-7686 (Algorithmic complexity vulnerability) <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
       bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7686>, which allows remote attackers to cause denial of service, is still present in Email::Address version 1.908.

       Email::Address::XS module was created to finally fix CVE-2015-7686.

       Existing applications that use Email::Address module could be easily switched to Email::Address::XS module. In most cases only changing "use Email::Address" to "use Email::Address::XS" and
       replacing every "Email::Address" occurrence with "Email::Address::XS" is sufficient.

       So unlike Email::Address, this module does not use regular expressions for parsing but instead native XS implementation parses input string sequentially according to RFC 5322 grammar.

       Additionally it has support also for named groups and so can be use instead of the Email::Address::List module.

       If you are looking for the module which provides object representation for the list of email addresses suitable for the MIME email headers, see Email::MIME::Header::AddressList.

   EXPORT
       None by default. Exportable functions are: "parse_email_addresses", "parse_email_groups", "format_email_addresses", "format_email_groups", "compose_address", "split_address".

   Exportable Functions
       format_email_addresses
             use Email::Address::XS qw(format_email_addresses);

             my $winstons_address = Email::Address::XS->new(phrase => 'Winston Smith', address => 'winston@recdep.minitrue');
             my $julias_address = Email::Address::XS->new(phrase => 'Julia', address => 'julia@ficdep.minitrue');
             my @addresses = ($winstons_address, $julias_address);
             my $string = format_email_addresses(@addresses);
             print $string;
             # "Winston Smith" <winston@recdep.minitrue>, Julia <julia@ficdep.minitrue>

           Takes a list of email address objects and returns one formatted string of those email addresses.

       format_email_groups
             use Email::Address::XS qw(format_email_groups);

             my $winstons_address = Email::Address::XS->new(phrase => 'Winston Smith', user => 'winston.smith', host => 'recdep.minitrue');
             my $julias_address = Email::Address::XS->new('Julia', 'julia@ficdep.minitrue');
             my $users_address = Email::Address::XS->new(address => 'user@oceania');

             my $groups_string = format_email_groups('Brotherhood' => [ $winstons_address, $julias_address ], undef() => [ $users_address ]);
             print $groups_string;
             # Brotherhood: "Winston Smith" <winston.smith@recdep.minitrue>, Julia <julia@ficdep.minitrue>;, user@oceania

             my $undisclosed_string = format_email_groups('undisclosed-recipients' => []);
             print $undisclosed_string;
             # undisclosed-recipients:;

           Like  "format_email_addresses"  but this method takes pairs which consist of a group display name and a reference to address list. If a group is not undef then address list is formatted inside
           named group.

       parse_email_addresses
             use Email::Address::XS qw(parse_email_addresses);

             my $string = '"Winston Smith" <winston.smith@recdep.minitrue>, Julia <julia@ficdep.minitrue>, user@oceania';
             my @addresses = parse_email_addresses($string);
             # @addresses now contains three Email::Address::XS objects, one for each address

           Parses an input string and returns a list of Email::Address::XS objects. Optional second string argument specifies class name for blessing new objects.

       parse_email_groups
             use Email::Address::XS qw(parse_email_groups);

             my $string = 'Brotherhood: "Winston Smith" <winston.smith@recdep.minitrue>, Julia <julia@ficdep.minitrue>;, user@oceania, undisclosed-recipients:;';
             my @groups = parse_email_groups($string);
             # @groups now contains list ('Brotherhood' => [ $winstons_object, $julias_object ], undef() => [ $users_object ], 'undisclosed-recipients' => [])

           Like "parse_email_addresses" but this function returns a list of pairs: a group display name and a reference to a list of addresses which belongs to that named group.  An  undef  value  for  a
           group means that a following list of addresses is not inside any named group. An output is in a same format as a input for the function "format_email_groups".  This function preserves order of
           groups and does not do any de-duplication or merging.

       compose_address
             use Email::Address::XS qw(compose_address);
             my $string_address = compose_address($user, $host);

           Takes an unescaped user part and unescaped host part of an address and returns escaped address.

           Available since version 1.01.

       split_address
             use Email::Address::XS qw(split_address);
             my ($user, $host) = split_address($string_address);

           Takes  an  escaped  address and split it into pair of unescaped user part and unescaped host part of address. If splitting input address into these two parts is not possible then this function
           returns pair of undefs.

           Available since version 1.01.

   Class Methods
       new
             my $empty_address = Email::Address::XS->new();
             my $winstons_address = Email::Address::XS->new(phrase => 'Winston Smith', user => 'winston.smith', host => 'recdep.minitrue', comment => 'Records Department');
             my $julias_address = Email::Address::XS->new('Julia', 'julia@ficdep.minitrue');
             my $users_address = Email::Address::XS->new(address => 'user@oceania');
             my $only_name = Email::Address::XS->new(phrase => 'Name');
             my $copy_of_winstons_address = Email::Address::XS->new(copy => $winstons_address);

           Constructs and returns a new "Email::Address::XS" object. Takes named list of arguments: phrase, address, user, host, comment and copy.  An argument address  takes  precedence  over  user  and
           host.

           When an argument copy is specified then it is expected an Email::Address::XS object and a cloned copy of that object is returned. All other parameters are ignored.

           Old  syntax  from  the Email::Address module is supported too. Takes one to four positional arguments: phrase, address comment, and original string. Passing an argument original is deprecated,
           ignored and throws a warning.

       parse
             my $winstons_address = Email::Address::XS->parse('"Winston Smith" <winston.smith@recdep.minitrue> (Records Department)');
             my @users_addresses = Email::Address::XS->parse('user1@oceania, user2@oceania');

           Parses an input string and returns a list of an Email::Address::XS objects. Same as the function "parse_email_addresses" but this one is class method.

           In scalar context this function returns just first parsed object.  If more then one object was parsed then "is_valid" method on returned object returns false. If  no  object  was  parsed  then
           empty Email::Address::XS object is returned.

           Prior to version 1.01 return value in scalar context is undef when no object was parsed.

       parse_bare_address
             my $winstons_address = Email::Address::XS->parse_bare_address('winston.smith@recdep.minitrue');

           Parses  an  input  string  as  one bare email address (addr spec) which does not allow phrase part or angle brackets around email address and returns an Email::Address::XS object. It is just a
           wrapper around "address" method. Method "is_valid" can be used to check if parsing was successful.

           Available since version 1.01.

   Object Methods
       format
             my $string = $address->format();

           Returns formatted Email::Address::XS object as a string. This method throws a warning when "user" or "host" part of the email address is invalid or empty string.

       is_valid
             my $is_valid = $address->is_valid();

           Returns true if the parse function or method which created this Email::Address::XS object had not received any syntax error on input string and also that "user" and "host" part  of  the  email
           address are not empty strings.

           Thus this function can be used for checking if Email::Address::XS object is valid before calling "format" method on it.

           Available since version 1.01.

       phrase
             my $phrase = $address->phrase();
             $address->phrase('Winston Smith');

           Accessor and mutator for the phrase (display name).

       user
             my $user = $address->user();
             $address->user('winston.smith');

           Accessor and mutator for the unescaped user (local/mailbox) part of an address.

       host
             my $host = $address->host();
             $address->host('recdep.minitrue');

           Accessor and mutator for the unescaped host (domain) part of an address.

           Since version 1.03 this method checks if setting a new value is syntactically valid. If not undef is set and returned.

       address
             my $string_address = $address->address();
             $address->address('winston.smith@recdep.minitrue');

           Accessor and mutator for the escaped address (addr spec).

           Internally  this  module stores a user and a host part of an address separately. Function "compose_address" is used for composing full address and function "split_address" for splitting into a
           user and a host parts. If splitting new address into these two parts is not possible then this method returns undef and sets both parts to undef.

       comment
             my $comment = $address->comment();
             $address->comment('Records Department');

           Accessor and mutator for the comment which is formatted after an address. A comment can contain another nested comments in round brackets.  When  setting  new  comment  this  method  check  if
           brackets are balanced. If not undef is set and returned.

       name
             my $name = $address->name();

           This  method tries to return a name which belongs to the address. It returns either "phrase" or "comment" or "user" part of the address or empty string (first defined value in this order). But
           it never returns undef.

       as_string
             my $address = Email::Address::XS->new(phrase => 'Winston Smith', address => 'winston.smith@recdep.minitrue');
             my $stringified = $address->as_string();

           This method is used for object stringification. It returns string representation of object. By default object is stringified to "format".

           Available since version 1.01.

       original
             my $address = Email::Address::XS->parse('(Winston) "Smith"   <winston.smith@recdep.minitrue> (Minitrue)');
             my $original = $address->original();
             # (Winston) "Smith"   <winston.smith@recdep.minitrue> (Minitrue)
             my $format = $address->format();
             # Smith <winston.smith@recdep.minitrue> (Minitrue)

           This method returns original part of the string which was used for parsing current Email::Address::XS object. If object was not created by parsing input string, then this method returns undef.

           Note that "format" method does not have to return same original string.

           Available since version 1.01.

   Overloaded Operators
       stringify
             my $address = Email::Address::XS->new(phrase => 'Winston Smith', address => 'winston.smith@recdep.minitrue');
             print "Winston's address is $address.";
             # Winston's address is "Winston Smith" <winston.smith@recdep.minitrue>.

           Stringification is done by method "as_string".

   Deprecated Functions and Variables
       For compatibility with the Email::Address module there are defined some deprecated functions and variables.  Do not use them in new code. Their usage throws warnings.

       Altering deprecated variable $Email::Address::XS::STRINGIFY changes method which is called for objects stringification.

       Deprecated cache functions "purge_cache", "disable_cache" and "enable_cache" are noop and do nothing.
