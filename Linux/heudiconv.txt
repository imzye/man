NAME
       heudiconv - DICOM converter for organizing brain imaging data into structured directory layouts

DESCRIPTION
       usage: heudiconv [-h] [--version]

              [-d  DICOM_DIR_TEMPLATE  |  --files [FILES ...]]  [-s [SUBJS ...]] [-c {dcm2niix,none}] [-o OUTDIR] [-l LOCATOR] [-a CONV_OUTDIR] [--anon-cmd ANON_CMD] [-f HEURISTIC] [-p] [-ss SESSION] [-b
              [BIDSOPTION1  [BIDSOPTION2  ...]]]  [--overwrite]  [--datalad]  [--dbg]  [--command  {heuristics,heuristic-info,ls,populate-templates,sanitize-jsons,treat-jsons,populate-intended-for}]  [-g
              {studyUID,accession_number,all,custom}] [--minmeta] [--random-seed RANDOM_SEED] [--dcmconfig DCMCONFIG] [-q {SLURM,None}] [--queue-args QUEUE_ARGS]

       Example: heudiconv -d 'rawdata/{subject}' -o . -f heuristic.py -s s1 s2 s3

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -d DICOM_DIR_TEMPLATE, --dicom_dir_template DICOM_DIR_TEMPLATE
              Location  of  dicomdir that can be indexed with subject id {subject} and session {session}. Tarballs (can be compressed) are supported in addition to directory.  All matching tarballs for a
              subject are extracted and their content processed in a single pass. If multiple tarballs are found, each is assumed to be a separate session and the --ses argument is ignored. Note that you
              might need to surround the value with quotes to avoid {...} being considered by shell

       --files [FILES ...]
              Files (tarballs, dicoms) or directories containing files to process. Cannot be provided if using --dicom_dir_template.

       -s [SUBJS ...], --subjects [SUBJS ...]
              List of subjects - required for dicom template. If not provided, DICOMS would first be "sorted" and subject IDs deduced by the heuristic.

       -c {dcm2niix,none}, --converter {dcm2niix,none}
              Tool to use for DICOM conversion. Setting to "none" disables the actual conversion step -- useful for testing heuristics.

       -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
              Output directory for conversion setup (for further customization and future reference. This directory will refer to non-anonymized subject IDs.

       -l LOCATOR, --locator LOCATOR
              Study path under outdir. If provided, it overloads the value provided by the heuristic. If --datalad is enabled, every directory within locator becomes a super-dataset thus  establishing  a
              hierarchy. Setting to "unknown" will skip that dataset.

       -a CONV_OUTDIR, --conv-outdir CONV_OUTDIR
              Output directory for converted files. By default this is identical to --outdir. This option is most useful in combination with --anon-cmd.

       --anon-cmd ANON_CMD
              Command to run to convert subject IDs used for DICOMs to anonymized IDs. Such command must take a single argument and return a single anonymized ID. Also see --conv-outdir.

       -f HEURISTIC, --heuristic HEURISTIC
              Name of a known heuristic or path to the Python script containing heuristic.

       -p, --with-prov
              Store additional provenance information. Requires python-rdflib.

       -ss SESSION, --ses SESSION
              Session for longitudinal study_sessions. Default is None.

       -b [BIDSOPTION1 [BIDSOPTION2 ...]], --bids [BIDSOPTION1 [BIDSOPTION2 ...]]
              Flag  for output into BIDS structure. Can also take BIDS-specific options, e.g., --bids notop. The only currently supported options is "notop", which skips creation of top-level BIDS files.
              This is useful when running in batch mode to prevent possible race conditions.

       --overwrite
              Overwrite existing converted files.

       --datalad
              Store the entire collection as DataLad dataset(s).  Small files will be committed directly to git, while large to annex. New version (6) of annex repositories will be used in a "thin"  mode
              so it would look to mortals as just any other regular directory (i.e. no symlinks to under .git/annex). For now just for BIDS mode.

       --dbg  Do not catch exceptions and show exception traceback.

       --command {heuristics,heuristic-info,ls,populate-templates,sanitize-jsons,treat-jsons,populate-intended-for}
              Custom action to be performed on provided files instead of regular operation.

       -g {studyUID,accession_number,all,custom}, --grouping {studyUID,accession_number,all,custom}
              How to group dicoms (default: by studyUID).

       --minmeta
              Exclude dcmstack meta information in sidecar jsons.

       --random-seed RANDOM_SEED
              Random seed to initialize RNG.

       --dcmconfig DCMCONFIG
              JSON file for additional dcm2niix configuration.

   Conversion submission options:
       -q {SLURM,None}, --queue {SLURM,None}
              Batch system to submit jobs in parallel.

       --queue-args QUEUE_ARGS
              Additional queue arguments passed as a single string of space-separated Argument=Value pairs.
