NAME
       omniMapper - Simple proxy for CORBA naming service from omniORB

SYNOPSIS
       omniMapper [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the omniMapper command.

       omniMapper  is  a simple daemon which listens on port 2809 (or any other port) and redirects IIOP requets for configured object keys to associated persistent IORs.  It can be used to make a naming
       service (even an old non-INS aware version of omniNames or other ORB's naming service) appear on port 2809 with the object key NameService.  The same goes for any other service  you  may  wish  to
       specify, such as an interace repository.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the HTML pages included in the omniorb4-doc package.

       -port port
              This allows you to choose a port other than 2809 to listen on.

       -config config_file
              This specifies a location for the configuration file.  The default name is /etc/omniMapper.cfg.

       -v     omniMapper does not normally print anything; this option makes it verbose so it prints configuration information and a record of the redirections it makes to standard output.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration file is very simple.  Each line contains a string to be used as an object key, some white space and an IOR (or any valid URI) that it will redirect that object key to.  Comments
       should be prefixed with a # character.  For example:
           # Example omniMapper.cfg
           NameService         IOR:000f...
           InterfaceRepository IOR:0100...

SEE ALSO
       omniNames(8).
       The programs are documented fully by the HTML documentation in the omniorb4-doc package.
