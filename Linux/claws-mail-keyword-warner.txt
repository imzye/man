NAME
       claws-mail-keyword-warner - missing keywords warning before sending

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-keyword-warner package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-keyword-warner is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       It warns the user if one or more of the configured keywords are mentioned in the text of the mail message being sent or queued.

       Mentions are found by simple regex matching, although some care is taken to avoid false positives.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named keyword_warner.so, and press
       the “Open” button.

SEE ALSO
       claws-mail(1), claws-mail-extra-plugins(7).
