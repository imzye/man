NAME
       wavtool-pl - program to concatenate and mix wav files

SYNOPSIS

       wavtool-pl {outfile} {infile} {offset} {length} {p1} {p2} {p3} {v1} {v2} {v3} {v4} {ovr} {p4} {p5} {v5}

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wavtool-pl command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       wavtool-pl is a program that can concatenate and mix wav files. Also adjust the volume of the wav files. The program will concatenate the input file to the end of the output file. If ovr is set,
       the input will be mixed with the end of the output file.

       To adjust the volume, use the 5 points (p1 ~ p5) and the corresponding volume parameter (v1 - v5). The relationship of the points are offset -> p1 -> p2 -> p5 ... p3 <- p4 <- (offset+length).

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       outfile
           The output file

       infile
           The input file

       offset
           How much offset (in msec) from head of the input file needs to skip.

       length
           How much length (in msec) from offset of the input file needs to be processed.

       p1
           point 1 (in msec). It is the relative position after offset.

       p2
           point 2 (in msec). It is the relative position after p1.

       p3
           point 3 (in msec). It is the relative position before p4.

       v1
           volume for point 1. The value is 0 to 100 which means percentage.

       v2
           volume for point 2. The value is 0 to 100 which means percentage.

       v3
           volume for point 3. The value is 0 to 100 which means percentage.

       v4
           volume for point 4. The value is 0 to 100 which means percentage.

       ovr
           The length of overlap (in msec). The head of the input (after offset) will be mixed with the end of the output.

       p4
           point 4 (in msec). It is the relative position before the end of input (offset + length).

       p5
           point 5 (in msec). It is the relative position after p2.

       v5
           volume for point 5. The value is 0 to 100 which means percentage.
