NAME
       persistence.conf - Configuration file for persistence media in live-boot

DESCRIPTION
       If  live-boot  probes  a persistence volume with the label (or GPT name, or file name, but from now on we will just say "label") "persistence", that volume's persistence is fully customizable
       through the persistence.conf file stored on the root of its file system. Any such labeled volume must have such a file, or it will be ignored.

       The format of persistence.conf allows empty lines and lines starting with a "#" (used for comments), both which will be ignored. A so called "custom mount" has the format:

              DIR [OPTION]...

       which roughly translates to "make DIR persistence in the way described by the list of OPTIONs".

       For each custom mount DIR must be an absolute path that cannot contain white spaces or the special . and .. path components, and cannot be /live (or any of its sub-directories).   Once  acti‐
       vated  all  changes (file deletion, creation and modification) to DIR on the live file system are stored persistently into a path equivalent to DIR on the persistence media, called the source
       directory. The default way to achieve persistence is to simply bind-mount the corresponding source directory to DIR, but this can be changed through the use of OPTIONs.

       All custom mounts will be done in an order so that no two custom mounts can "hide" each other. For instance, if we have the two DIR:s /a and /a/b it would  always  be  the  case  that  /a  is
       mounted  first,  then /a/b. This remains true no matter how the lines in persistence.conf are ordered, or if several persistence.conf files on different persistence media are used at the same
       time. However, it is forbidden for custom mounts to have their source directory inside the source directory of another custom mount, so the source directories that are auto-created  by  live-
       boot  does not support "nested" mounts like /a and /a/b on the same media. In this case you must use the source option (see below) to make sure that they are stored in different source direc‐
       tories.

       When a source directory doesn't exist on the persistence media for a certain custom mount, it will be created automatically, and permissions and ownership will be optimistically set according
       to DIR. It will also be bootstrapped by copying the contents of the DIR into its source directory on the persistence media. The bootstrapping will not happen when the link  or  union  options
       are used (see below).

OPTIONS
       Custom mounts defined in persistence.conf accept the following options in a comma-separated list:

       source=PATH
           When given, store the persistence changes into PATH on the persistence media. PATH must be a relative path (with respect to the persistence media root) that cannot contain white spaces or
           the  special  .  or  .. path components, with the exception that it can be just . which means the persistence media root. This option is mostly relevant if you want to nest custom mounts,
           which otherwise would cause errors, or if you want to make the whole media root available (similar to the now deprecated home-rw type of persistence).

       The following options are mutually exclusive (only the last given one will be in effect):

       bind
           Bind-mount the source directory to DIR. This is the default.

       link
           Create the directory structure of the source directory on the persistence media in DIR and create symbolic links from the corresponding place in DIR to each file in the source  directory.
           Existing  files or directories with the same name as any link will be overwritten. Note that deleting the links in DIR will only remove the link, not the corresponding file in the source;
           removed links will reappear after a reboot. To permanently add or delete a file one must do so directly in the source directory.

           Effectively link will make only files already in the source directory persistent, not any other files in DIR. These files must be manually added to the source directory  to  make  use  of
           this  option, and they will appear in DIR in addition to files already there. This option is useful when only certain files need to be persistent, not the whole directory they're in, e.g.
           some configuration files in a user's home directory.

       union
           Save the rw branch of a union on the persistence media, so only the changes are stored persistently. This can potentially reduce disk usage compared to  bind-mounts,  and  will  not  hide
           files  added  to the read-only media. One caveat is that the union will use DIR from the image's read-only file system, not the real file system root, so files created after boot (e.g. by
           live-config) will not appear in the union. This option will use the union file system specified by live-boot's union boot parameter.

DIRECTORIES
       /live/persistence
           All persistence volumes will be mounted here (in a directory corresponding to the device name). The persistence.conf file can easily be edited through this mount, as well  as  any  source
           directories (which is especially practical for custom mounts using the link option).

EXAMPLES
       Let's say we have a persistence volume VOL with the a persistence.conf file containing the following four lines (numbered for ease of reference):

       1.     /home/user1 link,source=config-files/user1

       2.     /home/user2 link,source=config-files/user2

       3.     /home

       4.     /usr union

       The corresponding source directories are:

       1.     VOL/config-files/user1 (but it would be VOL/home/user1 without the source option)

       2.     VOL/config-files/user2 (but it would be VOL/home/user2 without the source option)

       3.     VOL/home

       4.     VOL/usr

       It was necessary to set the source options for 1 and 2, since they otherwise would become nested with 3's source, which is invalid.

       Line  3 will be taken care of before line 1 and 2 in order to prevent custom mounts 1 and 2 from being hidden by 3. When line 3 is handled, VOL/home is simply bind-mounted on /home. To illus‐
       trate what happens for lines 1 and 2, let's say that the following files exist:

       a.     VOL/config-files/user1/.emacs

       b.     VOL/config-files/user2/.bashrc

       c.     VOL/config-files/user2/.ssh/config

       Then the following links and directories will be created:

       Link:  /home/user1/.emacs -> VOL/config-files/user1/.emacs (from a)

       Link:  /home/user2/.bashrc -> VOL/config-files/user2/.bashrc (from b)

       Dir:   /homea/user2/.ssh (from c)

       Link:  /home/user2/.ssh/config -> VOL/config-files/user2/.ssh/config (from c)

       One could argue, though, that lines 1 and 2 in the example persistence.conf file above are unnecessary since line 3 already would make all of /home persistent. The link option is intended for
       situations where you don't want a complete directory to be persistent, only certain files in it or its sub-directories.

       Line 4 can be mounted at any time since its DIR (and source directory) is completely disjoint from all the other custom mounts. When mounted, VOL/usr will be the rw branch due  to  the  union
       option,  and  will only contain the difference compared to the underlying read-only file system. Hence packages could be installed into /usr with great space-wise efficiency compared to bind-
       mounts, since in the latter case all of /usr would have to be copied into VOL/usr during the initial bootstrap.
