NAME
       Template::Tiny - Template Toolkit reimplemented in as little code as possible

VERSION
       version 1.16

SYNOPSIS
         my $template = Template::Tiny->new(
             TRIM => 1,
         );

         # Print the template results to STDOUT
         $template->process( <<'END_TEMPLATE', { foo => 'World' } );
         Hello [% foo %]!
         END_TEMPLATE

DESCRIPTION
       Template::Tiny is a reimplementation of a subset of the functionality from Template Toolkit in as few lines of code as possible.

       It is intended for use in light-usage, low-memory, or low-cpu templating situations, where you may need to upgrade to the full feature set in the future, or if you want the retain the familiarity
       of TT-style templates.

       For the subset of functionality it implements, it has fully-compatible template and stash API. All templates used with Template::Tiny should be able to be transparently upgraded to full Template
       Toolkit.

       Unlike Template Toolkit, Template::Tiny will process templates without a compile phase (but despite this is still quicker, owing to heavy use of the Perl regular expression engine.

   SUPPORTED USAGE
       Unless otherwise specified, the default Template Toolkit "[% %]" tag style is used. If you want to use different opening and closing tags, specify these when creating your Template::Tiny object:

           my $template = Template::Tiny->new( start_tag => '<%', end_tag => '%>' );

       (for the remainder of the documentation, "[% %]" tags are assumed)

       Both the "[%+ +%]" style explicit whitespace and the "[%- -%]" style explicit chomp are support, although the "[%+ +%]" version is unneeded in practice as Template::Tiny does not support default-
       enabled "PRE_CHOMP" or "POST_CHOMP".

       Variable expressions in the form "[% foo.bar.baz %]" are supported.

       Appropriate simple behaviours for "ARRAY" references, "HASH" references and objects are supported. "VMethods" such as [% array.length %] are not supported at this time.

       "IF", "ELSE" and "UNLESS" conditional blocks are supported, but only with simple "[% foo.bar.baz %]" conditions.

       Support for looping (or rather iteration) is available in simple "[% FOREACH item IN list %]" form is supported. Other loop structures are not supported. Because support for arbitrary or infinite
       looping is not available, Template::Tiny templates are not turing complete. This is intentional.

       All of the four supported control structures "IF"/"ELSE"/"UNLESS"/"FOREACH" can be nested to arbitrary depth.

       The treatment of "_private" hash and method keys is compatible with Template Toolkit, returning null or false rather than the actual content of the hash key or method.

       Anything beyond the above is currently out of scope.

METHODS
   new
         my $template = Template::Tiny->new(
             TRIM      => 1,
             start_tag => '<%',
             end_tag   => '%>',
         );

       The "new" constructor is provided for compatibility with Template Toolkit.

       The only parameters currently supported are:

       TRIM
           Removes leading and trailing whitespace from processed templates)

       start_tag
           Changes the starting tag identifier from "[%"

       end_tag
           Changes the ending tag identifier from "%]"

       Additional parameters can be provided without error, but will be ignored.

   process
         # DEPRECATED: Return template results (emits a warning)
         my $text = $template->process( \$input, $vars );

         # Print template results to STDOUT
         $template->process( \$input, $vars );

         # Generate template results into a variable
         my $output = '';
         $template->process( \$input, $vars, \$output );

       The "process" method is called to process a template.

       The first parameter is a reference to a text string containing the template text. A reference to a hash may be passed as the second parameter containing definitions of template variables.

       If a third parameter is provided, it must be a scalar reference to be populated with the output of the template.

       For a limited amount of time, the old deprecated interface will continue to be supported. If "process" is called without a third parameter, and in scalar or list contest, the template results will
       be returned to the caller.

       If  "process"  is  called  without  a  third parameter, and in void context, the template results will be print()ed to the currently selected file handle (probably "STDOUT") for compatibility with
       Template.
