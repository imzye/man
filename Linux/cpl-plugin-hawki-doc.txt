NAME
       hawki_detector_noise - HAWKI detector noise recipe

SYNOPSIS
       esorex hawki_detector_noise [OPTIONS] FILE.sof

DESCRIPTION
       hawki_detector_noise -- HAWKI recipe to find readnoise and gain.

       Compute  the readnoise and gain for the hawki detectors using two dark frames and two flat field frames. Both must have been exposed with NDIT=1 The program accepts the following files in the
       SOF:

           Tag                   Description

           DARK                  A list of raw dark images
           FLAT_TWILIGHT         A list of raw flat images
           MASTER_BPM            Optional master bad pixel mask or
           MASTER_CONF           Optional master confidence map If a master bad pixel mask or confidence map is included then thebad pixels will be flagged during the statistical analysis

OPTIONS
       --thresh <float>
              Rejection threshold in sigma above background (float; default: 5.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration  file  is  hawki.hawki_detector_noise.thresh  [default  =
              5.0].

       Note that it is possible to create a configuration file containing these options, along with suitable default values. Please refer to the details provided by the 'esorex --help' command.
