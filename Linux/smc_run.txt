NAME
       smc_run - start a TCP socket program with the capability to use SMC as networking protocol

SYNOPSIS
       smc_run [-dhrtv][-r SIZE] [-t SIZE] program parameters

DESCRIPTION
       smc_run starts a program specified as argument with its parameters, allowing to use the SMC protocol for program-used TCP socket connections.
       The  script  specifies  libsmc-preload.so  as  a  preload  shared library for the Linux program loader, and may adjust transmit and receive buffer sizes to SIZE by setting socket options SO_RCVBUF and
       SO_SNDBUF respectively.  SIZE can be specified in Bytes or using metric prefixes k and m, e.g.  8k...1024k/1m.
       The preload library libsmc-preload.so intercepts a few TCP socket calls and triggers the equivalent execution through SMC.
       Note: If it is not possibile to use smc_run, the libsmc-preload.so may be installed as apreload library via environment variable LD_PRELOAD. Use  environment  varibles  SMC_SNDBUF  and  SMC_RCVBUF  to
       request specific transmit and receive buffer sizes respectively. Supports metric prefixes k and m.

       The following options can be specified:

       -d     Display additional diagnostic messages during the program execution.

       -h     Display a brief usage information.

       -r SIZE
              Request receive buffer size SIZE.
              Notes:

              · May be overridden by the application.

              · Increases net.core.rmem_max if necessary.

       -t SIZE
              Request transmit buffer size SIZE.
              Notes:

              · May be overridden by the application.

              · Increases net.core.wmem_max if necessary.

       -v     Display version information.

RETURN CODES
       On success, the smc_run command returns 0.  If an error occurs smc_run writes a message to stdout and completes with a return code other than 0.

       1      An invalid option was specified.

EXAMPLES
       Run program foo using SMC, requesting a receive buffer size of 512KB

           $ smc_run -r 512k ./foo
