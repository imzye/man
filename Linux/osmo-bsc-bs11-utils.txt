NAME
       bs11_config - Configuration of BS-11 BTS via RS232

SYNOPSIS
       bs11_config [options] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       bs11_config is a small commandline program that can be used to configure the BS-11? BTS using its RS232 link.

       It can perform a subset of the functions that are typically performed using the Siemens LMT (Local Maintenance Terminal) software, such as

              -      querying some essential configuration values

              -      creating and deleting TRX1 objects

              -      download of SAFETY LOAD software

              -      download of BTS software

              -      creating an initial configuration (such as creating BBSIG,CCLK,PA,... objects)

              -      setting the Tx output power of the RF amplifier

       It is part of the OpenBSC base station controller software from Osmocom.
