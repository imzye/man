NAME
       omnicpp - OmniORB cpp preprocessor for IDL compiler

SYNOPSIS
       omnicpp [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the omnicpp command.

       omniidl  is  omniORBs IDL compiler and uses omnicpp as it's C preprocessor.  omnicpp is really just the GNU C preprocessor under a different name.  Normally you should not need to invoke this directly
       but should use omniidl instead.

OPTIONS
       As this is just the GNU C preprocessor cpp you can see that program for the full options.  Normally you should not be invoking this directly but should use omniidl instead.  The  options  listed  here
       should really be given to omniidl, but they are passed straight to omnicpp.

       -D name
              Define name for the preprocessor.

       -U name
              Undefine name for the preprocessor.

       -I dir Include dir in the preprocessor search path.  Note that the current directory is not on the include search path by default.  Use -I. for that.

SEE ALSO
       omniidl(1).
       The programs are documented fully by the HTML documentation in the omniorb4-doc package.
