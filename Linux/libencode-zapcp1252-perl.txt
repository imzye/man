Name
       Encode::ZapCP1252 - Zap Windows Western Gremlins

Synopsis
         use Encode::ZapCP1252;

         # Zap or fix in-place.
         zap_cp1252 $latin1_text;
         fix_cp1252 $utf8_text;

         # Zap or fix copy.
         my $clean_latin1 = zap_cp1252 $latin1_text;
         my $fixed_utf8   = fix_cp1252 $utf8_text;

Description
       Have you ever been processing a Web form submit for feed, assuming that the incoming text was encoded as specified in the Content-Type header, or in the XML declaration, only to end up with a
       bunch of junk because someone pasted in content from Microsoft Word? Well, this is because Microsoft uses a superset of the Latin-1 encoding called "Windows Western" or "CP1252". If the specified
       encoding is Latin-1, mostly things will come out right, but a few things--like curly quotes, m-dashes, ellipses, and the like--may not. The differences are well-known; you see a nice chart at
       documenting the differences on Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252>.

       Of course, that won't really help you. What will help you is to quit using Latin-1 and switch to UTF-8. Then you can just convert from CP1252 to UTF-8 without losing a thing, just like this:

         use Encode;
         $text = decode 'cp1252', $text, 1;

       But I know that there are those of you out there stuck with Latin-1 and who don't want any junk characters from Word users. That's where this module comes in. Its "zap_cp1252" function will zap
       those CP1252 gremlins for you, turning them into their appropriate ASCII approximations.

       Another case that can occasionally come up is when you're reading reading in text that claims to be UTF-8, but it still ends up with some CP1252 gremlins mixed in with properly encoded characters.
       I've seen examples of just this sort of thing when processing GMail messages and attempting to insert them into a UTF-8 database, as well as in some feeds processed by, say Yahoo! Pipes. Doesn't
       work so well. For such cases, there's "fix_cp1252", which converts those CP1252 gremlins into their UTF-8 equivalents.

Usage
       This module exports two subroutines: zap_cp1252() and fix_cp1252(), each of which accept a single argument:

         zap_cp1252 $text;
         fix_cp1252 $text;

       When called in a void context, as in these examples, zap_cp1252() and fix_cp1252() subroutine perform in place conversions of any CP1252 gremlins into their appropriate ASCII approximations or
       UTF-8 equivalents, respectively. Note that because the conversion happens in place, the data to be converted cannot be a string constant; it must be a scalar variable.

       When called in a scalar or list context, on the other hand, a copy will be modifed and returned. The original string will be unchanged:

         my $clean_latin1 = zap_cp1252 $latin1_text;
         my $fixed_utf8   = fix_cp1252 $utf8_text;

       In this case, even constant values can be processed. Either way, "undef"s will be ignored.

       In Perl 5.10 and higher, the functions may optionally be called with no arguments, in which case $_ will be converted, instead:

         zap_cp1252; # Modify $_ in-place.
         fix_cp1252; # Modify $_ in-place.
         my $zapped = zap_cp1252; # Copy $_ and return zapped
         my $fixed = zap_cp1252; # Copy $_ and return fixed

       In Perl 5.8.8 and higher, the conversion will work even when the string is decoded to Perl's internal form (usually via "decode 'ISO-8859-1', $text") or the string is encoded (and thus simply
       processed by Perl as a series of bytes). The conversion will even work on a string that has not been decoded but has had its "utf8" flag flipped anyway (usually by an injudicious use of
       Encode::_utf8_on(). This is to enable the highest possible likelihood of removing those CP1252 gremlins no matter what kind of processing has already been executed on the string.

       That said, although fix_cp1252() takes a conservative approach to replacing text in Unicode strings, it should be used as a very last option. Really, avoid that situation if you can.

Conversion Table
       Here's how the characters are converted to ASCII and UTF-8. The ASCII conversions are not perfect, but they should be good enough for general cleanup. If you want perfect, switch to UTF-8 and be
       done with it!

          Hex | Char  | ASCII | UTF-8 Name

         0x9f |   Ÿ   |   Y   | LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS

   Changing the Tables
       Don't like these conversions? You can modify them to your heart's content by accessing this module's internal conversion tables. For example, if you wanted zap_cp1252() to use an uppercase "E" for
       the euro sign, just do this:

         local $Encode::ZapCP1252::ascii_for{"\x80"} = 'E';

       Or if, for some reason, you wanted the UTF-8 equivalent for a bullet converted by fix_cp1252() to be a black square, you can assign the bytes (never a Unicode string) like so:

         local $Encode::ZapCP1252::utf8_for{"\x95"} = Encode::encode_utf8('■');

       Just remember, without "local" this would be a global change. In that case, be careful if your code zaps CP1252 elsewhere. Of course, it shouldn't really be doing that. These functions are just
       for cleaning up messes in one spot in your code, not for making a fundamental part of your text handling. For that, use Encode.
