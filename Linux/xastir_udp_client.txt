NAME
       xastir_udp_client - send simple messages to xastir for APRS(tm) network.

SYNOPSIS
       xastir_udp_client <hostname> <port> <callsign> <passcode> {-identify | [-to_rf] <message>}

DESCRIPTION
       xastir_udp_client sends packets into the UDP listening port of an enabled xastir instance.

EXAMPLES
        xastir_udp_client localhost 2023 <callsign> <passcode> "APRS Packet Goes Here"

       Currently  that will inject the packet into Xastir's decoding routines and send it to any TCP-connected clients. It will also igate it to the INET if you have igating enabled.  It will send the packet
       out the RF ports as third-party packets only if you add the "-to_rf" flag after the passcode like this:

        xastir_udp_client localhost 2023 <callsign> <passcode> -to_rf "APRS Packet"

       The UDP client is useful for generating and injecting APRS packets from external scripts.  It can also be used to fetch the callsign of the remote xastir server by using the -identify flag:

        xastir_udp_client localhost 2023 <callsign> <passcode> -identify

NOTES
       This is a very simple utility that provides no validation of message content.
