NAME
       vrms-rpm - report of installed non-free software

SYNOPSIS
       vrms-rpm [OPTION] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This program is a clone of the original vrms ("virtual Richard M. Stallman") program for Debian GNU/Linux, created with the purpose of bringing its brilliant idea over to RPM-based GNU/Linux distribu‐
       tions.

       This program analyses the list of currently installed RPM packages and reports found non-free packages to stdout. The decision on whether to classify a package as free or  non-free  is  based  on  the
       Fedora Project licensing guidelines.

       Fedora  /  CentOS  users  using additional repositories, such as RPM Fusion, may notice that not all packages coming from non-official repos are marked as non-free. This is because the distinction, as
       noted before, is made depending on the package licence. There are various reasons, apart from licensing, why a package may not have been accepted into the official Fedora / CentOS repository – such as
       software patents or export restrictions.

       Richard  Stallman  has  been,  for years, the most prominent and vocal figure in the Free Software movement, relentlessly reminding us on issues of software ethics. Like Richard, we believe that users
       should have an easy way to know whether they’re running non-free software on their systems.  This program is an attempt to fulfil that need.

OPTIONS
       --ascii
              Display rms ASCII-art when no non-free packages are found, or when non-free packages are 10% or more of the total.

       --colour <auto, no, yes>
              Controls whether terminal escape sequences should be used for colourizing the output.  Default is 'auto', which uses colour output when writing to a terminal, but not when writing to a file  or
              a pipe.

       --describe
              When listing packages, include the package summaries (short descriptions).

       --explain
              When listing packages, display licences as to justify the free / non-free classification.

       --help Display a short help on program usage and exit.

       --image
              Like --ascii, but displays an image using terminal escape seqences and Unicode half-height blocks.

       --licence-list <FILE>
              Specifies the list of good licences to use for classifying packages.  FILE can be a path to a file on disk, or one of the bundled licence lists:
              · fedora
              · spdx-fsf-and-osi
              · spdx-fsf-or-osi
              · spdx-only-fsf
              · spdx-only-osi
              · suse
              · tweaked
              The default value is "tweaked".

       --list <none, free, nonfree, all>
              Apart from displaying the total number of free and non-free packages, also list packages by name.  The default value for this option is "nonfree".

       --version
              Display version information and exit.
