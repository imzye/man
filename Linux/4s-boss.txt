NAME
     4s-boss — An administration and store discovery daemon for 4store

SYNOPSIS
     4s-boss [-D | --no-daemonize] [-p port | --port port]
     4s-boss [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
     4s-boss can be run on 4store storage nodes to provide a store discovery mechanism for a 4store cluster (as an alternative to Avahi/DNS-SD).

     It also provides a backend to enable store admin operations to be performed through the the 4s-admin(1) utility.

     It should be started on all storage nodes of a cluster, and will run as a daemon listening on port 6733 by default.

     Error and informational output is sent to /var/log/syslog when run as a daemon, and to stderr when run in the foreground.

   Command line options
     -D, --no-daemonize
             Do not daemonize, send output to stdout/stderr instead of syslog.

     -p port, --port port
             Port number to listen on.

   Configuration file options
     port = <port_number>
             Port number to listen on.

     Options for 4s-boss in /etc/4store.conf should all be within the [4s-boss] section, or will be ignored.

     Other options in the [4s-boss] section of the configuration file are used to set the nodes of a cluster, and to set how 4s-boss is used for store discovery.  See 4store.conf(5) for details.

FILES
     /etc/4store.conf

EXIT STATUS
     The 4s-boss utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Start 4s-boss in the foreground on port 9000

           $ 4s-boss --no-daemonize --port 9000

     Start 4s-boss as a daemon on the default port (6733)

           $ 4s-boss

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     4s-boss should never be run as root.  It should be started as any user that has read access to /var/lib/4store, and ideally the same user that would run any 4s-backend processes.

     The port 4s-boss runs on should only be accessible from trusted hosts, and appropriate firewall restrictions put in place.  This is to prevent untrusted users/hosts from sending store dele‐
     tion/stop/start requests .
