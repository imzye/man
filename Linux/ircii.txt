NAME
       ircflush -  a little program that tricks another program in to line buffering its output

SYNOPSIS
       ircflush [program] [argumentstoprogram

DESCRIPTION
       What's  the  deal  here?   Well,  it's like this.  First we find an open tty/pty pair.  Then we fork three processes.  The first reads from stdin and sends the info to the master device.  The next
       process reads from the master device and sends stuff to stdout.  The last processes is the rest of the command line arguments exec'd.  By doing all this, the exec'd process is fooled into flushing
       each line of output as it occurs.
