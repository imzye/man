DESCRIPTION
       The Ironseed is a 2D inter-galactic adventure game.  Gameplay is real-time, featuring trading, diplomacy, and strategy, and somewhat resembles Star Control 2 / Ur-Quan masters.

STORY
       It  is the thirty-eighth century. The fall of Earth is but a legend and humanity has migrated to a terraformed Mars. The Pentateuch, a group of five priests, rules the newly risen technocracy with
       an iron fist.  In a bold attempt to eliminate the last of their political opponents, the five began the purgation trials. With guerilla tactics their followers  went  about  convicting  those  who
       would oppose them.

       To counter them an underground movement was initiated and an elaborate plan was conceived. A virus was spread throughout the circuit matrix. A thousand days from inception, the virus was scheduled
       to delete all personality files. The Ironseed movement as it was called, hoped that by stealing a ship they could escape, leaving behind Mars - and the Pentateuch. Their intent was to return after
       the fall of the technocracy, but a computer malfunction turned a thousand days into a thousand years.
