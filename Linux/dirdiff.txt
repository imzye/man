DESCRIPTION
       Dirdiff is a graphical tool for displaying the differences between directory trees (up to 5) and for merging changes from one tree into another.

       At  startup,  dirdiff displays a main window with a list of the files that are different between the trees.  Colored squares are used to indicate the relative ages of the versions.  Files are like
       leaves on a deciduous tree: the newest ones are green, and then they turn yellow, orange, and red as they get older.  Missing files are black, and directories are white.

       To see the differences between two versions of a file, double-click on the file name.  By default, the first and last versions are compared, but this can be changed using the Diff menu in the main
       window.  In the differences window, there are checkboxes to the left of all the sections which are different.  You can use button 1 to select an individual checkbox, or shift-button 1 or button  3
       to select a whole group.  Selecting a line means that you are asking for that change to be made when you update either of the files using the Merge menu.  The line will be removed if it is already
       present or added if it is not present.

       To copy from one tree to another, click on the file name and select the appropriate copy operation from the Copy menu of the main window.

       Selecting  Make  patch  from the File menu of the main window produces a file describing the changes between the files that can be applied by the patch tool.  You can edit the patch before saving,
       and may wish to add explanatory text, instructions, or patch Prereq lines at the beginning.  To save the patch, enter a filename in the patch window relative to the current directory,  and  choose
       Save.  This will also close the window.

       If  you  are  sending  out patches, then the from directory should be the original version of the source.  Try to make sure that the two files have the same number of leading directories.  See the
       patch(1) man page for more information.

NOTES
       Dirdiff needs to be able to load the libfilecmp.so.0.0 shared library for the -r or -t flags to work.
