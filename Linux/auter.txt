NAME
       auter - Automatic Update Transaction Execution by Rackspace

SYNOPSIS
       auter   [--enable|--disable|--status]   [--prep]  [--apply]  [--reboot]
       [--postreboot] [--config=<configfile>] [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Automatic Update Transaction Execution by Rackspace. A  wrapper  around
       cron  and yum/dnf/apt to manage system updates with the ability to con‐
       figure automatic reboots and custom scripts.

   Actions:
       --enable
              Enable auter

       --disable
              Disable auter. Also deletes unused pidfile if it exists

       --status
              Show whether enabled or disabled

       --prep Pre-download updates before applying

       --apply
              Apply updates, and reboot if AUTOREBOOT=yes

       --reboot
              Reboot system including pre/post reboot scripts

       --postreboot
              Run post reboot script

OPTIONS
       --config=FILE Specify the full path to an auter config  file.  Defaults
              to /etc/auter/auter.conf

       --stdout
              Always log to STDOUT, regardless of not having a tty

       --maxdelay
              Override MAXDELAY from the command line

       --skip-all-scripts

              Skip   the   executions   of  all  custom  scripts  (Default  in
              /etc/auter/*.d/)

       --skip-scripts-by-phase=PHASE

              Skip the execution of  the  custom  scripts  for  the  specified
              phase. You can specify myltiple phases.

              Valid   Phases:   pre-prep,  post-prep,  pre-apply,  post-apply,
              pre-reboot, post-reboot.

              Example:    --skip-scripts-by-phase="pre-prep,post-apply,pre-re‐
              boot"

       --skip-scripts-by-name=SCRIPTNAME

              Skip specific scripts by name. You can specify myltiple phases.

              Example:   --skip-scripts-by-name="10-configsnap-pre,   20-star‐
              tApp.sh"

       --no-wall
              If possible, suppress shutdown wall messages in the reboot phase

       -h, --help
              Show this help text

       -v, --version Show the version

DIRECTORIES
       Default Directory locations are listed below; custom paths can be spec‐
       ified  in  the  config file. The use of additional, non-default, config
       files is required when running more than one auter profile.

   Pre/Post Hooks
       If any scripts in the pre/post hook  directories  are  not  executable,
       they  will  be  skipped  by auter and a warning containing the filename
       will be logged. If any scripts in the pre/post  hook  directories  exit
       with a non-zero exit code an error will be logged with the filename and
       exit code, and auter will abort.

       /etc/auter/pre-prep.d
              Directory containing scripts to be executed  before  downloading
              updates

       /etc/auter/post-prep.d
              Directory  containing  scripts  to be executed after downloading
              updates

       /etc/auter/pre-apply.d
              Directory containing scripts to be executed before applying  up‐
              dates

       /etc/auter/post-apply.d
              Directory  containing  scripts to be executed after applying up‐
              dates

       /etc/auter/pre-reboot.d
              Directory containing scripts to be executed before rebooting

       /etc/auter/post-reboot.d
              Directory containing scripts to be executed after rebooting

              There is a hard coded delay of 5 minutes  post-reboot  to  allow
              the  system to become fully ready before the post-reboot scripts
              are executed.

   Hook Execution Order
       Files in the pre/post script directories are parsed in  sorted  lexical
       order.  That  is, /etc/auter/pre-apply.d/01_first will be parsed before
       /etc/auter/pre-apply.d/10_second. Be aware that because the sorting  is
       lexical,  not  numeric, /etc/auter/pre-apply.d/1_whoops would be loaded
       after /etc/pre-apply.d/10_second. Using a consistent number of  leading
       zeroes  in the file names can be used to avoid such problems. For exam‐
       ple the following execution order would occur for pre-apply scripts:

              pre-apply.d/00-first.sh
              pre-apply.d/99-second.sh
              pre-apply.d/AA-fourth.sh
              pre-apply.d/aa-third.sh
              pre-apply.d/zz-fifth.sh
              pre-apply.d/ZZ-sixth.sh

       Note that the ordering is case-insensitive so AA-fourth.sh will be run before aa-third.sh.

ENABLE/DISABLE
       To provide an easy way to switch on/off all auter jobs, use auter --en‐
       able  or  auter  --disable  to set the lockfile /var/lib/auter/enabled.
       Auter will check for the presence of this file before running.

       This is also the correct method for cleaning up an unused pidfile.

REBOOTING
       Rebooting is an essential part of applying updates, in order to  ensure
       the  updated  packages  are in use. An update to the kernel will always
       need a reboot. Some  application  updates,  for  example  Apache,  will
       restart  the  service.  However  often  libraries  are updated, such as
       openssl, which don't force a reboot of services that use them.  Reboot‐
       ing guarantees that every update is in use by running services. You can
       either enable AUTOREBOOT=yes in the config file (the default is AUTORE‐
       BOOT=no),  to  reboot  after  --apply,  or  you can schedule a separate
       schedule for --reboot via a second cronjob. A 2 minute warning is emit‐
       ted before the server is rebooted, and this can be cancelled by a supe‐
       ruser with shutdown -c.

EXIT CODES
        0 = updates successful / no updates available
        3 = issue related to yum / dnf / apt-get command
        4 = auter disabled via lockfile
        5 = script not run as root / DATADIR does not exist / config file does
       not exist
        6 = auter is already running / PIDFILE exists
        7 = yum, dnf or apt-get was not found
        8 = a pre/post hook exited with a non-zero error code
