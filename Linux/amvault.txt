WARNING
       This application is not yet in its final form, and is subject to major
       revision in subsequent versions of Amanda. Backward compatibility is
       not guaranteed.

       Note that Amanda restore/recover operations will request tertiary media
       by label when dumpfiles are not found on secondary media, but there is
       no provision to automatically fetch such media from a different changer

       Feedback on and patches to this application are invited and encouraged!

DESCRIPTION
       Amvault is conceptually equivalent to "amfetchdump | taper". That is,
       it reads specified dumps from secondary media and re-writes them on
       tertiary media.

       Amvault Copies dumps selected by the specified filters onto volumes on
       the storage dest-storage.

   Secondary Media
       The dumps to be read from secondary media can be specified by any
       combination of dump specifications, --fulls-only, --latest-fulls,
       --incrs-only, and --src-timestamp. At least one must be specified, lest
       amvault attempt to vault all dumps in the catalog. See amanda-match(7)
       for more information on dump specifications.

       Note that the datestamp given in the dumpspec is the dump datestamp -
       the run in which the backup was taken on the Amanda client. The
       --src-timestamp, on the other hand, is the write timestamp - the run in
       which the dump was written to secondary media. The latter option
       facilitates duplicating the results of an entire backup run, including
       any dumps that might have been flushed from holding disk.

   Tertiary Media
       The amvault-storage is the default destination storage.

       If amanda.conf(5) contains the new part-size splitting parameters, then
       amvault will use them without any additional configuration. However, if
       the configuration still uses the old splitting parameters
       (tape_splitsize, split_diskbuffer, and fallback_splitsize), then
       amvault will need some additional configuration in order to properly
       split dumps to tertiary media. To do so, specify a new tapetype in
       amanda.conf(5), say "TERTIARY", and set the part-size and other
       appropriate parameters there. Then reference that tapetype in the
       amvault invocation:

           amvault -otapetype=TERTIARY ...

OPTIONS
       --dest-storage dest-storage
           The vaulted dumps are written to the specified storage.

           If the vault-storage option is specified in amanda.conf(5), amvault
           will use that storage as the default destination. If not, a
           destination storage must be specified on the amvault command line.

       --dry-run, -n
           Cause amvault to print the dumps it would vault, but not actually
           perform any vaulting operations.

       --exact-match
           The host and disk names in the dumpspecs are parsed as exact
           values.

       --export
           Cause amvault to attempt to move completed tertiary volumes to
           import/export slots, where they can be more easily removed by an
           operator.

       --fulls-only
           Only full (level-0) dumps are copied.

       --incrs-only
           Only incremental (level > 0) dumps are copied.

       --latest-fulls
           The latest full of every DLE in the disklist that do not have the
           skipstrategy.

       --no-interactivity
           Disable interactivity if a source or destination volume is not
           found.

       --quiet, -q
           Suppress the progress messages normally printed to the terminal as
           dumps are being copied.

       --src-labelstr labelstr
           Only dumps from volumes matching labelstr are copied.

           labelstr is a Perl regular expression, and will be matched as a
           substring of the volume labels -- it may be necessary to anchor the
           labelstr with "^" and/or "$" in order to prevent undesired partial
           matches.

           Also note that if a dump is split across multiple volumes and
           labelstr matches only one of those volumes, amvault will not select
           that dump for copying. For this reason, it is generally safer to to
           select dumps directly using other filters, in which case amvault
           will be able to retrieve parts of split dumps from whatever volume
           they were originally written to.

       --src-storage src-storage
           Only dumps found on the specified storage are copied. (If this
           option is not given, all available source storages will be
           searched.)

       --src-timestamps src-timestamps
           Specifies the timestamps in the format 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' of the run
           to vault, can be "latest", then the most recent amdump or amflush
           run will be used.

       -o configoption
           See the "CONFIGURATION OVERRIDE" section in amanda(8).

EXAMPLES
       Vault all dump written to tape in the latest amdump or amflush run:
       $ amvault --src-timestamps latest CONF

       Vault all dump written on the run of December 7 2011 12:13:14 :
       $ amvault --src-timestamps 20111207121314 CONF

       Vault all dump dumped on any run of December 7 2011:
       $ amvault CONF \* \* 20111207
