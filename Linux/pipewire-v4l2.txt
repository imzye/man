NAME
       pw-v4l2 - Use PipeWire instead of V4L2

SYNOPSIS
       pw-v4l2 [options] COMMAND [ARGUMENTS...]

DESCRIPTION
       pw-v4l2 runs a command using a compatibility layer that maps PipeWire video devices to be visible to applications using V4L2.

       This is implemented by preloading a shared library via LD_PRELOAD, which translates library calls that try to access V4L2 devices.

OPTIONS
       -h
           Show help.

       -r NAME
           The name of the remote instance to connect to. If left unspecified, a connection is made to the default PipeWire instance.

       -v
           Verbose operation.

EXAMPLES
       pw-v4l2 v4l2-ctl --list-devices
