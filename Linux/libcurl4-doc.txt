NAME
       CURLOPT_TCP_FASTOPEN - TCP Fast Open

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TCP_FASTOPEN, long enable);

DESCRIPTION
       Pass a long as parameter set to 1L to enable or 0 to disable.

       TCP  Fast  Open  (RFC 7413) is a mechanism that allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, saving up to one
       full round-trip time (RTT).

       Beware: the TLS session cache does not work when TCP Fast Open is enabled. TCP Fast Open is also known to be problematic on or across certain networks.

DEFAULT
       0

PROTOCOLS
       This functionality affects tcp only

EXAMPLE
       int main(void)
       {
         CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
         if(curl) {
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_FASTOPEN, 1L);
           curl_easy_perform(curl);
         }
       }

NOTES
       This option is only supported on Linux and macOS 10.11 or later.

AVAILABILITY
       Added in curl 7.49.0

       curl_easy_setopt(3) returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

       CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see libcurl-errors(3).
