CRUFT(8)                                                               System Manager's Manual                                                              CRUFT(8)

NAME
       cruft - Check the filesystem for cruft (missing and unexplained files)

SYNOPSIS
       cruft [-h] [-d DRIVES] [--chroots CHROOTS] [--ignore IGNORES] [-r REPORTFILE] [-m ADDRESS] [-k | -n | -N]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cruft command.  Please see /usr/share/doc/cruft-common/README.gz for more information.

       cruft  is a program that goes over the Debian packaging system's database, and compares the contents of that with the files actually on your system, and pro‐
       duces a summary of the differences.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized:

       -h     Show a summary of options and exit.

       -d DRIVES
              Search only the listed filesystems.  DRIVES should be an absolute path, or a quoted, space-separated list of multiple  absolute  paths  (eg,  "/  /usr
              /home"). Multiple -d options are allowed as well. If not specified, cruft attempts to autodetect which filesystems to scan.

       --chroots CHROOTS
              Do not perform validity checks on symlinks under these directories. Useful for whatever chroots are set up in the system.

       --ignore IGNORES
              Treat  the directory trees in IGNORES as if they did not exist.  IGNORES should be an absolute path, or a quoted, space-separated list of multiple ab‐
              solute paths. Multiple --ignore options are allowed as well.

       -r REPORTFILE
              Output report to REPORTFILE instead of standard output.

       -m ADDRESS
              Mail report to ADDRESS.

       -k     Only cleanup cruft's spool directory.

       -n     Generate input files for reporting, but do not generate a report.

       -N     Only generate a report, based on old input files.

       With none of -k -n or -N cruft performs all the above three actions, that is cleans its own spool directory, generates new input files and produces a report.
       Please note that cruft never deletes any files outside its own spool directory.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       It  is possible to get some debugging information from cruft by setting the variable CRUFT_DEBUG to 1. If you need more detailed information on what cruft is
       doing, set it to 2.
