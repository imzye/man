         -F       insert a one-shot fragmentation header
         -b       instead of an ICMP6 Ping, use TooBig (you will not see the target)
         -B       instead of an ICMP6 Ping, use PingReply (you will not see the target)
         -d       resolves the IPv6 addresses to DNS.
         -t       enables tunnel detection
         -u       use UDP instead of TCP if a port is supplied
