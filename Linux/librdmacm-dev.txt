NAME
       rdma_cm - RDMA communication manager.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>

DESCRIPTION
       Used to establish communication over RDMA transports.

NOTES
       The RDMA CM is a communication manager used to setup reliable, connected and unreliable datagram data transfers.  It provides an RDMA transport neutral interface for establishing connections.  The
       API concepts are based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based semantics: communication must be over a specific RDMA device, and data transfers are message based.

       The  RDMA  CM  can control both the QP and communication management (connection setup / teardown) portions of an RDMA API, or only the communication management piece.  It works in conjunction with
       the verbs API defined by the libibverbs library.  The libibverbs library provides the underlying interfaces needed to send and receive data.

       The RDMA CM can operate asynchronously or synchronously.  The mode of operation is controlled by the user through the use of the rdma_cm event channel parameter in specific  calls.   If  an  event
       channel  is provided, an rdma_cm identifier will report its event data (results of connecting, for example), on that channel.  If a channel is not provided, then all rdma_cm operations for the se‐
       lected rdma_cm identifier will block until they complete.

       The RDMA CM gives an option to different libibverbs providers to advertise and use various specific to that provider QP configuration options. This functionality is called ECE (enhanced connection
       establishment).

RDMA VERBS
       The rdma_cm supports the full range of verbs available through the libibverbs library and interfaces.  However, it also provides wrapper functions for some of the more commonly used  verbs  funca‐
       tionality.  The full set of abstracted verb calls are:

       rdma_reg_msgs  - register an array of buffers for sending and receiving

       rdma_reg_read  - registers a buffer for RDMA read operations

       rdma_reg_write - registers a buffer for RDMA write operations

       rdma_dereg_mr  - deregisters a memory region

       rdma_post_recv  - post a buffer to receive a message

       rdma_post_send  - post a buffer to send a message

       rdma_post_read  - post an RDMA to read data into a buffer

       rdma_post_write - post an RDMA to send data from a buffer

       rdma_post_recvv  - post a vector of buffers to receive a message

       rdma_post_sendv  - post a vector of buffers to send a message

       rdma_post_readv  - post a vector of buffers to receive an RDMA read

       rdma_post_writev - post a vector of buffers to send an RDMA write

       rdma_post_ud_send - post a buffer to send a message on a UD QP

       rdma_get_send_comp - get completion status for a send or RDMA operation

       rdma_get_recv_comp - get information about a completed receive

CLIENT OPERATION
       This  section  provides a general overview of the basic operation for the active, or client, side of communication.  This flow assume asynchronous operation with low level call details shown.  For
       synchronous operation, calls to rdma_create_event_channel, rdma_get_cm_event, rdma_ack_cm_event, and rdma_destroy_event_channel would be eliminated.  Abstracted calls, such as  rdma_create_ep  en‐
       capsulate several of these calls under a single API.  Users may also refer to the example applications for code samples.  A general connection flow would be:

       rdma_getaddrinfo
              retrieve address information of the destination

       rdma_create_event_channel
              create channel to receive events

       rdma_create_id
              allocate an rdma_cm_id, this is conceptually similar to a socket

       rdma_resolve_addr
              obtain a local RDMA device to reach the remote address

       rdma_get_cm_event
              wait for RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_RESOLVED event

       rdma_ack_cm_event
              ack event

       rdma_create_qp
              allocate a QP for the communication

       rdma_resolve_route
              determine the route to the remote address

       rdma_get_cm_event
              wait for RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED event

       rdma_ack_cm_event
              ack event

       rdma_connect
              connect to the remote server

       rdma_get_cm_event
              wait for RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED event

       rdma_ack_cm_event
              ack event

       Perform data transfers over connection

       rdma_disconnect
              tear-down connection

       rdma_get_cm_event
              wait for RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED event

       rdma_ack_cm_event
              ack event

       rdma_destroy_qp
              destroy the QP

       rdma_destroy_id
              release the rdma_cm_id

       rdma_destroy_event_channel
              release the event channel

       rdma_freeaddrinfo
              release the list of rdma_addrinfo structures

       rdma_set_local_ece
              set desired ECE options

       An almost identical process is used to setup unreliable datagram (UD) communication between nodes.  No actual connection is formed between QPs however, so disconnection is not needed.

       Although this example shows the client initiating the disconnect, either side of a connection may initiate the disconnect.

       This section provides a general overview of the basic operation for the passive, or server, side of communication.  A general connection flow would be:

       rdma_create_event_channel

       rdma_disconnect
              tear-down connection

       rdma_destroy_qp
              destroy the QP

              release the connected rdma_cm_id

       rdma_destroy_id
              release the listening rdma_cm_id

       rdma_destroy_event_channel
              release the event channel

       rdma_get_remote_ece
              get ECe options sent by the client

       rdma_set_local_ece
              set desired ECE options

RETURN CODES
       =  0   success

       = -1   error - see errno for more details

       Most  librdmacm functions return 0 to indicate success, and a -1 return value to indicate failure.  If a function operates asynchronously, a return value of 0 means that the operation was success‐
       fully started.  The operation could still complete in error; users should check the status of the related event.  If the return value is -1, then errno will contain additional information  regard‐
       ing the reason for the failure.

       Prior  versions of the library would return -errno and not set errno for some cases related to ENOMEM, ENODEV, ENODATA, EINVAL, and EADDRNOTAVAIL codes. Applications that want to check these codes
       and have compatibility with prior library versions must manually set errno to the negative of the return code if it is < -1.
