NAME
       filler - simple game where two players try to capture half the board

SYNOPSIS
       filler

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the filler game by John Farrell.
       Filler  is  a  simple  game where two players try to capture half of the board.  One player starts at the hex marked L and the other starts at the hex marked R.  Each player takes turns choosing a
       colour. When a player chooses a colour, all board hexes owned by that player change to that colour.  The colour change captures all adjacent hexes which match the player's new  colour.   The  game
       keeps score of how many hexes each player has captured.
       The winner is the first player to control more than half the hexes. As there are 1377 hexes, you need a score of 689 to win.
