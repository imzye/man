NAME
       dasdseq - Hercules DSORG=PS retrieval command

SYNOPSIS
       dasdseq [options...] image [sf=shadow] filespec
       dasdseq [-debug] [-expert] [-ascii] image [sf=shadow] [attr] filespec [debugopts] [ascii]

DESCRIPTION
       Hercules  command  to retrieve a DSORG=PS (sequential) dataset from CKD/CCKD DASD.  The dataset is presumed to be encoded in EBCDIC.  The second form of the command is for 'expert mode' users, and al‐
       lows more advanced access to data on the DASD image.

OPTIONS
       The following options are used to specify dasdseq behavior.  Surround each option by blank(s).  Options are divided into three categories: required, optional, and expert mode operands.

Required operands
   image
       specifies the Hercules CKD/CCKD DASD filename (sometimes referred to as the DASD image file)

   filespec
       dataset name of the file to retrieve.  Case insensitive, converted to upper case for searching VTOC on image DASD volume.

Optional operands
   sf=shadow
       For CCKD images which also use shadow files, specifies the [path/]filename of the shadow file.  Note the sf=, which must be present for this option.

   -ascii
       convert the output file to ASCII (from EBCDIC).  Additionally, trailing blanks are trimmed.  The 'ascii' option (no leading dash) is deprecated, and may be removed in a future release.

Expert mode operands
       All expert mode operands are considered to be experimental.

        dasdseq [-debug] [-expert] [-ascii] image [sf=shadow] [attr] filespec [debugopts]

   -debug
       Additional debug options are displayed.  Specifying -debug will (eventually) display dataset extent information.

   attr
       dataset attributes (only useful with -abs)

       [-recfm fb] [-lrecl aa]

       -recfm designates RECFM, reserved for future support

       fb - fixed, blocked (only RECFM currently supported)

       -lrecl designates dataset LRECL

       aa - decimal logical record length (default 80)

       Blocksize need not be specified; dasdseq handles whatever block size comes off the volume.

   filespec
       composed of the following sub-operands, in the following order: heads, abs, filename.

   -heads xx
       defines # tracks per cylinder on device; xx = decimal number of heads per cylinder on device

   -abs cc hh tt [...] [-abs cc hh tt]
       -abs indicates the beginning of each extent's location in terms of absolute dasd image location.

       cc - decimal cylinder number (relative zero)

       hh - decimal head number (relative zero)

       tt - decimal number of tracks in extent

       When -abs is specified, each -abs group specifies one dataset extent.  For multi-extent datasets, -abs groups may be repeated as needed, in the order in which the dataset's extents occur.   A  maximum
       of  123  extents are supported.  With -abs, no VTOC structure is implied; a F1 DSCB will not be sought.  Dasdseq will frequently report 'track not found in extent table' (along with a message from fb‐
       copy about rc -1 from convert_tt) due to potentially missing EOF markers in the extent, and the fact that the F1 DSCB DS1LSTAR field is not valid.  Check your output file  before  you  panic.   Fbcopy
       -abs ignores EOF, in case you are attempting to recovery PDS member(s) from a damaged dasd volume, preferring to wait until all tracks in the extent have been processed.  Tracks containing PDS members
       may have more than one EOF per track.  Expect a lot of associated manual effort with -abs.

       When -abs is -not- specified, filename specifies the MVS DSORG=PS dataset on the volume.  The dasd image volume containing the dataset must have a valid VTOC structure, and a F1  DSCB  describing  the
       dataset.

   filename
       will be the filename of the output file in the current directory; output filename in the same case as the command line filename.

   debugopts
       Produces debugging output, refer to the source code.

       verbose [x [y [z]]]

       verbose   debug output level (default = 0 when not specified).  Higher numbers produce more output.

       x  main program (default = 1 when verbose specified)

       y  copyfile + showf1

       z  dasdutil
