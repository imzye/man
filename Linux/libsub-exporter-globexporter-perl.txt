Sub::Exporter::GlobExporter(3pm)                                                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                    Sub::Exporter::GlobExporter(3pm)

NAME
       Sub::Exporter::GlobExporter - export shared globs with Sub::Exporter collectors

VERSION
       version 0.006

SYNOPSIS
       First, you write something that exports globs:

         package Shared::Symbol;

         use Sub::Exporter;
         use Sub::Exporter::GlobExport qw(glob_exporter);

         use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
           ...
           collectors => { '$Symbol' => glob_exporter(Symbol => \'_shared_globref') },
         };

         sub _shared_globref { return \*Common }

       Now other code can import $Symbol and get their *Symbol made an alias to *Shared::Symbol::Common.

       If you don't know what this means or why you'd want to do it, you may want to stop reading now.

       The other class can do something like this:

         use Shared::Symbol '$Symbol';

         print $Symbol; # prints the scalar entry of *Shared::Symbol::Common

       ...or...

         use Shared::Symbol '$Symbol' => { -as => 'SharedSymbol' };

         print $SharedSymbol; # prints the scalar entry of *Shared::Symbol::Common

       ...or...

         my $glob;
         use Shared::Symbol '$Symbol' => { -as => \$glob };

         print $$glob; # prints the scalar entry of *Shared::Symbol::Common

OVERVIEW
       Sub::Exporter::GlobExporter provides only one routine, "glob_exporter", which may be called either by its full name or may be imported on request.

         my $exporter = glob_exporter( $default_name, $globref_locator );

       The routine returns a collection validator that will export a glob into the importing package.  It will export it under the name $default_name, unless an alternate name is given (as shown above).
       The glob that is installed is specified by the $globref_locator, which can be either the globref itself, or a reference to a string which will be called on the exporter

       For an example, see the "SYNOPSIS", in which a method is defined to produce the globref to share.  This allows the glob-exporting package to be subclassed, so the subclass may choose to either re-
       use the same glob when exporting or to export a new one.

       If there are entries in the arguments to the globref-exporting collector other than those beginning with a dash, a hashref of them will be passed to the globref locator.  In other words, if we
       were to write this:

         use Shared::Symbol '$Symbol' => { arg => 1, -as => 2 };

       It would result in a call like the following:

         my $globref = Shared::Symbol->_shared_globref({ arg => 1 });

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
