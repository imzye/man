NAME
       wmfire - Fiery dock app monitor

SYNOPSIS
       wmfire [-c CPU] [-f COLOUR] [-F FILE] [-g GEOMETRY] [-h] [-H MAX] [-i INTERFACE] [-l] [-L MIN] [-m] [-n] [-p] [-s SPEED] [-x] [-y]

DESCRIPTION
       wmfire is flaming dock app which can monitor your cpu, memory, network or a file.

       o Left click to change the status monitor (unless locked)
       o Middle click to hide/show nice'd process on cpu load
       o Right click to change flame colour (unless locked)
       o Mouse wheel up or down is the same as left click

       On mouse over the cursor will disappear and be replaced by a burning spot at that location. After two seconds symbols will be burnt to represent what is being monitored. For cpu, a short solid bar
       represents  average load or a line of dots representing the current cpu number on SMP systems. For the memory, a grid of dots is used to signify a memory array. For the network, a line of marching
       dots is like data passing through a cable. For file values, a spinning disk platter is shown.

       (Not all window managers support all mouse over effects.)

OPTIONS
       -c [0..3]
              Monitor SMP CPU number X

       -f [1..4]
              Change flame colour
              (1:Natural 2:Coronal 3:Blue 4:Green)

       -F [...]
              Monitor file

       -g [{+-}X{+-}Y]
              Set initial window position

       -h     Show help

       -H [...]
              Set maximum (high) value for file monitoring

       -i [...]
              Change the network interface
              (Default is "ppp0")

       -l     Lock flame colour and monitor

       -L [...]
              Set minimum (low) value for file monitoring

       -m     Monitor the memory load

       -n     Monitor the network traffic

       -p     Fire effect only (no monitoring)

       -r     [...]  Change resource name (default:wmfire)

       -s [...][K|M]
              Change the network speed - kilobytes or megabytes
              (Automatic preset values for interfaces: ppp=56K eth=100M)

       -x     Exclude nice'd CPU load

       -y     Set window sticky for window managers which do not support dock apps

EXAMPLES
       wmfire -F /tmp/file -L 40 -H 60 -i eth2 -s 1000M

NOTES
       The file monitoring will only read the first value in a file. For complex parsing use an external program to read the required value and write it to the same file wmfire is set to read.
