NAME
       dskid - identify floppy or disc image file for emulated machines

SYNOPSIS
       dskid [-format FORMAT] [-type TYPE] [-side SIDE] [-comp COMP] [-retry COUNT] DISKIMAGE [DSKIMAGE...]
DESCRIPTION
       Dskid is a utility which will identify how a disc (or image) is formatted. It reports the required driver and various information about the disc geometry.

OPTIONS
       -type TYPE
              Determines which driver is to be used.

              auto    Select according to the disc image file. This is the default.

              dsk     Use the DSK (CPCEmu format) image driver.

              edsk    Use the extended version of the DSK format.

              floppy  Use the floppy driver.

              myz80   Use the hard disk (MYZ80 format) image driver.  (This format cannot be autodetected.)

              cfi     Use the CFI (DOS fdcopy format) image driver.  (This format cannot be autodetected.)

              raw     Use the raw driver.

       -retry COUNT
              Set the number of times to attempt to read the disc in case of error.

       -comp COMP
              Select the compression method used on the source disc image file (has no effect when reading a floppy disc).

              auto    Detect from the first few bytes of the file. This is the default.

              sq      Huffman coded (SQ / USQ).

              gz      Gzipped (gzip / gunzip).

              bz2     Burrows-Wheeler compressed (bzip2 / bunzip2).

       -side SIDE
              Determines which side (0 or 1) of the disc (image) is to be identified.
