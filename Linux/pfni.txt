NAME
       pfni - Print Full Name Image of an Ada entity

SYNOPSIS
       pfni [-sofd] [-p project-file] unit[:line-number[:column-number]] [-- ASIS options]

       pfni -h

DESCRIPTION
       pfni is a companion program to adactl(1).  It prints the full expanded name of entities declared or referenced by a specified Ada compilation unit.  This makes it easier to designate the entities when
       writing new rules for AdaControl.

       Commercial support is available for AdaControl, see file /usr/share/doc/adacontrol/support.txt. If you plan to use AdaControl for industrial projects, or if you want it to be customized or extended to
       match your own needs, please contact Adalog at info@adalog.fr.

OPTIONS
       -d     Enable debug mode.

       -f     Full output: display all entities declared and referenced by unit.  The default is to only display entities declared in unit.

       -h     Prints a general help message.

       -o     Also  print  overloading information.  If you are calling a subprogram that has several overloadings and you are not sure which one is called, use pfni with the -o option on that line: the pro‐
              gram will tell you the full name and profile of the called subprogram.

       -p project-file
              Use the specified Emacs ada-mode (*.adp) project file.

       -s     Process the specification of unit; the default is to process the body.

       line-number
              Only display entities declared on that line.

       line-number:column-number
              Only display the entity at that line and column, if any.
