NAME
       denemo_file_update - file update tool for denemo.

SYNOPSIS
       denemo_file_update

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the denemo_file_update command.

       GNU  denemo  is  a  GUI musical score editor written in C/gtk+.  It is intended primarily as a frontend to GNU Lilypond, but is adaptable to other computer-music-related purposes as well.  You can
       compose, transcribe, arrange, listen to the music and much more.

       This command is a wrapper intended to provide an easy way to update the denemo files created with previous versions of denemo. It looks for all the files with .denemo extension in the current  di‐
       rectory using the find command, and then executes denemo on each of them to update the file.

       The full documentation for denemo is kept in html format and can be found at /usr/share/doc/denemo-doc/denemo-manual.html after you have installed the denemo-doc package.
