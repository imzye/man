DESCRIPTION
       fa2htgs is a program used to generate Seq-submits (an ASN.1 sequence submission file) for high throughput genome sequencing projects.

       fa2htgs will read a FASTA file (or an Ace Contig file with Phrap sequence quality values), a Sequin submission template file, (to get contact and citation information for the submission), and a series
       of  command  line  arguments (see below).  This program will then combines these information to make a submission suitable for GenBank. Once you have generated your submission file, you need to follow
       the submission protocol (see the README present on your FTP account or mailed out to your Center).

       fa2htgs is intended for the automation by scripts for bulk submission of unannotated genome sequence. It can easily be extended from its current simple form to allow more  complicated  processing.   A
       submission prepared with fa2htgs can also be read into Psequin(1), and then annotated more extensively.

       Questions and concerns about this processing protocol, or how to use this tool should be forwarded to <htgs@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -      Print usage message

       -6 str SP6 clone (e.g., Contig1,left)

       -7 str T7 clone (e.g., Contig2,right)

       -A filename
              Filename  for  accession  list  input (mutually exclusive with -T and -i).  The input file contains a tab-delimited table with three to five columns, which are accession number, start position,
              stop position, and (optionally) length and strand.  If start > stop, the minus strand on the referenced accession is used.  A gap is indicated by the word "gap" instead of an accession,  0  for
              the start and stop positions, and a number for the length.

       -C str Clone library name (will appear as /clone-lib="str" on the source feature)

       -D     HTGS_DRAFT sequence

       -L filename
              Read  phrap  contig  order from filename.  This is a tab-delimited file that can be used to drive the order of contigs (normally specified by -P), as well as indicating the SP6 and T7 ends.  It
              can also be used when contigs are known to be in opposite orientation.  For example:

                  Contig2     +       1       SP6     left
                  Contig3     +       1
                  Contig1     -               T7      right

              The first column is the contig name, the second is the orientation, the third is the fragment_group, the fourth indicates the SP6 or T7 end, and the fifth says which side of SP6 or T7  end  had
              vector removed.

       -M str Map name (will appear as /map="str" on the source feature)

       -N     Annotate assembly_fragments

       -O filename
              Read comment from filename (100-character-per-line maximum; ~ is a linebreak and `~ is a literal ~.  You can check the format with PSequin(1).)

       -P str Contigs  to  use,  separated  by commas.  If -P is not indicated with the -T option, then the fragments will go in in the order that they are in the ace file (which is appropriate for a phase 1
              record, but not for a phase 2 or 3).  If you need to set the order of the segments of the ace file, you need to set it with the -P flag, like this: -P "Contig1,Contig4,Contig3,Contig2,Contig5"

       -Q filename
              Read quality scores from filename

       -S str Strain name

       -T filename
              Filename for phrap input (mutually exclusive with -A and -i)

       -X     The coordinates in the input file are on the resulting segmented sequence.  (Bases 1 through n of each accession are used.)  Otherwise, the coordinates are on the individual  accessions,  which
              need not start at base 1 of the record.

       -a str GenBank accession; use if and only if updating a sequence.

       -b N   Gap length (default = 100; anything from 0 to 1000000000 is legal)

       -c str Clone name (will appear as /clone in the source feature; can be the same as -s)

       -d str Title for sequence (will appear in GenBank DEFINITION line)

       -e filename
              Log errors to filename

       -f     htgs_fulltop keyword

       -g str Genome Center tag (probably the same as your login name on the NCBI FTP server)

       -h str Chromosome (will appear as /chromosome in the source feature)

       -i filename
              Filename for fasta input (default is stdin; mutually exclusive with -A and -T)

       -k str Add the supplied string as a keyword.

       -l N   Length  of  sequence  in bp (default = 0). The length is checked against the actual number of bases we get. For phase 1 and 2 sequence it is also used to estimate gap lengths. For phase 1 and 2
              records, it is important to use a number GREATER than the amount of provided nucleotide, otherwise this will generate false `gaps'.  Here is assumed that the putative full length of the BAC  or
              cosmid  will  be  used.   There  should be at least 20 to 30 `n' in between the segments (you can check for these in Sequin), as this will ensure proper behavior when this sequence is used with
              BLAST.  Otherwise `artifactual' unrelated segment neighbors may be brought into proximity of each other.

       -m     Take comment from template

       -n str Organism name (default = Homo sapiens)

       -o filename
              Filename for asn.1 output (default = stdout)

       -p N   HTGS phase:
              1      A collection of unordered contigs with gaps of unknown length.  A Phase 1 record must at the very least have two segments with one gap.  (default)
              2      A series of ordered contigs, possibly with known gap lengths.  This could be a single sequence without gaps, if the sequence has ambiguities to resolve.
              3      A single contiguous sequence.  This sequence is finished, but not necessarily annotated.

       -q     htgs_cancelled keyword

       -r str Remark for update (brief comment describing the nature of the update, such as "new sequence", "new citation", or "updated features")

       -s str Sequence name.  The sequence must have a name that is unique within the genome center. We use the combination of the genome center name (-g argument) and the sequence name (-s)  to  track  this
              sequence and to talk to you about it.  The name can have any form you like but must be unique within your center.

       -t filename
              Filename for Seq-submit template (default = template.sub)

       -u     Take biosource from template

       -v     htgs_activefin keyword

       -w     Whole Genome Shotgun flag

       -x str Secondary accession numbers, separated by commas, s.t. U10000,L11000.

              In  some  cases a large segment will supersede another or group of other accession numbers (records).  These records which are no longer wanted in GenBank should be made secondary. Using the -x
              argument you can list the Accession Numbers you want to make secondary.  This will instruct us to remove the accession number(s) from GenBank, and will no longer be part of the GenBank release.
              They will nonetheless be available from Entrez.

              GREAT  CARE  should  be taken when using this argument!!!  Improper use of accession numbers here will result in the inappropriate withdrawal of GenBank records from GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ.  We
              provide this parameter as a convenience to submitting centers, but this may need to be removed if it is not used carefully.
