SNMPD.CONF(5)                                                                                     Net-SNMP                                                                                    SNMPD.CONF(5)

NAME
       snmpd.conf - configuration file for the Net-SNMP SNMP agent

DESCRIPTION
       The  Net-SNMP  agent  uses one or more configuration files to control its operation and the management information provided.  These files (snmpd.conf and snmpd.local.conf) can be located in one of
       several locations, as described in the snmp_config(5) manual page.

       The (perl) application snmpconf can be used to generate configuration files for the most common agent requirements.  See the snmpconf(1) manual page for more information, or try running  the  com‐
       mand:

              snmpconf -g basic_setup

       There are a large number of directives that can be specified, but these mostly fall into four distinct categories:

       •      those controlling who can access the agent

       •      those configuring the information that is supplied by the agent

       •      those controlling active monitoring of the local system

       •      those concerned with extending the functionality of the agent.

       Some  directives don't fall naturally into any of these four categories, but this covers the majority of the contents of a typical snmpd.conf file.  A full list of recognised directives can be ob‐
       tained by running the command:

              snmpd -H

AGENT BEHAVIOUR
       Although most configuration directives are concerned with the MIB information supplied by the agent, there are a handful of directives that control the behaviour of snmpd considered  simply  as  a
       daemon providing a network service.

       agentaddress [<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>[,...]
              defines  a list of listening addresses, on which to receive incoming SNMP requests.  See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8) manual page for more information about the format of
              listening addresses.

              The default behaviour is to listen on UDP port 161 on all IPv4 interfaces.

       agentgroup {GROUP|#GID}
              changes to the specified group after opening the listening port(s).  This may refer to a group by name (GROUP), or a numeric group ID starting with '#' (#GID).

       agentuser {USER|#UID}
              changes to the specified user after opening the listening port(s).  This may refer to a user by name (USER), or a numeric user ID starting with '#' (#UID).

       leave_pidfile yes
              instructs the agent to not remove its pid file on shutdown. Equivalent to specifying "-U" on the command line.

       maxGetbulkRepeats NUM
              Sets the maximum number of responses allowed for a single variable in a getbulk request.  Set to 0 to enable the default and set it to -1 to enable unlimited.  Because memory  is  allocated
              ahead of time, setting this to unlimited is not considered safe if your user population can not be trusted.  A repeat number greater than this will be truncated to this value.

              This is set by default to -1.

       maxGetbulkResponses NUM
              Sets  the maximum number of responses allowed for a getbulk request.  This is set by default to 100.  Set to 0 to enable the default and set it to -1 to enable unlimited.  Because memory is
              allocated ahead of time, setting this to unlimited is not considered safe if your user population can not be trusted.

              In general, the total number of responses will not be allowed to exceed the maxGetbulkResponses number, and the total number returned will be an integer multiple of the number of  variables
              requested times the calculated number of repeats allow to fit below this number.

              Also note that processing of maxGetbulkRepeats is handled first.

       ifmib_max_num_ifaces NUM
              Sets  the  maximum  number of interfaces included in IF-MIB data collection.  For servers with a large number of interfaces (ppp, dummy, bridge, etc) the IF-MIB processing will take a large
              chunk of CPU for ioctl calls (on Linux). Setting a reasonable maximum for the CPU used will reduce the CPU load for IF-MIB processing.  For example, configuring  "ifmib_max_num_ifaces  500"
              will include only the first 500 interfaces based on ifindex and ignore all others for IF-MIB processing.

              The default (without this configured) is to include all interfaces.

       include_ifmib_iface_prefix PREFIX1 PREFIX2 ...
              Sets  the  interface name prefixes to include in the IF-MIB data collection.  For servers with a large number of interfaces (ppp, dummy, bridge, etc) the IF-MIB processing will take a large
              chunk of CPU for ioctl calls (on Linux). A set of space separated interface name prefixes will reduce the CPU load for IF-MIB processing.  For example, configuring "include_ifmib_iface_pre‐
              fix eth dummy lo" will include only interfaces with these prefixes and ignore all others for IF-MIB processing. If regex support is compiled in, each of the prefixes is a regular expression
              (which is not permitted to contain a space or tab character).

              The default (without this configured) is to include all interfaces.

   SNMPv3 Configuration - Real Security
       SNMPv3 is added flexible security models to the SNMP packet structure so that multiple security solutions could be used.  SNMPv3 was original defined  with  a  "User-based  Security  Model"  (USM)
       [RFC3414] that required maintaining a SNMP-specific user database.  This was later determined to be troublesome to maintain and had some minor security issues.  The IETF has since added additional
       security  models  to  tunnel  SNMP  over SSH [RFC5592] and DTLS/TLS [RFC-to-be].  Net-SNMP contains robust support for SNMPv3/USM, SNMPv3/TLS, and SNMPv3/DTLS.  It contains partial support for SN‐
       MPv3/SSH as well but has not been as extensively tested.  It also contains code for support for an experimental Kerberos based SNMPv3 that never got standardized.

       Hopefully more SNMP software and devices will eventually support SNMP over (D)TLS or SSH, but it is likely that devices with original support for SNMP will only contain support for USM users.   If
       your network manager supports SNMP over (D)TLS or SNMP over SSH we suggest you use one of these mechanisms instead of using USM, but as always with Net-SNMP we give you the options to pick from so
       you can make the choice that is best for you.

   SNMPv3 generic parameters
       These parameters are generic to all the forms of SNMPv3.  The SNMPv3 protocol defines "engineIDs" that uniquely identify an agent.  The string must be consistent through time and should not change
       or  conflict with another agent's engineID.  Ever.  Internally, Net-SNMP by default creates a unique engineID that is based off of the current system time and a random number.  This should be suf‐
       ficient for most users unless you're embedding our agent in a device where these numbers won't vary between boxes on the devices initial boot.

              EngineIDs are used both as a "context" for selecting information from the device and SNMPv3 with USM uses it to create unique entries for users in its user table.

              The Net-SNMP agent offers the following mechanisms for setting the engineID, but again you should only use them if you know what you're doing:

       engineID STRING
              specifies that the engineID should be built from the given text STRING.

       engineIDType 1|2|3
              specifies that the engineID should be built from the IPv4 address (1), IPv6 address (2) or MAC address (3).  Note that changing the IP address (or switching the network interface card)  may
              cause problems.

       engineIDNic INTERFACE
              defines which interface to use when determining the MAC address.  If engineIDType 3 is not specified, then this directive has no effect.

              The default is to use eth0.

   SNMPv3 over TLS
       SNMPv3  may  be  tunneled  over  TLS and DTLS.  TLS runs over TCP and DTLS is the UDP equivalent.  Wes Hardaker (the founder of Net-SNMP) performed a study and presented it at an IETF meeting that
       showed that TCP based protocols are sufficient for stable networks but quickly becomes a problem in unstable networks with even moderate levels of packet loss (~ 20-30%).  If you are going to  use
       TLS  or  DTLS,  you should use the one appropriate for your networking environment.  You should potentially turn them both on so your management system can access either the UDP or the TCP port as
       needed.

       Many of the configuration tokens described below are prefixed with a '[snmp]' tag.  If you place these tokens in your snmpd.conf file, this take is required.  See the  snmp_config(5)  manual  page
       for the meaning of this context switch.

       [snmp] localCert <specifier>
              This  token  defines  the  default  X.509  public  key  to  use  as  the server's identity.  It should either be a fingerprint or a filename.  To create a public key for use, please run the
              "net-snmp-cert" utility which will help you create the required certificate.

              The default value for this is the certificate in the "snmpd" named certificate file.

       [snmp] tlsAlgorithms <algorithms>
              This string will select the algorithms to use when negotiating security during (D)TLS session establishment.  See the openssl manual page ciphers(1) for details  on  the  format.   Examples
              strings include:

              DEFAULT
              ALL
              HIGH
              HIGH:!AES128-SHA

              The default value is whatever openssl itself was configured with.

       [snmp] x509CRLFile
              If  you  are using a Certificate Authority (CA) that publishes a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) then this token can be used to specify the location in the filesystem of a copy of the CRL
              file.  Note that Net-SNMP will not pull a CRL over http and this must be a file, not a URL.  Additionally, OpenSSL does not reload a CRL file when it has changed so modifications or updates
              to the file will only be noticed upon a restart of the snmpd agent.

       certSecName PRIORITY FINGERPRINT OPTIONS
              OPTIONS can be one of <--sn SECNAME | --rfc822 | --dns | --ip | --cn | --any>.

              The certSecName token will specify how to map a certificate field from the client's X.509 certificate to a SNMPv3 username.  Use the --sn SECNAME flag to directly specify a securityName for
              a given certificate.  The other flags extract a particular component of the certificate for use as a snmpv3 securityName.  These fields are one of: A  SubjectAltName  containing  an  rfc822
              value (eg hardaker@net-snmp.org), A SubjectAltName containing a dns name value (eg foo.net-snmp.org), an IP address (eg 192.0.2.1) or a common name "Wes Hardaker".  The --any flag specifies
              that any of the subjecAltName fields may be used.  Make sure once a securityName has been selected that it is given authorization via the VACM controls discussed later in this manual page.

              See the http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Using_DTLS web page for more detailed instructions for setting up (D)TLS.

       trustCert <specifier>
              For  X509  to properly verify a certificate, it should be verifiable up until a trust anchor for it.  This trust anchor is typically a CA certificate but it could also be a self-signed cer‐
              tificate.  The "trustCert" token should be used to load specific trust anchors into the verification engine.

       SNMP over (D)TLS requires the use of the Transport Security Model (TSM), so read the section on the usage of the Transport Security Model as well.  Make sure when you configure the VACM to  accept
       connections from (D)TLS that you use the "tsm" security model.  E.G.:

       rwuser -s tsm hardaker@net-snmp.org

   SNMPv3 over SSH Support
       To  use  SSH, you'll need to configure sshd to invoke the sshtosnmp program as well as configure the access control settings to allow access through the tsm security model using the user name pro‐
       vided to snmpd by the ssh transport.

   SNMPv3 with the Transport Security Model (TSM)
       The Transport Security Model [RFC5591] defines a SNMPv3 security system for use with "tunneled" security protocols like TLS, DTLS and SSH.  It is a very simple  security  model  that  simply  lets
       properly  protected  packets  to pass through into the snmp application.  The transport is required to pass a securityName to use to the TSM and the TSM may optionally prefix this with a transport
       string (see below).

       tsmUseTransportPrefix (1|yes|true|0|no|false)
              If set to true, the TSM module will take every securityName passed to it from the transports underneath and prefix it with a string that specifically identities the transport it came  from.
              This  is  useful  to avoid securityName clashes with transports that generate identical security names.  For example, if the ssh security transport delivered the security name of "hardaker"
              for a SSH connection and the TLS security transport also delivered the security name of "hardaker" for a TLS connection then it would be impossible to separate out these two users  to  pro‐
              vide separate access control rights.  With the tsmUseTransportPrefix set to true, however, the securityNames would be prefixed appropriately with one of: "tls:", "dtls:" or "ssh:".

   SNMPv3 with the User-based Security Model (USM)
       SNMPv3  was  originally defined using the User-Based Security Model (USM), which contains a private list of users and keys specific to the SNMPv3 protocol.  The operational community, however, de‐
       clared it a pain to manipulate yet another database and would prefer to use existing infrastructure.  To that end the IETF created the ISMS working group to battle that problem, and the ISMS work‐
       ing group decided to tunnel SNMP over SSH and DTLS to make use existing user and authentication infrastructures.

   SNMPv3 USM Users
       To use the USM based SNMPv3-specific users, you'll need to create them.  It is recommended you use the net-snmp-config command to do this, but you can also do it by directly specifying  createUser
       directives yourself instead:

       createUser [-e ENGINEID] username (MD5|SHA|SHA-512|SHA-384|SHA-256|SHA-224) authpassphrase [DES|AES] [privpassphrase]

              MD5|SHA|SHA-512|SHA-384|SHA-256|SHA-224  are the authentication types to use.  DES and AES are the privacy protocols to use.  If the privacy passphrase is not specified, it is assumed to be
              the same as the authentication passphrase.  Note that the users created will be useless unless they are also added to the VACM access control tables described above.

              SHA|SHA-512|SHA-384|SHA-256|SHA-224 authentication and DES/AES privacy require OpenSSL to be installed and the agent to be built with OpenSSL support.  MD5 authentication may be used  with‐
              out OpenSSL.

              Warning: the minimum pass phrase length is 8 characters.

              SNMPv3 users can be created at runtime using the snmpusm(1) command.

              Instead  of  figuring  out how to use this directive and where to put it (see below), just run "net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user" instead, which will add one of these lines to the right
              place.

              This directive should be placed into the /var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf file instead of the other normal locations.  The reason is that the information is read from the file and then the line  is
              removed (eliminating the storage of the master password for that user) and replaced with the key that is derived from it.  This key is a localized key, so that if it is stolen it can not be
              used to access other agents.  If the password is stolen, however, it can be.

              If  you need to localize the user to a particular EngineID (this is useful mostly in the similar snmptrapd.conf file), you can use the -e argument to specify an EngineID as a hex value (EG,
              "0x01020304").

              If you want to generate either your master or localized keys directly, replace the given password with a hexstring (preceded by a "0x") and precede the hex string by a -m or -l  token  (re‐
              spectively).  EGs:

              [these keys are *not* secure but are easy to visually parse for
              counting purposes.  Please generate random keys instead of using
              these examples]

              createUser myuser SHA -l 0x0001020304050607080900010203040506070809 AES -l 0x00010203040506070809000102030405
              createUser myuser SHA -m 0x0001020304050607080900010203040506070809 AES -m 0x0001020304050607080900010203040506070809

              Due  to  the way localization happens, localized privacy keys are expected to be the length needed by the algorithm (128 bits for all supported algorithms).  Master encryption keys, though,
              need to be the length required by the authentication algorithm not the length required by the encrypting algorithm (MD5: 16 bytes, SHA: 20 bytes).

ACCESS CONTROL
       snmpd supports the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM) as defined in RFC 2575, to control who can retrieve or update information.  To this end, it recognizes various directives relating to  ac‐
       cess control.

   Traditional Access Control
       Most simple access control requirements can be specified using the directives rouser/rwuser (for SNMPv3) or rocommunity/rwcommunity (for SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c).

       rouser [-s SECMODEL] USER [noauth|auth|priv [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]

       rwuser [-s SECMODEL]  USER [noauth|auth|priv [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]
              specify  an SNMPv3 user that will be allowed read-only (GET and GETNEXT) or read-write (GET, GETNEXT and SET) access respectively.  By default, this will provide access to the full OID tree
              for authenticated (including encrypted) SNMPv3 requests, using the default context.  An alternative minimum security level can be specified using noauth (to allow unauthenticated requests),
              or priv (to enforce use of encryption).  The OID field restricts access for that user to the subtree rooted at the given OID, or the named view.  An optional context can also be  specified,
              or "context*" to denote a context prefix.  If no context field is specified (or the token "*" is used), the directive will match all possible contexts.

              If SECMODEL is specified then it will be the security model required for that user (note that identical user names may come in over different security models and will be appropriately sepa‐
              rated via the access control settings).  The default security model is "usm" and the other common security models are likely "tsm" when using (D)TLS or SSH support and "ksm" if the Kerberos
              support has been compiled in.

       rocommunity COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]

       rwcommunity COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]
              specify  an  SNMPv1  or SNMPv2c community that will be allowed read-only (GET and GETNEXT) or read-write (GET, GETNEXT and SET) access respectively.  By default, this will provide access to
              the full OID tree for such requests, regardless of where they were sent from. The SOURCE token can be used to restrict access to requests from the specified system(s) - see com2sec for  the
              full  details.   The  OID field restricts access for that community to the subtree rooted at the given OID, or named view.  Contexts are typically less relevant to community-based SNMP ver‐
              sions, but the same behaviour applies here.

       rocommunity6 COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]

       rwcommunity6 COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]
              are directives relating to requests received using IPv6 (if the agent supports such transport domains).  The interpretation of the SOURCE, OID, VIEW and CONTEXT tokens are exactly the  same
              as for the IPv4 versions.

       In  each case, only one directive should be specified for a given SNMPv3 user, or community string.  It is not appropriate to specify both rouser and rwuser directives referring to the same SNMPv3
       user (or equivalent community settings). The rwuser directive provides all the access of rouser (as well as allowing SET support).  The same holds true for the community-based directives.

       More complex access requirements (such as access to two or more distinct OID subtrees, or different views for GET and SET requests) should use one of the other  access  control  mechanisms.   Note
       that if several distinct communities or SNMPv3 users need to be granted the same level of access, it would also be more efficient to use the main VACM configuration directives.

   VACM Configuration
       The full flexibility of the VACM is available using four configuration directives - com2sec, group, view and access.  These provide direct configuration of the underlying VACM tables.

       com2sec  [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOURCE COMMUNITY

       com2sec6 [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOURCE COMMUNITY
              map  an  SNMPv1  or  SNMPv2c community string to a security name - either from a particular range of source addresses, or globally ("default").  A restricted source can either be a specific
              hostname (or address), or a subnet - represented as IP/MASK (e.g. 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0), or IP/BITS (e.g. 10.10.10.0/24), or the IPv6 equivalents.  A restriction preceded by an exclama‐
              tion mark (!) denies access from that address or subnet, e.g., !10.10.10.0/24 denies requests from that sources in that subnet.  Deny restrictions must be before permit.  E.g., the  follow‐
              ing example permits access from all of 10.0.0.0/8 except for 10.10.10.0/24:
                     com2sec sec1 !10.10.10.0/24 public
                     com2sec sec1 10.0.0.0/8 public

              Access from outside of 10.0.0.0/8 would still be denied.

              The same community string can be specified in several separate directives (presumably with different source tokens), and the first source/community combination that matches the incoming re‐
              quest will be selected.  Various source/community combinations can also map to the same security name.

              If a CONTEXT is specified (using -Cn), the community string will be mapped to a security name in the named SNMPv3 context. Otherwise the default context ("") will be used.

       com2secunix [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOCKPATH COMMUNITY
              is the Unix domain sockets version of com2sec.

       group GROUP {v1|v2c|usm|tsm|ksm} SECNAME
              maps  a  security  name (in the specified security model) into a named group.  Several group directives can specify the same group name, allowing a single access setting to apply to several
              users and/or community strings.

              Note that groups must be set up for the two community-based models separately - a single com2sec (or equivalent) directive will typically be accompanied by two group directives.

       view VNAME TYPE OID [MASK]
              defines a named "view" - a subset of the overall OID tree. This is most commonly a single subtree, but several view directives can be given with the same view name (VNAME), to  build  up  a
              more  complex  collection  of OIDs.  TYPE is either included or excluded, which can again define a more complex view (e.g by excluding certain sensitive objects from an otherwise accessible
              subtree).

              MASK is a list of hex octets (optionally separated by '.' or ':') with the set bits indicating which subidentifiers in the view OID to match against.  If not  specified,  this  defaults  to
              matching the OID exactly (all bits set), thus defining a simple OID subtree.  So:
                     view iso1 included .iso  0xf0
                     view iso2 included .iso
                     view iso3 included .iso.org.dod.mgmt  0xf0

              would all define the same view, covering the whole of the 'iso(1)' subtree (with the third example ignoring the subidentifiers not covered by the mask).

              More  usefully, the mask can be used to define a view covering a particular row (or rows) in a table, by matching against the appropriate table index value, but skipping the column subiden‐
              tifier:

                     view ifRow4 included .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.0.4  0xff:a0

              Note that a mask longer than 8 bits must use ':' to separate the individual octets.

       access GROUP CONTEXT {any|v1|v2c|usm|tsm|ksm} LEVEL PREFX READ WRITE NOTIFY
              maps from a group of users/communities (with a particular security model and minimum security level, and in a specific context) to one  of  three  views,  depending  on  the  request  being
              processed.

              LEVEL  is one of noauth, auth, or priv.  PREFX specifies how CONTEXT should be matched against the context of the incoming request, either exact or prefix.  READ, WRITE and NOTIFY specifies
              the view to be used for GET*, SET and TRAP/INFORM requests (althought the NOTIFY view is not currently used).  For v1 or v2c access, LEVEL will need to be noauth.

   Typed-View Configuration
       The final group of directives extend the VACM approach into a more flexible mechanism, which can be applied to other access control requirements. Rather than the fixed three views of the  standard
       VACM  mechanism,  this can be used to configure various different view types.  As far as the main SNMP agent is concerned, the two main view types are read and write, corresponding to the READ and
       WRITE views of the main access directive.  See the 'snmptrapd.conf(5)' man page for discussion of other view types.

       authcommunity TYPES  COMMUNITY   [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]
              is an alternative to the rocommunity/rwcommunity directives.  TYPES will usually be read or read,write respectively.  The view specification can either be an OID subtree (as before),  or  a
              named  view (defined using the view directive) for greater flexibility.  If this is omitted, then access will be allowed to the full OID tree.  If CONTEXT is specified, access is configured
              within this SNMPv3 context.  Otherwise the default context ("") is used.

       authuser   TYPES [-s MODEL] USER  [LEVEL [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]
              is an alternative to the rouser/rwuser directives.  The fields TYPES, OID, VIEW and CONTEXT have the same meaning as for authcommunity.

       authgroup  TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP [LEVEL [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]
              is a companion to the authuser directive, specifying access for a particular group (defined using the group directive as usual).  Both authuser and authgroup default  to  authenticated  re‐
              quests - LEVEL can also be specified as noauth or priv to allow unauthenticated requests, or require encryption respectively.  Both authuser and authgroup directives also default to config‐
              uring access for SNMPv3/USM requests - use the '-s' flag to specify an alternative security model (using the same values as for access above).

       authaccess TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP VIEW [LEVEL [CONTEXT]]
              also configures the access for a particular group, specifying the name and type of view to apply. The MODEL and LEVEL fields are interpreted in the same way as for authgroup.  If CONTEXT is
              specified, access is configured within this SNMPv3 context (or contexts with this prefix if the CONTEXT field ends with '*').  Otherwise the default context ("") is used.

       setaccess GROUP CONTEXT MODEL LEVEL PREFIX VIEW TYPES
              is  a  direct equivalent to the original access directive, typically listing the view types as read or read,write as appropriate.  (or see 'snmptrapd.conf(5)' for other possibilities).  All
              other fields have the same interpretation as with access.

SYSTEM INFORMATION
       Most of the information reported by the Net-SNMP agent is retrieved from the underlying system, or dynamically configured via SNMP SET requests (and retained from one  run  of  the  agent  to  the
       next).  However, certain MIB objects can be configured or controlled via the snmpd.conf(5) file.

   System Group
       Most of the scalar objects in the 'system' group can be configured in this way:

       sysLocation STRING

       sysContact STRING

       sysName STRING
              set the system location, system contact or system name (sysLocation.0, sysContact.0 and sysName.0) for the agent respectively.  Ordinarily these objects are writable via suitably authorized
              SNMP SET requests.  However, specifying one of these directives makes the corresponding object read-only, and attempts to SET it will result in a notWritable error response.

       sysServices NUMBER
              sets the value of the sysServices.0 object.  For a host system, a good value is 72 (application + end-to-end layers).  If this directive is not specified, then no value will be reported for
              the sysServices.0 object.

       sysDescr STRING

       sysObjectID OID
              sets the system description or object ID for the agent.  Although these MIB objects are not SNMP-writable, these directives can be used by a network administrator to configure suitable val‐
              ues for them.

   Interfaces Group
       interface NAME TYPE SPEED
              can  be  used  to  provide  appropriate  type  and  speed  settings  for  interfaces  where  the  agent  fails to determine this information correctly.  TYPE is a type value as given in the
              IANAifType-MIB, and can be specified numerically or by name (assuming this MIB is loaded).

       interface_fadeout TIMEOUT
              specifies, for how long the agent keeps entries in ifTable after appropriate interfaces have been removed from system (typically various ppp, tap or tun interfaces).  Timeout  value  is  in
              seconds. Default value is 300 (=5 minutes).

       interface_replace_old yes
              can  be  used  to remove already existing entries in ifTable when an interface with the same name appears on the system. E.g. when ppp0 interface is removed, it is still listed in the table
              for interface_fadeout seconds. This option ensures, that the old ppp0 interface is removed even before the interface_fadeout timeour when new ppp0 (with different ifIndex) shows up.

   Host Resources Group
       This requires that the agent was built with support for the host module (which is now included as part of the default build configuration on the major supported platforms).

       ignoreDisk STRING
              controls which disk devices are scanned as part of populating the hrDiskStorageTable (and hrDeviceTable).  The HostRes implementation code includes a list of disk device patterns  appropri‐
              ate for the current operating system, some of which may cause the agent to block when trying to open the corresponding disk devices.  This might lead to a timeout when walking these tables,
              possibly resulting in inconsistent behaviour.  This directive can be used to specify particular devices (either individually or wildcarded) that should not be checked.

              Note:  Please consult the source (host/hr_disk.c) and check for the Add_HR_Disk_entry calls relevant for a particular O/S to determine the list of devices that will be scanned.

              The pattern can include one or more wildcard expressions.  See snmpd.examples(5) for illustration of the wildcard syntax.

       ignoremount [-r] STRING
              controls  which mounts should be omitted from the hrStorageTable.  If the Net-SNMP agent gets hung on accessing a filesystem, or the filesystem is always mostly full (and thus leads to spu‐
              rious alerts), you can omit it by listing the full path in this directive.

              If the "-r" option is provided, the pattern can include one or more regular expressions.

       skipNFSInHostResources true
              controls whether NFS and NFS-like file systems should be omitted from the hrStorageTable (true or 1) or not (false or 0, which is the default).  If the Net-SNMP  agent  gets  hung  on  NFS-
              mounted filesystems, you can try setting this to '1'.

              Alternately, more granular control over which mounts should be omitted from the hrStorageTable can be achieved via the ignoremount directive.

       storageUseNFS [1|2]
              controls  how  NFS  and  NFS-like file systems should be reported in the hrStorageTable.  as 'Network Disks' (1) or 'Fixed Disks' (2) Historically, the Net-SNMP agent has reported such file
              systems as 'Fixed Disks', and this is still the default behaviour.  Setting this directive to '1' reports such file systems as ´Network Disks', as required by the Host Resources MIB.

       realStorageUnits
              controlls how the agent reports hrStorageAllocationUnits, hrStorageSize and hrStorageUsed in hrStorageTable.  For big storage drives with small  allocation  units  the  agent  re-calculates
              these values so they all fit Integer32 and hrStorageAllocationUnits x hrStorageSize gives real size of the storage.

              Example:
                     Linux  xfs  16TB  filesystem with 4096 bytes large blocks will be reported as  hrStorageAllocationUnits = 8192 and hrStorageSize = 2147483647, so 8192 x 2147483647 gives real size of
                     the filesystem (=16 TB).

              Setting this directive to '1' turns off this calculation and the agent reports real hrStorageAllocationUnits, but it might report wrong hrStorageSize for big drives because the value  won't
              fit into Integer32. In this case, hrStorageAllocationUnits x hrStorageSize won't give real size of the storage.

   Process Monitoring
       The  hrSWRun group of the Host Resources MIB provides information about individual processes running on the local system.  The prTable of the UCD-SNMP-MIB complements this by reporting on selected
       services (which may involve multiple processes).  This requires that the agent was built with support for the ucd-snmp/proc module (which is included as part of the default build configuration).

       proc NAME [MAX [MIN]]
              monitors the number of processes called NAME (as reported by "/bin/ps -e") running on the local system.

              If the number of NAMEd processes is less than MIN or greater than MAX, then the corresponding prErrorFlag instance will be set to 1, and a suitable description message reported via the prE‐
              rrMessage instance.

              Note:  This situation will not automatically trigger a trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB section later.

              If neither MAX nor MIN are specified, they will default to infinity and 1 respectively ("at least one").  If only MAX is specified, MIN will default to 0 ("no more than MAX").  If MAX is  0
              (and MIN is not), this indicates infinity ("at least MIN").  If both MAX and MIN are 0, this indicates a process that should not be running.

       procfix NAME PROG ARGS
              registers a command that can be run to fix errors with the given process NAME.  This will be invoked when the corresponding prErrFix instance is set to 1.

              Note:  This command will not be invoked automatically.

              The procfix directive must be specified after the matching proc directive, and cannot be used on its own.

       If no proc directives are defined, then walking the prTable will fail (noSuchObject).

   Disk Usage Monitoring
       This requires that the agent was built with support for the ucd-snmp/disk module (which is included as part of the default build configuration).

       disk PATH [ MINSPACE | MINPERCENT% ]
              monitors the disk mounted at PATH for available disk space.  Disks mounted after the agent has started will not be monitored, unless includeAllDisks option is specified.

              The minimum threshold can either be specified in kB (MINSPACE) or as a percentage of the total disk (MINPERCENT% with a '%' character), defaulting to 100kB if neither are specified.  If the
              free disk space falls below this threshold, then the corresponding dskErrorFlag instance will be set to 1, and a suitable description message reported via the dskErrorMsg instance.

              Note:  This situation will not automatically trigger a trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB section later.

       includeAllDisks MINPERCENT%
              configures  monitoring of all disks found on the system, using the specified (percentage) threshold.  The dskTable is dynamically updated, unmounted disks disappear from the table and newly
              mounted disks are added to the table.  The threshold for individual disks can be adjusted using suitable disk directives (which can come either before or after  the  includeAllDisks  direc‐
              tive).

              Note:  Whether disk directives appears before or after includeAllDisks may affect the indexing of the dskTable.

              Only one includeAllDisks directive should be specified - any subsequent copies will be ignored.

              The list of mounted disks will be determined from HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrFSTable.

       If neither any disk directives or includeAllDisks are defined, then walking the dskTable will fail (noSuchObject).

   Disk I/O Monitoring
       This requires that the agent was built with support for the ucd-snmp/diskio module (which is not included as part of the default build configuration).

       By default, all block devices known to the operating system are included in the diskIOTable. On platforms other than Linux, this module has no configuration directives.

       On  Linux systems, it is possible to exclude several classes of block devices from the diskIOTable in order to avoid cluttering the table with useless zero statistics for pseudo-devices that often
       are not in use but are configured by default to exist in most recent Linux distributions.

       diskio_exclude_fd yes
              Excludes all Linux floppy disk block devices, whose names start with "fd", e.g. "fd0"

       diskio_exclude_loop yes
              Excludes all Linux loopback block devices, whose names start with "loop", e.g. "loop0"

       diskio_exclude_ram yes
              Excludes all LInux ramdisk block devices, whose names start with "ram", e.g.  "ram0"

       On Linux systems, it is also possible to report only explicitly accepted devices. It may take significant amount of time to process diskIOTable data on systems with tens of thousands of block  de‐
       vices and accept only the important ones avoids large CPU consumption.

       diskio <device>
              Enables acceptlist of devices and adds the device to the acceptlist. Only explicitly acceptlisted devices will be reported. This option may be used multiple times.

   System Load Monitoring
       This  requires that the agent was built with support for either the ucd-snmp/loadave module or the ucd-snmp/memory module respectively (both of which are included as part of the default build con‐
       figuration).

       load MAX1 [MAX5 [MAX15]]
              monitors the load average of the local system, specifying thresholds for the 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute averages.  If any of these loads exceed the associated maximum value, then  the
              corresponding laErrorFlag instance will be set to 1, and a suitable description message reported via the laErrMessage instance.

              Note:  This situation will not automatically trigger a trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB section later.

              If  the  MAX15  threshold  is  omitted, it will default to the MAX5 value.  If both MAX5 and MAX15 are omitted, they will default to the MAX1 value.  If this directive is not specified, all
              three thresholds will default to a value of DEFMAXLOADAVE.

              If a threshold value of 0 is given, the agent will not report errors via the relevant laErrorFlag or laErrMessage instances, regardless of the current load.

       Unlike the proc and disk directives, walking the walking the laTable will succeed (assuming the ucd-snmp/loadave module was configured into the agent), even if the load directive is not present.

       swap MIN
              monitors the amount of swap space available on the local system.  If this falls below the specified threshold (MIN kB), then the memErrorSwap object will be set to 1,  and  a  suitable  de‐
              scription message reported via memSwapErrorMsg.

              Note:  This situation will not automatically trigger a trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB section later.
       If this directive is not specified, the default threshold is 16 MB.

   Log File Monitoring
       This requires that the agent was built with support for either the ucd-snmp/file or ucd-snmp/logmatch modules respectively (both of which are included as part of the default build configuration).

       file FILE [MAXSIZE]
              monitors  the  size of the specified file (in kB).  If MAXSIZE is specified, and the size of the file exceeds this threshold, then the corresponding fileErrorFlag instance will be set to 1,
              and a suitable description message reported via the fileErrorMsg instance.

              Note:  This situation will not automatically trigger a trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB section later.

              Note: A maximum of 20 files can be monitored.

              Note: If no file directives are defined, then walking the fileTable will fail (noSuchObject).

       logmatch NAME FILE CYCLETIME REGEX
              monitors the specified file for occurances of the specified pattern REGEX. The file position is stored internally so the entire file is only read initially, every subsequent pass will  only
              read the new lines added to the file since the last read.

              NAME   name of the logmatch instance (will appear as logMatchName under logMatch/logMatchTable/logMatchEntry/logMatchName in the ucd-snmp MIB tree)

              FILE   absolute path to the logfile to be monitored. Note that this path can contain date/time directives (like in the UNIX 'date' command). See the manual page for 'strftime' for the vari‐
                     ous directives accepted.

              CYCLETIME
                     time interval for each logfile read and internal variable update in seconds.  Note: an SNMPGET* operation will also trigger an immediate logfile read and variable update.

              REGEX  the regular expression to be used. Note: DO NOT enclose the regular expression in quotes even if there are spaces in the expression as the quotes will also become part of the pattern
                     to be matched!

              Example:

                     logmatch apache-GETs /usr/local/apache/logs/access.log-%Y-%m-%d 60 GET.*HTTP.*

                     This  logmatch  instance  is  named  'apache-GETs',  uses  'GET.*HTTP.*'  as  its  regular  expression  and it will monitor the file named (assuming today is May 6th 2009): '/usr/lo‐
                     cal/apache/logs/access.log-2009-05-06', tomorrow it will look for 'access.log-2009-05-07'. The logfile is read every 60 seconds.

              Note: A maximum of 250 logmatch directives can be specified.

              Note: If no logmatch directives are defined, then walking the logMatchTable will fail (noSuchObject).

ACTIVE MONITORING
       The usual behaviour of an SNMP agent is to wait for incoming SNMP requests and respond to them - if no requests are received, an agent will typically not initiate any  actions.  This  section  de‐
       scribes various directives that can configure snmpd to take a more active role.

   Notification Handling
       trapcommunity STRING
              defines the default community string to be used when sending traps.  Note that this directive must be used prior to any community-based trap destination directives that need to use it.

       trapsink [-profile p] [-name n] [-tag t] [-s src] HOST [COMMUNITY [PORT]]

       trap2sink [-profile p] [-name n] [-tag t] [-s src] HOST [COMMUNITY [PORT]]

       informsink [-profile p] [-name n] [-tag t] [-s src] HOST [COMMUNITY [PORT]]
              define  the address of a notification receiver that should be sent SNMPv1 TRAPs, SNMPv2c TRAP2s, or SNMPv2 INFORM notifications respectively.  See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the sn‐
              mpd(8) manual page for more information about the format of listening addresses.  If COMMUNITY is not specified, the most recent trapcommunity string will be used.

              If the transport address does not include an explicit port specification, then PORT will be used.  If this is not specified, the well known SNMP trap port (162) will be used.

              Note:  This mechanism is being deprecated, and the listening port should be specified via the transport specification HOST instead.

              The optional name and tag parameters specifies the name or tag that will be used for SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB table entries. The profile specifies which notification filter profile entry  will
              be used for filtering outgoing notifications. (See notificationFilter)

              The  optional  src  parameter specifies the source address that will be used when sending the trap packet to this sink.  It is specified as a <transport-address>, using the same <transport-
              specifier> as the destination HOST.  See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8) manual page for more information about the format.

              If several sink directives are specified, multiple copies of each notification (in the appropriate formats) will be generated.

              Note:  It is not normally appropriate to list two (or all three) sink directives with the same destination.

       trapsess [-profile p] [-name n] [-tag t] [-s src] [SNMPCMD_ARGS] HOST
              provides a more generic mechanism for defining notification destinations.  SNMPCMD_ARGS should be the command-line options required for an equivalent snmptrap  (or  snmpinform)  command  to
              send the desired notification.  The option -Ci can be used (with -v2c or -v3) to generate an INFORM notification rather than an unacknowledged TRAP.

              The  optional name and tag parameters specifies the name or tag that will be used for SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB table entries. The profile specifies which notification filter profile entry will
              be used for filtering outgoing notifications. (See notificationFilter)

              This is the appropriate directive for defining SNMPv3 trap receivers.  See http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial/tutorial-5/commands/snmptrap-v3.html for more information about SNMPv3  notifica‐
              tion behaviour.

       notificationFilter NAME OID MASK TYPE
              specifies a SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB notification filter profile, which may be used to filter traps. TYPE must be included or excluded, Some examples:

                     notificationFilter all_ok .1.3 0x00 included
                     notificationFilter no_coldstart .1.3 0x00 included
                     notificationFilter no_coldstart .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1 0x00 excluded

                     trapsink -profile no_coldstart 192.168.1.3:3162 secret3

       authtrapenable {1|2}
              determines  whether  to  generate  authentication  failure traps (enabled(1)) or not (disabled(2) - the default).  Ordinarily the corresponding MIB object (snmpEnableAuthenTraps.0) is read-
              write, but specifying this directive makes this object read-only, and attempts to set the value via SET requests will result in a notWritable error response.

       v1trapaddress HOST
              defines the agent address, which is inserted into SNMPv1 TRAPs. Arbitrary local IPv4 address is chosen if this option is ommited. This option is useful mainly when the agent is visible from
              outside world by specific address only (e.g.  because of network address translation or firewall).

   DisMan Event MIB
       The previous directives can be used to configure where traps should be sent, but are not concerned with when to send such traps (or what traps should be generated).  This  is  the  domain  of  the
       Event MIB - developed by the Distributed Management (DisMan) working group of the IETF.

       This requires that the agent was built with support for the disman/event module (which is now included as part of the default build configuration for the most recent distribution).

              Note:  The  behaviour of the latest implementation differs in some minor respects from the previous code - nothing too significant, but existing scripts may possibly need some minor adjust‐
                     ments.

       iquerySecName NAME

       agentSecName NAME
              specifies the default SNMPv3 username, to be used when making internal queries to retrieve any necessary information (either for evaluating the monitored expression, or building a notifica‐
              tion payload).  These internal queries always use SNMPv3, even if normal querying of the agent is done using SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c.

              Note that this user must also be explicitly created (createUser) and given appropriate access rights (e.g. rouser).  This directive is purely concerned with defining which  user  should  be
              used - not with actually setting this user up.

       monitor [OPTIONS] NAME EXPRESSION
              defines a MIB object to monitor.  If the EXPRESSION condition holds (see below), then this will trigger the corresponding event, and either send a notification or apply a SET assignment (or
              both).   Note  that  the event will only be triggered once, when the expression first matches.  This monitor entry will not fire again until the monitored condition first becomes false, and
              then matches again.  NAME is an administrative name for this expression, and is used for indexing the mteTriggerTable (and related tables). Each monitor line must have a unique NAME.  Moni‐
              tor  lines  with a duplicate name are discarded and cause snmpd to log a duplicate index complaint.  Note also that such monitors use an internal SNMPv3 request to retrieve the values being
              monitored (even if normal agent queries typically use SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c).  See the iquerySecName token described above.

       EXPRESSION
              There are three types of monitor expression supported by the Event MIB - existence, boolean and threshold tests.

              OID | ! OID | != OID
                     defines an existence(0) monitor test.  A bare OID specifies a present(0) test, which will fire when (an instance of) the monitored OID is created.  An expression of the  form  !  OID
                     specifies an absent(1) test, which will fire when the monitored OID is delected.  An expression of the form != OID specifies a changed(2) test, which will fire whenever the monitored
                     value(s) change.  Note that there must be whitespace before the OID token.

              OID OP VALUE
                     defines  a  boolean(1)  monitor test.  OP should be one of the defined comparison operators (!=, ==, <, <=, >, >=) and VALUE should be an integer value to compare against.  Note that
                     there must be whitespace around the OP token.  A comparison such as OID !=0 will not be handled correctly.

              OID MIN MAX [DMIN DMAX]
                     defines a threshold(2) monitor test.  MIN and MAX are integer values, specifying lower and upper thresholds.  If the value of the monitored OID falls below the lower threshold  (MIN)
                     or rises above the upper threshold (MAX), then the monitor entry will trigger the corresponding event.

                     Note that the rising threshold event will only be re-armed when the monitored value falls below the lower threshold (MIN).  Similarly, the falling threshold event will be re-armed by
                     the upper threshold (MAX).

                     The optional parameters DMIN and DMAX configure a pair of similar threshold tests, but working with the delta differences between successive sample values.

       OPTIONS
              There are various options to control the behaviour of the monitored expression.  These include:

              -D     indicates that the expression should be evaluated using delta differences between sample values (rather than the values themselves).

              -d OID

              -di OID
                     specifies  a  discontinuity marker for validating delta differences.  A -di object instance will be used exactly as given.  A -d object will have the instance subidentifiers from the
                     corresponding (wildcarded) expression object appended.  If the -I flag is specified, then there is no difference between these two options.

                     This option also implies -D.

              -e EVENT
                     specifies the event to be invoked when this monitor entry is triggered.  If this option is not given, the monitor entry will generate one of the standard notifications defined in the
                     DISMAN-EVENT-MIB.

              -I     indicates that the monitored expression should be applied to the specified OID as a single instance.  By default, the OID will be treated as a wildcarded object, and the monitor  ex‐
                     panded to cover all matching instances.

              -i OID

              -o OID define  additional varbinds to be added to the notification payload when this monitor trigger fires.  For a wildcarded expression, the suffix of the matched instance will be added to
                     any OIDs specified using -o, while OIDs specified using -i will be treated as exact instances.  If the -I flag is specified, then there is no difference between these two options.

                     See strictDisman for details of the ordering of notification payloads.

              -r FREQUENCY
                     monitors the given expression every FREQUENCY, where FREQUENCY is in seconds or optionally suffixed by one of s (for seconds), m (for minutes), h (for hours), d (for days), or w (for
                     weeks).  By default, the expression will be evaluated every 600s (10 minutes).

              -S     indicates that the monitor expression should not be evaluated when the agent first starts up.  The first evaluation will be done once the first repeat interval has expired.

              -s     indicates that the monitor expression should be evaluated when the agent first starts up.  This is the default behaviour.

                     Note:  Notifications triggered by this initial evaluation will be sent before the coldStart trap.

              -u SECNAME
                     specifies a security name to use for scanning the local host, instead of the default iquerySecName.  Once again, this user must  be  explicitly  created  and  given  suitable  access
                     rights.

       notificationEvent ENAME NOTIFICATION [-m] [-i OID | -o OID ]*
              defines  a  notification event named ENAME.  This can be triggered from a given monitor entry by specifying the option -e ENAME (see above).  NOTIFICATION should be the OID of the NOTIFICA‐
              TION-TYPE definition for the notification to be generated.

              If the -m option is given, the notification payload will include the standard varbinds as specified in the OBJECTS clause of the notification MIB definition.  This option  must  come  after
              the NOTIFICATION OID (and the relevant MIB file must be available and loaded by the agent).  Otherwise, these varbinds must be listed explicitly (either here or in the corresponding monitor
              directive).

              The  -i  OID  and  -o OID options specify additional varbinds to be appended to the notification payload, after the standard list.  If the monitor entry that triggered this event involved a
              wildcarded expression, the suffix of the matched instance will be added to any OIDs specified using -o, while OIDs specified using -i will be treated as exact instances.  If the -I flag was
              specified to the monitor directive, then there is no difference between these two options.

       setEvent ENAME [-I] OID = VALUE
              defines a set event named ENAME, assigning the (integer) VALUE to the specified OID.  This can be triggered from a given monitor entry by specifying the option -e ENAME (see above).

              If the monitor entry that triggered this event involved a wildcarded expression, the suffix of the matched instance will normally be added to the OID.  If the -I flag was specified  to  ei‐
              ther of the monitor or setEvent directives, the specified OID will be regarded as an exact single instance.

       strictDisman yes
              The definition of SNMP notifications states that the varbinds defined in the OBJECT clause should come first (in the order specified), followed by any "extra" varbinds that the notification
              generator feels might be useful.  The most natural approach would be to associate these mandatory varbinds with the notificationEvent entry, and append any varbinds associated with the mon‐
              itor entry that triggered the notification to the end of this list.  This is the default behaviour of the Net-SNMP Event MIB implementation.

              Unfortunately, the DisMan Event MIB specifications actually state that the trigger-related varbinds should come first, followed by the event-related ones.  This directive can be used to re‐
              store this strictly-correct (but inappropriate) behaviour.

              Note:  Strict DisMan ordering may result in generating invalid notifications payload lists if the notificationEvent -n flag is used together with monitor -o (or -i) varbind options.

              If no monitor entries specify payload varbinds, then the setting of this directive is irrelevant.

       linkUpDownNotifications yes
              will configure the Event MIB tables to monitor the ifTable for network interfaces being taken up or down, and triggering a linkUp or linkDown notification as appropriate.

              This is exactly equivalent to the configuration:

                     notificationEvent  linkUpTrap    linkUp   ifIndex ifAdminStatus ifOperStatus
                     notificationEvent  linkDownTrap  linkDown ifIndex ifAdminStatus ifOperStatus

                     monitor  -r 60 -e linkUpTrap   "Generate linkUp" ifOperStatus != 2
                     monitor  -r 60 -e linkDownTrap "Generate linkDown" ifOperStatus == 2

       defaultMonitors yes
              will configure the Event MIB tables to monitor the various UCD-SNMP-MIB tables for problems (as indicated by the appropriate xxErrFlag column objects).

              This is exactly equivalent to the configuration:

                     monitor   -o prNames -o prErrMessage "process table" prErrorFlag != 0
                     monitor   -o memErrorName -o memSwapErrorMsg "memory" memSwapError != 0
                     monitor   -o extNames -o extOutput "extTable" extResult != 0
                     monitor   -o dskPath -o dskErrorMsg "dskTable" dskErrorFlag != 0
                     monitor   -o laNames -o laErrMessage  "laTable" laErrorFlag != 0
                     monitor   -o fileName -o fileErrorMsg  "fileTable" fileErrorFlag != 0

       In both these latter cases, the snmpd.conf must also contain a iquerySecName directive, together with a corresponding createUser entry and suitable access control configuration.

   DisMan Schedule MIB
       The  DisMan working group also produced a mechanism for scheduling particular actions (a specified SET assignment) at given times.  This requires that the agent was built with support for the dis‐
       man/schedule module (which is included as part of the default build configuration for the most recent distribution).

       There are three ways of specifying the scheduled action:

       repeat FREQUENCY OID = VALUE
              configures a SET assignment of the (integer) VALUE to the MIB instance OID, to be run every FREQUENCY seconds, where FREQUENCY is in seconds or optionally suffixed by one  of  s  (for  sec‐
              onds), m (for minutes), h (for hours), d (for days), or w (for weeks).

       cron MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH WEEKDAY  OID = VALUE
              configures  a  SET assignment of the (integer) VALUE to the MIB instance OID, to be run at the times specified by the fields MINUTE to WEEKDAY.  These follow the same pattern as the equiva‐
              lent crontab(5) fields.

              Note:  These fields should be specified as a (comma-separated) list of numeric values.  Named values for the MONTH and WEEKDAY fields are not supported, and  neither  are  value  ranges.  A
                     wildcard match can be specified as '*'.

              The DAY field can also accept negative values, to indicate days counting backwards from the end of the month.

       at MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH WEEKDAY  OID = VALUE
              configures  a  one-shot SET assignment, to be run at the first matching time as specified by the fields MINUTE to WEEKDAY.  The interpretation of these fields is exactly the same as for the
              cron directive.

   Data Delivery via Notfiications
       Note: this functionality is only available if the deliver/deliverByNotify mib module was complied in to the agent

       In some situations it may be advantageous to deliver SNMP data over SNMP Notifications (TRAPs and INFORMs) rather than the typical process of having the manager issue requests for  the  data  (via
       GETs  and  GETNEXTs).   Reasons  for doing this are numerous, but frequently corner cases.  The most common reason for wanting this behaviour might be to monitor devices that reside behind NATs or
       Firewalls that prevent incoming SNMP traffic.

       It should be noted that although most management software is capable of logging notifications, very little (if any) management software will updated their "knowledge database" based  on  the  con‐
       tents of SNMP notifications.  IE, it won't (for example) update the interface traffic counter history that is used to produce graphs.  Most larger network management packages have a separate data‐
       base  for storing data received via SNMP requests (GETs and GETNEXTs) vs those received from notifications.  Researching the capabilities of your management station software is required before as‐
       suming this functionality will solve your data delivery requirements.

       Notifications generated via this mechanism will be sent to the standard set of configured notification targets.  See the "Notification Handling" section of this document for further information.

       deliverByNotify [-p] [-m] [-s MAXSIZE] FREQUENCY OID
              This directive tells the SNMP agent to self-walk the OID, collect all the data and send it out every FREQUENCY seconds, where FREQUENCY is in seconds or optionally suffixed by one of s (for
              seconds), m (for minutes), h (for hours), d (for days), or w (for weeks).  By default scalars are included in the notification that specify the how often the notification will be sent  (un‐
              less  the  -p  option  is  specified) and which message number of how many messages a particular notification is (unless -m is specified).  To break the notifications into manageable packet
              sizes, use the -s flag to specify the approximate maximum number of bytes that a notification message should be limited to.  If more than MAXSIZE of bytes is needed then multiple  notifica‐
              tions  will  be  sent to deliver the data.  Note that the calculations for ensuring the maximum size is met are approximations and thus it can be absolutely guaranteed they'll be under that
              size, so leave a padding buffer if it is critical that you avoid fragmentation.  A value of -1 indicates force everything into a single message no matter how big it is.

              Example usage: the following will deliver the contents of the ifTable once an hour and the contents of the system group once every 2 hours:

              deliverByNotify 3600 ifTable
              deliverByNotify 7200 system

       deliverByNotifyMaxPacketSize SIZEINBYTES
              Sets the default notification size limit (see the -s flag above).

       deliverByNotifyOid OID

       deliverByNotifyFrequencyOid OID

       deliverByNotifyMessageNumberOid OID

       deliverByNotifyMaxMessageNumberOid OID
              These set the data OID that the notification will be sent under, the scalar OID, the message number OID, and the maximum message number OID.  These default to objects in the  NET-SNMP-PERI‐
              ODIC-NOTIFY-MIB.

EXTENDING AGENT FUNCTIONALITY
       One  of  the  first  distinguishing features of the original UCD suite was the ability to extend the functionality of the agent - not just by recompiling with code for new MIB modules, but also by
       configuring the running agent to report additional information. There are a number of techniques to support this, including:

       •      running external commands (exec, extend, pass)

       •      loading new code dynamically (embedded perl, dlmod)

       •      communicating with other agents (proxy, SMUX, AgentX)

   Arbitrary Extension Commands
       The earliest extension mechanism was the ability to run arbitrary commands or shell scripts. Such commands do not need to be aware of SNMP operations, or conform to any particular behaviour -  the
       MIB structures are designed to accommodate any form of command output.  Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was built with support for the ucd-snmp/extensible and/or agent/extend modules
       (which are both included as part of the default build configuration).

       exec [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS

       sh [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS
              invoke the named PROG with arguments of ARGS.  By default the exit status and first line of output from the command will be reported via the extTable, discarding any additional output.

              Note:  Entries  in this table appear in the order they are read from the configuration file.  This means that adding new exec (or sh) directives and restarting the agent, may affect the in‐
                     dexing of other entries.

              The PROG argument for exec directives must be a full path to a real binary, as it is executed via the exec() system call.  To invoke a shell script, use the sh directive instead.

              If MIBOID is specified, then the results will be rooted at this point in the OID tree, returning the exit statement as MIBOID.100.0 and the entire command output in a pseudo-table based  at
              MIBNUM.101 - with one 'row' for each line of output.

              Note:  The  layout of this "relocatable" form of exec (or sh) output does not strictly form a valid MIB structure.  This mechanism is being deprecated - please see the extend directive (de‐
                     scribed below) instead.

              The agent does not cache the exit status or output of the executed program.

       execfix NAME PROG ARGS
              registers a command that can be invoked on demand - typically to respond to or fix errors with the corresponding exec or sh entry.  When the extErrFix instance for a given  NAMEd  entry  is
              set to the integer value of 1, this command will be called.

              Note:  This  directive  can only be used in combination with a corresponding exec or sh directive, which must be defined first.  Attempting to define an unaccompanied execfix directive will
                     fail.

       exec and sh extensions can only be configured via the snmpd.conf file.  They cannot be set up via SNMP SET requests.

       extend [-cacheTime TIME] [-execType TYPE] [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS
              works in a similar manner to the exec directive, but with a number of improvements.  The MIB tables (nsExtendConfigTable etc) are indexed by the NAME token, so are unaffected by  the  order
              in  which  entries  are  read from the configuration files.  There are two result tables - one (nsExtendOutput1Table) containing the exit status, the first line and full output (as a single
              string) for each extend entry, and the other (nsExtendOutput2Table) containing the complete output as a series of separate lines.

              If -cacheTime is specified, then its argument is used as the cache timeout (in whole seconds) for this extend entry. This mechanism provides a non-volatile way to specify the cache timeout.

              If -execType is specified and has a value of sh, then this extend entry will be run in a shell. Otherwise it will be run in the default exec fashion. This mechanism provides a  non-volatile
              way to specify the exec type.

              If  MIBOID is specified, then the configuration and result tables will be rooted at this point in the OID tree, but are otherwise structured in exactly the same way. This means that several
              separate extend directives can specify the same MIBOID root, without conflicting.

              The exit status and output is cached for each entry individually, and can be cleared (and the caching behaviour configured) using the nsCacheTable.

       extendfix NAME PROG ARGS
              registers a command that can be invoked on demand, by setting the appropriate nsExtendRunType instance to the value run-command(3).  Unlike the equivalent execfix, this directive  does  not
              need to be paired with a corresponding extend entry, and can appear on its own.

   MIB-Specific Extension Commands
       The first group of extension directives invoke arbitrary commands, and rely on the MIB structure (and management applications) having the flexibility to accommodate and interpret the output.  This
       is  a convenient way to make information available quickly and simply, but is of no use when implementing specific MIB objects, where the extension must conform to the structure of the MIB (rather
       than vice versa).  The remaining extension mechanisms are all concerned with such MIB-specific situations - starting with "pass-through" scripts.  Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was
       built with support for the ucd-snmp/pass and ucd-snmp/pass_persist modules (which are both included as part of the default build configuration).

       pass [-p priority] MIBOID PROG
              will pass control of the subtree rooted at MIBOID to the specified PROG command.  GET and GETNEXT requests for OIDs within this tree will trigger this command, called as:

                     PROG -g OID

                     PROG -n OID

              respectively, where OID is the requested OID.  The PROG command should return the response varbind as three separate lines printed to stdout - the first line should be the OID  of  the  re‐
              turned  value,  the second should be its TYPE (one of the text strings integer, gauge, counter, timeticks, ipaddress, objectid, octet, or string ), and the third should be the value itself.
              (Note: octets are sent as ASCII, space-separated hex strings, e.g. "00 3f dd 00 c6 be".)

              If the command cannot return an appropriate varbind - e.g the specified OID did not correspond to a valid instance for a GET request, or there were no following instances for  a  GETNEXT  -
              then it should exit without producing any output.  This will result in an SNMP noSuchName error, or a noSuchInstance exception.

                     Note:  The SMIv2 type counter64 and SNMPv2 noSuchObject exception are not supported.

              A SET request will result in the command being called as:

                     PROG -s OID TYPE VALUE

              where TYPE is one of the tokens listed above, indicating the type of the value passed as the third parameter.

              If  the  assignment is successful, the PROG command should exit without producing any output. Errors should be indicated by writing one of the strings not-writable, or wrong-type to stdout,
              and the agent will generate the appropriate error response.

                     Note:  The other SNMPv2 errors are not supported.

              In either case, the command should exit once it has finished processing.  Each request (and each varbind within a single request) will trigger a separate invocation of the command.

              The default registration priority is 127.  This can be changed by supplying the optional -p flag, with lower priority registrations being used in preference to higher priority values.

       pass_persist [-p priority] MIBOID PROG
              will also pass control of the subtree rooted at MIBOID to the specified PROG command.  However this command will continue to run after the initial request has been answered,  so  subsequent
              requests can be processed without the startup overheads.

              Upon initialization, PROG will be passed the string "PING\n" on stdin, and should respond by printing "PONG\n" to stdout.

              For  GET and GETNEXT requests, PROG will be passed two lines on stdin, the command (get or getnext) and the requested OID.  It should respond by printing three lines to stdout - the OID for
              the result varbind, the TYPE and the VALUE itself - exactly as for the pass directive above.  If the command cannot return an appropriate varbind, it should print print "NONE\n"  to  stdout
              (but continue running).

              For  SET  requests, PROG will be passed three lines on stdin, the command (set) and the requested OID, followed by the type and value (both on the same line).  If the assignment is success‐
              ful, the command should print "DONE\n" to stdout.  Errors should be indicated by writing one of the strings not-writable, wrong-type, wrong-length, wrong-value or inconsistent-value to std‐
              out, and the agent will generate the appropriate error response.  In either case, the command should continue running.

              The registration priority can be changed using the optional -p flag, just as for the pass directive.

       pass and pass_persist extensions can only be configured via the snmpd.conf file.  They cannot be set up via SNMP SET requests.

   Embedded Perl Support
       Programs using the previous extension mechanisms can be written in any convenient programming language - including perl, which is a common choice for pass-through extensions in  particular.   How‐
       ever the Net-SNMP agent also includes support for embedded perl technology (similar to mod_perl for the Apache web server).  This allows the agent to interpret perl scripts directly, thus avoiding
       the overhead of spawning processes and initializing the perl system when a request is received.

       Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was built with support for the embedded perl mechanism, which is not part of the default build environment. It must be explicitly included by specify‐
       ing the '--enable-embedded-perl' option to the configure script when the package is first built.

       If enabled, the following directives will be recognised:

       disablePerl true
              will turn off embedded perl support entirely (e.g. if there are problems with the perl installation).

       perlInitFile FILE
              loads  the specified initialisation file (if present) immediately before the first perl directive is parsed.  If not explicitly specified, the agent will look for the default initialisation
              file /usr/share/snmp/snmp_perl.pl.

              The default initialisation file creates an instance of a NetSNMP::agent object - a variable $agent which can be used to register perl-based MIB handler routines.

       perl EXPRESSION
              evaluates the given expression.  This would typically register a handler routine to be called when a section of the OID tree was requested:
                     perl use Data::Dumper;
                     perl sub myroutine  { print "got called: ",Dumper(@_),"\n"; }
                     perl $agent->register('mylink', '.1.3.6.1.8765', \&myroutine);

              This expression could also source an external file:
                     perl 'do /path/to/file.pl';

              or perform any other perl-based processing that might be required.

   Dynamically Loadable Modules
       Most of the MIBs supported by the Net-SNMP agent are implemented as C code modules, which were compiled and linked into the agent libraries when the suite was  first  built.   Such  implementation
       modules  can also be compiled independently and loaded into the running agent once it has started.  Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was built with support for the ucd-snmp/dlmod mod‐
       ule (which is included as part of the default build configuration).

       dlmod NAME PATH
              will load the shared object module from the file PATH (an absolute filename), and call the initialisation routine init_NAME.

              Note:  If the specified PATH is not a fully qualified filename, it will be interpreted relative to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/snmp/dlmod, and .so will be appended to the filename.

       This functionality can also be configured using SNMP SET requests to the UCD-DLMOD-MIB.

   Proxy Support
       Another mechanism for extending the functionality of the agent is to pass selected requests (or selected varbinds) to another SNMP agent, which can be running on the same host (presumably  listen‐
       ing  on  a  different port), or on a remote system.  This can be viewed either as the main agent delegating requests to the remote one, or acting as a proxy for it.  Use of this mechanism requires
       that the agent was built with support for the ucd-snmp/proxy module (which is included as part of the default build configuration).

       proxy [-Cn CONTEXTNAME] [SNMPCMD_ARGS] HOST OID [REMOTEOID]
              will pass any incoming requests under OID to the agent listening on the port specified by the transport address HOST.  See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8)  manual  page  for
              more information about the format of listening addresses.

              Note:  To proxy the entire MIB tree, use the OID .1.3 (not the top-level .1)

       The SNMPCMD_ARGS should provide sufficient version and administrative information to generate a valid SNMP request (see snmpcmd(1)).

       Note:  The proxied request will not use the administrative settings from the original request.

       If  a CONTEXTNAME is specified, this will register the proxy delegation within the named context in the local agent.  Defining multiple proxy directives for the same OID but different contexts can
       be used to query several remote agents through a single proxy, by specifying the appropriate SNMPv3 context in the incoming request (or using  suitable  configured  community  strings  -  see  the
       com2sec directive).

       Specifying the REMOID parameter will map the local MIB tree rooted at OID to an equivalent subtree rooted at REMOID on the remote agent.

   SMUX Sub-Agents
       The  Net-SNMP  agent  supports the SMUX protocol (RFC 1227) to communicate with SMUX-based subagents (such as gated, zebra or quagga).  Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was built with
       support for the smux module, which is not part of the default build environment, and must be explicitly included by specifying the '--with-mib-modules=smux' option to the configure script when the
       package is first built.

              Note:  This extension protocol has been officially deprecated in favour of AgentX (see below).

       smuxpeer OID PASS
              will register a subtree for SMUX-based processing, to be authenticated using the password PASS.  If a subagent (or "peer") connects to the agent and registers this subtree then requests for
              OIDs within it will be passed to that SMUX subagent for processing.

              A suitable entry for an OSPF routing daemon (such as gated, zebra or quagga) might be something like
                     smuxpeer .1.3.6.1.2.1.14 ospf_pass

       smuxsocket <IPv4-address>
              defines the IPv4 address for SMUX peers to communicate with the Net-SNMP agent.  The default is to listen on all IPv4 interfaces ("0.0.0.0"), unless the package  has  been  configured  with
              "--enable-local-smux" at build time, which causes it to only listen on 127.0.0.1 by default. SMUX uses the well-known TCP port 199.

       Note the Net-SNMP agent will only operate as a SMUX master agent. It does not support acting in a SMUX subagent role.

   AgentX Sub-Agents
       The  Net-SNMP agent supports the AgentX protocol (RFC 2741) in both master and subagent roles.  Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was built with support for the agentx module (which is
       included as part of the default build configuration), and also that this support is explicitly enabled (e.g. via the snmpd.conf file).

       There are two directives specifically relevant to running as an AgentX master agent:

       master agentx
              will enable the AgentX functionality and cause the agent to start listening for incoming AgentX registrations.  This can also be activated by specifying the  '-x'  command-line  option  (to
              specify an alternative listening socket).

       agentXPerms SOCKPERMS [DIRPERMS [USER|UID [GROUP|GID]]]
              Defines  the  permissions and ownership of the AgentX Unix Domain socket, and the parent directories of this socket.  SOCKPERMS and DIRPERMS must be octal digits (see chmod(1) ). By default
              this socket will only be accessible to subagents which have the same userid as the agent.

       There is one directive specifically relevant to running as an AgentX sub-agent:

       agentXPingInterval NUM
              will make the subagent try and reconnect every NUM seconds to the master if it ever becomes (or starts) disconnected.

       The remaining directives are relevant to both AgentX master and sub-agents:

       agentXSocket [<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>[,...]
              defines the address the master agent listens at, or the subagent should connect to.  The default is the Unix Domain socket "/var/agentx/master".  Another common  alternative  is  tcp:local‐
              host:705.  See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8) manual page for more information about the format of addresses.

              Note:  Specifying an AgentX socket does not automatically enable AgentX functionality (unlike the '-x' command-line option).

       agentXTimeout NUM
              defines  the timeout period (NUM seconds) for an AgentX request.  Default is 1 second.  NUM also be specified with a suffix of one of s (for seconds), m (for minutes), h (for hours), d (for
              days), or w (for weeks).

       agentXRetries NUM
              defines the number of retries for an AgentX request.  Default is 5 retries.

       net-snmp ships with both C and Perl APIs to develop your own AgentX subagent.

OTHER CONFIGURATION
       override [-rw] OID TYPE VALUE
              This directive allows you to override a particular OID with a different value (and possibly a different type of value).  The -rw flag will allow snmp SETs to  modify  it's  value  as  well.
              (note that if you're overriding original functionality, that functionality will be entirely lost.  Thus SETS will do nothing more than modify the internal overridden value and will not per‐
              form any of the original functionality intended to be provided by the MIB object.  It's an emulation only.)  An example:

                     override sysDescr.0 octet_str "my own sysDescr"

              That line will set the sysDescr.0 value to "my own sysDescr" as well as make it modifiable with SNMP SETs as well (which is actually illegal according to the MIB specifications).

              Note that care must be taken when using this.  For example, if you try to override a property of the 3rd interface in the ifTable with a new value and later the numbering within the ifTable
              changes it's index ordering you'll end up with problems and your modified value won't appear in the right place in the table.

              Valid  TYPEs  are:  integer, uinteger, octet_str, object_id, counter, null (for gauges, use "uinteger"; for bit strings, use "octet_str").  Note that setting an object to "null" effectively
              delete's it as being accessible.  No VALUE needs to be given if the object type is null.

              More types should be available in the future.

       If you're trying to figure out aspects of the various mib modules (possibly some that you've added yourself), the following may help you spit out some useful  debugging  information.   First  off,
       please read the snmpd manual page on the -D flag.  Then the following configuration snmpd.conf token, combined with the -D flag, can produce useful output:

       injectHandler HANDLER modulename [beforeThis]
              This  will  insert new handlers into the section of the mib tree referenced by "modulename".  If "beforeThis" is specified then the module will be injected before the named module.  This is
              useful for getting a handler into the exact right position in the chain.

              The types of handlers available for insertion are:

              stash_cache
                     Caches information returned from the lower level.  This greatly help the performance of the agent, at the cost of caching the data such that its no longer "live" for 30  seconds  (in
                     this  future, this will be configurable).  Note that this means snmpd will use more memory as well while the information is cached.  Currently this only works for handlers registered
                     using the table_iterator support, which is only a few mib tables.  To use it, you need to make sure to install it before the table_iterator point in the chain, so to do this:

                       injectHandler stash_cache NAME table_iterator

                     If you want a table to play with, try walking the nsModuleTable with and without this injected.

              debug  Prints out lots of debugging information when the -Dhelper:debug flag is passed to the snmpd application.

              read_only
                     Forces turning off write support for the given module.

              serialize
                     If a module is failing to handle multiple requests properly (using the new 5.0 module API), this will force the module to only receive one request at a time.

              bulk_to_next
                     If a module registers to handle getbulk support, but for some reason is failing to implement it properly, this module will convert all getbulk requests to getnext requests before the
                     final module receives it.

       dontLogTCPWrappersConnects
              If the snmpd was compiled with TCP Wrapper support, it logs every connection made to the agent. This setting disables the log messages for  accepted  connections.  Denied  connections  will
              still be logged.

       Figuring out module names
              To figure out which modules you can inject things into, run snmpwalk on the nsModuleTable which will give a list of all named modules registered within the agent.

NOTES
       o      The   Net-SNMP   agent   can  be  instructed  to  re-read  the  various  configuration  files,  either  via  an  snmpset  assignment  of  integer(1)  to  UCD-SNMP-MIB::versionUpdateConfig.0
              (.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.100.11.0), or by sending a kill -HUP signal to the agent process.

       o      All directives listed with a value of "yes" actually accept a range of boolean values.  These will accept any of 1, yes or true to enable the corresponding behaviour, or any  of  0,  no  or
              false to disable it.  The default in each case is for the feature to be turned off, so these directives are typically only used to enable the appropriate behaviour.
