DESCRIPTION
       Bzfs is the server for BZFlag, and it must be running to play.  It  can
       be run on any system on the network (including a player's system or one
       without graphics).  Terminating  the  server  terminates  the  game  in
       progress.

OPTIONS
       -a linear angular
                      Sets  the maximum linear and angular accelerations.  The
                      units are somewhat arbitrary so you'll have  to  experi‐
                      ment  to  find suitable values. Positive values will set
                      limits to the acceleration and lower they  are,  greater
                      is  the inertia.  Zero or negative values disable accel‐
                      eration limits.

       -adminlagannounce milliseconds
                      Announce players that lag more than milliseconds to  ad‐
                      mins.

       -admsg message Define  a message which will be broadcast to all players
                      every 15 minutes.  This  option  can  be  used  multiple
                      times to define a multiline message.

       -advertise groupname,groupname,...
                      Allows  control of who can see this server on the server
                      list.  Use: -advertise NONE to make a private server (no
                      one will see the server, but global logins can be used).
                      The default, if -advertise is not specified, is to allow
                      everyone to see the server.  Otherwise, your server will
                      only be listed to members of the groups which you  spec‐
                      ify, eg: -advertise JOE,BOB.

       -autoTeam      Automatically  assign players to teams when they connect
                      so that there are an equal  number  of  players  on  all
                      available  teams.  Players are placed on teams that have
                      the fewest players; otherwise they will be placed on the
                      weakest  team.  Weakest team is the team with the lowest
                      combined kill ratio.

       -b             When -c is supplied, this option  randomly  rotates  the
                      buildings.

       -badwords badwordfile
                      Specify a file that contains bad words that will be used
                      when either -filterCallsigns or -filterChat is enabled.

       -ban ip[,ip]...
                      Prohibits connections  from  the  listed  IP  addresses.
                      Trailing 255 bytes are treated as mask bytes.

       -banfile filename
                      Specifies  the  name of a file where bzfs will store the
                      banlist. It will load the banlist from this file when it
                      starts  (if the file exists), and write the banlist back
                      to the file when someone gets banned  or  unbanned.   If
                      this option isn't given the banlist will not be saved.

       -c             Enables the capture-the-flag style game. By default this
                      allocates one team flag per team.  This can be  modified
                      see +f team. By default, the free-for-all style is used.

       -cache worldCacheURL
                      Specifies  the  URL  for the world cache file. This is a
                      binary file that clients will attempt to download before
                      getting the world from the bzfs server.

       -cacheout filename
                      Save  the  currently specified world into a binary cache
                      file and exit.

       -conf configfilename
                      Specifies the name of a configuration file to be used to
                      set all of the bzfs options, rather than setting them on
                      the command line.

       -cr            Enables the capture-the-flag style game with random map.
                      You can optionally specify a building density by provid‐
                      ing a number (default is 5).  One team flag per team  is
                      provided,  but  more  can be added thru +f team.  By de‐
                      fault, the free-for-all style is used.

       -d             Increase debugging level. If more -d is given, more  de‐
                      bugging info is obtained.

       -density num   Specify density for buildings, i.e. the higher the inte‐
                      ger number, the more buildings you will  get.  This  ap‐
                      plies to automatically generated maps only.

       -disableBots   Disallow  clients from using the ROGER autopilot or from
                      using robots.

       +f {good | bad | teamflag-id}[{count}]
                      Forces the existence of the given  flag.   If  specified
                      multiple  times  for  the  same  flag-id, then that many
                      flags will appear.  The good argument is  equivalent  to
                      specifying +f once for each kind of good flag. Same goes
                      for the bad argument.  The team  argument  adds  a  team
                      flag  to each team, assuming that the game style is cap‐
                      ture the flag. The optional {count} parameter allows the
                      specification  of  multiple flags of the same type. Note
                      that the curly braces are required.

       -f {good | bad | flag-id}
                      Disallows random flags  of  the  given  type.   Required
                      flags  given  by  the +f option are still provided.  The
                      bad argument is equivalent to  specifying  -f  once  for
                      each  kind  of  bad  flag.   Same goes for good, but you
                      probably do not want to do that.
                      An example of running a server with 40 to 50  flags  ex‐
                      cept  genocide  would be "+s 40 -s 50 -f G".  Similarly,
                      "+f good{40} +f bad{10} -f G{40}" would give you exactly
                      40 good flags except genocide and 10 of each bad flag.

       -fb            Allow flags on box buildings.

       -filterCallsigns
                      Turn  on  the  filtering of callsigns and mottos.  Call‐
                      signs and mottos are compared against bad words provided
                      via -badwords.

       -filterChat    Turn  on  the filtering of chat messages.  Messages that
                      contain words listed via a -badwords file  are  replaced
                      with !@#$%^&* characters.

       -filterSimple  By  default,  all filtering is aggressive, matching much
                      more than what is strictly listed in  a  -badwords  file
                      for  convenience.   Providing  this option will make the
                      -filterCallsigns and -filterChat comparisons exact match
                      only.

       -g             Quit after serving one game.

       -gndtex texture-name
                      Specify the name of the ground texture.

       -groupdb file  Load groups from file

       -h             Buildings are given random heights.

       -handicap      Players  are  given  a handicap advantage based on their
                      ability in relation to the  other  players.  Handicapped
                      players  will  have faster tanks and shots. The handicap
                      is determined by the player's score in relation to other
                      players.

       -help          Shows a help page and lists all the valid flag id's.

       -helpmsg file name
                      Provide  a message accessible by /help name, which sends
                      no more than the first 50 lines of file to the player.

       -i interface   Server will listen for and respond  to  ``pings''  (sent
                      via broadcast) on the given interface.  Clients use this
                      to find active servers  on  the  network.  This  is  the
                      TCP/UDP/IP address the server will listen on.

       -j             Allows jumping.

       -jitterdrop warn-count
                      Kicks players after warn-count jitter warnings.

       -jitterwarn milliseconds
                      Send warnings to players that jitter more than millisec‐
                      onds.

       -lagannounce milliseconds
                      Announce players that lag more than milliseconds in pub‐
                      lic.

       -lagdrop warn-count
                      Kicks players after warn-count lag warnings.

       -lagwarn milliseconds
                      Send  warnings  to  players that lag more than millisec‐
                      onds.

       -loadplugin name[,options]
                      Load the specified plugin. name can either be  the  name
                      of  the  plugin,  or a path to its library file. Option‐
                      ally, you can provide any options the plugin requires.

       -masterBanURL URL
                      Specify alternate URLs for the master  ban  file  to  be
                      pulled  from.   This  argument  may be provided multiple
                      times.

       -maxidle seconds
                      Kick players that did  not  play  longer  than  seconds.
                      Pausing  players  are  not kicked. If a player uttered a
                      word recently, he will be kicked after thrice the  given
                      time.

       -mp {count | [rogue],[red],[green],[blue],[purple],[observer]}
                      Sets  the  maximum number of players, total or per team.
                      A single value sets the total number of players allowed.
                      Five  comma  separated  values  set the maximum for each
                      team.  If a count is left blank then no limit is set for
                      that  team,  except for the limit on the total number of
                      players.  Both forms may be provided.  For rabbit chase,
                      the  "rogue" value sets the total number of non-observer
                      player, and all other values must be zero.

       -mps max-score Sets a maximum score for individual players.  The  first
                      player  to  reach  this score is declared the winner and
                      the game is over.

       -ms shots      Allows up to shots simultaneous shots for  each  player.
                      This is 1 by default.

       -mts max-score Sets a maximum score for teams.  The first team to reach
                      this score is declared the winner and the game is over.

       -noMasterBanlist
                      Server will not attempt to load the master ban list from
                      the internet.

       -noradar       Disable the use of the radar.

       -noTeamKills   Players  on  the  same  team  are immune to each other's
                      shots. Rogue is excepted.

       -offa          Enables the Open-Free-for-All  style  game.  This  is  a
                      teamless  mode,  similar  to  the  classic deathmatch in
                      other games.

       -p port        Listen for game connections on port instead of  the  de‐
                      fault port.  Use -help to print the default port, or use
                      -d debug printing.

       -packetlossdrop warn-count
                      Kicks players after warn-count packetloss warnings.

       -packetlosswarn percent
                      Send warnings to players that have more more  than  per‐
                      cent loss.

       -passwd password
                      Specify  a  server administrator password for use in re‐
                      mote administration such as  /kick,  /ban,  /mute,  etc.
                      messages.

       -pidfile filename
                      Specify  a  file where the server will write its process
                      ID so it may be used for remote administration.

       -poll variable=value
                      Configure several aspects of the in-game polling system

                      banTime
                             default number of minutes player should be banned
                             (unspecified, the  default is 300)

                      vetoTime
                             max  seconds  authorized  user  has to abort poll
                             (default is 20)

                      votePercentage
                             percentage of players required to affirm  a  poll
                             (unspecified, the default is 50.1%)

                      voteRepeatTime
                             minimum  seconds required before a player may re‐
                             quest another vote (default is 300)

                      votesRequired
                             minimum number of additional  votes  required  to
                             make a vote valid (default is 2)

                      voteTime
                             maximum  amount  of  time  player has to vote, in
                             seconds (default is 60)

       -printscore    Write score to stdout whenever it changes

       -publictitle description
                      Advertise this server on the internet with the given de‐
                      scription.   By default, a server will respond to broad‐
                      cast queries, allowing clients to find  servers  running
                      on  the standard port on the local subnet.  The -public‐
                      title option causes the server to register itself with a
                      list  server,  which  clients can query to get a list of
                      bzfs servers.

       -publicaddr address[:port]
                      Advertise this server with the given address  and  port.
                      Normally a server advertises itself at the local address
                      and port.  Some servers are not accessible from the  in‐
                      ternet  at  this  address  (for example servers behind a
                      firewall using Network Address Translation).   Use  this
                      option  to specify the address and/or port that internet
                      users should use to access this server.

       -publiclist url
                      Advertise this server on the list servers listed at url.
                      Only  has  an  effect when used with -publictitle and/or
                      -publicaddr.  A built-in url is used  by  default.   The
                      BZFlag clients use the same built-in url so, by default,
                      clients will see public servers automatically.  This ar‐
                      gument  may  be  provided  multiple times to publicize a
                      server to multiple list servers.

       -publickey key Advertise this server on the list  server(s)  using  the
                      specified  key.  Only has an effect when used with -pub‐
                      lictitle and/or -publicaddr.

       -q             If specified, the server will not listen for nor respond
                      to  ``pings''.  BZFlag sends out these pings to give the
                      user a list  of  available  servers.   This  effectively
                      makes the server private, especially if the -p option is
                      also used.

       +r             Makes most shots ricochet.  Super bullets, shock  waves,
                      and guided missiles do not.

       -rabbit [score | killer | random]
                      Enables  the  rabbit-chase  style game.  By default, the
                      free-for-all style is used.  You must specify the  algo‐
                      rithm  used  to pick a new rabbit when the old one dies.
                      The score algorithm uses a  modified  wins/(wins+losses)
                      score  and  picks  the  top scoring player to be the new
                      rabbit.  The killer algorithm specifies  a  reverse  tag
                      game  where  whomever  kills  the rabbit becomes the new
                      rabbit.  The random algorithm randomly picks a new  rab‐
                      bit  without  regard  to score.  (The score algorithm is
                      the original behavior.)

       -recbuf size   Start with the recording buffer active, with the  speci‐
                      fied size (in megabytes).

       -recbufonly    Disable recording straight to files

       -recdir directory
                      Specify the directory for record and replay files.

       -replay        Start the server in replay mode.

       -reportfile filename
                      Write  messages  to  the  server admin written using the
                      /report command to this file. If neither -reportfile  or
                      -reportpipe  is  used  the  /report command will be dis‐
                      abled.

       -reportpipe command
                      Pipe messages to the server admin written using the /re‐
                      port  command to this program or shell command. See -re‐
                      portfile.

       +s num-flags   The server will have an  extra  num-flags  random  super
                      flags available at all times.  The -f option can be used
                      to restrict which types of flags  will  be  added.   Re‐
                      quired  flags given by the +f option are not included in
                      the num-flags total.

       -s num-flags   The server will have up to num-flags random super  flags
                      available at any time.  The -f option can be used to re‐
                      strict which types of flags  will  be  added.   Required
                      flags  given  by  the  +f option are not included in the
                      num-flags total.

       -sa            Antidote flags are provided for players with bad flags.

       -sb            Allow spawns on box buildings.

       -set name value
                      Set BZDB variable name to value.

       -setforced name value
                      Set BZDB variable name to value, even  if  the  variable
                      does not exist.

       -sl id num     Restrict flag id to num shots.

       -spamtime time Minimum  time  between  player  chat  messages  that are
                      alike.

       -spamwarn warnLimit
                      Number of warnings a player/spammer gets, who   violates
                      -spamtime.

       -speedtol factor
                      Override  the default speed auto kick factor. The factor
                      should not be less then 1.0. The factor is a multiplier.

       -srvmsg message
                      Define a server welcome message. This option can be used
                      multiple times to define a multiline message.

       -st time       Bad flags are automatically dropped after time seconds.

       -sw count      Bad  flags  are  automatically dropped after count wins.
                      Capturing a team flag does not count as a win.

       -synclocation  Forces all clients to use the same  location  (longitude
                      and latitude).

       -synctime      Forces  all  clients  to  use the same time of day.  The
                      current time is determined by the server's clock.   This
                      disables the + and - keys on the clients.

       -t             Adds teleporters to the game.

       -tftimeout time-limit
                      If  the  last player in a team leaves while someone else
                      is carrying the team flag, the team flag will not  reset
                      until  it  is captured, or until the player drops it and
                      it is left alone for some time.  This  option  specifies
                      the number of seconds that the flag should be left alone
                      before it is reset. The default value is 30.

       -time {time-limit | ending-time}
                      Sets a time limit on the game to time-limit  or  ending-
                      time.  The game will be stopped time-limit seconds after
                      the first player connects, or at ending-time,  whichever
                      is  given.  The  ending-time should be given in hh:mm:ss
                      format, but does not need minute and  second  arguments.
                      If only hour is given, it must end in ':'. Each unspeci‐
                      fied argument is set to 0.

       -timemanual    When using -time, the  countdown  will  start  when  the
                      first  player joins. With -timemanual, the countdown has
                      to be started manually  using  the  /countdown  command.
                      This is useful for matches.

       -tk            Changes the default behavior where a player dies when he
                      kills a teammate.  When using this option, he will  just
                      get a -1 score penalty for the kill but not be killed in
                      game.

       -tkannounce    Announce teamkills to the admin channel.

       -tkkr percent  Kicks players whose team killing to normal kill ratio is
                      greater than percent [1-100]. A start up grace period is
                      given to players.

       -ts [micros]   Include timestamp information in DEBUG output  —  useful
                      for  logging.  If micros is specified, microseconds will
                      be added to the timestamp.

       -UPnP          If enabled during build, bzfs try  to  communicate  with
                      the  Gateway to set Port Forwarding and to supply infor‐
                      mation not specified with -i (local interface) and -pub‐
                      licaddr

       -userdb file   Load group associations from file

       -vars file     Loads  values for game configurable variables from file.
                      Entries are one per  line  in  the  form:  set  variable
                      value. For a list of variables that are configurable, in
                      the BZFlag client, send a message with /set as the text.

       -version       Prints the version number of the executable.

       -world world-file
                      Reads a specific BZFlag .bzw world layout file  for  the
                      game map.

       -worldsize world-size
                      Changes the size for random maps

   Notes
       The  server  uses nearly zero CPU time when nobody is playing, and even
       during a game the server uses very little CPU, so it's not a burden  on
       the  system  to  leave one running and it won't interfere with a player
       using the same system (except on Windows 95, which really sucks at mul‐
       titasking).   The  server  will continue to run until terminated.  If a
       game is in progress when the server goes  down,  all  players  will  be
       kicked  off  and  the game will be aborted without warning.  The server
       resets itself when all players have quit.  All players must quit to re‐
       set the server when a game is over (because of a score or time limit).

       The following game styles are recommended starting points.

              -c [-b]        Basic capture-the-flag game.  It teaches teamwork
                             and dogfighting skills.

              -s -t          Free-for-all  with  superflags  and  teleporters.
                             Teaches  players  how to use superflags and tele‐
                             porters for maximum effect.  You may want to  al‐
                             low  players  to  drop bad flags with any of -sa,
                             -st, and -sw.

       Notice that the maximum number of shots for these styles is one.   Hav‐
       ing low shot counts can greatly increase general playability and learn‐
       ing speed.  However, this is not always true of  every  game  style  or
       game  world,  and a skilled player will learn to deal with a variety of
       shot counts.  Single shot games have  additional  disadvantage  in  WAN
       games  where  lag/jitter can cause unfair advantage.  Single shot, non-
       Jump games will teach valuable lessons in dodging, however, and are ex‐
       cellent starting points for the beginner.

   Networking
       Communication  between  the  server  and clients (i.e. between bzfs and
       bzflag) during a game is via TCP and UDP.  Use the -help option to  get
       the  server's  default  port.  If there's a firewall between the server
       and client, the firewall must accept connections  from  the  client  to
       this port and forward them to the server.

       Clients  can  search for servers by sending broadcast UDP packets.  But
       they must be on the same local area network for this to work.   Clients
       can  also  find  servers advertised using -publictitle by querying list
       servers.

       Game information is relayed through the server. Some communication  be‐
       tween  clients,  such  as position and orientation information, is nor‐
       mally sent via UDP packets.  Other data, like flag grab and  kill  mes‐
       sages, are sent to the server via TCP. The server then turns around and
       broadcasts these packets  to all players. Since being in a game implies
       connection  to  the  server, all players are guaranteed to get all mes‐
       sages sent via TCP.  But the UDP packets may be  discarded.   If  other
       players  can see your tank in the game but it never appears to move and
       shots go through it, chances are high that your UDP connection  is  not
       working.

   Worlds
       BZFlag worlds come in two varieties, randomly generated ones, and human
       designed ones. By default, bzfs uses randomly  generated  world  unless
       you  specify  the -world command line or configuration file option. The
       world file specified by the -world option is a  text  based  file  that
       contains  a  list of world objects. This file can be created using pro‐
       grams found on github, or can be hand edited.  See  the  bzw(5)  manual
       page for more details.

GENERAL SERVER COMMANDS
       /clientquery [callsign]
              Retrieve client version info from all users, or just CALLSIGN if
              given. Example:
              /clientquery MrApathyCream
              MrApathyCream: Version: BZFlag 1.11.6-20040729-gnu-linux-SDL

       /date, /time
              Responds with the current server local time. /date and /time are exactly the same. Example:
              Tuesday September 08 06:45:54 2004

       /flaghistory
              Lists what flags players have grabbed in the past. Example:
              MrApathyCream: (<-) (->) (O) (CB) (M) (B) (JM) (WA)
              Gerbol: (L) (GM) (L) (GM) (CL) (ST) (GM) (L)
              captain_macgyver: (SB) (SW)

       /idlestats
              Displays the idle time in seconds for each player. A player is idle when
              he is dead and has not respawned yet. Example:
              MrApathyCream: 0s
              Gerbol: 80s
              captain_macgyver: 13s

       /lagstats
              Lists network delays, jitter and number of lost resp. out of order packets by player. Example:
              MrApathyCream 335 +- 10ms
              Gerbol 210 +- 3ms
              captain_macgyver 155 +- 0ms  12% lost/ooo

       /me action

              This command displays an "action" that is conveyed to another player.  It allows
              for a little more expressivity in the game.  For example: "/me is hunting wabbits"
              turns into a message like "TimRiker is hunting wabbits" that gets displayed
              differently to other players.

       /msg "callsign" message

              This command allows a player to send a message to another player.  Similar to using
              the "," and "." message keys in the game and then selecting your recipient, this
              will send some message to particular player.  The quotes are optional.

       /part [message]
              Leave the server with a goodbye message (similar to IRC's /part)
              /part Gotta go! bye everyone!

       /password password
              Attempt to gain administrator status Example:
              /password supersecretpassword
              You are now an administrator!

       /poll {{ban | kick} callsign | vote {yes | no} | veto}
              Interact and make requests of the bzflag voting system via the /poll command.
              The ban and kick subcommands request a vote to respectively ban or kick some
              player.  The playername is expected as the next argument.  The vote and veto
              commands behave identical to the /vote and /veto command counterparts,
              expecting the same arguments in following.  By default, you must be registered
              to request or vote on a poll, and an admin to veto.

       /quit [message]
              Quit the game with a goodbye message (similar to IRC's /quit)
              /quit Gotta go! bye everyone!

       /report message
              Write a message to the server administrator. Example:
              /report I like this map!

       /uptime
              Prints server's current running time in days, hours, mins and secs.

       /vote {yes | no}
              If there is a poll active, this command will place a vote in favor or in
              opposition to the poll.  Multiple languages are supported as a vote argument
              in addition to "yes" and "no".  By default, you must be registered to vote on
              a poll.

SERVER ADMINISTRATIVE COMMANDS

       /ban {ip | ipList | #slot | "Player Name" | playerName} duration reason

              Ban players using the specified IPs for certain length  of  time
              from using this server.  <duration> can be:
                  'short' or 'default' for the default ban time
                  'forever' or 'max' for infinite bans
                  a time in the format <weeks>W<days>D<hours>H<minutes>M
                  just a number of minutes

              Examples:
              /ban 35.23.43.66 2 cheating
              bans player with specific ip for 2 minutes
              /ban 35.23.*.*,47.23.17.* 0 Cheaters
              bans all ips in this range forever
              /ban 36.37.2.8 2h30m "ShootMe" was abusing players
              bans specific ip for 2.5 hours with given reason
              /ban #5 60m Rejoining
              bans player using slot 5 for 60 minutes with given reason
              /ban "Tanker" max cheating
              bans the player Tanker forever because cheating

              Note: Slots numbers are only displayed in admins clients.
              Duration and reason are required.

       /banlist
              List all of the IPs currently banned from this server. Example:
              /banlist
              IP Ban List
              ------------
              35.23.43.66 (2 minutes) banned by Tankmaster
                  reason: Cheaters
              47.23.17.* banned by Tankslave

       /checkip ip
              Check whether the IP is banned and print the corresponding rule. This does not
              cover hostbans. Example:
              /checkip 35.23.43.66
              35.23.43.66 is banned:
              35.23.43.66 banned by Tankmaster
                  reason: Cheaters

       /countdown [seconds]
              Starts the countdown sequence for a timed game.  The countdown
              sequence length can optionally be specified in seconds.  Examples:
              /countdown
              /countdown 3

       /flag reset {all|unused|team|FlagId}
              Repositions flags. If unused is specified, flags carried
              by tanks are not affected. Using the team option only
              resets team flags, whereas specifying a flag id (such as GM) only
              repositions flags of this type. If noteam is specified,
              team flags will not be reset. Examples:
              /flag reset unused noteam
              /flag reset G

       /flag show
              Shows all flags with information. Example:
              0: p:-1 r:1 g:1 1:V s:1 p:159.1x43.2x0.0
              1: p:2 r:1 g:1 1:SW s:1 p:209.1x143.2x10.0
              2: p:-1 r:1 g:3 1:L s:1 p:-29.1x301.2x0.0

       /flag up
              Removes all flags from the game

       /gameover
              Ends the current game

       /handicap
              Shows the handicap boost percentage for every player

       /hostban hostpattern duration reason
              Ban players using the specified hostnames for a certain length of time from using this server.
              Example:
              /hostban *.foo.com 2 cheating
              bans all players from foo.com for 2 minutes

              Change the maximum allowed jitter time. Example:
              /jitterwarn 50

       /jitterdrop [count]
              Change the number of jitter warnings given before a player is kicked. Example:
              /jitterdrop 3

       /kick {"Player Name" | playerName | #slot} reason
              Kick a player off the server. Example:
              /kick Gerbol
              You were kicked off the server by MrApathyCream

              /kick #1 Team killing
              Kick the player using slot 1 because Team Killing

              Note: Slots numbers are only displayed in admins clients.
              A reason is required

       /kill {"Player Name" | playerName | #slot} [reason]
              Kill a player just like when shooting. Example:
              /kill Gerbol
              kill the player named Gerbol

              /kill #4 teamkilling
              Kill the player using slot 4 because teamkilling

       /lagwarn [time]
              Change the maximum allowed lag time. Example:

              Allows a server admin to remove the ability for a player to communicate with
              other players. Once muted the player may only talk to admins on the server.
              This command removes the TALK permission that is enabled by default for all
              players. (disabling TALK by default would let you run a "silent" server)

       /packetlosswarn [time]
              Change the maximum allowed packetloss. Example:
              /packetloss 1

              Start recording directly to a file

       /record list
              List all files in the recordings directory

       /record rate seconds
              Set the time between game state updates stored in the recording. This will affect
              the granularity of the 'skips' you can do while replaying a file. It will also
              make the recording files bigger if it is set to a faster update rate.

       /record save filename [seconds]
              Save the recording buffer into a file. If seconds is specified, then only save
              that many previous seconds into the file.

       /record size megabytes
              Set the size of the recording memory buffer

       /record start
              Start recording into the memory buffer

       /record stats
              Display the statistics for the current recording (file or buffered)

       /record stop
              Stop recording into the memory buffer

       /replay list
              List all files in the recordings directory

       /replay load {filename | #index}
              Load the specified recording file by name, or by index
              (same indices as produced by the 'replay list' command)

       /replay loop
              Start looping the recording. This will oftentimes require that all players connected
              to the server rejoin  (to reload the map, etc...)

       /replay play
              Start playing the recording. This will oftentimes require that all players connected
              to the server rejoin  (to reload the map, etc...)

       /replay skip [{+ | -} seconds]
              If seconds is specified, then skip that amount of time in the recording.
              Otherwise, skip forwards until there is activity.

       /replay stats
              Show the current replay status (filename, position, etc...)

       /say message
              Generate a public message sent by the server. Example:
              /say This is a servermessage

       /sendhelp {"Player name" | playerName | #slot} help page
              Send the specified help page to a user
              /sendhelp register "Foo"
              Send the the help page 'register' to the player Foo

       /shutdownserver
              Stop serving BZFlag on this server

       /superkill
              Kick all players off the server

       /unmute {#slot | callsign}
              Allows a server admin to restore the TALK permission to a previously muted
              player.

       /veto  If there is a poll active, this will cancel the poll.  By default, you must be
              an admin to veto a poll.

       /viewreports
              View the server's report file.

USER MANAGEMENT
       Generally,  you  start with empty files for the user and password data‐
       bases.  These are maintained by  the  server,  and  modifiable  through
       server commands.  Users in turn belong to groups.  Groups are generally
       customized to perhaps allow administrative control to trusted users.

       There are both local and global groups, i.e. groups that are  available
       across the entire BZFlag network.  In setting up a server, you may want
       to specify global groups that will allow already well known and trusted
       users  to police your server and help maintain control against cheaters
       and abuse.

       The server will automatically create three groups: EVERYONE,  VERIFIED,
       and   LOCAL.ADMIN.   EVERYONE   has   ACTIONMESSAGE,  ADMINMESSAGESEND,
       CLIENTQUERY, DATE, FLAGHISTORY,  IDLESTATS,  LAGSTATS,  PRIVATEMESSAGE,
       SHOWMOTTO,  SPAWN  and TALK by default. VERIFIED has LISTPLUGINS, POLL,
       POLLKICK, POLLBAN, POLLKICK, POLLSET, POLLFLAGRESET, REPORT  and  VOTE.
       The  LOCAL.ADMIN group has almost every permission possible (similar to
       granting admin powers via /password).

       Once the server is running, users can register their callsigns and  ad‐
       mins  can  set  their group memberships. Users can use any command that
       their permissions allow. Every user, registered or not, is part of  the
       EVERYONE  group.  When a user identifies, they become part of the VERI‐
       FIED group.

       In addition, there  are  global  groups  available  that  persist  net‐
       work-wide.   Users  that register their callsigns on the BZFlag website
       at https://forums.bzflag.org/ have the ability to globally authenticate
       by  providing  a  password from within the client.  When they authenti‐
       cate, bzfs will ask the list server if they belong to any of the groups
       listed in your group database file that are not prefixed with "LOCAL.".
       If they are a member of a group in question, then they are granted  the
       permissions you specify for that group.

       A  group  database  file  is  set  up to contain the specific local and
       global groups you care to have on your server in  addition  to  default
       groups  and exactly which permissions are granted by each.  These files
       are laid out with one line per group, using the following format:

       GROUP_NAME: [*Group] [ +| -| !]perm1 [ +| -| !]perm2 ... permN

       *Group: inherit permissions from existing group "Group"

       +perm: add perm to this group

       -perm: remove perm from this group

       !perm: forbid perm for this group. makes perm inaccessible whether it's
       granted from another group or not

       If  no  operator is given with a permission it is handled like +perm. A
       group line for a previously existing group adds to already granted per‐
       missions.  That  way  you  can spread a group's definition over several
       lines:

       GROUP_NAME: +perm1 +perm2
       GROUP_NAME: +perm3 +perm4 -perm5

       Group names cannot have spaces, quotes, or other special characters  in
       them.  This would be a sample line defining a "cop" group:

       COPS: +KICK +SHORTBAN +BANLIST

       Now  a  group  USERADMIN with all permissions granted to COPS plus some
       additional could look like this:

       USERADMIN: *COPS +BAN +UNBAN

       Probably you want to define  customized  permissions  for  the  default
       group "VERIFIED" instead of those automatically assigned by the server:

       VERIFIED: -ALL +perm1 +perm2 ...

       Or you want to disable the /poll command entirely?

       EVERYONE: !POLL

       To  distinguish  between  a group that is local and one that is global,
       use the "LOCAL." prefix as part of the group name, e.g.:

       LOCAL.OPERATOR: BANLIST

       The available permissions are as follows:

       ACTIONMESSAGE       /me
       ADMINMESSAGERECEIVE player receives messages sent to admin channel
       ADMINMESSAGESEND    player may send messages on the admin channel
