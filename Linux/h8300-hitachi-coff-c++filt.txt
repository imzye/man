NAME
       c++filt - Demangle C++ and Java symbols.

SYNOPSIS
       c++filt [-_⎪--strip-underscores]
               [-j⎪--java]
               [-n⎪--no-strip-underscores]
               [-p⎪--no-params]
               [-s format⎪--format=format]
               [--help]  [--version]  [symbol...]

DESCRIPTION
       The C++ and Java languages provides function overloading, which means that you can write many functions with the same name (providing each takes parameters of different types).  All C++ and Java func‐
       tion names are encoded into a low-level assembly label (this process is known as mangling). The c++filt [1] program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles)  low-level  names  into  user-level
       names so that the linker can keep these overloaded functions from clashing.

       Every  alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores, dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential label.  If the label decodes into a C++ name, the C++ name replaces the low-
       level name in the output.

       You can use c++filt to decipher individual symbols:

               c++filt <symbol>

       If no symbol arguments are given, c++filt reads symbol names from the standard input and writes the demangled names to the standard output.  All results are printed on the standard output.

OPTIONS
       -_
       --strip-underscores
           On some systems, both the C and C++ compilers put an underscore in front of every name.  For example, the C name "foo" gets the low-level name "_foo".  This option removes the initial  underscore.
           Whether c++filt removes the underscore by default is target dependent.

       -j
       --java
           Prints demangled names using Java syntax.  The default is to use C++ syntax.

       -n
       --no-strip-underscores
           Do not remove the initial underscore.

       -p
       --no-params
           When demangling the name of a function, do not display the types of the function's parameters.

       -s format
       --format=format
           c++filt can decode various methods of mangling, used by different compilers.  The argument to this option selects which method it uses:

           "auto"
               Automatic selection based on executable (the default method)

           "gnu"
               the one used by the GNU C++ compiler (g++)

           "lucid"
               the one used by the Lucid compiler (lcc)

           "arm"
               the one specified by the C++ Annotated Reference Manual

           "hp"
               the one used by the HP compiler (aCC)

           "edg"
               the one used by the EDG compiler

           "gnu-v3"
               the one used by the GNU C++ compiler (g++) with the V3 ABI.

           "java"
               the one used by the GNU Java compiler (gcj)

           "gnat"
               the one used by the GNU Ada compiler (GNAT).

       --help
           Print a summary of the options to c++filt and exit.

       --version
           Print the version number of c++filt and exit.

       1.  MS-DOS does not allow "+" characters in file names, so on MS-DOS this program is named CXXFILT.
