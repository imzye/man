NAME
       ufdbguardd - a URL filter for the Squid web proxy

SYNOPSIS
       ufdbguardd [ufdbguardd-options]

DESCRIPTION
       ufdbguardd is a URL filter for the Squid web proxy.  Squid does not use the term URL filter but the term URL rewriter.

       ufdbguardd is normally not called from the command line but from a system initialisation script.

       There exists an extensive Reference Manual for ufdbGuard with sections for installation and configuration.
