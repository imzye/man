DESCRIPTION
       Program:        nxtrim Version:        v0.4.3 Contact:        joconnell@illumina.com

   Required arguments:
       -1 [ --r1 ] arg
              read 1 in fastq format (gzip allowed)

       -2 [ --r2 ] arg
              read 2 in fastq format (gzip allowed)

   Allowed options:
       -O [ --output-prefix ] arg
              output prefix

       --justmp
              just creates a the mp/unknown libraries (reads with adapter at the start will be completely N masked)

       --stdout
              print trimmed reads to stdout (equivalent to justmp)

       --stdout-mp
              print only known MP reads to stdout (good for scaffolding)

       --stdout-un
              print only unknown reads to stdout

       --rf   leave mate pair reads in RF orientation [by default are flipped into FR]

       --preserve-mp
              preserve MPs even when the corresponding PE has longer reads

       --ignorePF
              ignore chastity/purity filters in read headers

       --separate
              output paired reads in separate files (prefix_R1/prefix_r2). Default is interleaved.

       -a, --aggressive
              more aggressive adapter search (see docs/adapter.md)

       -s, --similarity arg (=0.85)
              The minimum similarity between strings to be considered a match (Hamming distance divided by string length)

       -v, --minoverlap arg (=12)
              The minimum overlap to be considered for matching

       -l, --minlength arg
              (=21)      The minimum read length to output (smaller reads will be filtered)
