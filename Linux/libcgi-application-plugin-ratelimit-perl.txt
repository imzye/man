NAME
       CGI::Application::Plugin::RateLimit - limits runmode call rate per user

SYNOPSIS
         use CGI::Application::Plugin::RateLimit;

           ...

           # call this in your setup routine to set

           $rate_limit->dbh($dbh);

           # set the table name to use for storing hits, the default is
           # 'rate_limit_hits'
           $rate_limit->table('rate_limit_hits');

           # keep people from calling 'send' more often than 5 times in 10
           # minutes and 'list' more often than once every 5 seconds.
           $rate_limit->protected_modes(send => {timeframe => '10m',
                                                 max_hits  => 5
                                                },

                                                           max_hits  => 2

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides protection against a user calling a runmode too frequently.  A typical use-case might be a contact form that sends email.  You'd like to allow your users to send you messages,
       but thousands of messages from a single user would be a problem.

       This module works by maintaining a database of hits to protected runmodes.  It then checks this database to determine if a new hit should be allowed based on past activity by the user.  The user's
       identity is, by default, tied to login (via REMOTE_USER) or IP address (via REMOTE_IP) if login info is not available.  You may provide your own identity function via the identity_callback()
       method.

       To use this module you must create a table in your database with the following schema (using MySQL-syntax, although other DBs may work as well with minor alterations):

         CREATE TABLE rate_limit_hits (
            user_id   VARCHAR(255)      NOT NULL,
            action    VARCHAR(255)      NOT NULL,
            timestamp UNSIGNED INTEGER  NOT NULL,
            INDEX (user_id, action, timestamp)
         );

       You may feel free to vary the storage-type and size of user_id and action to match your usage.  For example, if your identity_callback() always returns an integer you could make user_id an integer
       column.

       This table should be periodically cleared of old data.  Anything older than the maximum timeframe being used can be safely deleted.

       IMPORTANT NOTE: The protection offered by this module is not perfect.  Identifying a user on the internet is very hard and a sophisticated attacker can work around these checks, by switching IPs
       or automating login creation.

INTERFACE
       The object returned from calling "$self->rate_limit" on your CGI::App object supports the following method calls:

   dbh
          $rate_limit->dbh($dbh);

       Call this to set the database handle the object should use.  Must be set in setup().

   table
          $rate_limit->table('some_table_name');

       Call this to determine the table to be used to store and lookup hits.  The default is 'rate_limit_hits' if not set.  See the DESCRIPTION section for the required table schema.

   protected_modes
           $rate_limit->protected_modes(send => {timeframe => '10m',
                                                 max_hits  => 5
                                                },
                                        list => {timeframe => '5s',
                                                 max_hits  => 1
                                                });

       Takes a list of key-value pairs describing the modes to protect.  Keys are names of run-modes.  Values are hashes with the following keys:

         timeframe - the timeframe to be considered for violations.  Values
         must be numbers followed by either 's' for seconds, 'm' for minutes
         or 'h' for hours.

         max_hits - how many hits to allow in the specified timeframe before
         triggering a violation.

   protected_actions
           $rate_limit->protected_actions(failed_login => {timeframe => '10s',
                                                           max_hits  => 2
                                                          });

       Specifies non-run-mode actions to protect.  These are arbitrary keys you can use with record_hit() and check_violation().  Takes the same data-structure as protected_modes().

   violation_mode
         $rate_limit->violation_mode('too_fast_buddy');

       Call to set a run-mode to call when a violation is triggered.  Either this or violation_callback must be set.

   violation_callback
           $rate_limit->violation_callback(sub { ... });

       Callback to call when a violation is detected.  Should either throw an exception or return the run-mode to run.  Called with the CGI::App object as its sole parameter.

   identity_callback
           $rate_limit->identity_callback(sub { ... });

       Call this to provide a customized mechanism for determining the identity of the user.  The default is:

         sub { $ENV{REMOTE_USER} || $ENV{REMOTE_IP} }

       You might consider adding in session-ID or a hook to your authentication system if it doesn't use REMOTE_USER.  Whatever you write should return a single scalar which is expected to be unique to
       each user.

   record_hit
         $rate_limit->record_hit(action => 'failed_login');

       Record a hit for an arbitrary action.  This is not needed for run-mode protection.  Takes the action name as an argument, which must match an action registered with protected_actions().

   check_violation
         return $self->slow_down_buddy
           if( $rate_limit->check_violation(action => 'failed_login') );

       Checks for a violation of a protected action.  This is not needed for run-mode protection.  Takes the action name as an argument, which must match an action registered with protected_actions().

       Returns 1 if a violation took place, 0 otherwise.

   revoke_hit
         $rate_limit->revoke_hit();

       Revokes the last hit for this user.  You might use this to prevent validation errors from counting against a user, for example.

   violated_mode
         $mode = $rate_limit->violated_mode;

       Returns the mode for the last violation, or undef if an action caused the violation.

   violated_action
         $mode = $rate_limit->violated_action;

       Returns the action for the last violation, or undef if an action caused the violation.

   violated_limits
         $limits = $rate_limit->violated_limits;

       Returns the hash-ref passed to protected_actions() or protected_modes() for the violated mode/action.
