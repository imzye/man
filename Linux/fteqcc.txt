NAME
       fteqcc - FTE QuakeC compiler

SYNOPSIS
       fteqcc [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the fteqcc command.

       fteqcc is a program that compiles QuakeC sourcecode to binaray game data of Quake1 or QuakeWorld based games.

OPTIONS
       --help Show summary of options.

       -Fautoproto
              enable automatic prototyping

       -Fwasm dump all assembler code to qc.asm

       -Kkeyword, -Kno-keyword
              turn  language  keywords  on  or  off.  Keywords available to toggle are: asm, break, case, class, const, continue, default, entity, enum, enumflags, extern, float, for, goto, int, integer,
              noref, nosave, shared, state, string, struct, switch, thinktime, typedef, union, var and vector.

       -O0, -O1, -O2, -O3,
              use optimisation level between 0 and 3. With 0, no optimisation takes place, other values include more or less of the options in the section OPTIMISATION.

       -src directory
              Specify a directory to look for source files (progs.src) in.

       -Wall  show all warnings

FORMAT
       fteqcc supports several output formats.

       -Tstandard, -Tq1, -Tquakec
              This is the default setting and generates code compatible with original Quake1.

       -Thexen2, -Th2
              Outputs Hexen2 compatible code.

       -Tkkqwsv, -Tkk7, -Tbigprogs, -Tversion7, -Tkkqwsv
              Generates KK Version 7 compatible progs

       -Tfte  Generates code specific to FTE Quake.

OPTIMISATION
       The following options may be used to fine-tune optimisation. Some of them are activated automatically.

       -Oassignments
              c = a*b is performed in one operation rather than two, and can cause older decompilers to fail.

       -Oshortenifs
              if (!a) was traditionally compiled in two statements. This optimisation does it in one, but can cause some decompilers to get confused.

       -Ononvec_parms
              In the origional qcc, function parameters were specified as a vector store even for floats. This fixes that.

       -Oconstant_names
              strips out the names of constants from your progs, resulting in smaller files. It makes decompilers leave out names or fabricate numerical ones.

       -Oconstant_name_strings
              strips out the names of string constants from your progs. This can break addons, so don't use it in those cases.

       -Odupconstdefs
              merge definitions of constants which are the same value. Pay extra attention to assignment to constant warnings.

       -Onouplicatestrings
              compact the string table that is stored in the progs. It will be considerably smaller with this.

       -Olocals
              Strips out local names and definitions. This makes it REALLY hard to decompile

       -Ofunction_names
              This strips out the names of functions which are never called. Doesn't make much of an impact though.

       -Ofilenames
              This strips out the filenames of the progs. This can confuse the really old decompilers, but is nothing to the more recent ones.

       -Ounreferenced
              Removes the entries of unreferenced variables. Doesn't make a difference in well maintained code.

       -Ooverlaptemps
              Optimises the pr_globals count by overlapping temporaries. In QC, every multiplication, division or operation in general produces a temporary variable. This  optimisation  prevents  excess,
              and in the case of Hexen2's gamecode, reduces the count by 50k. This is the most important optimisation, ever.

       -Oconstantarithmatic
              5*6 actually emits an operation into the progs. This prevents that happening, effectivly making the compiler see 30

       -Oprecache_file
              Strip out stuff wasted used in function calls and strings to the precache_file builtin (which is actually a stub in quake).

       -Oreturn_only
              Functions ending in a return statement do not need a done statement at the end of the function. This can confuse some decompilers, making functions appear larger than they were.

       -Ocompound_jumps
              This optimisation plays an effect mostly with nested if/else statements, instead of jumping to an unconditional jump statement, it'll jump to the final destination instead. This will bewil‐
              der decompilers.

       -Ostrip_functions
              Strips out the 'defs' of functions that were only ever called directly. This does not affect saved games.

       -Olocals_marshalling
              Store  all  locals  in  one  section of the pr_globals. Vastly reducing it. This effectivly does the job of overlaptemps. It's been noticed as buggy by a few, however, and the curcumstances
              where it causes problems are not yet known.

       -Ovectorcals
              Where a function is called with just a vector, this causes the function call to store three floats instead of one vector. This can save a good number of pr_globals where those vectors  con‐
              tain many duplicate coordinates but do not match entirly.
