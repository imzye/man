       cvsaskpass [ generic-options ] prompt

DESCRIPTION
       This utility displays a dialog box prompting the user for the password to a CVS repository, then writes the password to standard output and exits.  You should not need to run this program directly
       - it is designed for the internal use of cvsservice(1).

              user@host's password:

       This will allow the dialog box to display the details of the CVS repository to the user.

       This utility is part of the CVS service provided with Cervisia, which in turn is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.

OPTIONS
       For a full summary of options, run cvsaskpass --help.

RETURN VALUE
       If a password was succefully obtained, 0 is returned.  If no prompt was supplied on the command-line or if the dialog was cancelled, 1 is returned.
