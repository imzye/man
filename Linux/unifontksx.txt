NAME
       unifontksx - Extract Hangul syllables that comprise KS X 1001:1992

SYNOPSIS
       unifontksx < input-font.hex > output-font.hex

DESCRIPTION
       unifontksx reads a Unifont-format .hex font file from STDIN and writes a Unifont .hex file containing a subset to STDOUT.  The subset that is output only contains the 2,350 syllables that comprise Ko‐
       rean Standard KS X 1001:1992.  These are extracted from the Unicode Hangul Syllables block, U+AC00..U+D7A3.  This lets a font designer focus on those syllables that are most common  in  modern  Hangul
       usage during font development.

FILES
       *.bdf font files
