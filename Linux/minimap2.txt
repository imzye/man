NAME
       minimap2 - mapping and alignment between collections of DNA sequences

SYNOPSIS
       * Indexing the target sequences (optional):
           minimap2 [-x preset] -d target.mmi target.fa
           minimap2 [-H] [-k kmer] [-w miniWinSize] [-I batchSize] -d target.mmi target.fa

       * Long-read alignment with CIGAR:
           minimap2 -a [-x preset] target.mmi query.fa > output.sam
           minimap2 -c [-H] [-k kmer] [-w miniWinSize] [...]  target.fa query.fa > output.paf

       * Long-read overlap without CIGAR:
           minimap2 -x ava-ont [-t nThreads] target.fa query.fa > output.paf

DESCRIPTION
       Minimap2  is  a  fast  sequence  mapping and alignment program that can find overlaps between long noisy reads, or map long reads or their assemblies to a reference genome optionally with detailed
       alignment (i.e. CIGAR). At present, it works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to ~100 megabases in length at a error rate ~15%. Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format.

OPTIONS
   Indexing options
       -k INT    Minimizer k-mer length [15]

       -w INT    Minimizer window size [10]. A minimizer is the smallest k-mer in a window of w consecutive k-mers.

       -j INT    Syncmer submer size [10]. Option -j and -w will override each: if -w is applied after -j, -j will have no effect, and vice versa.

       -H        Use homopolymer-compressed (HPC) minimizers. An HPC sequence is constructed by contracting homopolymer runs to a single base. An HPC minimizer is a minimizer on the HPC sequence.

       -I NUM    Load at most NUM target bases into RAM for indexing [8G]. If there are more than NUM bases in target.fa, minimap2 needs to read query.fa multiple times to map it against  each  batch  of
                 target sequences. This would create a multi-part index.  NUM may be ending with k/K/m/M/g/G. NB: mapping quality is incorrect given a multi-part index. See also option --split-prefix.

       --idx-no-seq
                 Don't  store  target  sequences  in  the index. It saves disk space and memory but the index generated with this option will not work with -a or -c.  When base-level alignment is not re‐
                 quested, this option is automatically applied.

       -d FILE   Save the minimizer index of target.fa to FILE [no dump]. Minimap2 indexing is fast. It can index the human genome in a couple of minutes. If even shorter startup  time  is  desired,  use
                 this option to save the index. Indexing options are fixed in the index file. When an index file is provided as the target sequences, options -H, -k, -w, -I will be effectively overridden
                 by the options stored in the index file.

       --alt FILE
                 List of ALT contigs [null]

       --alt-drop FLOAT
                 Drop ALT hits by FLOAT fraction when ranking and computing mapping quality [0.15]

   Mapping options
       -f FLOAT|INT1[,INT2]
                 If  fraction,  ignore  top  FLOAT  fraction of most frequent minimizers [0.0002]. If integer, ignore minimizers occuring more than INT1 times.  INT2 is only effective in the --sr or -xsr
                 mode, which sets the threshold for a second round of seeding.

       -U INT1[,INT2]
                 Lower and upper bounds of k-mer occurrences [10,1000000]. The final k-mer occurrence threshold is max{INT1, min{INT2, -f}}.  This option prevents excessively small or large -f  estimated
                 from the input reference. Available since r1034 and deprecating --min-occ-floor in earlier versions of minimap2.

       --q-occ-frac FLOAT
                 Discard a query minimizer if its occurrence is higher than FLOAT fraction of query minimizers and than the reference occurrence threshold [0.01]. Set 0 to disable. Available since r1105.

       -e INT    Sample a high-frequency minimizer every INT basepairs [500].

       -g NUM    Stop chain enlongation if there are no minimizers within NUM-bp [10k].

       -r NUM1[,NUM2]
                 Bandwidth for chaining and base alignment [500,20k].  NUM1 is used for initial chaining and alignment extension; NUM2 for RMQ-based re-chaining and closing gaps in alignments.

       -n INT    Discard chains consisting of <INT number of minimizers [3]

       -m INT    Discard chains with chaining score <INT [40]. Chaining score equals the approximate number of matching bases minus a concave gap penalty. It is computed with dynamic programming.

       -D        If query sequence name/length are identical to the target name/length, ignore diagonal anchors. This option also reduces DP-based extension along the diagonal.

       -P        Retain all chains and don't attempt to set primary chains. Options -p and -N have no effect when this option is in use.

       --dual=yes|no
                 If no, skip query-target pairs wherein the query name is lexicographically greater than the target name [yes]

       -X        Equivalent to '-DP --dual=no --no-long-join'.  Primarily used for all-vs-all read overlapping.

       -p FLOAT  Minimal  secondary-to-primary  score  ratio  to  output secondary mappings [0.8].  Between two chains overlaping over half of the shorter chain (controlled by -M), the chain with a lower
                 score is secondary to the chain with a higher score.  If the ratio of the scores is below FLOAT, the secondary chain will not be outputted or extended with DP alignment later.  This  op‐
                 tion has no effect when -X is applied.

       -N INT    Output at most INT secondary alignments [5]. This option has no effect when -X is applied.

       -G NUM    Maximum gap on the reference (effective with -xsplice/--splice).  This option also changes the chaining and alignment band width to NUM.  Increasing this option slows down spliced align‐
                 ment. [200k]

       -F NUM    Maximum fragment length (aka insert size; effective with -xsr/--frag=yes) [800]

       -M FLOAT  Mark as secondary a chain that overlaps with a better chain by FLOAT or more of the shorter chain [0.5]

       --rmq=no|yes
                 Use the minigraph chaining algorithm [no]. The minigraph algorithm is better for aligning contigs through long INDELs.

       --hard-mask-level
                 Honor option -M and disable a heurstic to save unmapped subsequences and disables --mask-len.

       --mask-len NUM
                 Keep an alignment if dropping it leaves an unaligned region on query longer than INT [inf]. Effective without --hard-mask-level.

       --max-chain-skip INT
                 A heuristics that stops chaining early [25]. Minimap2 uses dynamic programming for chaining. The time complexity is quadratic in the number of seeds. This option makes minimap2 exits the
                 inner loop if it repeatedly sees seeds already on chains. Set INT to a large number to switch off this heurstics.

       --max-chain-iter INT
                 Check up to INT partial chains during chaining [5000]. This is a heuristic to avoid quadratic time complexity in the worst case.

       --chain-gap-scale FLOAT
                 Scale of gap cost during chaining [1.0]

       --no-long-join
                 Disable the long gap patching heuristic. When this option is applied, the maximum alignment gap is mostly controlled by -r.

       --splice  Enable the splice alignment mode.

       --sr      Enable short-read alignment heuristics. In the short-read mode, minimap2 applies a second round of chaining with a higher minimizer occurrence threshold if no good chain is found. In ad‐
                 dition, minimap2 attempts to patch gaps between seeds with ungapped alignment.

       --split-prefix STR
                 Prefix to create temporary files. Typically used for a multi-part index.

       --frag=no|yes
                 Whether to enable the fragment mode [no]

       --for-only
                 Only  map  to  the forward strand of the reference sequences. For paired-end reads in the forward-reverse orientation, the first read is mapped to forward strand of the reference and the
                 second read to the reverse stand.

       --rev-only
                 Only map to the reverse complement strand of the reference sequences.

       --heap-sort=no|yes
                 If yes, sort anchors with heap merge, instead of radix sort. Heap merge is faster for short reads, but slower for long reads. [no]

       --no-pairing
                 Treat two reads in a pair as independent reads. The mate related fields in SAM are still properly populated.

       --no-hash-name
                 Produce the same alignment for identical sequences regardless of their sequence names.

   Alignment options
       -A INT    Matching score [2]

       -B INT    Mismatching penalty [4]

       -b INT    Mismatching penalty for transitions [same as -B].

       -O INT1[,INT2]
                 Gap open penalty [4,24]. If INT2 is not specified, it is set to INT1.

       -E INT1[,INT2]
                 Gap extension penalty [2,1]. A gap of length k costs min{O1+k*E1,O2+k*E2}.  In the splice mode, the second gap penalties are not used.

       -J INT    Splice model [1]. 0 for the original minimap2 splice model that always penalizes non-GT-AG splicing; 1 for the miniprot model that considers non-GT-AG. Option -C has no effect  with  the
                 default -J1.  -J0.

       -C INT    Cost for a non-canonical GT-AG splicing (effective with --splice -J0) [0].

       -z INT1[,INT2]
                 Truncate  an  alignment  if  the running alignment score drops too quickly along the diagonal of the DP matrix (diagonal X-drop, or Z-drop) [400,200]. If the drop of score is above INT2,
                 minimap2 will reverse complement the query in the related region and align again to test small inversions. Minimap2 truncates alignment if there is an inversion or the drop of  score  is
                 greater  than  INT1.   Decrease  INT2  to find small inversions at the cost of performance and false positives.  Increase INT1 to improves the contiguity of alignment at the cost of poor
                 alignment in the middle.

       -s INT    Minimal peak DP alignment score to output [40]. The peak score is computed from the final CIGAR. It is the score of the max scoring segment in the alignment and may be different from the
                 total alignment score.

       -u CHAR   How to find canonical splicing sites GT-AG - f: transcript strand; b: both strands; n: no attempt to match GT-AG [n]

       --end-bonus INT
                 Score bonus when alignment extends to the end of the query sequence [0].

       --score-N INT
                 Score of a mismatch involving ambiguous bases [1].

       --splice-flank=yes|no
                 Assume the next base to a GT donor site tends to be A/G (91% in human and 92% in mouse) and the preceding base to a AG acceptor tends to be C/T [no].  This trend is  evolutionarily  con‐
                 servative,  all  the  way  to  S.  cerevisiae  (PMID:18688272).  Specifying  this option generally leads to higher junction accuracy by several percents, so it is applied by default with
                 --splice.  However, the SIRV control does not honor this trend (only ~60%). This option reduces accuracy. If you are benchmarking minimap2 on SIRV data, please add  --splice-flank=no  to
                 the command line.

       --junc-bed FILE
                 Gene  annotations  in  the BED12 format (aka 12-column BED), or intron positions in 5-column BED. With this option, minimap2 prefers splicing in annotations.  BED12 file can be converted
                 from GTF/GFF3 with `paftools.js gff2bed anno.gtf' [].

       --junc-bonus INT
                 Score bonus for a splice donor or acceptor found in annotation (effective with --junc-bed) [9].

       --end-seed-pen INT
                 Drop a terminal anchor if s<log(g)+INT, where s is the local alignment score around the anchor and g the length of the terminal gap in the chain.  This  option  is  only  effective  with
                 --splice.  It helps to avoid tiny terminal exons. [6]

       --no-end-flt
                 Don't filter seeds towards the ends of chains before performing base-level alignment.

       --cap-sw-mem NUM
                 Skip alignment if the DP matrix size is above NUM.  Set 0 to disable [100m].

       --cap-kalloc NUM
                 Free thread-local kalloc memory reservoir if after the alignment the size of the reservoir above NUM.  Set 0 to disable [0].

   Input/output options
       -a        Generate CIGAR and output alignments in the SAM format. Minimap2 outputs in PAF by default.

       -o FILE   Output alignments to FILE [stdout].

       -Q        Ignore base quality in the input file.

       -L        Write  CIGAR  with  >65535 operators at the CG tag. Older tools are unable to convert alignments with >65535 CIGAR ops to BAM. This option makes minimap2 SAM compatible with older tools.
                 Newer tools recognizes this tag and reconstruct the real CIGAR in memory.

       -R STR    SAM read group line in a format like @RG\tID:foo\tSM:bar [].

       -y        Copy input FASTA/Q comments to output.

       -c        Generate CIGAR. In PAF, the CIGAR is written to the `cg' custom tag.

       --cs[=STR]
                 Output the cs tag.  STR can be either short or long.  If no STR is given, short is assumed. [none]

       --MD      Output the MD tag (see the SAM spec).

       --eqx     Output =/X CIGAR operators for sequence match/mismatch.

       -Y        In SAM output, use soft clipping for supplementary alignments.

       --secondary-seq
                 In SAM output, show query sequences for secondary alignments.

       --seed INT
                 Integer seed for randomizing equally best hits. Minimap2 hashes INT and read name when choosing between equally best hits. [11]

       -t INT    Number of threads [3]. Minimap2 uses at most three threads when indexing target sequences, and uses up to INT+1 threads when mapping (the extra thread is for  I/O,  which  is  frequently
                 idle and takes little CPU time).

       -2        Use  two I/O threads during mapping. By default, minimap2 uses one I/O thread.  When I/O is slow (e.g. piping to gzip, or reading from a slow pipe), the I/O thread may become the bottle‐
                 neck. Apply this option to use one thread for input and another thread for output, at the cost of increased peak RAM.

       -K NUM    Number of bases loaded into memory to process in a mini-batch [500M].  Similar to option -I, K/M/G/k/m/g suffix is accepted. A large NUM helps load balancing in the multi-threading mode,
                 at the cost of increased memory.

       --secondary=yes|no
                 Whether to output secondary alignments [yes]

       --max-qlen NUM
                 Filter out query sequences longer than NUM.

       --paf-no-hit
                 In PAF, output unmapped queries; the strand and the reference name fields are set to `*'. Warning: some paftools.js commands may not work with such output for the moment.

       --sam-hit-only
                 In SAM, don't output unmapped reads.

       --version Print version number to stdout

   Preset options
       -x STR    Preset []. This option applies multiple options at the same time. It should be applied before other options because options applied later will overwrite the values set by -x.   Available
                 STR are:

                 map-ont   Align noisy long reads of ~10% error rate to a reference genome. This is the default mode.

                 lr:hq     Align  accurate  long  reads  (error rate <1%) to a reference genome (-k19 -w19 -U50,500 -g10k).  This was recommended by ONT developers for recent Nanopore reads produced with
                           chemistry v14 that can reach ~99% in accuracy.  It was shown to work better for accurate Nanopore reads than map-hifi.

                 map-hifi  Align PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) reads to a reference genome (-xlr:hq -A1 -B4 -O6,26 -E2,1 -s200).  It differs from lr:hq only in scoring. It has not been tested whether lr:hq
                           would work better for PacBio HiFi reads.

                 map-pb    Align older PacBio continuous long (CLR) reads to a reference genome (-Hk19).  Note that this data type is effectively deprecated by HiFi.  Unless you work on  very  old  data,
                           you probably want to use map-hifi or lr:hq.

                 map-iclr  Align Illumina Complete Long Reads (ICLR) to a reference genome (-k19 -B6 -b4 -O10,50).  This was recommended by Illumina developers.

                 asm5      Long assembly to reference mapping (-k19 -w19 -U50,500 --rmq -r1k,100k -g10k -A1 -B19 -O39,81 -E3,1 -s200 -z200 -N50).  Typically, the alignment will not extend to regions with
                           5% or higher sequence divergence. Use this preset if the average divergence is not much higher than 0.1%.

                 asm10     Long assembly to reference mapping (-k19 -w19 -U50,500 --rmq -r1k,100k -g10k -A1 -B9 -O16,41 -E2,1 -s200 -z200 -N50).  Use this if the average divergence is around 1%.

                 asm20     Long  assembly to reference mapping (-k19 -w10 -U50,500 --rmq -r1k,100k -g10k -A1 -B4 -O6,26 -E2,1 -s200 -z200 -N50).  Use this if the average divergence is around several per‐
                           cent.

                 splice    Long-read spliced alignment (-k15 -w5 --splice -g2k -G200k -A1 -B2 -O2,32 -E1,0 -C9 -z200 -ub --junc-bonus=9 --cap-sw-mem=0 --splice-flank=yes).  In the splice  mode,  1)  long
                           deletions are taken as introns and represented as the `N' CIGAR operator; 2) long insertions are disabled; 3) deletion and insertion gap costs are different during chaining; 4)
                           the computation of the `ms' tag ignores introns to demote hits to pseudogenes.

                 splice:hq Spliced alignment for accurate long RNA-seq reads such as PacBio iso-seq (-xsplice -C5 -O6,24 -B4).

                 sr        Short-read  alignment  without  splicing  (-k21  -w11  --sr  --frag=yes  -A2 -B8 -O12,32 -E2,1 -b0 -r100 -p.5 -N20 -f1000,5000 -n2 -m25 -s40 -g100 -2K50m --heap-sort=yes --sec‐
                           ondary=no).

                 ava-pb    PacBio CLR all-vs-all overlap mapping (-Hk19 -Xw5 -e0 -m100).

                 ava-ont   Oxford Nanopore all-vs-all overlap mapping (-k15 -Xw5 -e0 -m100 -r2k).

   Miscellaneous options
       --no-kalloc
                 Use the libc default allocator instead of the kalloc thread-local allocator.  This debugging option is mostly used with Valgrind to detect invalid memory accesses. Minimap2  runs  slower
                 with this option, especially in the multi-threading mode.

       --print-qname
                 Print query names to stderr, mostly to see which query is crashing minimap2.

       --print-seeds
                 Print seed positions to stderr, for debugging only.

OUTPUT FORMAT
       Minimap2  outputs mapping positions in the Pairwise mApping Format (PAF) by default. PAF is a TAB-delimited text format with each line consisting of at least 12 fields as are described in the fol‐
       lowing table:

       When alignment is available, column 11 gives the total number of sequence matches, mismatches and gaps in the alignment; column 10 divided by column 11 gives  the  BLAST-like  alignment  identity.
       When alignment is unavailable, these two columns are approximate. PAF may optionally have additional fields in the SAM-like typed key-value format. Minimap2 may output the following tags:

LIMITATIONS
       * Minimap2  may produce suboptimal alignments through long low-complexity regions where seed positions may be suboptimal. This should not be a big concern because even the optimal alignment may be
         wrong in such regions.

       * Minimap2 requires SSE2 or NEON instructions to compile. It is possible to add non-SSE2/NEON support, but it would make minimap2 slower by several times.
