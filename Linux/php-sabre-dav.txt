NAME
       naturalselection - keep cache directories below a specified threshold

SYNOPSIS
       naturalselection.py [options] cacheDirectory

DESCRIPTION
       Cache directory manager. Deletes cache entries based on accesstime and free space thresholds. This utility is distributed alongside SabreDAV.

OPTIONS
       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -s     Don't actually make changes, but just simulate the behaviour

       -r RUNS, --runs=RUNS
              How many times to check before exiting. -1 is infinite, which is the default

       -n SLEEP, --interval=SLEEP
              Sleep time in seconds (default = 5)

       -l THRESHOLD, --threshold=THRESHOLD
              Threshold in bytes (default = 10737418240, which is 10GB)

       -m MIN_ERASE, --min-erase=MIN_ERASE
              Minimum  number of bytes to erase when the threshold is reached. Setting this option higher will reduce the amount of times the cache directory will need to be scanned. (the default is
              1073741824, which is 1GB.)
