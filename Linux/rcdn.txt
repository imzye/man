NAME
     rcdn — remove dotfiles as managed by rcm

SYNOPSIS
     rcdn [-hKkqVv] [-B hostname] [-d dir] [-I excl_pat] [-S excl_pat] [-s excl_pat] [-t tag] [-U excl_pat] [-u excl_pat] [-x excl_pat] [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
     This program will remove all the rc files that the rcm(7) suite knows about. This can be further controlled with the -t and -d flags.

     The files that are removed are symlinks. However, the COPY_ALWAYS setting in rcrc(5) modifies this. If a rc file is not a symlink but an ancestor directory is, that directory is removed. If a rc file is
     not a symlink but is listed in COPY_ALWAYS the file is removed.

     The rcdn program will run hooks before and after removing files, if these hooks exist. Hooks are executable programs inside the dotfiles directory, with the following names: hooks/pre-down and
     hooks/post-down.  These hooks are run each time rcdn is run and therefore must be idempotent.

     Hooks will be executed one at a time, sorted alphabetically. For instance, hooks/pre-down/animals will run before hooks/pre-down/aquariums, and hooks/pre-down/4-eyes will run before
     hooks/post-down/2-u-nothing-compares.

     -B HOSTNAME  treat host-HOSTNAME as the host-specific directory instead of computing it

     -d DIR       remove rc files from the DIR.  This can be specified multiple times.

     -h           show usage instructions.

     -I EXCL_PAT  remove rc files that match EXCL_PAT despite being excluded by the -x flag or a setting in rcrc(5).  This can be repeated with additional patterns. See lsrc(1), EXCLUDE PATTERN, for more de‐
                  tails.

     -K           skip pre- and post-hooks

     -k           run pre- and post-hooks. This is the default.

     -q           decrease verbosity

     -S EXCL_PAT  when removing dotfiles, any file that matches EXCL_PAT should be treated as a file that was symlinked, even if it is a directory. This can be repeated.

     -s EXCL_PAT  when removing dotfiles, any directory that matches EXCL_PAT should be recurred upon like normal. This is the default, and is the opposite of -S.  This can be repeated.

     -t TAG       remove dotfiles according to TAG

     -U EXCL_PAT  any rc file or directory that matches EXCL_PAT is considered to have been installed without a leading dot when removing them.  Must be specified for rc files or directories that were indeed
                  installed without a leading dot. This can be repeated. See the documentation of the -U option in lsrc(1) for more information.

     -u EXCL_PAT  any rc file or directory that matches EXCL_PAT is considered to have been installed with a leading dot when removing them.  This is the default, and is the opposite of -U.  This can be re‐
                  peated. See the documentation of the -u option in lsrc(1) for more information.

     -v           increase verbosity. This can be repeated for extra verbosity.

     -V           show the version number.

     -x EXCL_PAT  do not remove rc files that match EXCL_PAT.  This can be repeated with additional patterns. See lsrc(1), EXCLUDE PATTERN, for more details.

     files        only remove the specified file(s)
