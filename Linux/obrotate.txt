NAME
     obrotate — batch-rotate dihedral angles matching SMARTS patterns

SYNOPSIS
     obrotate 'SMARTS-pattern' filename atom1 atom2 atom3 atom4 angle

DESCRIPTION
     The obrotate program rotates the torsional (dihedral) angle of a specified bond in molecules to that defined by the user. In other words, it does the same as a user setting an angle in a molecular mod‐
     elling package, but much faster and in batch mode (i.e. across multiple molecules in a file).

     The four atom IDs required are indexes into the SMARTS pattern, which starts at atom 0 (zero). The angle supplied is in degrees. The two atoms used to set the dihedral angle <atom1> and <atom4> do not
     need to be connected to the atoms of the bond <atom2> and <atom3> in any way.

     The order of the atoms matters -- the portion of the molecule attached to <atom1> and <atom2> remain fixed, but the portion bonded to <atom3> and & <atom4> moves.

EXAMPLES
     Let's say that you want to define the conformation of a large number of molecules with a pyridyl scaffold and substituted with an aliphatic chain at the 3-position, for example for docking or 3D-QSAR
     purposes.

     To set the value of the first dihedral angle to 90 degrees:
           obrotate 'c1ccncc1CCC' pyridines.sdf 5 6 7 8 90

     Here 6 and 7 define the bond to rotate in the SMARTS patter, i.e., c1-C and atoms 5 and 8 define the particular dihedral angle to rotate.

     Since the atoms to define the dihedral do not need to be directly connected, the nitrogen in the pyridine can be used:
           obrotate 'c1ccncc1CCC' pyridines.sdf 4 6 7 8 90

     Keep the pyridyl ring fixed and moves the aliphatic chain:
           obrotate 'c1ccncc1CCC' pyridines.sdf 5 6 7 8 90

     Keep the aliphatic chain fixed and move the pyridyl ring:
           obrotate 'c1ccncc1CCC' pyridines.sdf 8 7 6 5 90
