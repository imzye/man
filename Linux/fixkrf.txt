NAME
       fixkrf - Fixes DNSSEC-Tools keyrec files whose encryption key files
       have been moved

SYNOPSIS
         fixkrf [options] <keyrec-file> <dir 1> ... <dir N>

DESCRIPTION
       fixkrf checks a specified keyrec file to ensure that the referenced
       encryption key files exist where listed.  If a key is not where the
       keyrec specifies it should be, then fixkrf will search the given
       directories for those keys and adjust the keyrec to match reality.  If
       a key of a particular filename is found in multiple places, a warning
       will be printed and the keyrec file will not be changed for that key.

OPTIONS
       -list
           Display output about missing keys, but don't fix the keyrec file.

       -verbose
           Display output about found keys as well as missing keys.

       -Version
           Display version information for fixkrf and DNSSEC-Tools.

       -help
           Display a usage message.
