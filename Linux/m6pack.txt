M6PACK(8)                Linux System Managers Manual                M6PACK(8)

NAME
       m6pack - Attach multiples 6PACK interfaces

SYNOPSIS
       m6pack [-l] [-s speed] [-x n_ptmx] [-v] ttyinterface pty ..

DESCRIPTION
       m6pack  allows  multiple  6PACK TNCs sharing the same serial port to be
       used with the Linux AX.25 kernel software. The  AX.25  softare  has  no
       support  for  multiple TNCs sharing the same serial line. The different
       ports are addressed by encoding the port number in the control byte  of
       every  6pack  frame.   m6pack  watches  a serial port, and routes 6pack
       frames to/from the pseudo ttys. The other side of the pseudo  ttys  are
       then attached with spattach as normal.

       Statistics about the operation of m6pack may be obtained by sending the
       SIGUSR1 signal to the running program. On reception of  such  a  signal
       m6pack  will print a set of statistics to the system log if logging has
       been enabled.

       Although mention is made of using pseudo ttys as  the  last  arguments,
       these  devices  may  be normal serial ports. However m6pack provides no
       way in which to set their speed, the speed must  therefore  be  set  by
       some other method.

OPTIONS
       -l        Enables system logging, the default is off.

       -s speed  Set the speed of the serial port.

       -v        Display the version.

       -x number This  option  is for Unix98 PTYs. It allocates "number" ptys;
                 their names are written to stdout. When -x is used,  the  pty
                 arguments are optional.
