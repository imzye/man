       qstat [-a|-i|-r|-e|--xml] [-l] [-n [-1]] [-s] [-G|-M] [-R] [-u user_list] [job_identifier... |  destination...]

       qstat -Q [-f [-1]][-W site_specific] [-l] [destination...]

       qstat -q [-G|-M] [-l] [destination...]

       qstat -B [-f [-1]][-W site_specific] [-l] [server_name...]

       qstat -t

DESCRIPTION
       The qstat command is used to request the status of jobs, queues, or a batch server.  The requested status is written to standard out.

       When requesting job status, synopsis format 1 or 2, qstat will output information about each job_identifier or all jobs at each destination.  Jobs for which the user does not have status privilege are
       not displayed.

       When requesting queue or server status, synopsis format 3 through 5, qstat will output information about each destination.

OPTIONS
       -f        Specifies that a full status display be written to standard out.

       -a        "All" jobs are displayed in the alternative format, see the Standard Output section.  If the operand is a destination id, all jobs at that destination are displayed.  If the operand is a job
                 id, information about that job is displayed.

       -e        If the operand is a job id or not specified, only jobs in executable queues are displayed.  Setting the PBS_QSTAT_EXECONLY environment variable will also enable this option.

       -i        Job  status  is  displayed  in  the  alternative format.  For a destination id operand, status for jobs at that destination which are not running are displayed.  This includes jobs which are
                 queued, held or waiting.  If an operand is a job id, status for that job is displayed regardless of its state.

       -r        If an operand is a job id, status for that job is displayed.  For a destination id operand, status for jobs at that destination which are running are displayed,  this includes jobs which are
                 suspended.

       -n        In addition to the basic information, nodes allocated to a job are listed.

       -1        In  combination with -n, the -1 option puts all of the nodes on the same line as the job ID.  In combination with -f, attributes are not folded to fit in a terminal window.  This is intended
                 to ease the parsing of the qstat output.

       -s        In addition to the basic information, any comment provided by the batch administrator or scheduler is shown.

       -G        Show size information in giga-bytes.

       -M        Show size information, disk or memory in mega-words.   A word is considered to be 8 bytes.

       -R        In addition to other information, disk reservation information is shown.  Not applicable to all systems.

       -t        Normal qstat output displays a summary of the array instead of the entire array, job for job. qstat -t expands the output to display the entire array. Note that arrays  are  now  named  with
                 brackets following the array name; for example:

                 echo sleep 20 | qsub -t 0-299 189[].pali

                 Individual jobs in the array are now also noted using square brackets instead of dashes; for example, here is part of the output of qstat -t for the preceding array:

                 189[299].napali STDIN[299] dbeer 0 Q batch

       -u        Job  status is displayed in the alternative format.  If an operand is a job id, status for that job is displayed.  For a destination id operand, status for jobs at that destination which are
                 owned by the user(s) listed in user_list are displayed.  The syntax of the user_list is:
                     user_name[@host][,user_name[@host],...]
                 Host names may be wild carded on the left end, e.g. "*.nasa.gov".  User_name without a "@host" is equivalent to "user_name@*", that is at any host.

       -Q        Specifies that the request is for queue status and that the operands are destination identifiers.

       -q        Specifies that the request is for queue status which should be shown in the alternative format.

       -B        Specifies that the request is for batch server status and that the operands are the names of servers.

       -x --xml  Specifies that the output is to be displayed in XML form.  This option is only valid with the -f option or by itself, which will also specify the -f full status display.

       -l        Specifies that the long name of the job (or the job name appended with the suffix alias) should be displayed.

OPERANDS
       If neither the -Q nor the -B option is given, the operands on the qstat command must be either job identifiers or destinations identifiers.

       If the operand is a job identifier, it must be in the following form:
            sequence_number[.server_name][@server]
       where sequence_number.server_name is the job identifier assigned at submittal time, see qsub.  If the .server_name is omitted, the name of the default server will be used.  If @server is supplied, the
       request will be for the job identifier currently at that Server.

       If the operand is a destination identifier, it is one of the following three forms:
            queue
            @server
            queue@server
       If queue is specified, the request is for status of all jobs in that queue at the default server.  If the @server form is given, the request is for status of all jobs at that server.  If a full desti‐
       nation identifier, queue@server, is given, the request is for status of all jobs in the named queue at the named server.

       If the -Q option is given, the operands are destination identifiers as specified above.  If queue is specified, the status of that queue at the default server will be given.  If queue@server is speci‐
       fied, the status of the named queue at the named server will be given.  If @server is specified, the status of all queues at the named server will be given.  If no destination is specified, the status
       of all queues at the default server will be given.

       If the -B option is given, the operand is the name of a server.

STANDARD OUTPUT
       Displaying Job Status

       If job status is being displayed in the default format and the -f option is not specified, the following items are displayed on a single line, in the specified order, separated by white space:

              -  the job identifier assigned by PBS.

              -  the job name given by the submitter.

              -  the job owner

              -  the CPU time used

              -  the job state:
                   C -     Job is completed after having run/
                   E -  Job is exiting after having run.
                   H -  Job is held.
                   Q -  job is queued, eligible to run or routed.
                   R -  job is running.
                   T -  job is being moved to new location.
                   W -  job is waiting for its execution time
                        (-a option) to be reached.
                   S -  (Unicos only) job is suspend.

              -  the queue in which the job resides

       If job status is being displayed and the -f option is specified, the output will depend on whether qstat was compiled to use a Tcl interpreter.  See the configuration section for details.  If  Tcl  is
       not being used, full display for each job consists of the header line:
           Job Id:  job identifier
       Followed by one line per job attribute of the form:
           attribute_name = value

       If any of the options -a, -i, -r, -u, -n, -s, -G or -M are provided, the alternative display format for jobs is used.  The following items are displayed on a single line, in the specified order, sepa‐
       rated by white space:

       When any of the above options or the -R option is used to request an alternative display format, a column with the requested memory for the job is displayed.  If more than one type of  memory  is  re‐
       quested  for the job, either through server or queue parameters or command line, only one value can be displayed.  The value displayed depends on the order the memory types are evaluated with the last
       type evaluated being the value displayed. The order of evaluation is dmem, mem, pmem, pvmem, vmem.

              -  the job identifier assigned by PBS.

              -  the job owner.

              -  The queue in which the job currently resides.

              -  The job name given by the submitter.

              -  The session id (if the job is running).

              -  The number of nodes requested by the job.

              -  The number of cpus or tasks requested by the job.

              -  The amount of memory requested by the job.

              -  Either the cpu time, if specified, or wall time requested by the job, (hh:mm).

              -  The job's current state.

              -  The amount of cpu time or wall time used by the job (hh:mm).
       If the -R option is provided, the line contains:

              -  the job identifier assigned by PBS.

              -  the job owner.

              -  The queue in which the job currently resides.

              -  The number of nodes requested by the job.

              -  The number of cpus or tasks requested by the job.

              -  The amount of memory requested by the job.

              -  Either the cpu time or wall time requested by the job.

              -  The job's current state.

              -  The amount of cpu time or wall time used by the job.

              -  The amount of SRFS space requested on the big file system.

              -  The amount of SRFS space requested on the fast file system.

              -  The amount of space requested on the parallel I/O file system.
       The last three fields may not contain useful information at all sites or on all systems.
       Note: Remaining walltime does not account for walltime multiplication factors.

       Displaying Queue Status

       If queue status is being displayed and the -f option was not specified, the following items are displayed on a single line, in the specified order, separated by white space:

            -      the queue name

            -      the maximum number of jobs that may be run in the queue concurrently

            -      the total number of jobs in the queue

            -      the enable or disabled status of the queue

            -      the started or stopped status of the queue

            -      for each job state, the name of the state and the number of jobs in the queue in that state.

            -      the type of queue, execution or routing.

       If queue status is being displayed and the -f option is specified, the output will depend on whether qstat was compiled to use a Tcl interpreter.  See the configuration section for details.  If Tcl is
       not being used, the full display for each queue consists of the header line:
           Queue:  queue_name
       Followed by one line per queue attribute of the form:
           attribute_name = value

       If the -q option is specified, queue information is displayed in the alternative format:  The following information is displayed on a single line:

              -  the queue name

              -  the maximum amount of memory a job in the queue may request

              -  the maximum amount of cpu time a job in the queue may request

              -  the maximum amount of wall time a job in the queue may request

              -  the maximum amount of nodes a job in the queue may request

              -  the number of jobs in the queue in the running state

              -  the number of jobs in the queue in the queued state

              -  the maximum number (limit) of jobs that may be run in the queue concurrently

              -  the state of the queue given by a pair of letters:
                 - either the letter E if the queue is Enabled or D if Disabled, and
                 - either the letter R if the queue is Running (started) or S if Stopped.

       Displaying Server Status

       If batch server status is being displayed and the -f option is not specified, the following items are displayed on a single line, in the specified order, separated by white space:

            -      the server name

            -      the maximum number of jobs that the server may run concurrently

            -      the total number of jobs currently managed by the server

            -      the status of the server

            -      for each job state, the name of the state and the number of jobs in the server in that state

       If  server  status is being displayed and the -f option is specified, the output will depend on whether qstat was compiled to use a Tcl interpreter.  See the configuration section for details.  If Tcl
       is not being used, the full display for the server consist of the header line:
           Server:  server name
       Followed by one line per server attribute of the form:
           attribute_name = value

STANDARD ERROR
       The qstat command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for each error occurrence.

CONFIGURATION
       If qstat is compiled with an option to include a Tcl interpreter, using the -f flag to get a full display causes a check to be made for a script file to use to output the requested  information.   The
       first location checked is $HOME/.qstatrc.  If this does not exist, the next location checked is administrator configured.  If one of these is found, a Tcl interpreter is started and the script file is
       passed to it along with three global variables.  The command line arguments are split into two variable named flags and operands .  The status information is passed in a variable named objects .   All
       of  these variables are Tcl lists.  The flags list contains the name of the command (usually "qstat") as its first element.  Any other elements are command line option flags with any options they use,
       presented in the order given on the command line.  They are broken up individually so that if two flags are given together on the command line, they are separated in the list.   For  example,  if  the
       user typed

       qstat -QfWbigdisplay

       the flags list would contain

       qstat -Q -f -W bigdisplay

       The operands list contains all other command line arguments following the flags.  There will always be at least one element in operands because if no operands are typed by the user, the default desti‐
       nation or server name is used.  The objects list contains all the information retrieved from the server(s) so the Tcl interpreter can run once to format the entire output.  This list has the same num‐
       ber  of  elements  as  the operands list.  Each element is another list with two elements.  The first element is a string giving the type of objects to be found in the second.  The string can take the
       values "server", "queue", "job" or "error".  The second element will be a list in which each element is a single batch status object of the type given by the string discussed above.  In  the  case  of
       "error", the list will be empty.  Each object is again a list.  The first element is the name of the object.  The second is a list of attributes.  The third element will be the object text.  All three
       of these object elements correspond with fields in the structure batch_status which is described in detail for each type of object by the man pages for pbs_statjob(3),  pbs_statque(3),  and  pbs_stat‐
       server(3).   Each  attribute in the second element list whose elements correspond with the attrl structure.  Each will be a list with two elements.  The first will be the attribute name and the second
       will be the attribute value.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qstat command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qstat command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
