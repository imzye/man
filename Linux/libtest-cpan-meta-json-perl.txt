NAME
       Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON - Validate a META.json file within a CPAN distribution.

SYNOPSIS
       There are two forms this module can be used.

       The first is a standalone test of your distribution's META.json file:

         use Test::More;
         eval "use Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON";
         plan skip_all => "Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON required for testing META.json" if $@;
         meta_json_ok();

       Note that you may provide an optional label/comment/message/etc to the function, or one will be created automatically.

       The second form allows you to test other META.json files, or specify a specific version you wish to test against:

         use Test::More test => 6;
         use Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON;

         # specify a file and specification version
         meta_spec_ok('META.json','1.3',$msg);

         # specify the specification version to validate the local META.json
         meta_spec_ok(undef,'1.3',$msg);

         # specify a file, where the specification version is deduced
         # from the file itself
         meta_spec_ok('META.json',undef,$msg);

       Note that this form requires you to specify the number of tests you will be running in your test script. Also note that each 'meta_spec_ok' is actually 2 tests under the hood.

       Also note that the version you are testing against, is the version of the META.yml specification, which forms the basis for the contents of a META.json file.

DESCRIPTION
       This module was written to ensure that a META.json file, provided with a standard distribution uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are slowly being introduced to module uploads, via
       the use of package makers and installers such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build and Module::Install.

       See CPAN::Meta for further details of the CPAN Meta Specification.

ABSTRACT
       A test module to validate a CPAN META.json file.

FUNCTIONS
       •   meta_json_ok([$msg])

           Basic META.json wrapper around meta_spec_ok.

           Returns a hash reference to the contents of the parsed META.json

       •   meta_spec_ok($file, $version [,$msg])

           Validates the named file against the given specification version. Both $file and $version can be undefined.

           Returns a hash reference to the contents of the given file, after it has been parsed.

TESTING META FILES
       There are currently 3 distributions to test META files:

         Test-CPAN-Meta
         Test-CPAN-Meta-JSON
         Test-CPAN-Meta-YAML

       All three have slightly different requirements and are intended to be used in slightly different environments.

       Test-CPAN-Meta-YAML  requires  a  YAML  parser,  and  currently  looks  for  the  YAML or YAML::Syck modules. This is the original variant of the 3 and was intended to provide a more complete YAML
       validation of a META.yml.

       Test-CPAN-Meta requires the Parse::CPAN::Meta module, which is now part of Perl Core as of perl-5.10.1. This version is intended to be used by those only wishing to rely on core  modules  to  test
       their META.yml files.

       Test-CPAN-Meta-JSON  is  the most recent addition to the family, and is specifically aimed at those distributions that use a META.json Meta file. The distribution requires the JSON module to parse
       the Meta file.

BUGS, PATCHES & FIXES
       There are no known bugs at the time of this release. However, if you spot a bug or are experiencing difficulties that are not explained within the  POD  documentation,  please  send  an  email  to
       barbie@cpan.org  or  submit  a  bug to the RT system (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Test-CPAN-Meta-JSON).  However, it would help greatly if you are able to pinpoint problems or
       even supply a patch.

       Fixes are dependent upon their severity and my availability. Should a fix not be forthcoming, please feel free to (politely) remind me.
