NAME
       diffoscope - in-depth comparison of files, archives, and directories

SYNOPSIS
       diffoscope --help
       diffoscope [OPTIONS] [--json output_diff] path1 path2
       diffoscope [OPTIONS] diff
       diffoscope [OPTIONS] < diff
        ""

DESCRIPTION
       diffoscope  will try to get to the bottom of what makes files or directories different. It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds and transform various binary formats into more human-read‐
       able form to compare them. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDF just as easily.

       It can be scripted through error codes, and a report can be produced with the detected differences. The report can be text or HTML.  When no type of report has been selected,  diffoscope  defaults
       to write a text report on the standard output.

       diffoscope was initially started by the "reproducible builds" Debian project and now being developed as part of the (wider) ???Reproducible Builds??? initiative <https://reproducible-builds.org> .
       It is meant to be able to quickly understand why two builds of the same package produce different outputs. diffoscope was previously named debbindiff.

       See  the  COMMAND-LINE  EXAMPLES  section  further  below  to  get  you  started,  as  well as more detailed explanations of all the command-line options. The same information is also available in
       /usr/share/doc/diffoscope/README.rst or similar.

       path1  First file or directory to compare.

       path2  Second file or directory to compare.

   options:
       --debug
              Display debug messages

       --pdb  Open the Python pdb debugger in case of crashes

       --status-fd FD
              Send machine-readable status to file descriptor FD

       --progress, --no-progress
              Show an approximate progress bar. Default: yes if stdin is a tty, otherwise no.

       --no-default-limits
              Disable most default output limits and diff calculation limits.

       --load-existing-diff INPUT_FILE
              Load existing diff from file. Specify "-" to read a diffoscope diff from stdin.

   output types:
       --text OUTPUT_FILE
              Write plain text output to given file (use - for stdout)

       --text-color WHEN
              When to output color diff. WHEN is one of {never, auto, always}. Default: auto, meaning yes if the output is a terminal, otherwise no.

       --output-empty
              If there was no difference, then output an empty diff for each output type that was specified. In --text output, an empty file is written.

       --html OUTPUT_FILE
              Write HTML report to given file (use - for stdout)

       --html-dir OUTPUT_DIR
              Write multi-file HTML report to given directory

       --css URL
              Link to an extra CSS for the HTML report

       --jquery URL
              URL link to jQuery, for --html and --html-dir  output.   If  this  is  a  non-existent  relative  URL,  diffoscope  will  create  a  symlink  to  a  system  installation.  (Paths  searched:
              /usr/share/javascript/jquery/jquery.js.) If not given, --html output will not use JS but --htmldir will if it can be found; give "disable" to disable JS on all outputs.

       --json OUTPUT_FILE
              Write JSON text output to given file (use - for stdout)

       --markdown OUTPUT_FILE
              Write Markdown text output to given file (use - for stdout)

       --restructured-text OUTPUT_FILE
              Write RsT text output to given file (use - for stdout)

       --difftool TOOL
              Compare differences one-by-one using the specified external command similar to git-difftool(1)

       --profile [OUTPUT_FILE]
              Write profiling info to given file (use - for stdout)

   output limits:
       --diff-context LINES
              Lines of unified diff context to show. (default: 7)

       --max-text-report-size BYTES
              Maximum bytes written in --text report. (0 to disable, default: 0)

       --max-report-size BYTES
              Maximum  bytes  of  a report in a given format, across all of its pages. Note that some formats, such as --html, may be restricted by even smaller limits such as --max-page-size. (0 to dis‐
              able, default: 41943040)

       --max-diff-block-lines LINES
              Maximum number of lines output per unified-diff block, across all pages. (0 to disable, default: 1024)

       --max-page-size BYTES
              Maximum bytes of the top-level (--html-dir) or sole (--html) page. (default: 41943040, remains in effect even with --no-default-limits)

       --max-page-diff-block-lines LINES
              Maximum number of lines output per unified-diff block on the top-level (--html-dir) or sole (--html) page, before spilling it into a child page (--html-dir) or skipping the rest of the diff
              block. (default: 128, remains in effect even with --no-default-limits)

   diff calculation:
       --new-file
              Treat absent files as empty

       --exclude GLOB_PATTERN
              Exclude files whose names (including any directory part) match GLOB_PATTERN. Use this option to ignore files based on their names.

       --exclude-command REGEX_PATTERN
              Exclude commands that match REGEX_PATTERN. For example '^readelf.*\s--debug-dump=info' and '^radare2.*' can takea long time and differences here are likely secondary differences  caused  by
              something represented elsewhere. Use this option to disable commands that use a lot of resources.

       --exclude-directory-metadata {auto,yes,no,recursive}
              Exclude  directory  metadata.  Useful  if  comparing  files  whose  filesystem-level metadata is not intended to be distributed to other systems. This is true for most distributions package
              builders, but not true for the output of commands such as `make install`. Metadata of archive members remain un-excluded except if "recursive" choice is set. Use this option to ignore  per‐
              missions,  timestamps,  xattrs  etc. Default: 'no' if comparing two directories, else 'yes'. Note that "file" metadata is actually a property of its containing directory and is not relevant
              when distributing the file across systems.

       --extended-filesystem-attributes, --no-extended-filesystem-attributes
              Check potentially-expensive filesystem extended attributes such as POSIX ACLs, lsattr(1)/chattr(1) attributes etc. (default: False)

       --diff-mask REGEX_PATTERN
              Replace/unify substrings that match regular expression REGEX_PATTERN from output strings before applying diff. For example, to filter out a version number or changed path.

       --fuzzy-threshold FUZZY_THRESHOLD
              Threshold for fuzzy-matching (0 to disable, 110 is default, 400 is high fuzziness)

       --tool-prefix-binutils PREFIX
              Prefix for binutils program names, e.g.  "aarch64-linux-gnu-" for a foreign-arch binary or "g" if you're on a non-GNU system.

       --max-diff-input-lines LINES
              Maximum number of lines fed to diff(1) (0 to disable, default: 4194304)

       --max-container-depth DEPTH
              Maximum depth to recurse into containers. (Cannot be disabled for security reasons, default: 50)

       --timeout SECONDS
              Best-effort attempt at a global timeout in seconds. If enabled, diffoscope will not recurse into any further sub-archives after X seconds of total execution  time.   (default:  no  timeout)
              [experimental]

       --max-diff-block-lines-saved LINES
              Maximum  number  of  lines saved per diff block. Most users should not need this, unless you run out of memory. This truncates diff(1) output before emitting it in a report, and affects all
              types of output, including --text and --json. (0 to disable, default: 0)

       --use-dbgsym WHEN
              When to automatically use corresponding -dbgsym packages when comparing .deb files. WHEN is one of {no, auto, yes}. Default: auto, meaning yes if two .changes or .buildinfo files are speci‐
              fied, otherwise no.

       --force-details
              Force recursing into the depths of file formats even if files have the same content, only really useful for debugging diffoscope. Default: False

   information commands:
       --help, -h
              Show this help and exit

       --version
              Show program's version number and exit

       --list-tools [DISTRO]
              Show external tools required and exit. DISTRO can be one of {arch, debian, FreeBSD, guix}. If specified, the output will list packages in that distribution that satisfy these dependencies.

       --list-debian-substvars
              List packages needed for Debian in 'substvar' format.

       --list-missing-tools [DISTRO]
              Show missing external tools and exit. DISTRO can be one of {arch, debian, FreeBSD, guix}. If specified, the output will list packages in that distribution that satisfy these dependencies.

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

COMMAND-LINE EXAMPLES
       To compare two files in-depth and produce an HTML report, run something like:

          $ diffoscope --html output.html build1.changes build2.changes

       diffoscope will exit with 0 if there's no differences and 1 if there are.

       To get all possible options, run:

          $ diffoscope --help

       If you have enough RAM, you can improve performance by running:

          $ TMPDIR=/run/shm diffoscope very-big-input-0/ very-big-input-1/

       By default this allowed to use up half of RAM; for more add something like:

          tmpfs   /run/shm    tmpfs   size=80%    0   0

       to your /etc/fstab; see man mount for details.

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
       diffoscope requires Python 3 and the following modules available on PyPI:
        <libarchive-c> ,
        <python-magic> .

       The various comparators rely on external commands being available. To get a list of them, please run:

          $ diffoscope --list-tools
