NAME
       aide.wrapper - call aide binary for Debian mechanisms

SYNOPSIS
       aide.wrapper [options]

DESCRIPTION
       aide.wrapper  calls  the  aide  binary  with --config appropriate for the mechanisms automatically used in the Debian package. To prevent damage to the database, aide.wrapper takes out a lock and will
       refuse to run a second aide process when there is still another one running.

       If no --config option explicitly given, aide.wrapper will set --config to /var/lib/aide/aide.conf.autogenerated, invoke update-aide.conf, and use aide --config-check to verify correctness of the  con‐
       figuration prior to invoking the aide binary.

OPTIONS
       aide.wrapper hands down all options down to the aide binary verbatim and only detects the presence of --config to determine whether to call update-aide.conf or not.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Normally,  the  exit status is 0 if no errors occurred. An exit status below 100 is the exit status from the actual aide binary, as documented in its own man page. The wrapper's own exit codes are de‐
       fined as:

       250 problem finding the aide binary

       251 cannot obtain lock file

       255 there was an error running aide --config-check

FILES
       /etc/aide/aide.conf
              AIDE configuration file

       /usr/bin/aide
              AIDE binary

       /var/run/aide.lock
              Lock file

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable DBAGE can be used to control the aide run respective to the age of the aide databases in /var/lib/aide/aide.db(.new). This is useful when the local  admin  manually  recreates
       the  database, preventing an automated aide run (for example from cron) from clobbering the database the local admin might be inspecting at the moment. If DBAGE is set to a non-zero value (for example
       from the crontab), and one of the databases is younger than DBAGE seconds, the wrapper will print a warning, terminate without running aide and return an exit status of 0. The default value  of  DBAGE
       is 0.
