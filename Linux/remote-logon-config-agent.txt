NAME
       remote-logon-config-agent - Retrieve JSON based remote logon information

SYNOPSIS
       remote-logon-config-agent [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       remote-logon-config-agent  is a tiny tool for retrieving JSON-based remote logon information from broker servers (like, e.g., X2Go Session Broker, Arctica Server) and handing that over to the DBus
       service remote-logon-service.

       The remote-logon-config-agent and the remote-logon-service both are components of Arctica Greeter, facilitating user logins into session running on remote machines.

       Here is a short example for retrieving session information from the X2Go Session Broker (make sure the broker has UCCS frontend support enabled:

         $ SERVER_ROOT=http://x2gobroker.localdomain:8080/uccs/inifile/
         $ export SERVER_ROOT
         $ echo <mypassword> | thin-client-config-agent <myuserid>
