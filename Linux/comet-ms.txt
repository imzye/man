NAME

SYNOPSIS
       comet-ms

       Running comet-ms with no arguments outputs a helping synopsis.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the comet-ms source package.

       Comet is an open source tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequence database search engine. It identifies peptides by searching MS/MS spectra against sequences present in protein sequence databases.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       The comet-ms source package is used to create the comet-ms binary program.
