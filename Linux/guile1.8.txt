NAME
       guile - a Scheme interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       guile [-q] [-ds] [--help] [--version] [--emacs] [--debug] [-l FILE] [-e FUNCTION] [] [-c EXPR] [-s SCRIPT] [--]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU  Guile  is an interpreter for the Scheme programming language.  It implements R5RS, providing additional features necessary for real-world use.  It is extremely simple to embed guile into a C pro‐
       gram, calling C from Scheme and Scheme from C.  Guile's design makes it very suitable for use as an "extension" or "glue" language, but it also works well as a stand-alone scheme development  environ‐
       ment.

       The guile executable itself provides a stand-alone interpreter for scheme programs, for either interactive use or executing scripts.

       This manpage provides only brief instruction in invoking guile from the command line.  Please consult the guile info documentation (type info guile at a command prompt) for more information.  There is
       also a tutorial (info guile-tut) available.

OPTIONS
       -l     Load scheme source code from file.

       -e     After reading script, apply FUNCTION to command-line arguments

       -ds    do -s SCRIPT at this point (note that this argument must be used in conjuction with -s)

       --help Describe command line options and exit

       --debug
              Start guile with debugging evaluator and backtraces enabled (useful for debugging guile scripts)

       --version
              Display guile version and exit.

       --emacs
              Enable emacs protocol for use from within emacs (experimental)

       --     Stop argument processing, start guile in interactive mode.

       -c     Stop argument processing, evaluate EXPR as a scheme expression.

       -s     Load Scheme source from SCRIPT-FILE and execute as a script.

ENVIRONMENT
       GUILE_LOAD_PATH
              If $GUILE_LOAD_PATH is set, its value is used to agument the path to search for scheme files when loading.  It should be a colon separated list of directories which will be prepended to the de‐
              fault %load-path.

FILES
       ~/.guile is a guile script that is executed before any other processing occurs.  For example, the following .guile activates guile's readline interface:

           (use-modules (ice-9 readline))
           (activate-readline)

SEE ALSO
       The full documentation for guile is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the info and guile programs are properly installed at your site, the command

              info guile

       should give you access to the complete manual.

       http://www.schemers.org provides a general introduction to the Scheme language.

       guile is GNU software.  Guile is originally based on Aubrey Jaffer's SCM interpreter, and is the work of many individuals.
