NAME
       htp - HTML preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       htp [options] <input file> <output file>
       htp [options] @<response file>
       htp [options] @

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the htp command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documenta‐
       tion in HTML format; see /usr/share/doc/htp.

       htp is an HTML pre-processor. It is designed to be a flexible authoring tool that can easily be integrated into the design process. htp works by processing special HTML files and producing as out‐
       put regular HTML files ready to be served up. The original HTML files are "special" because they (possibly) contain certain markup tags only recognizable to htp.
       To handle larger sets of files, htp also accepts a response file, which lists input/output filename pairs and additional response files. For more information on response files, see the HTML  docu‐
       mentation.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the HTML documentation.  These options can be used on the command-line by preceding their name with a '-' or '/' character.

       H, ?   Shows basic usage information.

       IMGXY  Width & height will be added to all image tags. This is the default setting.

       NOIMGXY
              Width & height will not be added to image tags (but not removed if already found).

       QUIET  Pre-processor only displays warnings and error messages.

       VERBOSE
              Pre-processor displays all informational, warnings, and error messages. This is the default setting.

       DEPEND Check target file's dependencies before processing. If the input file, or any of the file it may INCLUDE have changed, it will continue and build the output file. Otherwise, a simple infor‐
              mational message will be printed and no action will occur. This is the default setting.

       NODEPEND
              Dependency checking will not occur during processing.

       PRECIOUS
              Normally,  if  htp  cannot  finish processing a file, it will delete the incomplete output file to prevent using it accidentally. However, if this is not desirable, the PRECIOUS option will
              turn off this behavior.

       CONDENSE
              All HTML will be condensed, which is merely stripping it of all linefeeds. HTML does not require any carriage returns or linefeeds, so the format of the output will not be changed. However,
              file sizes will be somewhat smaller, and should load a little faster, especially over a slow link.

       NOCONDENSE
              This disables condensing the output. This is the default setting.

       DELIM  This can be set to either HTML, CURLY or SQUARE. Each setting determines how htp markups should be surrounded in the text. HTML indicates using arrow brackets ('<' and '>') just like  stan‐
              dard  HTML tags. CURLY means tags should be surrounded by curly braces ('{' and '}'). SQUARE uses square brackets ('[' and ']') to surround htp tags. Note that this only applies to the spe‐
              cial htp tags and not to the standard HTML tags, including IMG (which htp can process.) The default setting is HTML.
