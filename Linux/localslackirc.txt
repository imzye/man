NAME
       lsi-send - Send a file to a slack user or channel.

SYNOPSIS
       lsi-send [OPTIONS] DESTINATION < file
       lsi-send [OPTIONS] -F file DESTINATION

DESCRIPTION
       This command sends files to an instance of localslackirc that is running locally.
       DESTINATION indicates a channel or user to send the file to.
       When using the provided .service file and starting localslackirc with systemd, this command should be able to autodetect the location of the socket.
       In case the same user is running multiple instances, then it is possible that the path to the unix socket must be provides as a parameter.
       NOTE: the files are entirely loaded in RAM before sending.

   Options:
       -h, --help
              Show the help message and exit.

       -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
              The name to give to the filename.
              It will appear on slack.

       --control-socket CONTROL_SOCKET
              If the path to the socket cannot be auto-detected, this option must be used to indicate the path to connect to the control socket.

       -F SOURCE, --file SOURCE
              When used, instead of reading from stdin, lsi-send will read from the specified file.
              The --filename option will be ignored in this case, and the real name of the file will be used.
