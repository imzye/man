NAME
       ipmidetectd - IPMI node detection monitoring daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ipmidetectd [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       The ipmidetectd daemon regularly sends out IPMI pings to determine if nodes have functioning IPMI interfaces or not. It is primarily used to determine those nodes in the cluster that are not function‐
       ing properly, allowing IPMI commands to be executed across the cluster faster by skipping those nodes that would automatically timeout.

       The ipmidetectd daemon must be configured using the ipmidetectd configuration file. Until hosts to be pinged are configured, ipmidetectd will not function properly.

       See the ipmidetectd.conf(5) manpage for additional information.
