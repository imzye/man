NAME
       exim4-localscan-plugin-config - get information necessary to build and package exim4 plugins

SYNOPSIS

       exim4-localscan-plugin-config --localscan-abiversion

DESCRIPTION
       exim4-localscan-plugin-config is a tool that is used to determine various things needed to build plugins (shared libraries) for the Exim MTA. Currently there is one such plugin API - the
       local_scan API. In addition to local_scan plugins, this API is also available to shared libraries used with the ${dlfunc ...} expansion item.

OPTIONS
       Since exim4-localscan-plugin-config is Debian(TM)-specific, it currently takes a single mandatory option parameter, --localscan-apiversion, outputting the API/ABI version (ver). Packages
       containing local_scan plugins should depend on exim4-localscanapi-ver
