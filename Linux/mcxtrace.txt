NAME
       mcxtrace Compiler of the mcxtrace xray ray-trace simulation package

SYNOPSIS
       mcxtrace [-o file] [-I dir1 ...]  [-t] [-p] [-v] [–no-main] [–no-runtime] [–verbose] file

DESCRIPTION
       The  compiler for the mcxtrace instrument definition is invoked by typing a command of the form mcxtrace name.instr in a shell or command prompt.  This will read the beamline definition name.instr
       which is written in the mcxtrace meta-language.  The compiler will translate the instrument definition into a Monte Carlo simulation program provided in ISO-C.  The output is by default written to
       a file in the current directory with the same name as the instrument file, but with extension .c rather than .instr.  This can be overridden using the -o option  as  follows:  mcxtrace  -o  code.c
       name.instr  which  gives  the output in the file code.c.  A single dash - may be used for both input and output filename to represent standard input and standard output, respectively.  The default
       component search list is usually defined by the environment variable MCXTRACE (default is /usr/share/mcxtrace/resources).

       Often, it will be more convenient to use the front-end program mxgui or mxrun.  These front-ends will compile and run the simulations automatically.

       The usual instrument syntax is:

              DEFINE INSTRUMENT name(parameters)

              DECLARE %{
                // C_code
              %}
              INITIALIZE %{
                // C_code
              %}
              TRACE

              COMPONENT name = comp(parameters)
              WHEN (condition)
              AT (...) [RELATIVE reference
              {ROTATED {RELATIVE reference }
              EXTEND %{
                // C_code
              %}

              FINALLY %{
                // C_code
              %}
              END

OPTIONS
       -o FILE –output-file=FILE
              Place C output in file FILE.

       -I DIR –search-dir=DIR
              Append DIR to the component search list.

       -t –trace
              Enable `trace' mode for instrument display.

       -v –version
              Prints mcxtrace version.

       –no-main
              Do not create main(), for external embedding.

       –no-runtime
              Do not embed run-time libraries.

       –verbose
              Display compilation process steps.

       –source
              Embed the instrument source code in executable.
