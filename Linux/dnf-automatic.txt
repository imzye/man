NAME
       dnf-automatic - DNF Automatic

SYNOPSIS
       dnf-automatic [<config file>]

DESCRIPTION
       Alternative CLI to dnf upgrade with specific facilities to make it suitable to be executed automatically and regularly from systemd timers, cron jobs and similar.

       The  operation  of the tool is usually controlled by the configuration file or the function-specific timer units (see below). The command only accepts a single optional argument pointing to the config
       file, and some control arguments intended for use by the services that back the timer units. If no configuration file is passed from the command line, /etc/dnf/automatic.conf is used.

       The tool synchronizes package metadata as needed and then checks for updates available for the given system and then either exits, downloads the packages or downloads and  applies  the  packages.  The
       outcome of the operation is then reported by a selected mechanism, for instance via the standard output, email or MOTD messages.

       The  systemd  timer unit dnf-automatic.timer will behave as the configuration file specifies (see below) with regard to whether to download and apply updates. Some other timer units are provided which
       override the configuration file with some standard behaviours:

       · dnf-automatic-notifyonly

       · dnf-automatic-download

       · dnf-automatic-install

       Regardless of the configuration file settings, the first will only notify of available updates. The second will download, but not install them. The third will download and install them.

RUN DNF-AUTOMATIC
       You can select one that most closely fits your needs, customize /etc/dnf/automatic.conf for any specific behaviors, and enable the timer unit.

       For example: systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic-notifyonly.timer

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       The configuration file is separated into topical sections.
