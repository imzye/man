NAME
       tmpreaper.conf - defines parameters for daily run of tmpreaper

DESCRIPTION
       tmpreaper is run daily via the /etc/cron.daily/tmpreaper script. Its behaviour can be tuned via the /etc/tmpreaper.conf file. This file can contain settings entries to override the defaults in the
       cron.daily script itself.  These settings are:

       TMPREAPER_TIME
              the max. age of files before they're removed. Default:
              TMPREAPER_TIME=7d

       TMPREAPER_PROTECT_EXTRA
              extra patterns that you may want to protect. Example:
              TMPREAPER_PROTECT_EXTRA='/tmp/isdnctrl* /tmp/important*'
              Don't forget to enclose the patterns in quotes, like above.

       TMPREAPER_DIRS
              the directories to clean up.
              NEVER supply / here! That will wipe most of your system!
              Example:
              TMPREAPER_DIRS='/tmp/. /var/tmp/.'
              Again, don't forget to enclose the patterns in quotes, like above.

       TMPREAPER_DELAY
              defines the maximum (randomized) delay before starting processing.  This is passed as the --delay parameter.

       TMPREAPER_ADDITIONALOPTIONS
              defines any additional parameters you want to pass to the tmpreaper program, e.g. --all
