           Close lists of family_name family under robot_name.

       "--close_list="list[@robot]
           Close the list (changing its status to closed), remove aliases and remove subscribers from DB (a dump is created in the list directory to allow restoring the list)

       "--create_list" "--robot="robot_name "--input_file="/path/to/file.xml
