NAME
       eric7_doc - eric7 documentation generator

SYNOPSIS
       eric7_doc [options] files...

       where files can be be either Python modules, package directories or ordinary directories.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the eric7_doc command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has docu‐
       mentation provided in the file /usr/share/doc/eric/README-eric7-doc.txt.gz in plain text format.

       eric7_doc  is  the  documentation generator of the eric7 IDE. Source code documentation may be included as ordinary Python doc-strings or as documentation comments. For Quixote Template file (PTL)
       only documentation comments are available due to the inner workings of Quixote. Documentation comments start with the string ###, followed by the contents and ended by ###. Every line of the docu‐
       mentation comments contents must start with a # (see example below).
