NAME
       xml2yaml - convert an XML message with a schema into YAML

SYNOPSIS
        xml2yaml xml-file schema-file(s)  >yaml-file

        xml2yaml -x xml-file -s schema-files -o yaml-file

DESCRIPTION
       Convert an XML message into YAML with the same structure.  A schema is required to enforce the correct syntax, especially for optionally repeated elements.

   Options
       You can either specify an XML message filename and one or more schema filenames as arguments, or use the options.

       --xml|-x filename
           The file which contains the xml message.  A single dash means "stdin".

       --schema|-s filename(s)
           This option can be repeated, or the filenames separated by comma's, if you have more than one schema file to parse.  All imported and included schema components have to be provided explicitly.

       --bigints|-b  (boolean)
           By default, the translation is a little sloppy: Integer types are defined to support at least 18 digits in XML.  However, this is usually unnecessary large and unreadible in YAML.

       --no-keep-root  (boolean)
           Do not include the top node in the output.

       --mixed HOW
           [1.32]   How   to   treat   mixed   elements.    The   default   is   TEXTUAL.   Other  values  are  "ATTRIBUTES",  "XML_STRING",  and  "STRUCTURAL".   More  details  about  mixed_elements  in
           XML::Compile::Translate::Reader.

       --type|-t TYPE
           The type of the root element, required if the XML is not namespaceo qualified, although the schema is.  If not specified, the root element is automatically inspected.

           The TYPE notation is "{namespace}localname".  Be warned to use quoting on the UNIX command-line, because curly braces have a special meaning for the shell.

       --output|-o filename
           By default (or when the filename is a dash), the output is printed to stdout.
