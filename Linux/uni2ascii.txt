NAME
       uni2ascii - convert UTF-8 Unicode to various 7-bit ASCII representations

SYNOPSIS
       uni2ascii [options] (<input file name>)

DESCRIPTION
       uni2ascii  converts UTF-8 Unicode to various 7-bit ASCII representations. If no format is specified, standard hexadecimal format (e.g. 0x00e9) is used.  It reads from the standard input and writes
       to the standard output.

       Command line options are:

       -A     List the single character approximations carried out by the -y flag.

       -a <format>
              Convert to the specified format. Formats may be specified by means of the following arbitrary single character codes, by means of names such as "SGML_decimal", and by examples  of  the  de‐
              sired format.

              A Generate hexadecimal numbers with prefix U in angle-brackets (<U00E9>).

              B Generate \x-escaped hex (e.g. \x00E9)

              C Generate \x escaped hexadecimal numbers in braces (e.g. \x{00E9}).

              D Generate decimal HTML numeric character references (e.g. &#0233;)

              E Generate hexadecimal with prefix U (U00E9).

              F Generate hexadecimal with prefix u (u00E9).

              G Convert hexadecimal in single quotes with prefix X (e.g. X'00E9').

              H Generate hexadecimal HTML numeric character references (e.g. &#x00E9;)

              I Generate hexadecimal UTF-8 with each byte's hex preceded by an =-sign (e.g. =C3=A9) . This is the Quoted Printable format defined by RFC 2045.

              J Generate hexadecimal UTF-8 with each byte's hex preceded by a %-sign (e.g.  %C3%A9). This is the URI escape format defined by RFC 2396.

              K Generate octal UTF-8 with each byte escaped by a backslash (e.g.  \303\251)

              L Generate \U-escaped hex outside the BMP, \u-escaped hex within the BMP (U+0000-U+FFFF).

              M Generate hexadecimal SGML numeric character references (e.g. \#xE9;)

              N Generate decimal SGML numeric character references (e.g. \#233;)

              O Generate octal escapes for the three low bytes in big-endian order(e.g. \000\000\351))

              P Generate hexadecimal numbers with prefix U+ (e.g. U+00E9)

              Q Generate character entities (e.g. &eacute;) where possible, otherwise hexadecimal numeric character references.

              R Generate raw hexadecimal numbers (e.g. 00E9)

              S Generate hexadecimal escapes for the three low bytes in big-endian order (e.g. \x00\x00\xE9)

              T Generate decimal escapes for the three low bytes in big-endian order (e.g. \d000\d000\d233)

              U Generate \u-escaped hexadecimal numbers (e.g. \u00E9).

              V Generate \u-escaped decimal numbers (e.g. \u00233).

              X Generate standard hexadecimal numbers (e.g. 0x00E9).

              0 Generate hexadecimal UTF-8 with each byte's hex enclosed within angle brackets (e.g. <C3><A9>).

              1 Generate Common Lisp format hexadecimal numbers (e.g. #x00E9).

              2 Generate Perl format decimal numbers with prefix v (e.g. v233).

              3 Generate hexadecimal numbers with prefix $ (e.g. $00E9).

              4 Generate Postscript format hexadecimal numbers with prefix 16# (e.g. 16#00E9).

              5 Generate Common Lisp format hexadecimal numbers with prefix #16r (e.g. #16r00E9).

              6 Generate ADA format hexadecimal numbers with prefix 16# and suffix # (e.g. 16#00E9#).

              7 Generate Apache log format hexadecimal UTF-8 with each byte's hex preceded by a backslash-x (e.g.  \xC3\xA9).

              8 Generate Microsoft OOXML format hexadecimal numbers with prefix _x and suffix _ (e.g. _x00E9_).

              9 Generate %\u-escaped hexadecimal numbers (e.g. %\u00E9).

       -B     Transform to ASCII if possible. This option is equivalent to the combination cdefx.

       -c     Convert circled and parenthesized characters to their unenclosed counterparts.

       -d     Strip diacritics. This converts single codepoints representing characters with diacritics to the corresponding ASCII character and deletes separately encoded diacritics.

       -e     Convert characters to their approximate ASCII equivalents, as follows:

       -E     List the expansions performed by the -x flag.

       -f     Convert  stylistic  variants  to  plain  ASCII.  Stylistic equivalents include: superscript and subscript forms, small capitals (e.g. U+1D04), script forms (e.g. U+212C), black letter forms
              (e.g. U+212D), fullwidth forms (e.g. U+FF01), halfwidth forms (e.g. U+FF7B), and the mathematical alphanumeric symbols (e.g. U+1D400).

       -h     Help. Print the usage message and exit.

       -l     Use lowercase a-f when generating hexadecimal numbers.

       -n     Convert newlines too. By default, they are left alone.

       -P     Pass through Unicode rather than converting to ASCII escapes if the character is not converted to an ASCII character by a transformation such as diacritic stripping. Note that if  this  op‐
              tion is used the output may not be pure ASCII.

       -p     Pure. Convert characters within the ASCII range except for space and newline as well as those above.

       -q     Quiet. Do not chat unnecessarily while working.

       -s     Convert space characters too. By default, they are left alone.

       -S <Unicode:ASCII>
              Define  a  custom  substitution.  The  argument  should consist of the Unicode codepoint to be replaced followed by the ASCII code of the character to be used as replacement, separated by a
              colon. If no ASCII code follows the colon, the specified Unicode character will be deleted.  The code values may be in hexadecimal, octal, or decimal following the usual conventions (to  be
              precise,those of strtoul(3)).  This option may be repeated as many times as desired to define multiple substitutions.

       -v     Print program version information and exit.

       -w     Add a space after each converted item.

       -x     Expand certain characters to multicharacter sequences.  The characters affected are the same as those affected by the -y option.

       -Z <format>
              Generate output using the supplied format. The format specified will be used as the format string in a call to printf(3) with a single argument consisting of an unsigned long  integer.  For
              example, to obtain the same output as with the -U flag, the format would be: \u%04X.

       If conversion of spaces is disabled (as it is by default), if space characters outside the ASCII range are encountered (U+3000 ideographic space, U+1351 Ethiopic word space, and U+1680 ogham space
       mark), they are replaced with the ASCII space character (0x20) so as to keep the output pure 7-bit ASCII.

       Note  that  XML and XHTML numeric character entities are like those of HTML with two restrictions. First, in X(HT)ML the terminating semi-colon may not be omitted.  Second, in X(HT)ML the "x" must
       be lower-case, while in HTML it may be either upper- or lower-case. We always generate the terminating semi-colon and use a lower-case "x", so the option dubbed "HTML" produces valid XML and XHTML
       as well.
