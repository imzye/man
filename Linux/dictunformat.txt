NAME
       dictunformat - create a raw database file from a .dict and .index file

SYNOPSIS
       dictunformat [OPTIONS] index_filename

DESCRIPTION
       dictunformat takes a dictionary index file as a parameter and a dictio‐
       nary database file on stdin and outputs a raw database that may be used
       to  create  a DICT database by dictfmt -t.  This may be useful if it is
       desired to create a dictionary for a locale other than that  for  which
       the  original was created, or if it is desired to correct or supplement
       a pre-existing dictionary.

OPTIONS
       --help displays a usage message and exits.

       --headword-separator sep
              sep is the headword separator used when  creating  the  origianl
              dictionary.  (See --headword-separator in dictfmt (1)).

       index_filename
              is the .index file of the original dictionary.
