BGLTAGS(1)                  General Commands Manual                 BGLTAGS(1)

NAME
       bgltags - generate tag file for Emacs

SYNOPSIS
       bgltags [ options ] [ objfile [ gmon.out ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The bgltags program is used to create a tag table file, in a format un‐
       derstood by emacs(1). This programs understand the syntax of the Bigloo
       files.  It  reads  the files specified on the command line, and write a
       tag table (defaults: TAGS) in  the  current  working  directory.  Files
       specified  with  relative  file names will be recorded in the tag table
       with file names relative to the  directory  where  the  tag  table  re-
       sides.   Files specified with absolute file names will be recorded with
       absolute file names. The program does not recognize the  language  used
       in  an  input file based on its file name and contents.  The --language
       switch can be used to force parsing of the  file  names  following  the
       switch  according  to  the  given language, overriding guesses based on
       file-name extensions. Source files that are  not  Scheme  are  actually
       processed by the etags program.

OPTIONS
       -a, --append
            Append to existing tag file.

            identifier are not indexed in the tags table.
