NAME
       slsh — interperter for S-Lang scripts

SYNOPSIS
       slsh [-i init-file]  [-g]  [-n]  [-v]  [--help]  [--version]  [-|file args]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the slsh command. This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       slsh is an interpreter for scripts written in the S-Lang language.

OPTIONS
       --help    Show summary of options

       --version Show slsh version information

       -g        Compile with debugging code, tracebacks, etc

       -n        Don't load personal init file

       -i init-file
                 Use this file instead of default

       -v        Show verbose loading messages

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Upon startup, the program will try to load slsh.rc as follows:

       If either SLSH_CONF_DIR or SLSH_LIB_DIR environment variables exist, then look in the corresponding directories for slsh.rc. Otherwise look in:

                 $(prefix)/etc (specified in Makefile)

                 /usr/local/etc/

                 /usr/local/etc/slsh/

                 /etc/

                 /etc/slsh/

       The slsh.rc file may load other files from slsh's library directory in the manner described below.

       Once  slsh.rc  is  loaded,  slsh  will  load $HOME/.slshrc if present. Finally, it will load the script specified on the command line. If the name of the script is ``-'', then it will be read from
       stdin.

       When a script loads a file via the built-in ``evalfile'' function or the ``require'' function (autoloaded by slsh.rc), the file is searched for along the SLSH_PATH as specified in the Makefile. An
       alternate path may be specified by the SLSH_PATH environment variable.

       The search path may be queried and set during run time via set the get_lib_path and set_lib_path functions, e.g.,

       set_lib_path ("/home/bill/lib/slsh:/usr/share/slsh");
