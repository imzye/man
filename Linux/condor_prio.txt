CONDOR_PRIO(1)                                                                                  HTCondor Manual                                                                                  CONDOR_PRIO(1)

NAME
       condor_prio - HTCondor Manual

       change priority of jobs in the HTCondor queue

SYNOPSIS
       condor_prio -p priority | + ** *value* | **- value [-n schedd_name] **

       condor_prio -p priority | + ** *value* | **- value [-pool pool_name -n schedd_name ]**

DESCRIPTION
       condor_prio  changes  the  priority of one or more jobs in the HTCondor queue. If the job identification is given by cluster.process, condor_prio attempts to change the priority of the single job with
       job ClassAd attributes ClusterId and ProcId. If described by cluster, condor_prio attempts to change the priority of all processes with the given ClusterId job ClassAd attribute. If username is speci‐
       fied, condor_prio attempts to change priority of all jobs belonging to that user. For -a, condor_prio attempts to change priority of all jobs in the queue.

       The  user  must set a new priority with the -p option, or specify a priority adjustment. The priority of a job can be any integer, with higher numbers corresponding to greater priority. For adjustment
       of the current priority, + ** *value* increases the priority by the amount given with *value*. **- value decreases the priority by the amount given with value.

       Only the owner of a job or the super user can change the priority.

       The priority changed by condor_prio is only used when comparing to the priority jobs owned by the same user and submitted from the same machine.

OPTIONS
          -n schedd_name
                 Change priority of jobs queued at the specified condor_schedd in the local pool.

          -pool pool_name -n schedd_name
                 Change priority of jobs queued at the specified condor_schedd in the specified pool.

EXIT STATUS
       condor_prio will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
