NAME
       stone — interface description language (IDL) for APIs

SYNOPSIS
       stone  [-h]   [-v]   [--clean-build]   [-f FILTER_BY_ROUTE_ATTR]  [-r ROUTE_WHITELIST_FILTER]  [-a ATTRIBUTE]  [-w WHITELIST_NAMESPACE_ROUTES]  [-b BLACKLIST_NAMESPACE_ROUTES]  [backend]  [output]
       [spec ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the stone command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       stone is a code generator, used to translate your specification into objects and functions in the programming languages of your choice.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

                 -h           --help
                 Show help message and exit.

                 -v           --verbose
                 Print debugging statements.

                 --clean-build
                 Remove build_path before source files are compiled into them.

                 -f           --filter-by-route-attr
                 Removes routes that do not match the expression. The expression must specify a route attribute on the left-hand side and a value on the right-hand side. Use quotes for strings and bytes.
                 The only supported operators are "=" and "!=". For example, if "hide" is a route attribute, we can use this filter: "hide!=true". You can combine multiple expressions with "and"/"or" and
                 use parentheses to enforce precedence.

                 -r           --route-whitelist-filter
                 Restrict datatype generation to only the routes specified in the  whitelist  and  their  dependencies.  Input  should  be  a  file  containing  a  JSON  dict  with  the  following  form:
                 {"route_whitelist": {}, "datatype_whitelist": {}} where each object maps namespaces to lists of routes or datatypes to whitelist.

                 -a           --attribute
                 Route  attributes  that  the backend will have access to and presumably expose in generated code. Use ":all" to select all attributes defined in stone_cfg.Route. Note that you can filter
                 (-f) by attributes that are not listed here.

                 -w           --whitelist-namespace-routes
                 If set, backends will only see the specified namespaces as having routes.

                 -b           --blacklist-namespace-routes
                 If set, backends will not see any routes for the specified namespaces.

ARGUMENTS
       backend   Either the name of a built-in backend or the path to a backend module. Paths to backend modules must end with a stoneg.py extension.  The following backends are  built-in:  obj_c_client,
                 obj_c_types, obj_c_tests, js_client, js_types, tsd_client, tsd_types, python_types, python_type_stubs, python_client, swift_types, swift_client.

       output    The folder to save generated files to.

       spec      Path to API specifications. Each must have a .stone extension. If omitted or set to "-", the spec is read from stdin. Multiple namespaces can be provided over stdin by concatenating mul‐
                 tiple specs together.
