NAME
       chake-itamae - configure chake nodes with itamae

DESCRIPTION
       This configuration manager will run itamae(1) against your nodes.

CONFIGURATION
       The itamae configuration manager requires one key called itamae, and the value must be a list of strings representing the list of recipes to apply to the node when converging.

           host1.mycompany.com:
             itamae:
               - cookbooks/basic/default.rb
               - roles/server.rb
             service1:
               option1: "here we go"

       Any  extra  configuration under host1.mycompany.com will be saved to a JSON file and given to the itamae --node-json option in the command line. For example, the above configuration will produce a
       JSON file that looks like this:

           {
             "itamae": [
               "cookbooks/basic.rb",
               "roles/server.rb"
             ]
             ,
             "service1": {
               "option1": "here we go"
             }
           }

       Inside itamae recipes, you can access those values by using the node object. For example:

           template "/etc/service1.conf.d/option1.conf" do
             variables option1: node["option1"]
           end

BOOTSTRAPPING
       Very little bootstrapping is required for this configuration manager, as itamae requires no setup on the node site since the Ruby code in the recipes is interpreted locally and not on  the  nodes.
       During bootstrapping, only the node hostname will be set according to your chake configuration.
