NAME
       lltdscan - scan for LLTD-enabled hosts on a network interface.

SYNOPSIS
       lltdscan [-i iface] [-t timeout] [-u] [-v] [-v] [aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff]

DESCRIPTION
       The lltdscan utility sends broadcast LLTD request on specified (or default) interface. And then listens for timeout milliseconds for responses.

       Add one or two -v options to increase verbosity.

       Add -u option to show machine names in UTF-8.

       Also you can specify exactly one MAC address as last argument - and lltdscan will exit as soon as it receives first reply from specified host.

LLTD PROTOCOL
       LLTD stands for "Link Layer Topology Discovery".

       Protocol specs are available from Microsoft at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/connect/Rally/LLTD-spec.mspx
