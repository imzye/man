NAME
       mocked - use mocked libraries in unit tests

SYNOPSIS
         # use a fake LWP::Simple for testing from t/lib/LWP/Simple.pm
         use mocked 'LWP::Simple';
         my $text = get($url);

         # use a fake WWW::Mechanize for testing from t/mock-libs/WWW/Mechanize.pm
         use mocked [qw(WWW::Mechanize t/mock-libs)];

DESCRIPTION
       Often during unit testing, you may find the need to use mocked libraries to test edge cases, or prevent unit tests from using slow or external code.

       This is where mocking libraries can help.

       When you mock a library, you are creating a fake one that will be used in place of the real one.  The code can do as much or as little as is needed.

       Use mocked.pm as a safety measure (be sure you're actually using the mocked module), and as a way to document the tests for future maintainers.

VARIABLES
   real_inc_paths
       The real @INC that we are over-ridding is stored here while we are loading the mocked library.

FUNCTIONS
   import
       With a package name, this function will ensure that the module you specify is loaded from t/lib.

       You can also pass an array reference containing the package name and a directory from which to load it from.
