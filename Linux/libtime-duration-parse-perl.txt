NAME
       Time::Duration::Parse - Parse string that represents time duration

SYNOPSIS
         use Time::Duration::Parse;

         my $seconds = parse_duration("2 minutes and 3 seconds"); # 123

DESCRIPTION
       Time::Duration::Parse is a module to parse human readable duration strings like 2 minutes and 3 seconds to seconds.

       It does the opposite of "duration_exact" in Time::Duration function in Time::Duration and is roundtrip safe.  So, the following is always true.

         use Time::Duration::Parse;
         use Time::Duration;

         my $seconds = int rand 100000;
         is( parse_duration(duration_exact($seconds)), $seconds );

FUNCTIONS
       parse_duration
             $seconds = parse_duration($string);

           Parses  duration  string and returns seconds.  When it encounters an error in a given string, it dies with an exception saying "Unknown timespec: blah blah blah".  This function is exported by
           default.

SEE ALSO
       Time::Duration::Parse::More has the same interface as this module, but supports more expressions and memoization.

       Time::Duration can be used for the reverse of this module: given a number of seconds it will provide an English description of the duration.

       Time::Duration::Object provides an OO interface to Time::Duration.

       Time::Duration::LocaleObject provides an OO interface to the "Time::Duration::??" modules, which provide language-specific versions of Time::Duration.

       DateTime::Format::Duration can be used to parse natural language descriptions of durations, returning an instance  of  DateTime::Duration,  which  can  then  be  converted  to  seconds  using  the
       "in_units()" method.
