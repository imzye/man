NAME
       bumps - data fitting and Bayesian uncertainty modeling for inverse problems

SYNOPSIS

       bumps [options] modelfile [modelargs]

       bumps [{-? | -h | --help}]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the bumps command ( bumps3 for python3).

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation in HTML and in the GNU info(1) format; see below.

       bumps provides a set of routines for curve fitting and uncertainty analysis from a Bayesian perspective. In addition to traditional optimizers which search for the best minimum they can find in
       the search space, bumps provides uncertainty analysis which explores all viable minima and finds confidence intervals on the parameters based on uncertainty in the measured values. Bumps has been
       used for systems of up to 100 parameters with tight constraints on the parameters. Full uncertainty analysis requires hundreds of thousands of function evaluations, which is only feasible for
       cheap functions, systems with many processors, or lots of patience.

       Bumps includes several traditional local optimizers such as Nelder-Mead simplex, BFGS and differential evolution. Bumps uncertainty analysis uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to explore the parameter
       space. Although it was created for curve fitting problems, Bumps can explore any probability density function, such as those defined by PyMC. In particular, the bumps uncertainty analysis works
       well with correlated parameters.

       The modelfile is a Python script (i.e., a series of Python commands) which sets up the data, the models, and the fittable parameters. The model arguments are available in the modelfile as
       sys.argv[1:]. Model arguments may not start with '-'.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below. For a complete description, see the HTML
