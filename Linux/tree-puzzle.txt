NAME
       tree-puzzle - Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood

SYNOPSIS
       tree-puzzle

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tree-puzzle command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       TREE-PUZZLE is the new name for the program previously known as PUZZLE!

       tree-puzzle  is an interactive console program that implements a fast tree search algorithm, quartet puzzling, that allows analysis of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations of sup‐
       port to each internal branch. TREE-PUZZLE also computes pairwise maximum likelihood distances as well as branch lengths for user specified trees. Branch lengths can also be  calculated  under  the
       clock-assumption.  In addition, TREE-PUZZLE offers a novel method, likelihood mapping, to investigate the support of a hypothesized internal branch without computing an overall tree and to visual‐
       ize the phylogenetic content of a sequence alignment.

       There is also a paralellized version tree-ppuzzle available.

OPTIONS
       There are no options. For usage please look at /usr/share/doc/tree-puzzle/tree-puzzle.pdf.
