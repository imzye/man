NAME
       prads-asset-report - PRADS Text Reporting Module

SYNOPSIS
          prads-asset-report -r /var/log/prads-asset.log -w /tmp/asset-report.txt

DESCRIPTION
       PRADS is a Passive Real-time Asset Detection System.

       PRADS  passively  listens to network traffic and gathers information on hosts and services it sees on the network. This information can be used to map your network, letting you know what ser‐
       vices and hosts are alive/used, or can be used together with your favorite IDS/IPS setup for "event to host/service" correlation.

       Gathering info about your hosts in real-time will also let you detect assets that are just connected to the network for a short period of time, where a active network scan (nmap  etc.)  would
       take long time, and not common to run continually, hence missing the asset.

       prads-asset-report parses prads-asset.log prints out some useful information about the hosts prads has managed to gather info about.

OPTIONS
       -r <file>
              PRADS Raw Report File

       -w <file>
              Output file

       -i <IP>
              Just get info for this IP

       -n     Do not convert IP addresses to names.

       -p     Do not convert RFC 1918 IP addresses to names.

PROBLEMS
       1. Much more logic can be built into it!
