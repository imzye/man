NAME
       WAFW00F - Identify and fingerprint Web Application Firewall products

SYNOPSIS
       wafw00f url1 [url2 [url3 ... ]]

DESCRIPTION
       The Web Application Firewall Identification and Fingerprinting Tool.

       To do its magic, WAFW00F does the following:
              Sends  a normal HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a number of WAF solutions.  If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious) HTTP requests and
              uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is.  If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF  or  security
              solution is active>

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show available options.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbosity - multiple -v options increase verbosity.

       -a, --findall
              Find all WAFs, do not stop testing on the first one.

       -r, --noredirect
              Do not follow redirections given by 3xx responses.

       -t WAF, --test=WAF
              Test for one specific WAF product.

       -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
              Write output to csv, json or text file depending on file extension. For stdout, specify - as filename.

       -f, --format=FORMAT
              Force output format to csv, json or text.

       -i INPUT, --input=INPUT
              Read targets from a file. Input format can be csv, json or text. For csv and json, a `url` column name or element is required.

       -l, --list
              List all the WAFs that WAFW00F is able to detect.

       -p PROXY, --proxy=PROXY
