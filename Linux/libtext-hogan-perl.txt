NAME
       Text::Hogan - A mustache templating engine statement-for-statement cloned from hogan.js

VERSION
       version 2.03

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Hogan is a statement-for-statement rewrite of hogan.js <http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/> in Perl.

       It is a mustache <https://mustache.github.io/> templating engine which supports pre-compilation of your templates into pure Perl code, which then renders very quickly.

       It passes the full mustache spec <https://github.com/mustache/spec>.

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Hogan::Compiler;

           my $text = "Hello, {{name}}!";

           my $compiler = Text::Hogan::Compiler->new;
           my $template = $compiler->compile($text);

           say $template->render({ name => "Alex" });

       See Text::Hogan::Compiler and Text::Hogan::Template for more details.

TEMPLATE FORMAT
       The template format is documented in mustache(5) <https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html>.

SEE ALSO
   hogan.js
       hogan.js <http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/> is the original library that Text::Hogan is based on. It was written and is maintained by Twitter. It runs on Node.js and pre-compiles templates to
       pure JavaScript.

   Text::Caml
       Text::Caml supports searching for partials by file name, by default .caml but that can be configured.

   Template::Mustache
       Template::Mustache is used by Dancer::Template::Mustache and Dancer2::Template::Mustache. It supports compile once, render many times, but does not allow dumping the compiled form to disk.

   Mustache::Simple
       Mustache::Simple largely supports the Mustache spec, but skips the whitespace and decimal tests (its behaviour with decimals is the same as Text::Hogan with 'numeric_string_as_string' option
       enabled.) It supports passing objects with getters to the context hash, so that {{name}} can be rendered from $object->name if $object->can('name') returns true.
