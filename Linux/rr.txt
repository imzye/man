NAME
       rr-collect-symbols - add symbols to rr traces

SYNOPSIS
       rr-collect-symbols <trace-dir> [<url> | <path>]

DESCRIPTION
       rr-collect-symbols merges symbols into an rr(1) trace.

       The trace in trace-dir must be package, with rr pack, so all relevant files appear in the trace directory.

       Symbols  can  be extracted from a ZIP file downloaded from url, or from a .build-id directory under path with the usual structure.  path defaults to /usr/lib/debug, thus using any available system
       debuginfo files.

       The extracted debuginfo files are stored in the trace under a debug subdirectory, in a .build-id directory with the usual structure.

       If a debuginfo file contains a .gnu_debugaltlink section then the referenced file will also be copied, if it's available, with the same file name as the .debug file, but with a .sup suffix.
