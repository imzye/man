NAME
       verse - Displays a daily devotional verse from scripture

SYNOPSIS
       verse

DESCRIPTION
       Displays a verse taken from the database in /usr/share/verse/daily.verse that is specific for the current date.

INTEGRATION
       If  you  invoke verse from /etc/profile then the daily devotional verse will appear on each login for each user. Alternatively you could put the invocation of verse into the .profile of a user and
       have each user choose if he wants to use verse or not.

       Note that you will run into trouble if you have dialin users whose scripts call pppd and put the verse call into /etc/profile. The output might confuse the ppp programs.
