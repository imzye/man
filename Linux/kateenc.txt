NAME
       kateenc - create Kate streams from text input

SYNOPSIS
       kateenc [-hVM] [-o outfile] [-l language] [-c category] [-s serial] [-C tag=value] [-R threshold] [-K threshold] -t filetype [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       kateenc creates Kate streams from input files (SubRip SRT subtitles, LRC lyrics, and libkate's custom description language).  When saved to an Ogg stream (the default behavior), a Kate stream may then
       be merged with other Ogg streams (eg, a Theora video) using the oggz tools.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show command line help.

       -V     Show version information.

       -M     Allow simple HTML-like markup in SRT files. If this parameter is used, strings such as "<i>" will be interpreted to mean italics, rather than appear as such. Note that various players interpret
              a slightly different set of HTML tags, and some do not.

       -o outfile
              Write the output Kate stream to the given file name (writes to stdout if not specified).

       -l language
              Sets the language for the stream (default is the language specified in the input, or none).

       -c category
              Sets the category for the stream (default is the category specified in the input, or none).

       -s serial
              Sets the serial number for the output Kate stream (does not apply to raw streams).

       -C tag=value
              Adds  a  comment  to encode into the output Kate stream. The comment must be of the form tag=value, and comply with the Vorbis comment rules (eg, tag is composed of a particular subset of ASCII
              characters, and value is valid UTF-8). Note that you might have to escape or quote the comment for it to be seen as a single command line parameter.

       -t filetype
              Specifies the type of the input (srt, lrc, kate)

       -R threshold
              Use repeat packets, with the given threshold (in seconds).  Data packets will be repeated at intervals of roughly threshold seconds, while active.

       -K threshold
              Use keepalive packets, with the given threshold (in seconds).  Keepalive packets will be emitted when no other packet has been emitted for roughly threshold seconds.

EXAMPLES
       Create a Kate stream for Welsh subtitles from a SubRip file:

           kateenc -t srt -l cy -c SUB -o output.ogg input.srt
