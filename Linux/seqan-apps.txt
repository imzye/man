NAME
       rabema_evaluate - RABEMA Evaluation

SYNOPSIS
       rabema_evaluate [OPTIONS] --reference REF.fa --in-gsi IN.gsi --in-bam MAPPING.{sam,bam}

DESCRIPTION
       Compare  the  SAM/bam  output  MAPPING.sam/MAPPING.bam of any read mapper against the RABEMA gold standard previously built with rabema_build_gold_standard.  The input is a reference FASTA file, a
       gold standard interval (GSI) file and the SAM/BAM input to evaluate.

       The input SAM/BAM file must be sorted by queryname.  The program will create a FASTA index file REF.fa.fai for fast random access to the reference.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display the help message.

       --version
              Display version information.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output.

       -vv, --very-verbose
              Enable even more verbose output.

   Input / Output:
       -r, --reference INPUT_FILE
              Path to load reference FASTA from. Valid filetypes are: .sam[.*], .raw[.*], .gbk[.*], .frn[.*], .fq[.*], .fna[.*], .ffn[.*], .fastq[.*], .fasta[.*], .faa[.*], .fa[.*], .embl[.*], and  .bam,
              where * is any of the following extensions: gz, bz2, and bgzf for transparent (de)compression.

       -g, --in-gsi INPUT_FILE
              Path  to  load  gold standard intervals from. If compressed using gzip, the file will be decompressed on the fly. Valid filetype is: .gsi[.*], where * is any of the following extensions: gz
              for transparent (de)compression.

       -b, --in-bam INPUT_FILE
              Path to load the read mapper SAM or BAM output from. Valid filetypes are: .sam[.*] and .bam, where * is any of the following extensions: gz, bz2, and bgzf for transparent (de)compression.

       --out-tsv OUTPUT_FILE
              Path to write the statistics to as TSV. Valid filetype is: .rabema_report_tsv.

       --dont-check-sorting
              Do not check sortedness (by name) of input SAM/BAM files.  This is required if the reads are not sorted by name in the original FASTQ files.  Files  from  the  SRA  and  ENA  generally  are
              sorted.

   Benchmark Parameters:
       --oracle-mode
              Enable oracle mode.  This is used for simulated data when the input GSI file gives exactly one position that is considered as the true sample position.  For simulated data.

       --only-unique-reads
              Consider only reads that a single alignment in the mapping result file. Useful for precision computation.

       --match-N
              When set, N matches all characters without penalty.

       --distance-metric STRING
              Set distance metric.  Valid values: hamming, edit.  Default: edit. One of hamming and edit. Default: edit.

       -e, --max-error INTEGER
              Maximal  error rate to build gold standard for in percent.  This parameter is an integer and relative to the read length.  The error rate is ignored in oracle mode, here the distance of the
              read at the sample position is taken, individually for each read.  Default: 0 Default: 0.

       -c, --benchmark-category STRING
              Set benchmark category.  One of {all, all-best, any-best.  Default: all One of all, all-best, and any-best. Default: all.

       --trust-NM
              When set, we trust the alignment and distance from SAM/BAM file and no realignment is performed.  Off by default.

       --extra-pos-tag STRING
              If the CIGAR string is absent, the missing alignment end position can be provided by this BAM tag.

       --ignore-paired-flags
              When set, we ignore all SAM/BAM flags related to pairing.  This is necessary when analyzing SAM from SOAP's soap2sam.pl script.

       --DONT-PANIC
              Do not stop program execution if an additional hit was found that indicates that the gold standard is incorrect.

   Logging:
       --show-missed-intervals
              Show details for each missed interval from the GSI.

       --show-invalid-hits
              Show details for invalid hits (with too high error rate).

       --show-additional-hits
              Show details for additional hits (low enough error rate but not in gold standard.

       --show-hits
              Show details for hit intervals.

       --show-try-hit
              Show details for each alignment in SAM/BAM input.

              The occurrence of "invalid" hits in the read mapper's output is not an error.  If there are additional hits, however, this shows an error in the gold standard.

RETURN VALUES
       A return value of 0 indicates success, any other value indicates an error.

MEMORY REQUIREMENTS
       From version 1.1, great care has been taken to keep the memory requirements as low as possible.

       The evaluation step needs to store the whole reference sequence in memory but little more memory.  So, for the human genome, the memory requirements are below 4 GB, regardless of the size  of  the
       GSI or SAM/BAM file.
