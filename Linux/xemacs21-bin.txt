DESCRIPTION
       The `etags' program is used to create a tag table file, in a format understood by emacs(1); the `ctags' program is used to create a similar table in a format
       understood by vi(1).  Both forms of the program understand the syntax of C, Objective C, C++, Java, Fortran, Ada, Cobol,  Erlang,  LaTeX,  Emacs  Lisp/Common
       Lisp, makefiles, Pascal, Perl, Postscript, Python, Prolog, Scheme and most assembler-like syntaxes.  Both forms read the files specified on the command line,
       and write a tag table (defaults: `TAGS' for etags, `tags' for ctags) in the current working directory.  Files specified with  relative  file  names  will  be
       recorded  in  the tag table with file names relative to the directory where the tag table resides.  Files specified with absolute file names will be recorded
       with absolute file names.  The programs recognize the language used in an input file based on its file name and contents.  The --language switch can be  used
       to force parsing of the file names following the switch according to the given language, overriding guesses based on filename extensions.

OPTIONS
       Some  options make sense only for the vi style tag files produced by ctags; etags does not recognize them.  The programs accept unambiguous abbreviations for
       long option names.

       -a, --append
              Append to existing tag file.  (For vi-format tag files, see also --update.)

       -B, --backward-search
              Tag files written in the format expected by vi contain regular expression search instructions; the -B option writes them using the delimiter  `?',  to
              search backwards through files.  The default is to use the delimiter `/', to search forwards through files.  Only ctags accepts this option.

       --declarations
              In C and derived languages, create tags for function declarations, and create tags for extern variables unless --no-globals is used.

       -d, --defines
              Create tag entries for C preprocessor constant definitions and enum constants, too.  This is the default behavior for etags.

       -D, --no-defines
              Do  not  create tag entries for C preprocessor constant definitions and enum constants.  This may make the tags file much smaller if many header files
              are tagged.  This is the default behavior for ctags.

       -g, --globals
              Create tag entries for global variables in C, C++, Objective C, Java, and Perl.  This is the default behavior for etags.

       -G, --no-globals
              Do not tag global variables.  Typically this reduces the file size by one fourth.  This is the default behavior for ctags.

       -i file, --include=file
              Include a note in the tag file indicating that, when searching for a tag, one should also consult the tags file file after checking the current  file.
              This options is only accepted by etags.

       -I, --ignore-indentation
              Don't  rely on indentation as much as we normally do.  Currently, this means not to assume that a closing brace in the first column is the final brace
              of a function or structure definition in C and C++.

       -l language, --language=language
              Parse the following files according to the given language.  More than one such options may be intermixed with filenames.  Use --help to get a list  of
              the  available  languages  and their default filename extensions.  The `auto' language can be used to restore automatic detection of language based on
              the file name.  The `none' language may be used to disable language parsing altogether; only regexp matching is done in this case (see the --regex op‐
              tion).

       -m, --members
              Create tag entries for variables that are members of structure-like constructs in C++, Objective C, Java.

       -M, --no-members
              Do not tag member variables.  This is the default behavior.

       --packages-only
              Only tag packages in Ada files.

       -o tagfile, --output=tagfile
              Explicit name of file for tag table; overrides default `TAGS' or `tags'.   (But ignored with -v or -x.)

       -r regexp, --regex=regexp, --ignore-case-regex=regexp
              Make  tags  based on regexp matching for each line of the files following this option, in addition to the tags made with the standard parsing based on
              language.  When using --regex, case is significant, while it is not with --ignore-case-regex. May be freely intermixed with filenames and the  -R  op‐
              tion.  The regexps are cumulative, i.e. each option will add to the previous ones.  The regexps are of the form:
                   /tagregexp[/nameregexp]/

              where  tagregexp  is  used to match the lines that must be tagged.  It should not match useless characters.  If the match is such that more characters
              than needed are unavoidably matched by tagregexp, it may be useful to add a nameregexp, to narrow down the tag scope.  ctags ignores regexps without a
              nameregexp.  The syntax of regexps is the same as in emacs, augmented with intervals of the form \{m,n\}, as in ed or grep.
              Here are some examples.  All the regexps are quoted to protect them from shell interpretation.

              Tag the DEFVAR macros in the emacs source files:
              --regex='/[ \t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_ \t(]+"\([^"]+\)"'

              Tag VHDL files (this example is a single long line, broken here for formatting reasons):
              --language=none --regex='/[ \t]*\(ARCHITECTURE\|\   CONFIGURATION\) +[^ ]* +OF/' --regex='/[ \t]*\   \(ATTRIBUTE\|ENTITY\|FUNCTION\|PACKAGE\( BODY\)?\
              \|PROCEDURE\|PROCESS\|TYPE\)[ \t]+\([^ \t(]+\)/\3/'

              Tag TCL files (this last example shows the usage of a tagregexp):
              --lang=none --regex='/proc[ \t]+\([^ \t]+\)/\1/'

              A regexp can be preceded by {lang}, thus restriciting it to match lines of files of the specified language.  Use etags --help to obtain a list of  the
              recognised  languages.   This  feature  is  particularly useful inside regex files.  A regex file contains one regex per line.  Empty lines, and those
              lines beginning with space or tab are ignored.  Lines beginning with @ are references to regex files whose name follows the @ sign.  Other  lines  are
              considered regular expressions like those following --regex.
              For example, the command
              etags --regex=@regex.file *.c
              reads the regexes contained in the file regex.file.

       -R, --no-regex
              Don't do any more regexp matching on the following files.  May be freely intermixed with filenames and the --regex option.

       -t, --typedefs
              Record typedefs in C code as tags.  Since this is the default behaviour of etags, only ctags accepts this option.

       -T, --typedefs-and-c++
              Generate  tag  entries for typedefs, struct, enum, and union tags, and C++ member functions.  Since this is the default behaviour of etags, only ctags
              accepts this option.

       -u, --update
              Update tag entries for files specified on command line, leaving tag entries for other files in place.  Currently, this is implemented by deleting  the
              existing  entries for the given files and then rewriting the new entries at the end of the tags file.  It is often faster to simply rebuild the entire
              tag file than to use this.  Only ctags accepts this option.

       -v, --vgrind
              Instead of generating a tag file, write index (in vgrind format) to standard output.  Only ctags accepts this option.

       -w, --no-warn
              Suppress warning messages about duplicate entries.  The etags program does not check for duplicate entries, so this option is not allowed with it.

       -x, --cxref
              Instead of generating a tag file, write a cross reference (in cxref format) to standard output.  Only ctags accepts this option.

       -h, -H, --help
              Print usage information.

       -V, --version
              Print the current version of the program (same as the version of the emacs etags is shipped with).
