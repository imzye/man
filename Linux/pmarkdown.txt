NAME
       pmarkdown – Very configurable Markdown processor written in pure Perl, supporting the CommonMark spec and many extensions.

SYNOPSIS
         pmarkdown [-o key=value] ... < in_file.md > out_file.html_fragment

DESCRIPTION
       Currently "pmarkdown" can only read a single input from its standard input and will write its output on the standard output. Both are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8.

       If needed, See the GitHub pmarkdown page <https://github.com/mkende/pmarkdown> for installation instructions.

OPTIONS
       --help, -h
               Show a short help message about the program.

       --helpfull
               Show the complete man page of the program.

       --list-options
               Show the documentation of all the existing options of the Markdown processor.  This is the same content that can be found on the Markdown::Perl::Options page.

               These options can be passed to the program with the "--options" flag.

       --version, -v
               Show the version of this program.

       --mode mode, -m
               Specify  a  mode for the Markdown processor. A mode is a set of configuration options working together, typically to replicate the semantics of another existing Markdown processor. See the
               "MODES" section in this page for a list of available modes.

               When a mode is applied, is set specific values for some options but any value for these options set through the "--option" flag will take precedence.

       --option option=value, -o
               Specify the value for one particular option. The "--option" flag can be passed multiple times. If an option is specified multiple times, the last value takes precedence.

               The options are described in the Markdown::Perl::Options page. You can see it with the "pmarkdown --list-options" command.

               When specifying an option value, boolean options should be passed as either 0, 1, "false", or "true".

               Note that all options are applied on top of the selected mode. Even if the options are passed before the --mode flag, the mode will not override options set through --option.

MODES
       default The default mode if no other mode is specified. This mode uses the default value for all the options (as per their documentation). The default syntax is documented in the GitHub repository
               of the project: <https://github.com/mkende/pmarkdown/blob/main/Syntax.md>

               Note that, in practice, setting the mode to default is equivalent to not setting a mode at all, except that subsequent calls to set a mode  will  raise  a  warning  about  the  mode  being
               overwritten.

       cmark   This mode implements the full CommonMark spec <https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/>.

       github  This mode implements the GitHub Flavored Markdown <https://github.github.com/gfm/> variant of the CommonMark spec.

       markdown
               This mode implements the original Markdown syntax <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>.

               Note that this mode is not 100% similar to the original Markdown.pl script as that script has some buggy behavior that we are not reproducing.
