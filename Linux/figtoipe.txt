NAME
       figtoipe - Convert FIG figures into Ipe format

SYNOPSIS
       figtoipe [-g] [-p preamble] FIGfile XMLfile

DESCRIPTION
       figtoipe converts files in FIG format (as created, e.g., by xfig) to Ipe's XML format.

       figtoipe is not complete.  The main lacking feature is the conversion of splines.  Arc-boxes are replaced by rectangles.  Feel free to improve this version!

       The drawing models of FIG and Ipe are somewhat different.  Ipe does not support depth ordering independent of grouping, pattern fill, and Postscript fonts.

       figtoipe  tries to include images specified in the XFIG file. For JPEG pictures, it tries include the compressed image data into the XML file. For files not recognized as JPEG, anytopnm is called;
       its output is compressed and included in the XML file. Some output of anytopnm might be rejected (e.g. images larger than 5000x5000 pixels or B&W bitmaps), or misunderstood.

OPTIONS
       -g group the figure in the output XML

       -c     tell ipe to crop PDF output to the boundingbox

       -6     write in ipe 6 format instead of ipe 7 format

       -p latex
              add latex as a preamble to the generated XML file, e.g.
                   ´\usepackage{amsmath}´
