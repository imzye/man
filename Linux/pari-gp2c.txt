NAME
       GP2C-RUN - The GP to C compiler driver

DESCRIPTION
       gp2c-run [gp2c options] [file.gp]

       Compile file.gp with gp2c and launch a gp session where the functions of functions of file.gp are preloaded.  Any options are passed to gp2c.

       gp2c-run file.c

       Compile file.c and launch a gp session where the functions of file.c are preloaded. the file file.c must have suitable GP;install() lines.

       This  is  especially  useful  if  you  manually modify the file.gp.c produced by gp2c-run. In this case it is advised to rename it to file.c to avoid subsequent calls of gp2c-run to overwrite your
       changes.

FILES
       file.gp.c The C output of gp2c.

       file.gp.so
              The GP loadable module.

       file.gp.run
              The  commands to load the module. Once a module is compiled, you can load it inside a gp session by running this script.

ENVIRONMENT
       GP2C   Path to the gp2c compiler, default: /usr/bin/gp2c

       GP     Path to the gp calculator, default: /usr/bin/gp

FILES
       file.gp.c The C output of gp2c.

       file.gp.so
              The GP loadable module.

       file.gp.run
              The  commands to load the module. Once a module is compiled, you can load it inside a gp session by running this script.
