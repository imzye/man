NAME
       String::Tokenizer - A simple string tokenizer.

SYNOPSIS
         use String::Tokenizer;

         # create the tokenizer and tokenize input
         my $tokenizer = String::Tokenizer->new("((5+5) * 10)", '+*()');

         # create tokenizer
         my $tokenizer = String::Tokenizer->new();
         # ... then tokenize the string
         $tokenizer->tokenize("((5 + 5) - 10)", '()');

         # will print '(, (, 5, +, 5, ), -, 10, )'
         print join ", " => $tokenizer->getTokens();

         # create tokenizer which retains whitespace
         my $st = String::Tokenizer->new(
                       'this is a test with,    (significant) whitespace',
                       ',()',
                       String::Tokenizer->RETAIN_WHITESPACE
                       );

         # this will print:
         # 'this', ' ', 'is', ' ', 'a', ' ', 'test', ' ', 'with', '    ', '(', 'significant', ')', ' ', 'whitespace'
         print "'" . (join "', '" => $tokenizer->getTokens()) . "'";

         # get a token iterator
         my $i = $tokenizer->iterator();
         while ($i->hasNextToken()) {
             my $next = $i->nextToken();
             # peek ahead at the next token
             my $look_ahead = $i->lookAheadToken();
             # ...
             # skip the next 2 tokens
             $i->skipTokens(2);
             # ...
             # then backtrack 1 token
             my $previous = $i->prevToken();
             # ...
             # get the current token
             my $current = $i->currentToken();
             # ...
         }

DESCRIPTION
       A simple string tokenizer which takes a string and splits it on whitespace. It also optionally takes a string of characters to use as delimiters, and returns them with the token set as well. This
       allows for splitting the string in many different ways.

       This is a very basic tokenizer, so more complex needs should be either addressed with a custom written tokenizer or post-processing of the output generated by this module. Basically, this will not
       fill everyone's needs, but it spans a gap between simple "split / /, $string" and the other options that involve much larger and complex modules.

       Also note that this is not a lexical analyser. Many people confuse tokenization with lexical analysis. A tokenizer merely splits its input into specific chunks, a lexical analyzer classifies those
       chunks. Sometimes these two steps are combined, but not here.

METHODS
       new ($string, $delimiters, $handle_whitespace)
           If  you  do  not  supply any parameters, nothing happens, the instance is just created. But if you do supply parameters, they are passed on to the "tokenize" method and that method is run. For
           information about those arguments, see "tokenize" below.

       setDelimiter ($delimiter)
           This can be used to set the delimiter string, this is used by "tokenize".

       handleWhitespace ($value)
           This can be used to set the whitespace handling. It accepts one of the two constant values "RETAIN_WHITESPACE" or "IGNORE_WHITESPACE".

       tokenize ($string, $delimiters, $handle_whitespace)
           Takes a $string to tokenize, and optionally a set of $delimiter characters to facilitate the tokenization and the type of whitespace handling with $handle_whitespace. The $string parameter and
           the $handle_whitespace parameter are pretty obvious, the $delimiter parameter is not as transparent. $delimiter is a string of characters, these characters are then separated  into  individual
           characters and are used to split the $string with. So given this string:

             (5 + (100 * (20 - 35)) + 4)

           The "tokenize" method without a $delimiter parameter would return the following comma separated list of tokens:

             '(5', '+', '(100', '*', '(20', '-', '35))', '+', '4)'

           However, if you were to pass the following set of delimiters "(, )" to "tokenize", you would get the following comma separated list of tokens:

             '(', '5', '+', '(', '100', '*', '(', '20', '-', '35', ')', ')', '+', '4', ')'

           We now can differentiate the parens from the numbers, and no globbing occurs. If you wanted to allow for optionally leaving out the whitespace in the expression, like this:

             (5+(100*(20-35))+4)

           as some languages do. Then you would give this delimiter "+*-()" to arrive at the same result.

           If you decide that whitespace is significant in your string, then you need to specify that like this:

             my $st = String::Tokenizer->new(
                           'this is a test with,    (significant) whitespace',
                           ',()',
                           String::Tokenizer->RETAIN_WHITESPACE
                           );

           A call to "getTokens" on this instance would result in the following token set.

            'this', ' ', 'is', ' ', 'a', ' ', 'test', ' ', 'with', '       ', '(', 'significant', ')', ' ', 'whitespace'

           All running whitespace is grouped together into a single token, we make no attempt to split it into its individual parts.

       getTokens
           Simply returns the array of tokens. It returns an array-ref in scalar context.

       iterator
           Returns a String::Tokenizer::Iterator instance, see below for more details.

INNER CLASS
       A String::Tokenizer::Iterator instance is returned from the String::Tokenizer's "iterator" method and serves as yet another means of iterating through an array of tokens. The simplest way would be
       to  call "getTokens" and just manipulate the array yourself, or push the array into another object. However, iterating through a set of tokens tends to get messy when done manually. So here I have
       provided the String::Tokenizer::Iterator to address those common token processing idioms. It is basically a bi-directional iterator which can look ahead, skip and be reset to the beginning.

       NOTE: String::Tokenizer::Iterator is an inner class, which means that only String::Tokenizer objects can create an instance of it. That  said,  if  String::Tokenizer::Iterator's  "new"  method  is
       called from outside of the String::Tokenizer package, an exception is thrown.

       new ($tokens_array_ref)
           This accepts an array reference of tokens and sets up the iterator. This method can only be called from within the String::Tokenizer package, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

       reset
           This will reset the internal counter, bringing it back to the beginning of the token list.

       hasNextToken
           This will return true (1) if there are more tokens to be iterated over, and false (0) otherwise.

       hasPrevToken
           This will return true (1) if the beginning of the token list has been reached, and false (0) otherwise.

       nextToken
           This dispenses the next available token, and move the internal counter ahead by one.

       prevToken
           This dispenses the previous token, and moves the internal counter back by one.

       currentToken
           This returns the current token, which will match the last token retrieved by "nextToken".

       lookAheadToken
           This  peeks  ahead  one  token  to  the next one in the list. This item will match the next item dispensed with "nextToken". This is a non-destructive look ahead, meaning it does not alter the
           position of the internal counter.

       skipToken
           This will jump the internal counter ahead by 1.

       skipTokens ($number_to_skip)
           This will jump the internal counter ahead by $number_to_skip.

       skipTokenIfWhitespace
           This will skip the next token if it is whitespace.

       skipTokensUntil ($token_to_match)
           Given a string as a $token_to_match, this will skip all tokens until it matches that string. If the $token_to_match is never matched, then the iterator will return the internal pointer to  its
           initial state.

       collectTokensUntil ($token_to_match)
           Given  a  string as a $token_to_match, this will collect all tokens until it matches that string, at which point the collected tokens will be returned. If the $token_to_match is never matched,
           then the iterator will return the internal pointer to its initial state and no tokens will be returned.

TO DO
       Inline token expansion
           The Java StringTokenizer class allows for a token to be tokenized further, therefore breaking it up more and including the results into the current token stream. I have never used this feature
           in this class, but I can see where it might be a useful one. This may be in the next release if it works out.

           Possibly compliment this expansion with compression as well, so for instance double quoted strings could be compressed into a single token.

       Token Bookmarks
           Allow for the creation of "token bookmarks". Meaning we could tag a specific token with a label, that index could be returned to from any point in the token stream. We could mix  this  with  a
           memory stack as well, so that we would have an ordering to the bookmarks as well.

BUGS
       None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it.

SEE ALSO
       The interface and workings of this module are based largely on the StringTokenizer class from the Java standard library.

       Below is a short list of other modules that might be considered similar to this one. If this module does not suit your needs, you might look at one of these.

       String::Tokeniser
           Along with being a tokenizer, it also provides a means of moving through the resulting tokens, allowing for skipping of tokens and such.  It was last updated in 2011.

       Parse::Tokens
           This one hasn't been touched since 2001, although it did get up to version 0.27.  It looks to lean over more towards the parser side than a basic tokenizer.

       Text::Tokenizer
           This  is  both  a lexical analyzer and a tokenizer.  It also uses XS, where String::Tokenizer is pure perl.  This is something maybe to look into if you were to need a more beefy solution than
           String::Tokenizer provides.

THANKS
       Thanks to Stephan Tobias for finding bugs and suggestions on whitespace handling.
