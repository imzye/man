NAME
       scrobbler - a last.fm and libre.fm submitter for portable devices

SYNOPSIS
       scrobbler [options]

DESCRIPTION
       scrobbler is a program to submit information about tracks which have been listened to from a portable music player to last.fm (previously known as Audioscrobbler), libre.fm and/or a custom site of
       your choice.  scrobbler can read this information from .scrobbler.log files (i.e. produced by the open Rockbox firmware), from iPod databases, or from devices that use MTP (aka Plays for Sure).
       In addition to this, scrobbler can adjust the date/time information relating to when the track was listened to before uploading.  This can be useful if your device is set to a different timezone
       to the machine you upload from.
