DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xhtml2pdf3 command.

       xhtml2pdf3 is an HTML-to-PDF converter using the ReportLab Toolkit, HTML5lib and pyPdf.

       It supports HTML 5 and CSS 2.1 (and some of CSS 3). It is completely written in pure Python so it is platform independent. The main benefit of this tool that a user with Web skills like HTML and
       CSS is able to generate PDF templates very quickly without learning new technologies. Easy integration into Python frameworks like CherryPy, KID Templating, TurboGears, Django, Zope, Plone, Google
       AppEngine (GAE) etc.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       SRC
           Name of a HTML file or a file pattern using * placeholder. If you want to read from stdin use - as file name. You may also load an URL over HTTP. Take care of putting the src in quotes if it
           contains characters like ?.

       DEST
           Name of the generated PDF file or - if you like to send the result to stdout. Take care that the destination file is not already opened by any other application like the Adobe Reader. If the
           destination is not writeable a similar name will be calculated automatically.

       -b, --base
           Specify a base path if input comes via STDIN.

       -c, --css
           Path to default CSS file

       --css-dump
           Dumps the default CSS definitions to STDOUT.

       -d, --debug
           Show debugging information.

       --encoding
           The character encoding of SRC. If left empty (default) this information will be extracted from the HTML header data.

       -h, --help
           Show the help text.

       -q, --quiet
           Show no messages.

       --version
           Show version information.

       -w, --warn
           Show warnings
