NAME
       cococs - Coco/R Compiler Generator (C-Sharp Version)

HINT
       By  default cococs expects the Parser.frame and Scanner.frame file to be in the same directory as the grammar (atg-file) to translate. As the frame files are
       architecture independent, the default frame files can be found in /usr/share/coco-cs/.

SEE ALSO
       See package coco-doc for documentation.
