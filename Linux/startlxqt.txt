NAME
       startlxqt - script to initialize and launch LXQt sessions

SYNOPSIS
       startlxqt

DESCRIPTION
       startlxqt is a shell script meant to initialize and launch LXQt sessions.  It is as such similar to counterparts of other desktop environments like startlxde in LXDE or startkde in KDE.

       It's main tasks are exporting environment variables, partly after performing corresponding checks, and launching lxqt-session, the LXQt session manager.

       It is not meant to be run by users.  Rather, it is invoked as backend, e. g. by script startx on virtual terminals or display managers like SDDM or LightDM, see section EXAMPLE.

FILES
       $XDG_DATA_DIRS/xsessions/lxqt.desktop
            Desktop entry file stating startlxqt as binary needed to start LXQt sessions. Sourced e. g.  by display managers.

BUGS
       None at the time of this writing. Bugs can be reported on https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/issues.

EXAMPLE
       To start an LXQt session from a virtual terminal (virtual console) add a line

            exec startlxqt

       to file ~/.xinitrc. An LXQt session will then be launched by running startx.

       Display  managers  are  making  use  of  scripts  like  startlxqt  automatically.  Information  about  available desktop environments is provided by files $XDG_DATA_DIRS/xsessions/*.desktop, typically
       /usr/share/xessions/*.desktop.
       File lxqt.desktop provided by LXQt is stating startlxqt in key Exec while making sure the session manager lxqt-session does exist by stating it in key TryExec.
