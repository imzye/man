NAME
       ifnames2.13 - print identifiers that a package uses in C preprocessor conditionals

SYNOPSIS
       ifnames2.13 [ --help | -h ] [ --macrodir=dir | -m dir ] [ --version ]

DESCRIPTION
       ifnames2.13  can help when writing a configure.in for a software package.  It prints the identifiers that the package already uses in C preprocessor conditionals.  If a package has already been set up
       to have some portability, this program can help you figure out what its configure needs to check for.  It may help fill in some gaps in a configure.in generated by autoscan2.13 (see autoscan2.13(1)).

       ifnames2.13 scans all of the C source files named on the command line (or the standard input, if none are given) and writes to the standard output a sorted list of all the identifiers that  appear  in
       those files in #if, #elif, #ifdef, or #ifndef directives.  It prints each identifier on a line, followed by a space-separated list of the files in which that identifier occurs.

       ifnames2.13 accepts the following options:

       --help

       -h     Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       --macrodir=DIR

       -m DIR Look for the installed macro files in directory DIR.  You can also set the AC_MACRODIR environment variable to a directory; this option overrides the environment variable.

       --version
              Print the version number of Autoconf and exit.
