NAME
       segraph_query - SELinux policy analysis tool

SYNOPSIS
       segraph_query [-h] [-d POLICY_GRAPH2] POLICY_GRAPH QUERY_FUNCTIONS

DESCRIPTION
       Analyses policy graph using given query functions.

          Available query functions:

              write_executable
                     Finds all types corresponding to executables, that can be written to. Lists dictionary with execuatable types as keys and types with write permission as values.

              transition_write
                     Finds  domain  transitions  via entrypoints that can be rewritten by source domain. This effectively increases reach of source domain by access rights of target domain. Lists triplets of
                     (source domain, target domain, entrypoint)

              write_to_security
                     Find domains that are allowed write access to "security related" types. Lists domains with the specified write access and lists of affected types (security types that can be written to)

OPTIONS
   Positional arguments:
              POLICY_GRAPH
                     Policy graph file

              QUERY_FUNCTIONS
                     Comma separated list of query functions to be executed

   Optional arguments:
              -h, --help
                     Show help message and exit

              -d POLICY_GRAPH2, --diff POLICY_GRAPH2
                     Another policy graph file for comparison

EXAMPLE
       Check a policy graph (created using sebuild_graph) with write_executable function:

             $ graph_query.py graph write_executable

       Show consequences of change in policy (graph2 was created after the change):

             $ segraph_query graph2 write_executable,transition_write,write_to_security -d graph
