NAME
       tortoize - Calculate ramachandran z-scores

SYNOPSIS
       tortoize [OPTION] input [output]

DESCRIPTION
       Tortoize validates protein structure models by checking the Ramachandran plot and side-chain rotamer distributions. Quality Z-scores are given at the residue level and at the model level
       (ramachandran-z and torsions-z). Higher scores are better. To compare models or to describe the reliability of the model Z-scores jackknife- based standard deviations are also reported
       (ramachandran-jackknife-sd and torsion-jackknife-sd).

OPTIONS
       The input file can be either mmCIF or PDB format and the file may be gzip or bzip2 compressed.

       The output is a json file, if no file name is specified the output is written to stdout.

       --dict=<file>
              Specify a dictionary file containing restraints for residues specific to this file.

       --log=<file>
              Write a log with diagnostic information to this file.
