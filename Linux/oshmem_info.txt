NAME
       oshmem_info - Display information about the Open MPI installation

SYNOPSIS
       oshmem_info [options]

DESCRIPTION
       oshmem_info provides detailed information about the Open MPI/SHMEM installation.  It can be useful for at least three common scenarios:

       1. Checking local configuration and seeing how Open MPI/SHMEM was installed.

       2. Submitting bug reports / help requests to the Open MPI/SHMEM community (see http://www.open-mpi.org/community/help/)

       3. Seeing a list of installed Open MPI/SHMEM plugins and querying what MCA parameters they support.

OPTIONS
       oshmem_info accepts the following options:

       -a|--all
               Show all configuration options and MCA parameters

       --arch  Show architecture Open MPI/SHMEM was compiled on

       -c|--config
               Show configuration options

       -gmca|--gmca <param> <value>
               Pass global MCA parameters that are applicable to all contexts.

       -h|--help
               Shows help / usage message

       --hostname
               Show the hostname that Open MPI/SHMEM was configured and built on

       --internal
               Show internal MCA parameters (not meant to be modified by users)

       --level Show only variables with at most this level (1-9). The default is 1 unless --all is specified without --level in which case the default is 9. See the LEVEL section for more information.

       -mca|--mca <param> <value>
               Pass context-specific MCA parameters; they are considered global if --gmca is not used and only one context is specified.

       --param <type> <component>
               Show  MCA parameters.  The first parameter is the type of the component to display; the second parameter is the specific component to display (or the keyword "all", meaning "display all compo‐
               nents of this type").

       --parsable
               When used in conjunction with other parameters, the output is displayed in a machine-parsable format --parseable Synonym for --parsable

       --path <type>
               Show paths that Open MPI/SHMEM was configured with.  Accepts the following parameters: prefix, bindir, libdir, incdir, pkglibdir, sysconfdir.

       --pretty
               When used in conjunction with other parameters, the output is displayed in 'prettyprint' format (default)

       --selected-only
               Show only variables from selected components.

       -V|--version
               Show version of Open MPI/SHMEM.

LEVELS
       1   Basic information of interest to users

       2   Detailed information of interest to users

       3   All remaining information of interest to users

       4   Basic information required for tuning

       5   Detailed information required for tuning

       6   All remaining information required for tuning

       7   Basic information for MPI implementors

       8   Detailed information for MPI implementors

       9   All remaining information for MPI implementors

EXAMPLES

       oshmem_info --parsable
           Show the default output of options and listing of installed components in a machine-parsable format.

       oshmem_info --param btl openib
           Show the MCA parameters of the "openib" BTL component in a human-readable / prettyprint format.

       oshmem_info --param btl openib --parsable
           Show the MCA parameters of the "openib" BTL component in a machine-parsable format.

       oshmem_info --path bindir
           Show the "bindir" that Open MPI was configured with.

       oshmem_info --version ompi full --parsable
           Show the full version numbers of Open MPI/SHMEM (including the ORTE and OPAL version numbers) in a machine-readable format.

       oshmem_info --version btl major
           Show the major version number of all BTL components in a prettyprint format.

       oshmem_info --version btl:tcp minor
           Show the minor version number of the TCP BTL component in a prettyprint format.

       oshmem_info --all
           Show all information about the Open MPI/SHMEM installation, including all components that can be found, the MCA parameters that they support, versions of Open MPI/SHMEM and the components, etc.
