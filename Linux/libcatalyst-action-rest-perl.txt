NAME
       Catalyst::Request::REST - A REST-y subclass of Catalyst::Request

SYNOPSIS
            if ( $c->request->accepts('application/json') ) {
                ...
            }

            my $types = $c->request->accepted_content_types();

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of "Catalyst::Request" that applies the Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST role to your request class. That trait adds a few methods to the request object to facilitate writing
       REST-y code.

       This class is only here for backwards compatibility with applications already subclassing this class. New code should use Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST directly.

       Catalyst::Action::REST and Catalyst::Controller::REST will arrange for the request trait to be applied if needed.
