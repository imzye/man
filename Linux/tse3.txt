NAME
       tse3 - Trax Sequencer Engine library version 3.0

SYNOPSIS
       #include files from tse3/*.h.

DESCRIPTION
       The TSE3 library is a powerful third generation sequencer engine written in C++. It is a 'sequencer engine' because it provides the actual driving force elements of a sequencer but provides no form of
       fancy interface. Sequencer applications or multimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3 libraries to provide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.

       TSE3 is a mature library based on a lot of experience. Whilst not providing the user interface, it provides a lot of assistance to a UI.  TSE3 is supplied with a suite of utilities that act  on  songs
       (or parts of a song) as well as common application support services (such as undo/redoable commands).

       TSE3  uses  an advanced, acclaimed 'object-oriented' song structure and incorporates functionality including a mixing desk, real time song alteration, song file save/load (both standard MIDI files and
       proprietary format) and so on.

       For more documentation on the TSE3 library look in the 'doc' directory in the source distribution package.

BUGS
       Naturally, TSE3 is completely bug free. However, if you do find something goes wrong then contact the author. The program can only be improved with your feedback.
