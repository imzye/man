NAME
       fping6 - backwards compatibility with fping below version 4.0

SYNOPSIS
       fping6 [ options ] [ systems... ]

DESCRIPTION
       fping6 is a backwards-compatibility symbolic link to fping solely for the purpose to be able to specify Smokeping remote configurations which work on systems
       with fping ≥ 4.0 as well as on systems with fping < 4.0.

       Please do not use fping in in scripts or configurations which don't require it for backwards-compatibility with older fping versions. It will vanish as soon
       as it's no more required in setups as mentioned above.
