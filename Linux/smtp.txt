NAME
       smtp - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol client

SYNOPSIS
       smtp [-Chnv] [-F from] [-H helo] [-s server] [recipient ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The smtp utility is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) client which
       can be used to run an SMTP transaction against an SMTP server.

       By default, smtp reads the mail content from the standard input, estab‐
       lishes an SMTP session, and runs an SMTP transaction for all the speci‐
       fied recipients.  The content is sent unaltered as mail data.

       The options are as follows:

            -C     Do not require server certificate to be valid.

            -F from
                   Set the return-path (MAIL FROM) for the SMTP transaction.
                   Default to the current username.

            -H helo
                   Define the hostname to advertise (HELO) when establishing
                   the SMTP session.

            -h     Display version and usage.

            -n     Do not actually execute a transaction, just try to estab‐
                   lish an SMTP session and quit.  When this option is given,
                   no message is read from the standard input.

            -s server
                   Specify the server to connect to and connection parameters.
                   The format is Sm off [proto :// [user: pass @]] host [:
