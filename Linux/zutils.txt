NAME
       zcat - decompress and concatenate files to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       zcat [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       zcat  copies  each file argument to standard output in sequence. If any file given is compressed, its decompressed content is copied. If a file given does not exist, and its name does not end with
       one of the known extensions, zcat tries the compressed file names corresponding to the formats supported until one is found. If a file fails to decompress, zcat continues copying the rest  of  the
       files.

       If  a  file is specified as '-', data are read from standard input, decompressed if needed, and sent to standard output. Data read from standard input must be of the same type; all uncompressed or
       all in the same compressed format.

       If no files are specified, recursive searches examine the current working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.

       The formats supported are bzip2, gzip, lzip, xz, and zstd.

       Exit status is 0 if no errors occurred, 1 otherwise.
