NAME
       srmsync - download for SRM PowerControl

SYNOPSIS
       srmsync [options] path

DESCRIPTION
       srmsync implements the serial protocols for SRM's PowerControl V, VI and 7.  It allows you to download data from the PC attached to the serial device at path.

       Data is stored in a srmwin compatible file store. If possible only data not known to the srmwin file store is downloaded.

OPTIONS
       Options available for the srmsync command:

       -a, --all
              Try to download data "deleted" on the PCV.  (PCVI and PC7 don't seem to support getting "deleted" data).

       -b, --baud=rate
              Use specified baudrate, only. By default all supported baudrates are probed. PCV factory setting is 9600 baud. PCVI and PV7 always use 38400.

       -d, --dup
              download/save data known to srmwin store, as well.

       -f, --ftdi
              use ftdi serial driver and open device by the given description.

       -h, --help
              A brief message.

       -p, --pc=type
              Type of PowerControl protocol to use. Supported are PowerControl 5, 6, and 7.  Default is "5".

       -s, --split=seconds
              Split data on gaps of specified minimum length. Time is given as 10*seconds (see --recint for srmcmd).

       -S, --store=dir
              Path for your srmwin file store. That's where the _name.SRM folders are in.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose status messages.

       -V, --version
              show srmsync version number and exit.

       -w, --write=destination
              Write data retrieved from to specified wkt file before splitting.

EXAMPLES
        srmsync -S ~/srmwin /dev/ttyUSB0       # linux
        srmsync -S ~/srmwin -p 7 /dev/ttyUSB0       # linux, PowerControl 7

       This is just a very simplistic frontend for the lib. Please check the source distribution for details.

BUGS
       Yes. For sure. Just keep in mind, that protocol and file formats are reverse engineered...
