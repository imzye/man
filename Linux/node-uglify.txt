NAME
       uglifyjs - JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit

DESCRIPTION
       uglifyjs input1.js [input2.js ...] [options] Use a single dash to read input from the standard input.

       NOTE:  by default there is no mangling/compression.  Without [options] it will simply parse input files and dump the AST with whitespace and comments discarded. To achieve compression and mangling
       you need to use `-c` and `-m`.

OPTIONS
       --help Show help                              [boolean]

       --source-map
              Specify an output file where to generate source map.                                    [string]

       --source-map-root
              The path to the original source to be included in the source map.                      [string]

       --source-map-url
              The path to the source map to be added in //# sourceMappingURL. Defaults to the value passed with --source-map.                      [string]

       --source-map-inline
              Write base64-encoded source map to the end of js output. Disabled by default            [boolean]

       --source-map-include-sources
              Pass this flag if you want to include the content of source files in the source map as sourcesContent property.               [boolean]

       --in-source-map
              Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was generated from some other original code.

       --screw-ie8
              Do not support Internet Explorer 6/7/8. This flag is enabled by default.            [boolean]

       --support-ie8
              Support non-standard Internet Explorer 6/7/8 javascript.                            [boolean]

       --expr Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for parsing JSON)                     [boolean]

       -p, --prefix
              Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also specify -p relative,
              which will make UglifyJS figure out itself the relative paths between original sources, the source map and the output file.

              [string]

       -o, --output
              Output file (default STDOUT).

       -b, --beautify
              Beautify output/specify output options. [string]

       -m, --mangle
              Mangle names/pass mangler options.      [string]

       -r, --reserved
              Reserved names to exclude from mangling.

       -c, --compress
              Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no argument to use the default compression options.

              [string]

       -d, --define
              Global definitions                      [string]

       -e, --enclose
              Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable parameter/argument list.   [string]

       --comments
              Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments that contain "@license" or "@preserve". You can optionally pass one of the
              following arguments to this flag: - "all" to keep all comments - a valid JS RegExp like `/foo/`or `/^!/` to keep only matching comments.  Note that currently not *all* comments can be  kept
              when compression is on, because of dead code removal or cascading statements into sequences.                              [string]

       --preamble
              Preamble to prepend to the output. You can use this to insert a comment, for example for licensing information. This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust for its presence.

       --stats
              Display operations run time on STDERR. [boolean]

       --acorn
              Use Acorn for parsing.                 [boolean]

       --spidermonkey
              Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).                             [boolean]

       --self Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)          [boolean]

       --wrap Embed everything in a big function, making the ???exports??? and ???global??? variables available. You need to pass an argument to this option to specify the name that your module will take
              when included in, say, a browser.            [string]

       --export-all
              Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to automatically export all globals.

              [boolean]

       --lint Display some scope warnings            [boolean]

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose                                [boolean]

       -V, --version
              Show version number                    [boolean]

       --noerr
              Don't throw an error for unknown options in -c, -b or -m.                              [boolean]

       --bare-returns
              Allow return outside of functions. Useful when minifying CommonJS modules.            [boolean]

       --keep-fnames
              Do not mangle/drop function names. Useful for code relying on Function.prototype.name.

              [boolean]

       --reserved-file
              File containing reserved names           [array]

       --reserve-domprops
              Make (most?) DOM properties reserved for --mangle-props                         [boolean]

       --mangle-props
              Mangle property names (0 - disabled, 1 - mangle all properties, 2 - mangle unquoted properies)

       --mangle-regex
              Only mangle property names matching the regex

       --name-cache
              File to hold mangled names mappings     [string]

              Dump SpiderMonkey AST to stdout.       [boolean]

       --wrap-iife
              Wrap IIFEs in parenthesis. Note: this disables the negate_iife compression option     [boolean]

              Quote style (0 - auto, 1 - single, 2 - double, 3 - original)
