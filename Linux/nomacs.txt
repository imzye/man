NAME
       nomacs - is a free, open source image viewer, which supports multiple platforms.

SYNOPSIS
       nomacs [file]

DESCRIPTION
       nomacs is a free, open source image viewer, which supports multiple platforms. You can use it for viewing all common image formats including RAW and psd images.  nomacs includes image manipulation
       methods  for  adjusting  brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma, exposure. It has a pseudo color function which allows creating false color images. A unique feature of nomacs is the synchro‐
       nization of multiple instances. With this feature you can easily compare images by zooming and/or panning at the exactly same position or even by overlaying them with different opacity.  nomacs is
       licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 and available for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and OS/2. It is free for private and commercial use.
