NAME
       GnuPG - The GNU Privacy Guard suite of programs

DESCRIPTION
       GnuPG  is  a set of programs for public key encryption and digital signatures.  The program most users will want to use is the OpenPGP command line tool, named gpg2.  gpgvis a stripped down version of
       gpg2 with no encryption functionality, used only to verify signatures against a trusted keyring.  gpgsm is the X.509/CMS (for S/MIME) counterpart of gpg2. gpg-agent is a  passphrase  and  private  key
       daemon which may also emulate the ssh-agent.
