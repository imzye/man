NAME
       airspy_gpiodir - reconfigure GPIO Direction

DESCRIPTION
       The Airspy is a tiny and efficient software defined radio receiver.

       WARNING this tool reconfigures AirSpy GPIO Direction IN/OUT and can destroy GPIO/MCU in case of mistake

SYNOPSIS
       airspy_gpiodir

OPTIONS
       -p, --port_no <p>: set port number<p>[0,7] for subsequent read/write operations0

       -n, --pin_no <n>: set pin number<n>[0,31] for subsequent read/write operations0

       -r, --read: read port number/pin number direction specified by last -n argument, or all port/pin0

       -w, --write <v>: write value port direction specified by last -n argument with value<v>[0,1]0

       [-s serial_number_64bits]: Open board with specified 64bits serial number.0

Examples
       <command> -p 0 -n 12 -r # reads gpio port direction from port 0 pin number 120

       <command> -r          # reads gpio direction all pins on all ports0

       <command> -p 0 -n 10 -w 1 # writes gpio direction port 0 pin number 10 with 1(output) decimal0
