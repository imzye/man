NAME
       connman-ui-gtk - GTK tray icon for ConnMan

DESCRIPTION
       A full-featured GTK based trayicon UI for ConnMan.

       It targets all WM/DM users but Gnome3 ones*. It works on any Linux WM/DM which provides a freedesktop compliant system tray. (kde, awesome, ...)

       It  exposes  almost  all  features  provided  by ConnMan API (small features are missing, see TODO for more information). You can enable/disable a technology (wired, wifi, cellular, bt, ...), con‐
       nect/disconnect a service, configure a service (IPv4, IPv6, DNS, Timeservers, etc...), share your current connection (tethering) and so on. Everything is accessible through the mouse via the tray‐
       icon, all with left and right click.

       This program takes no arguments.
