ORPIERC(5)                                                                      configuration file for the Orpie calculator                                                                      ORPIERC(5)

NAME
       orpierc - is the configuration textfile for the orpie(1) console calculator.

INTRODUCTION
       CAUTION:  while  this manpage should be suitable as a quick reference, it may be subject to miscellaneous shortcomings in typesetting. The definitive documentation is the user manual provided with
       Orpie in PDF format.

       Orpie reads a run-configuration textfile (generally /etc/orpierc or /usr/local/etc/orpierc) to determine key and command bindings. You can create a personalized configuration  file  in  $HOME/.or‐
       pierc,  and  select  bindings that match your usage patterns. The recommended procedure is to ``include'' the orpierc file provided with Orpie (see INCLUDING OTHER RCFILES), and add or remove set‐
       tings as desired.

ORPIERC SYNTAX
       You may notice that the orpierc syntax is similar to the syntax used in the configuration file for the Mutt email client (muttrc).

       Within the orpierc file, strings should be enclosed in double quotes (").  A double quote character inside a string may be represented by \" .  The backslash character must be represented by  dou‐
       bling it (\\).

   INCLUDING OTHER RCFILES
       Syntax: include filename_string
       This syntax can be used to include one run-configuration file within another.  This command could be used to load the default orpierc file (probably found in /etc/orpierc) within your personalized
       rcfile,
        {/.orpierc}. The filename string should be enclosed in quotes.

   SETTING CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       Syntax: set variable=value_string
       Several configuration variables can be set using this syntax; check the CONFIGURATION VARIABLES description to see a list. The variables are unquoted, but the values should be quoted strings.

   CREATING KEY BINDINGS
       Syntax: bind key_identifier operation
       This  command  will  bind  a keypress to execute a calculator operation.  The various operations, which should not be enclosed in quotes, may be found in the section on CALCULATOR OPERATIONS.  Key
       identifiers may be specified by strings that represent a single keypress, for example "m" (quotes included). The key may be prefixed with "\\C" or "\\M" to represent Control or  Meta  (Alt)  modi‐
       fiers, respectively; note that the backslash must be doubled. A number of special keys lack single-character representations, so the following strings may be used to represent them:

       *      "<esc>"

       *      "<tab>"

       *      "<enter>"

       *      "<return>"

       *      "<insert>"

       *      "<home>"

       *      "<end>"

       *      "<pageup>"

       *      "<pagedown>"

       *      "<space>"

       *      "<left>"

       *      "<right>"

       *      "<up>"

       *      "<down>"

       *      "<f1>" to "<f12>"

       Due  to  differences between various terminal emulators, this key identifier syntax may not be adequate to describe every keypress. As a workaround, Orpie will also accept key identifiers in octal
       notation. As an example, you could use \024 (do not enclose it in quotes) to represent Ctrl-T.

       Orpie includes a secondary executable, orpie-curses-keys, that prints out the key identifiers associated with keypresses. You may find it useful when customizing orpierc.

       Multiple keys may be bound to the same operation, if desired.

   REMOVING KEY BINDINGS
       Syntax:
       unbind_function key_identifier
       unbind_command key_identifier
       unbind_edit key_identifier
       unbind_browse key_identifier
       unbind_abbrev key_identifier
       unbind_variable key_identifier
       unbind_integer key_identifier
       These commands will remove key bindings associated with the various entry modes (functions, commands, editing operations, etc.). The key identifiers should be defined using the syntax described in
       the previous section.

   CREATING KEY AUTO-BINDINGS
       Syntax: autobind key_identifier
       In order to make repetitive calculations more pleasant, Orpie offers an automatic key binding feature. When a function or command is executed using its abbreviation, one of the  keys  selected  by
       the autobind syntax will be automatically bound to that operation (unless the operation has already been bound to a key). The current set of autobindings can be viewed in the help panel by execut‐
       ing command_cycle_help (bound to 'h' by default).

       The syntax for the key identifiers is provided in the previous section.

   CREATING OPERATION ABBREVIATIONS
       Syntax: abbrev operation_abbreviation operation
       You  can  use  this syntax to set the abbreviations used within Orpie to represent the various functions and commands. A list of available operations may be found in the CALCULATOR OPERATIONS sec‐
       tion.  The operation abbreviations should be quoted strings, for example "sin" or "log".

       Orpie performs autocompletion on these abbreviations, allowing you to type usually just a few letters in order to select the desired command. The order of the autocompletion matches  will  be  the
       same as the order in which the abbreviations are registered by the rcfile--so you may wish to place the more commonly used operation abbreviations earlier in the list.

       Multiple abbreviations may be bound to the same operation, if desired.

   REMOVING OPERATION ABBREVIATIONS
       Syntax: unabbrev operation_abbreviation
       This syntax can be used to remove an operation abbreviation. The operation abbreviations should be quoted strings, as described in the previous section.

   CREATING MACROS
       Syntax: macro key_identifier macro_string
       You  can  use  this  syntax to cause a single keypress (the key_identifier) to be interpreted as the series of keypresses listed in macro_string.  The syntax for defining a keypress is the same as
       that defined in the section on CREATING KEY BINDINGS.  The macro string should be a list of whitespace-separated keypresses, e.g.  "2 <return> 2 +" (including quotes).

       This macro syntax provides a way to create small programs; by way of example, the default orpierc file includes macros for the base 2 logarithm and the binary entropy function (bound to L  and  H,
       respectively), as well as ``register'' variable shortcuts (<f1> to <f12>).

       Macros may call other macros recursively. However, take care that a macro does not call itself recursively; Orpie will not trap the infinite loop.

       Note that operation abbreviations may be accessed within macros. For example, macro "A" "' a b o u t <return>" would bind A to display the ``about Orpie'' screen.

   CREATING UNITS
       Syntax:
       base_unit unit_symbol preferred_prefix
       unit unit_symbol unit_definition
       Units are defined in a two-step process:

       1.     Define  a  set of orthogonal ``base units.'' All other units must be expressible in terms of these base units. The base units can be given a preferred SI prefix, which will be used whenever
              the units are standardized (e.g. via ustand).  The unit symbols and preferred prefixes should all be quoted strings; to prefer no prefix, use the empty string ("").

       It is expected that most users will use the fundamental SI units for base units.

       2.     Define all other units in terms of either base units or previously-defined units.  Again, the unit symbol and unit definition should be quoted strings. The definition should take  the  form
              of a numeric value followed by a units string, e.g.  "2.5_kN*m/s". See the UNITS FORMATTING section for more details on the unit string format.

   CREATING CONSTANTS
       Syntax: constant constant_symbol constant_definition
       This  syntax  can  be  used  to define a physical constant. Both the constant symbol and definition must be quoted strings. The constant definition should be a numeric constant followed by a units
       string e.g. "1.60217733e-19_C".  All units used in the constant definition must already have been defined.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The following configuration variables may be set as described in the SETTING CONFIGURATION VARIABLES section.

       *      datadir
              This variable should be set to the full path of the Orpie data directory, which will contain the calculator state save file, temporary buffers, etc.  The default directory is "\~/.orpie/".

       *      editor
              This variable may be set to the fullscreen editor of your choice. The default value is "vi". It is recommended that you choose an editor that offers horizontal scrolling in  place  of  word
              wrapping, so that the columns of large matrices can be properly aligned. (The Vim editor could be used in this fashion by setting editor to "vim -c 'set nowrap'".)

       *      hide_help
              Set this variable to "true" to hide the left help/status panel, or leave it on the default of "false" to display the help panel.

       *      conserve_memory
              Set  this  variable  to "true" to minimize memory usage, or leave it on the default of "false" to improve rendering performance. (By default, Orpie caches multiple string representations of
              all stack elements. Very large integers in particular require significant computation for string representation, so caching these strings can make display updates much faster.)

CALCULATOR OPERATIONS
       Every calculator operation can be made available to the interface using the syntax described in the sections on CREATING KEY BINDINGS and CREATING OPERATION ABBREVIATIONS.  The following is a list
       of every available operation.

   FUNCTIONS
       The following operations are functions--that is, they will consume at least one argument from the stack. Orpie will generally abort the computation and provide an informative error  message  if  a
       function cannot be successfully applied (for example, if you try to compute the transpose of something that is not a matrix).

       For  the exact integer data type, basic arithmetic operations will yield an exact integer result. Division of two exact integers will yield the quotient of the division. The more complicated func‐
       tions will generally promote the integer to a real number, and as such the arithmetic will no longer be exact.

       *      function_10_x
              Raise 10 to the power of the last stack element (inverse of function_log10).

       *      function_abs
              Compute the absolute value of the last stack element.

       *      function_acos
              Compute the inverse cosine of the last stack element. For real numbers, The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       *      function_acosh
              Compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the last stack element.

       *      function_add
              Add last two stack elements.

       *      function_arg
              Compute the argument (phase angle of complex number) of the last stack element. The value will be provided in either degrees or radians, depending on the current angle mode of the  calcula‐
              tor.

       *      function_asin
              Compute the inverse sine of the last stack element. For real numbers, The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       *      function_asinh
              Compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of the last stack element.

       *      function_atan
              Compute the inverse tangent of the last stack element. For real numbers, The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       *      function_atanh
              Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the last stack element.

       *      function_binomial_coeff
              Compute  the  binomial  coefficient (``n choose k'') formed by the last two stack elements. If these arguments are real, the coefficient is computed using a fast approximation to the log of
              the gamma function, and therefore the result is subject to rounding errors. For exact integer arguments, the coefficient is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential to  be  a
              slow operation.

       *      function_ceiling
              Compute the ceiling of the last stack element.

       *      function_convert_units
              Convert stack element 2 to an equivalent expression in the units of element 1. Element 1 should be real-valued, and its magnitude will be ignored when computing the conversion.

       *      function_cos
              Compute the cosine of the last stack element. If the argument is real, it will be assumed to be either degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       *      function_cosh
              Compute the hyperbolic cosine of the last stack element.

       *      function_exp
              Evaluate the exponential function of the last stack element.

       *      function_factorial
              Compute  the factorial of the last stack element. For a real argument, this is computed using a fast approximation to the gamma function, and therefore the result may be subject to rounding
              errors (or overflow). For an exact integer argument, the factorial is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential to be a slow operation.

       *      function_floor
              Compute the floor of the last stack element.

       *      function_gamma
              Compute the Euler gamma function of the last stack element.

       *      function_gcd

              Compute the multiplicative inverse of the last stack element.

       *      function_lcm
              Compute the least common multiple of the last two stack elements. This operation may be applied only to integer type data.

       *      function_maximum
              Find the maximum values of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result.

       *      function_minimum

       *      function_mean
              Compute the sample means of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result.

       *      function_mod
              Compute element 2 mod element 1. This operation can be applied only to integer type data.

       *      function_mult
              Multiply last two stack elements.

       *      function_neg
              Negate last stack element.

       *      function_permutation
              Compute the permutation coefficient determined by the last two stack elements 'n' and 'k': the number of ways of obtaining an ordered subset of k elements from a  set  of  n  elements.   If
              these  arguments are real, the coefficient is computed using a fast approximation to the log of the gamma function, and therefore the result is subject to rounding errors. For exact integer
              arguments, the coefficient is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential to be a slow operation.

       *      function_pow
              Raise element 2 to the power of element 1.

              Compute the real part of the last stack element.

       *      function_sin

       *      function_solve_linear
              Solve a linear system of the form Ax = b, where A and b are the last two elements on the stack. A must be a square matrix and b must be a matrix with one column. This function does not com‐
              pute inv(A), but obtains the solution by a more efficient LU decomposition method.  This function is recommended over explicitly computing the inverse, especially when solving  linear  sys‐
              tems with relatively large dimension or with poorly conditioned matrices.

       *      function_sq
              Square the last stack element.

       *      function_sqrt
              Compute the square root of the last stack element.

       *      function_standardize_units
              Convert the last stack element to an equivalent expression using the SI standard base units (kg, m, s, etc.).

       *      function_stdev_unbiased
              Compute the unbiased sample standard deviation of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result. (Compare to HP48's sdev function.)

       *      function_stdev_biased
              Compute the biased (population) sample standard deviation of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result. (Compare to HP48's psdev function.)

       *      function_tan
              Compute the tangent of the last stack element. If the argument is real, it will be assumed to be either degrees or radians, depending on the angle mode of the calculator.

       *      function_tanh
              Compute the hyperbolic tangent of the last stack element.

       *      function_to_int
              Convert a real number to an integer type.

       *      function_to_real
              Convert an integer type to a real number.

       *      function_total
              Sum each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result.

              Compute the trace of a square matrix.

       *      function_transpose

              Drop the units of the last stack element.

       *      function_utpn
              Compute the upper tail probability of a normal distribution.
              UTPN(m, v, x) = Integrate[ 1/Sqrt[2 Pi v] Exp[-(m-y)^2/(2 v)], {y, x, Infinity}]

       *      function_var_unbiased
              Compute the unbiased sample variance of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result. (Compare to HP48's var function.)

       *      function_var_biased
              Compute the biased (population) sample variance of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result. (Compare to HP48's pvar function.)

   COMMANDS
       The following operations are referred to as commands; they differ from functions because they do not take an argument. Many calculator interface settings are implemented as commands.

   EDIT OPERATIONS
       The  following  operations are related to editing during data entry. These commands cannot be made available as operation abbreviations, since abbreviations are not accessible while entering data.
