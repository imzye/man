       nabi [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nabi command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       -s --status-only

       --sm-client-id=ID
           Specifies the session management ID. This option is for session manager software, not for user typing.

       --xim-name=NAME
           Specifies the name of nabi's XIM service ("nabi" when it's not specified). Useful for debugging.
