SNMPTRAPD.CONF(5)                                                                                 Net-SNMP                                                                                SNMPTRAPD.CONF(5)

NAME
       snmptrapd.conf - configuration file for the Net-SNMP notification receiver

DESCRIPTION
       The  Net-SNMP  notification  receiver  (trap daemon) uses one or more configuration files to control its operation and how incoming traps (and INFORM requests) should be processed.  This file (sn‐
       mptrapd.conf) can be located in one of several locations, as described in the snmp_config(5) manual page.

IMPORTANT
       Previously, snmptrapd would accept all incoming notifications, and log them automatically (even if no explicit configuration was provided).  Starting with release 5.3, access control  checks  will
       be applied to incoming notifications. If snmptrapd is run without a suitable configuration file (or equivalent access control settings), then such traps WILL NOT be processed.  See the section AC‐
       CESS CONTROL for more details.

       As with the agent configuration, the snmptrapd.conf directives can be divided into four distinct groups.

TRAPD BEHAVIOUR
       snmpTrapdAddr [<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>[,...]
              defines  a list of listening addresses, on which to receive incoming SNMP notifications.  See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8) manual page for more information about the for‐
              mat of listening addresses.

              The default behaviour is to listen on UDP port 162 on all IPv4 interfaces.

       doNotRetainNotificationLogs yes
              disables support for the NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB.  Normally the snmptrapd program keeps a record of the traps received, which can be retrieved  by  querying  the  nlmLogTable  and  nlmLogvari‐
              ableTable tables.  This directive can be used to suppress this behaviour.

              See the snmptrapd(8) manual page and the NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB for details.

       doNotLogTraps yes
              disables the logging of notifications altogether.  This is useful if the snmptrapd application should only run traphandle hooks and should not log traps to any location.

       doNotFork yes
              do not fork from the calling shell.

       pidFile PATH
              defines a file in which to store the process ID of the notification receiver.  By default, this ID is not saved.

ACCESS CONTROL
       Starting  with  release 5.3, it is necessary to explicitly specify who is authorised to send traps and informs to the notification receiver (and what types of processing these are allowed to trig‐
       ger).  This uses an extension of the VACM model, used in the main SNMP agent.

       There are currently three types of processing that can be specified:

              log    log the details of the notification - either in a specified file, to standard output (or stderr), or via syslog (or similar).

              execute
                     pass the details of the trap to a specified handler program, including embedded perl.

              net    forward the trap to another notification receiver.

       In the following directives, TYPES will be a (comma-separated) list of one or more of these tokens.  Most commonly, this will typically be log,execute,net to cover any style of  processing  for  a
       particular category of notification. But it is perfectly possible (even desirable) to limit certain notification sources to selected processing only.

       authCommunity   TYPES COMMUNITY  [SOURCE [OID | -v VIEW ]]
              authorises  traps (and SNMPv2c INFORM requests) with the specified community to trigger the types of processing listed.  By default, this will allow any notification using this community to
              be processed.  The SOURCE field can be used to specify that the configuration should only apply to notifications received from particular sources - see snmpd.conf(5) for more details.

       authUser   TYPES [-s MODEL] USER  [LEVEL [OID | -v VIEW ]]
              authorises SNMPv3 notifications with the specified user to trigger the types of processing listed.  By default, this will accept authenticated requests.  (authNoPriv or authPriv). The LEVEL
              field can be used to allow unauthenticated notifications (noauth), or to require encryption (priv), just as for the SNMP agent.

              With both of these directives, the OID (or -v VIEW) field can be used to retrict this configuration to the processing of particular notifications.

              Note:  Unlike the VACM processing described in RFC 3415, this view is only matched against the snmpTrapOID value of the incoming notification.  It is not applied  to  the  payload  varbinds
                     held within that notification.

       authGroup  TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP  [LEVEL [OID | -v VIEW ]]

       authAccess TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP VIEW  [LEVEL [CONTEXT]]

       setAccess GROUP CONTEXT MODEL LEVEL PREFIX VIEW TYPES
              authorise notifications in the specified GROUP (configured using the group directive) to trigger the types of processing listed.  See snmpd.conf(5) for more details.

       createUser [-e  ENGINEID] username (MD5|SHA|SHA-512|SHA-384|SHA-256|SHA-224) authpassphrase [DES|AES]
              See the snmpd.conf(5) manual page for a description of how to create SNMPv3 users.  This is roughly the same, but the file name changes to snmptrapd.conf from snmpd.conf.

       disableAuthorization yes
              will disable the above access control checks, and revert to the previous behaviour of accepting all incoming notifications.

LOGGING
       format1 FORMAT

       format2 FORMAT
              specify the format used to display SNMPv1 TRAPs and SNMPv2 notifications respectively.  Note that SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 both use the same SNMPv2 PDU format.

       format DESTINATION FORMAT
              specify the format used for different destinations.  DESTINATION is one of: print, print1, print2, syslog, syslog1, syslog2, execute, execute1, execute2.  print1 is used for printing SNMPv1
              traps,  print2  is  for  SNMPv2.   print is used for both versions.  syslog is similarly used when sending traps to syslog, and execute used when sending traps to a program such as traptoe‐
              mail(1).

              The default formats are
              format print1 %.4y-%.2m-%.2l %.2h:%.2j:%.2k %B [%b] (via %A [%a]): %N\n\t%W Trap (%q) Uptime: %#T\n%v\n
              format print2 %.4y-%.2m-%.2l %.2h:%.2j:%.2k %B [%b]:\n%v\n
              format syslog1 %a: %W Trap (%q) Uptime: %#T%#v\n
              format syslog2 %B [%b]: Trap %#v\n
              format execute %B\n%b\n%V\n%v\n

              See snmptrapd(8) for the layout characters available.

       ignoreAuthFailure yes
              instructs the receiver to ignore authenticationFailure traps.

              Note:  This currently only affects the logging of such notifications.  authenticationFailure traps will still be passed to trap handler scripts, and  forwarded  to  other  notification  re‐
                     ceivers.  This behaviour should not be relied on, as it is likely to change in future versions.

       logOption string
              specifies  where  notifications should be logged - to standard output, standard error, a specified file or via syslog.  See the section LOGGING OPTIONS in the snmpcmd(1) manual page for de‐
              tails.

       outputOption string
              specifies various characteristics of how OIDs and other values should be displayed.  See the section OUTPUT OPTIONS in the snmpcmd(1) manual page for details.

MySQL Logging
       There are two configuration variables that work together to control when queued traps are logged to the MySQL database. A non-zero value must be specified for sqlSaveInterval to enable MySQL  log‐
       ging.

       sqlMaxQueue max
              specifies the maximum number of traps to queue before a forced flush to the MySQL database.

       sqlSaveInterval seconds
              specified the number of seconds between periodic queue flushes.  A value of 0 for will disable MySQL logging.

NOTIFICATION PROCESSING
       As well as logging incoming notifications, they can also be forwarded on to another notification receiver, or passed to an external program for specialised processing.

       traphandle OID|default PROGRAM [ARGS ...]
              invokes  the  specified program (with the given arguments) whenever a notification is received that matches the OID token.  For SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 notifications, this token will be compared
              against the snmpTrapOID value taken from the notification.  For SNMPv1 traps, the generic and specific trap values and the enterprise OID will be converted into the equivalent OID  (follow‐
              ing RFC 2576).

              Typically,  the  OID token will be the name (or numeric OID) of a NOTIFICATION-TYPE object, and the specified program will be invoked for notifications that match this OID exactly.  However
              this token also supports a simple form of wildcard suffixing.  By appending the character ´*' to the OID token, the corresponding program will be invoked for any notification  based  within
              subtree  rooted  at  the  specified  OID.  For example, an OID token of .1.3.6.1.4.1* would match any enterprise specific notification (including the specified OID itself).  An OID token of
              .1.3.6.1.4.1.* would would work in much the same way, but would not match this exact OID - just notifications that lay strictly below this root.  Note that this syntax does not support full
              regular expressions or wildcards - an OID token of the form oid.*.subids is not valid.

              If the OID field is the token default then the program will be invoked for any notification not matching another (OID specific) traphandle entry.

       Details of the notification are fed to the program via its standard input.  Note that this will always use the SNMPv2-style notification format, with SNMPv1 traps being converted as per RFC  2576,
       before being passed to the program.  The input format is, if you use the default set by the "format execute %B\n%b\n%V\n%v\n", one entry per line:

              HOSTNAME
                     The name of the host that sent the notification, as determined by gethostbyaddr(3).

              ADDRESS
                     The transport address, like
                     "[UDP: [172.16.10.12]:23456->[10.150.0.8]]"

              VARBINDS
                     A list of variable bindings describing the contents of the notification, one per line.  The first token on each line (up until a space) is the OID of the varind, and the remainder of
                     the line is its value.  The format of both of these are controlled by the outputOption directive (or similar configuration).

                     The  first  OID  should always be SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0, and the second should be SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapOID.0.  The remaining lines will contain the payload varbind list.  For SNMPv1
                     traps, the final OID will be SNMPv2-MIB::snmpTrapEnterprise.0.

              Example:
                     A traptoemail script has been included in the Net-SNMP package that can be used within a traphandle directive:

                     traphandle default /usr/bin/perl /usr/bin/traptoemail -s mysmtp.somewhere.com -f admin@somewhere.com me@somewhere.com

       forward OID|default DESTINATION
              forwards notifications that match the specified OID to another receiver listening on DESTINATION.  The interpretation of OID (and default) is the same as for the traphandle directive).

              See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8) manual page for more information about the format of listening addresses.

       addForwarderInfo 1|yes|true|0|no|false

              Each time a trap is forwarded, add an OID with the IP address of the system from which the trap has been received. The following OID is added: .1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.3.x (SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::sn‐
              mpTrapAddress.x) where x is the lowest index >= 0 that does not yet occur in the trap payload. The end recipient (i.e. the monitoring system) can determine the IPv4 address of the  original
              sender by looking for the varbind with OID snmpTrapAddress.0. If that OID is not populated it means that the trap has been sent directly or in other words that it has not been forwarded.

NOTES
       o      The daemon blocks while executing the traphandle commands.  (This should be fixed in the future with an appropriate signal catch and wait() combination).

       o      All  directives  listed  with  a value of "yes" actually accept a range of boolean values.  These will accept any of 1, yes or true to enable the corresponding behaviour, or any of 0, no or
              false to disable it.  The default in each case is for the feature to be turned off, so these directives are typically only used to enable the appropriate behaviour.
