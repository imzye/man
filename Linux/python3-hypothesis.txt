NAME
       hypothesis - helper tool for property-based testing

SYNOPSIS
       hypothesis codemod PATH

       hypothesis write [OPTIONS] FUNCTION [FUNCTION ...]

DESCRIPTION
       hypothesis helps you write and maintain property-based tests in your Python project.

       hypothesis codemod refactors deprecated or inefficient code, rewriting files in place.  It has no additional options.

       hypothesis write writes property-based tests for you. Type annotations are helpful but not required. The following options are recognized:

       --roundtrip
              write roundtrip tests for write/read or encode/decode functions.

              Example: hypothesis write --roundtrip json.dumps json.loads

       --equivalent
              write tests whether two functions behave identically.

              Example: hypothesis write --equivalent ast.literal_eval eval

       --errors-equivalent
              like --equivalent, but also allows consistent errors.

       --idempotent
              write tests whether a function is idempotent.

       --binary-op
              write tests for associativity, commutativity and identitiy element.

              Example: hypothesis write --binary-op operator.add

       --except CLASS
              dotted name of exception to ignore. can be specified multiple times.

       --annotate, --no-annotate
              force tests to be type-annotated (or not).

       --style=STYLE
              write tests as pytest functions or unittest methods.
