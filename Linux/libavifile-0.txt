NAME
       avifile-config - script to get information about the installed version of avifile

SYNOPSIS
       avifile-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       avifile-config  is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use avi‐
       file. It is also used internally to the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf that are included with avifile.

OPTIONS
       --version Print the currently installed version of avifile on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a avifile program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a avifile program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that avifile was built with when computing the output for the  --cflags  and  --libs  op‐
               tions.  This  option is also used for the exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags
               options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that avifile was built with when computing the output for the  --cflags  and  --libs
               options.  This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --data-dir
               Print the data dir used for avifile program.
