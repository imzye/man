NAME
       oem-config-firstboot — run oem-config on first boot after shipping to end user

SYNOPSIS
       oem-config-firstboot [--debug] [--automatic]

DESCRIPTION
       oem-config-firstboot  performs some minor set-up before calling oem-config(8) (possibly via oem-config-dm(8)) to ask configuration questions of the end user.  It will call oem-config(8) up to
       five times until it succeeds (exiting zero).  If it succeeds, it will clean up the temporary OEM configuration user created during initial installation, and arrange  for  oem-config-firstboot
       not to be run again.  If it fails every time, it will drop to a shell to help the end user fix things up.

       oem-config-firstboot is suitable for calling from an init script, and is not intended to be run directly by users.

       The following options are available:

       -d, --debug
             Run in debugging mode, sending verbose information to /var/log/oem-config.log that may be useful to developers.  Note that passwords will be logged in debugging mode!

             In debugging mode, oem-config-firstboot will only try to run oem-config(8) once, and will not provide a panic shell on failure.

       --automatic
             Run  in automatic mode, read a preseed file, quietly apply all preseeded values and do not ask any questions for already preseeded answers.  If the option automatic-oem-config is set on
             the kernel command line at boot time, this option is used automatically.
