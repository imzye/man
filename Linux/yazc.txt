NAME
       yazc - yet another zip cracker

SYNOPSIS
       yazc [-h] [-V]
       yazc COMMAND OPTIONS... FILE

DESCRIPTION
       yazc cracks password protected zip files. Three attack methods are supported: bruteforce, dictionary and plaintext.

       Note: Only files encrypted using the legacy Pkware encryption method are supported.

BRUTEFORCE
       The bruteforce command tries every possible character combination. A general rule of thumb is to use this command when you suspect the password to be 8 characters or less.

       -c, --charset=CHARSET
              Set the character set to CHARSET.

       -i, --initial=STRING
              Set the initial password to STRING.

       -l, --length=NUM
              Set the maximum password length to LENGTH characters.

       -a, --alpha
              Use characters [a-z].

       -A, --alpha-caps
              Use characters [A-Z].

       -n, --numeric
              Use characters [0-9].

       -s, --special
              Use special characters "!:$%&/()=?{[]}+-*~#@|;".

       -t, --threads=NUM
              Distribute load to NUM threads. For maximum performance, this should be set to the number of logical processors available.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

DICTIONARY
       The dictionary command reads passwords from a text file (or stdin if no file argument is provided). It is assumed that each password is separated by a newline.

       -d, --dictionary=FILE
              Read passwords from FILE.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

PLAINTEXT
       The plaintext command uses a known vulnerability in the pkzip stream cipher to find the internal representation of the encryption key. To use this attack type, you need at least 13 known plaintext
       bytes from any file in the archive. Generally, this means that you need to obtain at least 13 bytes of the compressed stream before it was encrypted.

       The plaintext command can be used either with the raw byte offsets (-o option) or by using the zip file entry name.

       -o, --offset
              Use raw byte offsets instead of entry names.

       -t, --threads=NUM
              Distribute load to NUM threads.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

INFO
       The info command lists the filenames, offsets and the encryption header for each file in the archive. This is useful to determine what configuration to pass to the plaintext command.

EXAMPLES
       Use a bruteforce attack on file archive.zip using only lower case letters and distribute the load to 8 threads:

              yazc bruteforce -a -t8 archive.zip

       Use a dictionary attack on file archive.zip and use passwords from rockyou.txt:

              cat rockyou.txt | yazc dictionary archive.zip

       Use  a  plaintext  attack on archive.zip. Take plaintext bytes 100 to 650 and map them to ciphertext bytes 112 to 662. Use these bytes to reduce the number of keys and perform the attack. Once the
       intermediate key is found, decrypt the rest of the cipher (begins at offset 64) to get the internal representation (the encryption key derived from the password). If possible the actual (or equiv‐
       alent) password will also be recovered and printed.

              yazc plaintext -o plain.bin 100 650 archive.zip 112 662 64
