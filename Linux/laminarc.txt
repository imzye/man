NAME
       laminarc - Laminar CI client application

SYNOPSIS
       laminarc queue JOB [PARAM=VALUE...] ...
       laminarc queue JOB [PARAM=VALUE...] ...
       laminarc queue JOB [PARAM=VALUE...] ...
       laminarc set PARAM=VALUE...
       laminarc show-jobs
       laminarc show-running
       laminarc show-queued
       laminarc abort JOB NUMBER

DESCRIPTION
       The laminarc program connects to a Laminar server and perform one of following operations:

       queue   adds job(s) (with optional parameters) to the queue and returns immediately.

       start   adds job(s) (with optional parameters) to the queue and returns when the jobs begin execution.

       run     adds job(s) (with optional parameters) to the queue and returns when the jobs complete execution. The exit code will be non-zero if any of the runs does not complete successfully.

       set     sets  one  or  more  parameters to be exported as environment variables in subsequent scripts for the run identified by the $JOB and $RUN environment variables.  This is primarily in‐
               tended for use from within a job execution, where those variables are already set by the server.

       show-jobs
               list jobs known to the server.

       show-running
               list the currently running jobs with their numbers.

       show-queued
               list the names and numbers of the jobs waiting in the queue.

       abort   manually abort a currently running job by name and number.

       The laminar server to connect to is read from the LAMINAR_HOST environment variable. If empty, it falls back to LAMINAR_BIND_RPC and finally defaults to unix-abstract:laminar

ENVIRONMENT
       LAMINAR_HOST
               address of server to connect. May be of the form IP:PORT, unix:PATH/TO/SOCKET or unix-abstract:NAME

       LAMINAR_BIND_RPC
               fallback server address variable. It is set by laminard during execution of scripts.
