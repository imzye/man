NAME
       uhd_cal_rx_iq_balance  - Generate RX IQ Balance Calibration Table for a
       UHD Device

DESCRIPTION
       The Universal Software Radio Peripheral Hardware Drivers  handle  cali‐
       bration  information.  This  application reduces RX IQ imbalance within
       the specified frequency range using transmit leakage into  the  receive
       path.  Remove  all  external  hardware from the RF antenna ports before
       using this application. This  can  take  up  to  several  minutes  with
       default settings.

       NOTE:  This  application  can only be used with the WBX, SBX, XCVR2450,
       and RFX daughterboards.

OPTIONS
       --help help message

       --verbose
              enable some verbose

       --args arg
              device address args [default = ""]

       --tx_wave_freq arg (=507123)

              unspecified)

              Frequency stop in Hz (will use end of frequency range if unspec‐
