NAME
       ml-lex - a parser generator for ML

SYNOPSIS
       ml-lex file.lex

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ml-lex command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  The ml-lex proogram
       generates a lexical analyzer from the specification in file.lex, and produces the file, file.lex.sml.

SEE ALSO
       sml(1), ml-yacc(1), ml-makedepend(1), ml-build(1).
       The  programs are documented fully by A lexical analyzer generator for Standard ML, Andrew W. Appel, James S. Mattson, and David R. Tarditi which is available in /usr/share/doc/smlnj-doc/lex‐
       gen.pdf.gz.
