DESCRIPTION

       Unique id for request

   result_msg

Methods
   successful
       Returns true if the result code is of the 1xx (successful) variety.

   warning
       Returns true if the result code is of the 2xx (warning) variety.  The Akamai documentation states that "The remove request has been accepted" even when a warning response is sent.

   accepted
       Returns true if the result code is of the 1xx (successful) or 2xx (warning) varieties.  This indicates that the remove request was accepted by Akamai.  You should still check to see if there was a
       warning, and if their was report it.

   message
        if (!$res_data->accepted()) {
               # These do the same thing:
               die "$res_data";
               die $res_data->message();
        }

       Returns a nicely formatted string containing the result_code and result_msg.
