NAME
       fritzing - from prototype to product

SYNOPSIS
       fritzing

DESCRIPTION
       Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers, artists, researchers and hobbyists to work creatively with interactive electronics. We are creating a software and website in the spirit
       of  Processing  and Arduino, developing a tool that allows users to document their prototypes, share them with others, teach electronics in a classroom, and to create a pcb layout for professional
       manufacturing.
