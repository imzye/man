NAME
       hilive - Realtime Alignment of Illumina Reads

SYNOPSIS
       hilive [options]

DESCRIPTION
       HiLive is a read mapping tool that maps Illumina HiSeq (or comparable) reads to a reference genome right in the moment when they are produced.  This means, read mapping is finished as soon as
       the sequencer is finished generating the data.

OPTIONS
   REQUIRED OPTIONS:
       -b [--bcl-dir]
              Illumina's BaseCalls directory which contains the sequence information of the reads.

       -i [--index]
              Path to the HiLive index.

       -r [--reads]
              Length and types of the read segments.

       Required options might be specified either on the command line or in the config file.

   GENERAL OPTIONS:
       -h [ --help ]
              Print this help message and exit.

       -l [ --license ]
              Print license information and exit.

       -c [ --config ] arg
              Path  to  a  config file. Config file is in .ini format. Duplicate keys are not permitted. Instead, use comma-separated lists. Parameters obtained from the command line are prioritized
              over settings made in the config file.

       Example for a config.ini:
              bcl-dir=./BaseCalls lanes=1 out-cycle=50,100

       --runinfo arg
              Path to Illumina's runInfo.xml file. If specified, read lengths, lane count and tile count are automatically set in accordance with the sequencing run.  Parameters  obtained  from  the
              command line or config file are prioritized over settings obtained from the runInfo.xml.

       --continue arg
              Continue  an interrupted HiLive run from a specified cycle. We strongly recommend to load the config file that was automatically created for the original run to continue with identical
              settings. This config file (hilive_config.ini) can be found in the temporary directory specified with --temp-dir.

   SEQUENCING OPTIONS:
       -b [ --bcl-dir ] arg
              Illumina's BaseCalls directory which contains the sequence information of the reads.

       -l [ --lanes ] arg
              Specify the lanes to be considered for read alignment. [Default: 1-8]

       -t [ --tiles ] arg
              Specify the tiles to be considered for read alignment. [Default: [1-2][1-3][01-16] (96 tiles)]

       -T [ --max-tile ] arg
              Specify the highest tile number. The tile numbers will be computed by this number, considering the correct surface count, swath count and tile count for Illumina sequencing.  This  pa‐
              rameter serves as a shortcut for --tiles.

       Example:
              --max-tile 2216

       will activate all tiles in
              [1-2][1-2][01-16].

       -r [ --reads ] arg
              Length  and types of the read segments. Each segment is either a read ('R') or a barcode ('B'). Please give the segments in the correct order as they are produced by the sequencing ma‐
              chine. [REQUIRED]

       Example:
              --reads 101R,8B,8B,101R

       specifies paired-end sequencing with
              2x101bp reads and 2x8bp barcodes.

       -B [ --barcodes ] arg
              Barcode(s) of the sample(s) to be considered for read alignment. Barcodes must match the barcode length(s) as specified with --reads. Delimit different segments of the same barcodes by
              '-' and different barcodes by ','. [Default: All barcodes]

       Example:
              -b ACCG-ATTG,ATGT-TGAC

              for two different barcodes of length 2x4bp.

       --run-id arg
              ID of the sequencing run. Should be obtained from runInfo.xml.

       --flowcell-id arg
              ID of the flowcell. Should be obtained from runInfo.xml.

       --instrument-id arg
              ID of the sequencing machine. Should be obtained from runInfo.xml.

   REPORT OPTIONS:
       -o [ --out-dir ] arg
              Path to the directory that is used for the output files. The directory will be created if it does not exist. [Default: ./out]

       -f [ --out-format ] arg
              Format of the output files. Currently, SAM and BAM format are supported. [Default: BAM]

       -O [ --out-cycles ] arg
              Cycles for that alignment output is written. The respective temporary files are kept. [Default: write only after the last cycle]

       -M [ --out-mode ] arg
              The output mode. [Default: ANYBEST] [ALL|A]: Report all found alignments.  [BESTN#|N#]: Report the # best found alignments.  [ALLBEST|H]: Report all  found  alignments  with  the  best
              score.  [ANYBEST|B]: Report one best alignment.  [UNIQUE|U]: Report only unique alignments.

       --report-unmapped
              Activate reporting unmapped reads.  [Default: false]

       --extended-cigar
              Activate extended CIGAR format for the alignment output files ('=' for matches and 'X' for mismatches instead of using 'M' for both). [Default: false]

       --force-resort
              Always  sort  temporary  alignment files before writing output. Existing sorted align files are overwritten. This is only necessary if the temp directory is used more than once for new
              alignments. In general, this is not recommended for most applications. [Default: false (only sort if no sorted files exist)]

       --max-softclip-ratio arg
              Maximal relative length of the front softclip (only relevant during output) [Default: 0.2]

       Further explanation:
              HiLive uses an approach that requires one exact match of a k-mer at the beginning of an alignment. This can lead to unaligned regions at the beginning of the read which  we  report  as
              'softclips'. With this parameter, you can control the maximal length of this region.

   ALIGNMENT OPTIONS:
       -i [ --index ] arg
              Path  to  the HiLive index. Please use the executable 'hilive-build' to create a new HiLive index that is delivered with this program. The index consists of several files with the same
              prefix. Please include the file prefix when specifying the index location.

       -m [ --align-mode ] arg
              Alignment mode to balance speed and accuracy [very-fast|fast|balanced|accurate| very-accurate]. This selected mode automatically sets other parameters.  Individually configured parame‐
              ters are prioritized over settings made by selecting an alignment mode. [Default: balanced]

       --anchor-length arg
              Length of the alignment anchor (or initial seed) [Default: set by the selected alignment mode]

       --error-interval arg
              The interval to tolerate more errors during alignment (low=accurate; great=fast).  [Default: 'anchor-length'/2]

       --seeding-interval arg
              The interval to create new seeds (low=accurate; great=fast). [Default: 'anchor-length'/2]

       --max-softclip-length arg
              The maximum length of a front softclip when creating new seeds. In contrast to --max-softclip-ratio, this parameter  may  have  effects  on  runtime  and  mapping  accuracy.  [Default:
              'readlength/2]

       --barcode-errors arg
              The  number  of  errors that are tolerated for the barcode segments. A single value can be provided to be applied for all barcode segments. Alternatively, the value can be set for each
              segment individually.  [Default: 1]

       Example:
              --barcode-errors 2 [2 errors for all barcode segments]

              --barcode-errors 2,1 [2 errors for the first, 1 error for the second segment]

       --align-undetermined-barcodes
              Align all barcodes. Reads with a barcode that don't match one of the barcodes specified with '--barcodes' will be reported as undetermined. [Default: false]

       --min-basecall-quality arg
              Minimum basecall quality for a nucleotide to be considered as a match [Default: 1 (everything but N-calls)]

       --keep-invalid-sequences
              Keep sequences of invalid reads, i.e. with unconsidered barcode or filtered by the sequencer. This option must be activated to report unmapped reads. [Default: false]

   SCORING OPTIONS:
       -s [ --min-as ] arg
              Minimum alignment score. [Default: Set automatically based on the alignment mode and match/mismatch scores]

       --match-score arg
              Score for a match. [Default: 0]

       --mismatch-penalty arg
              Penalty for a mismatch. [Default: 6]

       --insertion-opening-penalty arg
              Penalty for insertion opening. [Default: 5]

       --insertion-extension-penalty arg Penalty for insertion extension. [Default: 3]

       --deletion-opening-penalty arg
              Penalty for deletion opening. [Default: 5]

       --deletion-extension-penalty arg
              Penalty for deletion extension. [Default: 3]

       --max-gap-length arg
              Maximal permitted consecutive gap length.  Increasing this parameter may lead to highly increased runtime! [Default: 3]

       --softclip-opening-penalty arg
              Penalty for softclip opening (only relevant during output). [Default: 'mismatch-penalty']

       --softclip-extension-penalty arg
              Penalty for softclip extension (only relevant during output). [Default: 'mismatch-penalty'/'anchor-length']

   TECHNICAL OPTIONS:
       --temp-dir arg
              Temporary directory to store the alignment files and hilive_config.ini. [Default: ./temp]

       -k [ --keep-files ] arg
              Keep intermediate alignment files for these cycles. The last cycle is always kept.  [Default: Keep files of output cycles]

       Further Explanations:
              HiLive comes with a separated executable 'hilive-out'. This executable can be used to produce alignment files in SAM or BAM format from existing temporary files. Thus, output can  only
              be  created  for  cycles for that keeping the temporary alignment files is activated. Temporary alignment files are also needed if an interrupted run is continued with the '--continue'
              parameter.

       -K [ --keep-all-files ]
              Keep all intermediate alignment files. This option may lead to huge disk space requirements. [Default: false]

       --block-size arg
              Block size for the alignment input/output stream in Bytes. Append 'K' or 'M' to specify in Kilobytes or Megabytes, respectively. [Default: 64M]

       Example:
              --block-size 1024 [1024 bytes] --block-size 64K [64 Kilobytes] --block-size 64M [64 Megabytes]

       --compression arg
              Compression of temporary alignment files.  [Default: LZ4] 0: no compression.  1: Deflate (smaller).  2: LZ4 (faster).

       -n [ --num-threads ] arg
              Number of threads to spawn (including output threads). [Default: 1]

       -N [ --num-out-threads ] arg
              Maximum number of threads to use for output. More threads may be used for output automatically if threads are idle.  [Default: 'num-threads'/2]
