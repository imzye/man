NAME
       Math::GSL::Spline - Splines

SYNOPSIS
           use Math::GSL::Spline qw/:all/;

DESCRIPTION
       The functions described in the Interp module required the user to supply pointers to the x and y arrays on each call. The following functions are equivalent to the corresponding gsl_interp
       functions but maintain a copy of this data in the gsl_spline object. This removes the need to pass both xa and ya as arguments on each evaluation.

       •   "gsl_spline_alloc($T, $size)"

       •   "gsl_spline_init($spline, $xa, $ya, $size)"

       •   gsl_spline_free($spline)

       •   gsl_spline_name($spline)

       •   gsl_spline_min_size($spline)

       •   "gsl_spline_eval_e($spline, $x, $acc)"

       •   "gsl_spline_eval($spline, $x, $acc)"

       •   "gsl_spline_eval_deriv_e($spline, $x, $acc)"

       •   "gsl_spline_eval_deriv($spline, $x, $acc)"

       •   "gsl_spline_eval_deriv2_e($spline, $x, $acc)"

       •   "gsl_spline_eval_deriv2($spline, $x, $acc)"

       •   "gsl_spline_eval_integ_e($spline, $a, $b, $acc)"

       •   "gsl_spline_eval_integ($spline, $a, $b, $acc)"

       For more information on the functions, we refer you to the GSL official documentation: <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/>
