NAME
       elk-lapw - all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave code

SYNOPSIS
       elk-lapw

DESCRIPTION
       elk-lapw is an all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave (FP-LAPW) code for determining the properties of crystalline solids with many advanced features.

OPTIONS
       The program has no options to use.

FILES
       All  input files for the code are in lower case and end with the extension .in.  All output files are uppercase and have the extension .OUT.  The input file elk.in contains all parameters arranged
       in blocks. For more information on the file format refer to the official documentation.

ENVIRONMENT
       elk-lapw was compiled with OpenMP and MPI enabled. Thus you can use all environmental variables these libraries provide.
