NAME
       mailman2lurker - Import mailman lists and their archives into a lurker database.

SYNOPSIS
        mailman2lurker -i|-p [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mailman2lurker has mainly two functions. First, it parses mailman's lists and creates a lurker configuration include out of them. Second, it imports archives
       from mailman lists into a lurker database.

       To build a new lurker database from mailmans archives, first run 'mailman2lurker -p'. Next you need to add 'include = /etc/lurker/lurker.conf.mailman' into
       /etc/lurker/lurker.conf.local.  Finally import mailmans mboxes by running 'mailman2lurker -i'.

       If you want to add new lists to an already existing lurker configuration, run 'mailman2lurker -p -w newlists' and afterwards 'mailman2lurker -i -f newlists'.
       This will import only the mbox files of mailman lists that have been added to the lurker configuration because they were new to lurker.

COMMANDS
       -p, --parse
           Parse mailman lists, and create a lurker configuration include file containing all parsed lists. Lists that are already configured in lurker are ignored.

       -i, --import
           Import archives of all lists. This parses the lurker configuration and imports the mailman mbox at
           /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/<list>.mbox/<list>.mbox for every list.

OPTIONS
       -c, --config <config>
           Use <config> as lurker configuration file. Default: /etc/lurker/lurker.conf

       -o, --outfile <outfile>
           Write list configuration to <outfile>. If this is not specified, <lurker.conf>.mailman will be used.  This option is only useful in conjunction with -p.

       -g, --group <group>
           Use <group> for new lists. Default is 'undef'.  This option is only useful in conjunction with -p.

       -a, --listhost <listhost>
           Use <listhost> as host for new list addresses. If a new list is called 'mylist' and <listhost> is lists.org, then the list address will be
           mylist@lists.org. Default is 'example.org'.  This option is only useful in conjunction with -p.

       -l, --link <url link>
           Use <url link> as base for links of new lists. If a list is called 'mylist', and <url link> is 'http://lists.org', then the link address will be
           http://lists.org/mylist. Default is 'http://example.org'.  This option is only useful in conjunction with -p.

       -s, --lang <language>
           Use <language> as language for new lists. Needs to be a language token.  Default is 'en'. This option is only useful in conjunction with -p.

       -w, --write-lists <file>
           Write a list of all lists that have been added to the lurker configuration.  Safe that list in <file>. Default is off.  This option is only useful in
           conjunction with -p.

       -x, --list-cmd <file>
           Use <command|file> to get the list of mailman lists that should be parsed.  When <command|file> is a command, it needs to end with ' |'.  Default is
           '/var/lib/mailman/bin/list_lists |'.  This option is only useful in conjunction with -p.

       -f, --listfile <file>
           Import only lists that are listed in <file>.  This option is only useful in conjunction with -i.

       -d, --lists <one[,two,...]>
           Import only lists that are given as argument.  This option is only useful in conjunction with -i.

       -h, --help
           Display a help message.

       -v, --version
           Display mailman2lurker's version number.
