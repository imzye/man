NAME
       pilot-getram - Retrieves the RAM image from your Palm device for use in debugging.

SECTION
       pilot-link: Tools

SYNOPSIS
        pilot-getram [-p|--port <port>] [--version] [-q|--quiet] [-?|--help] [--usage] [-t|--token  token] [-s|--sysinfo] [--ram] [--rom] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
        pilot-getram is used to fetch the current RAM image from your Palm handheld for use in debugging.

        pilot-getromtoken,  pilot-getrom  and  pilot-getram  are  inter-related. All relevant code is implemented in pilot-getrom, and you can do pilot-getromtoken  --ram  filename to get the RAM dump if you
       like.

       Note, because pilot-getrom uses the low-level RPC protocol to fetch the ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do not use this protocol, you currently cannot fetch an OS5 ROM  image  using  this  utility.
       This will be updated in a future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM images, using the debugger protocol.

OPTIONS
   pilot-getram options
                               -t,
                               --token token

                               -s, --sysinfo

       Print SysInfo

                               --ram

       Read RAM

                               --rom

       Read ROM

                               <filename>

       Write  the  RAM  image to the file named by <filename>. If this is omitted, the filename will be written out as the RAM version name as follows: ' pilot-$VERSION.ram  ', where an OS 3.5 image would be
       written as the filename of 'pilot-3.5.0.ram'.

   Conduit Options
                               -p, --port

       Use device file <port> to communicate with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-getram will look for the $PILOTPORT environment variable. If neither are found or supplied,   pilot-getram
       will print the usage information.

                               -q,
