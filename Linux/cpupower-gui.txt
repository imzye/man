NAME
       cpupower-gui - Set the scaling frequencies and governor of a CPU

SYNOPSIS
       cpupower-gui

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cpupower-gui command.

       cpupower-gui is a graphical (GUI) utility to change the CPU frequency.
       This  utility  can  change  the  operating frequency of the CPU for each core separately.  Additionally, the cpu governor can be changed.  The program can detect offline cores and only present the
       available ones.  Furthermore, if a core doesn't support frequency scaling, is not shown.  There is also an option to apply the same settings to all cores simultaneously.
       To apply the settings, the user must be local and active, as well as in group sudo.  Local and active users not in this group must authenticate themselves as admin in order to apply the settings.
