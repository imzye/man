NAME
       claws-mail-feeds-reader - read feeds (RSS/Atom) like mail

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-feeds-reader.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-feeds-reader is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer. It allows user subscribe and read feeds like if they were regular mail messages.

       Also integrates nicely with HTML plugins, allowing online browsing of feeds' sources.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named rssyl.so, and press the “Open”
       button.
