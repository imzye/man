NAME
       tessrun - convenience script for running TESS scripts en masse

SYNOPSIS
       tessrun [ -h ] [ -l ] [ -l ] [ application [ args ...] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The tessrun script is part of TESS, the (Te)st (S)ystem for (S)-Lang.  It is intended to simplify the invocation, typically within a Makefile, of TESS-based automated regression suites.  Each test
       in the current directory (marked by a .t suffix) will be automatically loaded into the S-Lang interpreter (within slsh, by default) and executed.

       tessrun returns 1 if any tests fail, otherwise 0.

OPTIONS
       -h     Output this short help text.

       -l     Supports local execution of examples (before install).

       -v     Verbose mode.

       application [ args ...]
              Replace the use of slsh with the given application, and optional arguments.
