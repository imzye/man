NAME
       veroroute - Qt based Veroboard/Perfboard/PCB layout and routing application

SYNOPSIS
       veroroute [OPTION] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the application and opens the FILE (a VeroRoute VRT file).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display help and exit

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit

       -p PATH
              specify the path to the 'tutorials' directory.
              By default the application looks for the 'tutorials' directory in the same location as the binary.  If not found, then it tries a location relative to the binary.
              For example, if the veroroute binary is in
                   ~/sandbox/usr/bin/
              then it will look for the 'tutorials' directory in
                   ~/sandbox/usr/share/veroroute/
              If not found in the relative location, it will look for the 'tutorials' directory in
                   /usr/share/veroroute/
