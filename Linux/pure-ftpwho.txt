NAME
       pure-ftpwho - Report current FTP sessions

SYNTAX
       pure-ftpwho [-c] [-h] [-H] [-n] [-p] [-s] [-v] [-w] [-W] [-x]

DESCRIPTION
       pure-ftpwho  shows  current Pure-FTPd client sessions.  Only the system
       administrator may run this.  Output can be text  (default),  HTML,  XML
       data  and  parser-optimized.   The  server  has  to  be  compiled  with
       --with-ftpwho to support this command.

OPTIONS
       -c     the program is called via a web server (CGI interface) .  Output
              is  a  full HTML page with the initial content-type header. This
              option is  automatically  enabled  if  an  environment  variable
              called  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  is  found. This is the default if you
              can the program from a CGI-enabled web server.

       -h     Output help information and exit.

       -H     Don't resolve host names, and only show IP addresses (faster).

       -n     A synonym for -H.

       -p     Output Mac OSX / GNUStep plist data.

       -s     Output only one line per client, with only numeric data,  delim‐
              ited  by  a | character.  It's not very human-readable, but it's
              designed for easy parsing by  shell  scripts  (cut/sed)  .   '|'
              characters in user names or file names are quoted (\|) .

       -v     Output  an  ASCII  table (just like the default mode), with more
              info.  The verbose output includes the local IP, the local port,
              the  total  size  of transferred files and the current number of
              transferred bytes.

       -w     Output a complete HTML page (web mode).

       -W     Output an HTML page with no header and no  footer.  This  is  an
              embedded  mode,  suitable  for inline calls from CGI, SSI or PHP
              scripts.

       -x     Output well-formed XML data for post-processing.

FILES
       /var/run/pure-ftpd/ Scoreboard directory. Should always owned  by  root
       and on a lockable filesystem.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       GATEWAY_INTERFACE
              If found, automatically run in CGI mode and output HTML data.
