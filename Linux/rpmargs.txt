NAME
       rpmargs - process RPM packages

SYNOPSIS
       rpmargs [-h] -c command [-a] [-p] [FILE...] [DIR...]

DESCRIPTION
       rpmargs executes a command against each RPM package given on the command line.  Extra word splitting is performed on the command.  Each FILE is treated as RPM package.  Each DIR is processed with
       "*.rpm" pattern, and RPM file basename is prepended to the command output.

OPTIONS
       -a  Process all Sisyphus packages.

       -p  When processing a directory, list package names, not file names; furthermore, enable special treatment of packages with the same name; that is, process only the one with the latest version.

       -h  Display this help and exit.
