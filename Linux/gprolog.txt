NAME
       gprolog - prolog interpreter and native code compiler

SYNOPSIS
       gprolog
       gplc [options] [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU Prolog (gprolog) is a prolog interpreter and compiler to native code.

       In its basic form, gprolog starts an interactive Prolog interpreter.  The gplc command compiles Prolog sources into object files, which may be linked to produce a stand-alone executable.

       See the GNU Prolog manual (online) for how to use gprolog and gplc for writing Prolog programs.

OPTIONS
       --help Print a summary of allowable options.

       filename
              (for gplc) compile the specified file.

ENVIRONMENT
       TRAILSZ
              Size of the trail stack, needed to effect backtracking (undo bindings), defaults to 2097152 (2MB).

       CSTRSZ Size of the constraints stack, defaults to 2097152 (2MB).

       GLOBALSZ
              Size of the global stack, also known as the heap, defaults to 4194304 (4MB).

       LOCALSZ
              Size of the local stack, defaults to 2097152 (2MB).
