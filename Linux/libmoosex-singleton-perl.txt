NAME
       MooseX::Singleton::Role::Meta::Class - Metaclass role for MooseX::Singleton

VERSION
       version 0.30

DESCRIPTION
       This metaclass role makes sure that there is only ever one instance of an object for a singleton class. The first call to "construct_instance" is run normally (and then cached). Subsequent calls
       will return the cached version.
