NAME
       yabause - Yet Another Buggy And Uncomplete Saturn Emulator

SYNOPSIS
       yabause [ -afh ] [ -ns ] [ -b <BIOS> ] [ -c <CDROM> ] [ -i <ISO> ] [ --binary=<BINARY>[:<ADDRESS>] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Yabause  is  a  Sega  Saturn  emulator.  Yabause needs either a bios file, a game or a binary to run.  Games can be loaded from a real cd device or from dump
       files.

OPTIONS
       -a

       --autostart
              Automatically start emulation.

       --autoframeskip=0|1
              Enable or disable auto frame skipping / limiting.

       --autoload
              Automatically start emulation and load a save state.

       -b

       --bios Choose a bios file.

       --binary
              Use a binary file. Content of the file will be loaded to 0x06004000 and execution will start from that address.  You can provide  an  alternative  ad‐
              dress  to  load  and  run  the binary with the --binary=<BINARY>:<ADDRESS> syntax.  When using this option, emulation is automatically started and you
              shouldn't use it in cunjunction with -a.  This option is intended for homebrew developers wanting to test their programs in Yabause.

       -c

       --cdrom
              Choose the cdrom device.

       -f

       --fullscreen
              Start the emulator in fullscreen.

       -h     Display a short help text.

       -i

       --iso  Choose a dump file. The dump can be either in iso or bin/cue file format.

       -ns

       --nosound
              Turns sound off. This option actually set the sound core to the dummy one.

FILES
       <BINARY>
              An executable for the Saturn, usually with a BIN extension.

       <BIOS> A Saturn ROM BIOS image.

       <CDROM>
              A CDROM device file.

       <ISO>  A Saturn game dump.
