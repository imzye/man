NAME
       salliere — Duplicate Bridge Scorer

SYNOPSIS
       salliere [options] -- [commands]  [boards.csv]  [names.csv]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the salliere command.

       salliere scores, matchpoints and nicely formats the boards for a duplicate pairs evening. The command line is a list of commands followed by two comma-separated files on which to operate.

       The  boards  file  must  contain  lines  with at least board number, NS pair number, EW pair number, Contract, Declarer and either tricks or the contract must include whether it made (=) went down
       (-tricks) or made over tricks (+tricks). The names file must list at least pair number followed by two comma separated names.

       The commands will add tricks, scores and matchpoint columns to the boards file and total matchpoints, percentages and local/orange points to the names file as appropriate.

       By default the commands which print results will do so as ascii to stdout.  This can be changed with the --output=format:file option. Formats are either pdf, html or txt and file is the path to  a
       file or - for stdout.

       The commands which format the output require the extra fields to be added either by hand or with the appropriate commands so they can be printed.
