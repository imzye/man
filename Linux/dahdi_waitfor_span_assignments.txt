NAME
       dahdi_waitfor_span_assignments - wait for DAHDI spans to get (un)assigned

SYNOPSIS
       dahdi_span_assignments assigned

       dahdi_span_assignments unassigned

DESCRIPTION
       DAHDI spans get assigned / unassigned asynchronously.

       dahdi_span_assignments is a helper script that allows running commands after all the spans have been assigned or unassigned.

       It takes a single command: assigned or unassigned and waits (up until a timeout of 5 seconds) for all the DAHDI spans in the system to do so.

       Note that if the system has a span that will not get assigned automatically (e.g.: it's not in assigned-spans.conf), this program does not know and will wait until a timeout.

EXAMPLES
        modprobe wctdm24xxp
        dahdi_waitfor_span_assignments assigned
        do_something

        dahdi_span_assignments add
        dahdi_waitfor_span_assignments assigned
        do_something_else

        dahdi_span_assignments remove
        dahdi_span_assignments unassigned
        do_something_completely_different
