NAME
       VM::EC2::Security::CredentialCache -- Cache credentials respecting expiration time for IAM roles.

SYNOPSIS
       Retrieves the current EC2 instance's IAM credentials and caches them until they expire.

         use VM::EC2::Security::CredentialCache;

         # return a VM::EC2::Security::Credentials if available undef otherwise.
         my $credentials = VM::EC2::Security::CredentialCache->get();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a cache for an EC2's IAM credentials represented by VM::EC2::Security::Credentials.  Rather than retriving the credentials for every possible call that uses them, cache them
       until they expire and retrieve them again if they have expired.
