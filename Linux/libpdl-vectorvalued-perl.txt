NAME
       PDL::VectorValued - Utilities for vector-valued PDLs

SYNOPSIS
        use PDL;
        use PDL::VectorValued;

        ##---------------------------------------------------------------------
        ## ... stuff happens

DESCRIPTION
       PDL::VectorValued provides generalizations of some elementary PDL functions to higher-order PDLs which treat vectors as "data values".

ALIASES
       To facilitate incorporation of selected vector-valued functions into the PDL core, the PDL:PP-, XS-, C-, and perl-level functions defined by this module in the "PDL::VectorValued::Utils" package
       namespace all carry a "vv_" prefix as of PDL::VectorValued v1.0.19 Prior to v1.0.19, many of these functions (e.g. cmpvec()) were defined by this module without a "vv_" prefix.

       For PDL::VectorValued >= v1.0.19 and PDL > v2.079, most vector-valued functions are expected to be defined in the PDL core.  For such "moving" functions "FUNC", the PDL core implementations will
       be imported into the "PDL::VectorValued" namespace as both "FUNC" and "vv_FUNC", clobbering any local implementation from the "PDL::VectorValued::Utils" namespace.  Local implementations "vv_FUNC"
       which were previously defined and exported as "FUNC" or for which no binding for *PDL::FUNC exists will be bound to both *PDL::VectorValued::FUNC and *PDL::FUNC, and exported by default, for
       backwards-compatibility.

       Functions expected to move to the PDL core are:

       •   New code should use FUNC() or PDL::FUNC().

       •   Backwards-compatible code can use FUNC() or PDL::VectorValued::FUNC().

       •   Direct use of PDL::VectorValued::Utils::vv_FUNC() is deprecated.

       •   Direct use of PDL::VectorValued::Utils::FUNC() is likely broken as of PDL::VectorValued v1.0.19.

FUNCTIONS
   vv_uniqvec
         Signature: (v(N,M); [o]vu(N,MU))

       Drop-in replacement for broken uniqvec() which uses vv_qsortvec().  Otherwise copied from PDL::Primitive::primitive.pd.

       See also: PDL::VectorValued::Utils::vv_qsortvec, PDL::Primitive::uniqvec.

Higher-Order Run-Length Encoding and Decoding
       The following functions generalize the builtin PDL functions rle() and rld() for higher-order "values".

       See also: PDL::VectorValued::Utils::vv_rlevec(), PDL::VectorValued::Utils::vv_rldvec().

   vv_rleND
         Signature: (data(@vdims,N); int [o]counts(N); [o]elts(@vdims,N))

       Run-length encode a set of (sorted) n-dimensional values.

       Generalization  of  rle()  and vv_rlevec(): given set of values $data, generate a vector $counts with the number of occurrences of each element (where an "element" is a matrix of dimensions @vdims
       ocurring as a sequential run over the final dimension in $data), and a set of vectors $elts containing the elements which begin a run.  Really just a wrapper for clump() and rlevec().

       See also: PDL::Slices::rle, PDL::Ngrams::VectorValued::Utils::vv_rlevec.

   vv_rldND
         Signature: (int counts(N); elts(@vdims,N); [o]data(@vdims,N);)

       Run-length decode a set of (sorted) n-dimensional values.

       Generalization of rld() and rldvec(): given a vector $counts() of the number of occurrences of each @vdims-dimensioned element, and a set $elts() of @vdims-dimensioned elements, run-length  decode
       to $data().

       Really just a wrapper for clump() and rldvec().

       See also: PDL::Slices::rld, PDL::VectorValued::Utils::rldvec

Datatype Utilities
   vv_indx
         Signature: vv_indx()

       Returns PDL::Type subclass used for indices.  If built with PDL < v2.007, this should return "PDL::long", otherwise "PDL::indx".

   Low-Level Functions
       Some additional low-level functions are provided in the PDL::VectorValued::Utils package.  See PDL::VectorValued::Utils for details.
