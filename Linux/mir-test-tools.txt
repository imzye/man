       mir_platform_graphics_test_harness - Run basic tests against a Mir platform implementation

SYNOPSIS
       mir_platform_graphics_test_harness [<PLATFORM_DSO>]

DESCRIPTION
       This program can be used to load a Mir platform module and run a basic smoke test - check that it probes correctly, that it can swap display buffers, and that it can provide a GL context.

       This is primarily useful to people developing a new Mir platform.
