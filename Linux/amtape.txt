AMTAPE(8)               System Administration Commands               AMTAPE(8)

NAME
       amtape - Control Amanda changers

SYNOPSIS
       amtape [-o configoption...] config subcommand [subcommand_options...]

DESCRIPTION
       Amtape is the command-line interface to Amanda's tape changers (amanda-
       changers(7)) and to the taperscan algorithm (amanda-taperscan(7)).

       Tape changers maintain a notion of the current slot for each
       configuration. This may or may not correspond to an actual physical
       state of the device, but is used by some taperscan algorithms to
       minimize searching through the slots.

       Amtape uses the default changer. To use a different changer, use the
       config override option, e.g., -otpchanger=otherchanger.

SUBCOMMANDS
       create
           Call the changer create method, it create the vtape root dirtectory
           or the s3 bucket.

       label label
           Search for and load the Amanda tape with label [label], also
           setting the current slot.

       slot slot [drive drive]
           Load the volume in the given slot, also setting the current slot.
           The slot names current, next, first, and last have special meaning.

       current
           Shorthand for slotcurrent.

       inventory
           Show the contents of all slots, based on the changer's cached
           metadata. This is a quick operation as it does not load or unload
           any volumes, but is not supported by all changers.

       show [slots]
           Show the contents of all slots (or listed slots) by loading each
           slot and reading its label. This can be very slow. The slots
           arguments is of the form 1,3-5,7.

       reset
           Reset the changer to a known state. This subcommand is intended to
           clear any unknown and potentially incorrect state the changer may
           have stored.

       eject [drive]
           Eject the tape currently in the drive. This only applies to some
           changers. Specify a drive (by drive number) if more than one drive
           is available.

       clean [drive]
           If a cleaning tape is defined for the changer, used it to clean the
           specified drive. The [drive] is optional if the changer only has
           one drive.

       sync-catalog
           sync the catalog with a device that support it,

       taper
           Run the taperscan algorithm (see amanda-taperscan(7)), displaying
           information about the progress of the scan.

       update [what]
           Update changer state. Consult amanda-changers(7) for
           changer-specific details on the format of what.

       verify
           Verify the changer is correctly configured. Can be useful for
           chg-robot and chg-ndmp.

       -o configoption
           See the "CONFIGURATION OVERRIDE" section in amanda(8).
