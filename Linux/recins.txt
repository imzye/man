DESCRIPTION
       Insert new records in a rec database.

       -r, --record=STR
              record that will be inserted in the file.

       --force
              insert the record even if it is violating record restrictions.

       --no-external
              don't use external descriptors.

       --no-auto
              don't insert auto generated fields.

       --verbose

       -s, --password=STR
              encrypt confidential fields with the given password.

       --help print a help message and exit.

       --version
              show version and exit.

   Record selection options:
       -i, --case-insensitive
              make strings case-insensitive in selection expressions.

       -t, --type=TYPE
              operate on records of the specified type only.

       -e, --expression=RECORD_EXPR
              selection expression.

              select records with fields containing a string.

       -n, --number=NUM,...
              select specific records by position, with ranges.

       -m, --random=NUM
              select a given number of random records.

       If no FILE is specified then the command acts like a filter, getting the data from standard input and writing the result to standard output.
