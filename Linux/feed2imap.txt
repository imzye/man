NAME
       feed2imaprc - feed2imap configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       feed2imaprc is feed2imap's configuration file. It is usually located in ~/.feed2imaprc.

EXAMPLE

RESERVED CHARACTERS
       Some  characters  are  reserved in RFC2396 (URI). If you need to include a reserved character in the login/password part of your target URI, replace it with its hex code. For example, @ can be re‐
       placed by %40.
