NAME
       pfsinimgmagick - Load images or frames using ImageMagick++ library

SYNOPSIS
       pfsinimgmagick (<file> [--linear] [--absolute <max_lum>] [--frames <range>] [--skip-missing])  [<file>...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  can load images or frames in the multitude of image formats supported by the ImageMagick library. This includes but is not limited to: BMP, JPG, PNG, GIF, EPS, TIFF, DPX. See the manual
       page of ImageMagick for the full list of available formats.

       pfsinimgmagick reads images or frames from files and writes pfs stream to the Standard Output. The pfs stream is usually piped to another program for further processing. To detect the format automati‐
       cally based on the extension, use pfsin command.

       The  output  of  pfsinimgmagick is scaled to 0-1 range, unless '--absolute' option is specified. By default, the 'LUMINANCE' tag is set to 'DISPLAY' contents. Using the '--linear' switch you can force
       the inverse sRGB transformation to provide linear data. In this case the 'LUMINANCE' tag is set to 'RELATIVE' contents. '--absolute' switch can be used to convert pixels to absolute luminance values.

       This command handles properly 'alpha' channel (transparency) stored in images.

       Each file can contain a %d pattern, which is substituted with frame numbers. The pattern has the same syntax as C printf command. For example, you can use %04d to make the frame number four digit with
       proceedings zeros. You can select the frames using the following options (the options must be always given after the file name):

       --frames <range>
              Range is given in mathlab / octave format:

              startframe:step:endframe

              Frame  numbers  start with startframe (default 0), are increased by step (default 1) and stop at endframe You can skip one of those values, for example 1:100 for frames 1,2,...,100 and 0:2: for
              frame 0,2,4,... up to the last file that exists.

       --skip-missing
              Skip up to ten frames in a row if corresponding files are missing. Otherwise the program stops reading sequence at the first file that does not exists. This switch does not apply to  the  first
              frame in a sequence. This switch can be useful if there is a rendered animation where some of the frame has not been generated.

       --linear, -l
              Converts pixel values to linear luminance (XYZ), assuming the sRGB color space for the input image. The maximum pixel value (255,255,255) is mapped to Y=1. LUMINANCE tag is set to RELATIVE.

       --absolute <max_lum>, -a <max_lum>
              --absolute  converts  pixel values to an absolute linear luminance (XYZ), that is the color space, in which channel Y contains luminance given in cd/m^2. The sRGB color space is assumed for the
              input image. The maximum pixel value (255,255,255) is mapped to Y=<max_lum>. <max_lum> is typically set to 80 [cd/m^2] for a CRT monitor. LUMINANCE tag is set to  ABSOLUTE.  --absolute  process
              images almost the same as --relative, but additionally it scales all pixels by <max_lum>.

EXAMPLES
       pfsinimgmagick frame%04d.dpx --frames 0:10 | pfsview

              Read frames from files frame0000.dpx, frame0001.dpx, ..., frame0010.dpx and show them using pfsview.

BUGS
       pfsinimgmagick can not read frames from the Standard Input.
