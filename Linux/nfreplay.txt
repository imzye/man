NAME
       nfreplay - netflow replay program

SYNOPSIS
       nfreplay [options] [filter]

DESCRIPTION
       nfreplay  is  the  netflow  replay  program of the nfdump tool set.  It
       reads data from files stored by nfcapd and sents the netflow data to  a
       host or a multicat group. The filter syntax is equivalent to nfdump. If
       a filter is supplied, only  the  matching  flows  are  sent.   See  the
       nfdump(1) man page for a detailed description of the filter syntax. All
       records are sent as netflow version 5.

OPTIONS
       -H remotehost
          Send all flows to this remote host. Accepts a  symbolic  name  or  a
          IPv4/IPv6 IP address.  Defaults to IPv4 localhost 127.0.0.1.

       -j mcastgroup
          Join  this  multicast  group  and send all flows to this group host.
          Accepts a symbolic name or multicast IPv4/IPv6 IP address.

       -p port
          Send all flows to this port on the remote side. Default is 9995.

       -4 Forces nfreplay to send flows to a IPv4 address only.  Can  be  used
          together  with  -i  if  the remote host has an IPv4 and IPv6 address
          record.

       -6 Forces nfreplay to send flows to a IPv6 address only.  Can  be  used
          together  with  -i  if  the remote host has an IPv4 and IPv6 address
          record.

       -v num
          Send flows as netflow version  num.  5  and  9  are  supported.  The
          default  is  sending  the  flows  as netflow version 5. In version 5
          mode, IPv6 flows, are skipped and 64bit counters  are  truncated  to
          32bit.

       -d usec
          Delay  each  record  by  usec mirco seconds, to avoid overrun on the
          remote side. Default is 10.

       -b buffersize
          Set send buffer size in bytes. Useful for large  data  to  transfer.
          Default is system dependent.

       -r inputfile
          Read input data from inputfile. Default is read from stdin.

       -t timewin
          Send  only  flows,  which  fall  in  the  time window timewin, where
          timewin is YYYY/MM/dd.hh:mm:ss[-YYYY/MM/dd.hh:mm:ss]. Any  parts  of
          the   time   spec   may   be   omitted  e.g  YYYY/MM/dd  expands  to
          YYYY/MM/dd.00:00:00-YYYY/MM/dd.23:59:59 and sends all  flow  from  a
          given day.

       -z num
          Flows  are  sent with their "real distribution" acrross time (with a
          speed coefficient) -z 1 : 5 minutes of records will  be  sent  in  5
          minutes.   -z  20  : 5 minutes of record will be sent in 5/20 = 0.25
          minutes.

       -c num
          Limit number of records to send to the first num flows.

       -V Print nfreplay version and exit.

       -h Print help text on stdout with all options and exit.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns
           0   No error.
           255 Initialization failed.
           254 Error in filter syntax.
           250 Internal error.
