NAME
       newsboat - an RSS/Atom feed reader for text terminals

SYNOPSIS
       newsboat [-r] [-e] [-i opmlfile] [-u urlfile] [-c cachefile] [-C configfile] [-X] [-o] [-x command...] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       Newsboat is an RSS/Atom feed reader for text terminals. RSS and Atom are a number of widely-used XML formats to transmit, publish and syndicate articles, for example news or blog articles.
       Newsboat is designed to be used on text terminals on Unix or Unix-like systems such as GNU/Linux, BSD or macOS.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display help

       -r, --refresh-on-start
           Refresh feeds on start

       -e, --export-to-opml
           Export feeds as OPML to stdout. This currently outputs OPML 1.0, losing all tag information, but this is subject to change to 2.0 in the future.

       --export-to-opml2
           Export feeds as OPML 2.0, including tags, to stdout

       -X, --vacuum
           Compact the cache by: 1) reclaiming the space that was left empty when data was deleted; and 2) defragmenting the entries in the cache. This doesn’t delete the entries; for that, see
           cleanup-on-quit, delete-read-articles-on-quit, keep-articles-days, and max-items settings.

       --cleanup
           Remove unreferenced entries from the cache and quit Newsboat. Feeds and their articles will be removed if the feedurl is no longer in the urls file.

           Additionally, if the delete-read-articles-on-quit configuration is set, all read articles will be deleted (including articles of feeds which are still in the urls file).

       -v, -V, --version
           Get version information about Newsboat and the libraries it uses

       -i opmlfile, --import-from-opml=opmlfile
           Import an OPML file

       -u urlfile, --url-file=urlfile
           Use an alternative URL file

       -c cachefile, --cache-file=cachefile
           Use an alternative cache file

       -C configfile, --config-file=configfile
           Use an alternative configuration file

       --queue-file=queuefile
           Use an alternative queue file

       --search-history-file=searchhistoryfile
           Use an alternative search history file

       --cmdline-history-file=cmdlinehistoryfile
           Use an alternative command line history file

       -x command ..., --execute=command...
           Execute one or more commands to run Newsboat unattended. Currently available commands are reload and print-unread.

       -l loglevel, --log-level=loglevel
           Generate a logfile with a certain loglevel (valid values: 1 to 6, for user error, critical, error, warning, info, and debug respectively). Filename can be specified using the --log-file
           option. If not specified, a filename is generated of the form newsboat_<date-time>.log

       -d logfile, --log-file=logfile
           Use this logfile as output when logging debug messages. Please note that this only works when providing a loglevel.

       -E file, --export-to-file=file
           Export a list of read articles (resp. their GUIDs). This can be used to transfer information about read articles between different computers.

       -I file, --import-from-file=file
           Import a list of read articles and mark them as read if they are held in the cache. This is to be used in conjunction with the -E commandline parameter.

FIRST STEPS
       After you’ve installed Newsboat, you can run it for the first time by typing newsboat on your command prompt. This will bring you the following message:

           Error: no URLs configured. Please fill the file /home/ak/.newsboat/urls with RSS feed URLs or import an OPML file.

           Newsboat 2.22
           usage: ./newsboat [-i <file>|-e] [-u <urlfile>] [-c <cachefile>] [-x <command> ...] [-h]
               -e, --export-to-opml            export OPML feed to stdout
               -r, --refresh-on-start          refresh feeds on start
               -i, --import-from-opml=<file>   import OPML file
               -u, --url-file=<urlfile>        read RSS feed URLs from <urlfile>
               -c, --cache-file=<cachefile>    use <cachefile> as cache file
               -C, --config-file=<configfile>  read configuration from <configfile>
               -X, --vacuum                    compact the cache
               -x, --execute=<command>...      execute list of commands
               -q, --quiet                     quiet startup
               -v, --version                   get version information
               -l, --log-level=<loglevel>      write a log with a certain loglevel (valid values: 1 to 6)
               -d, --log-file=<logfile>        use <logfile> as output log file
               -E, --export-to-file=<file>     export list of read articles to <file>
               -I, --import-from-file=<file>   import list of read articles from <file>
               -h, --help                      this help
                   --cleanup                   remove unreferenced items from cache

       This means that Newsboat can’t start without any configured feeds.

   Adding Feeds
       To add feeds to Newsboat, you can simply add one feed URL per line to the ~/.newsboat/urls configuration file:

           http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss
           http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss.xml

       You can also import an OPML file by running newsboat -i blogroll.opml

           Adding comments Lines that start with # can contain anything you want. Comments are ignored by Newsboat, but can serve as documentation for you. Please note, that commenting out URLs for
           debugging purposes might lead to unexpected data loss, see cleanup-on-quit for more details.

       Feeds with restricted access

       If you need to add URLs that have restricted access, simply provide username/password:

           https://username:password@hostname.domain.tld/feed.rss

       In case there is a @ in the username, you need to write it as %40.

       In order to protect usernames and passwords, make sure to restrict read access for ~/.newsboat/urls to you and optionally your group:

           $ chmod u=rw,g=r,o= ~/.newsboat/urls

       Newsboat makes sure to not display usernames and passwords in its user interface.

       Local files as feeds

       You can also configure local files as feeds, by prefixing the local path with file:// and adding it to the urls file:

           file:///var/log/rss_eventlog.xml

   First UI Interaction
       The main UI of Newsboat consists of three views

       Feed List View → Article List View → Article View

       You can drill down those views by pressing Enter and move to the previous one by pressing Q. Pressing Q on the Feed List View — or pressing Shift + Q from anywhere — closes Newsboat.

       You can also search articles' title or content by pressing / on the Feed List View or the Article List View. On the Feed List View all articles of all feeds are taken into account. On the Article
       List View the articles of the current feed are taken into account. When opening an article from a search result dialog, the search phrase is highlighted.

           Search history The history of all your searches is saved to the filesystem, to the history.search file (stored next to the cache.db file). By default, the last 100 search phrases are stored.

           You can influence how many search phrases are stored by configuring history-limit.

       Feed List View

       When you start Newsboat, it presents you with a list of feeds that you added previously.

       You can now:

       •   Press Shift + R to download articles for all feeds.

       •   Press R to download articles for the selected feed.

       •   Press / to search all articles in all feeds.

       •   Press Enter to go to the article list of a selected feed.

       •   Press Q to close Newsboat.

           Local articles Newsboat keeps the articles that it downloads. When you start Newsboat again and reload a feed, old articles can still be read even if they aren’t in the current RSS feeds
           anymore. The maximum number of articles is controlled by max-items.

           Caching Newsboat uses a number of measures to preserve the users' and feed providers' bandwidth through the use of conditional HTTP downloading. It saves every feed’s "Last-Modified" and
           "ETag" response header values (if present) and advises the feed’s HTTP server to only send data if the feed has been updated. This doesn’t only make feed downloads for RSS feeds with no new
           updates faster, it also reduces the amount of transferred data per request.

           You can disable conditional HTTP downloading per feed by configuring always-download.

       Article List View

       After you entered a feed, you can see the list of available articles by their title. A N on the left indicates that an article wasn’t read yet.

       You can now:

       •   Press Q to go back to the Feed List View.

       •   Press / to search all articles of this feed.

       •   Press Enter to read a selected article.

       Article View

       On an article you can scroll through the text and read it. Each link in the article has a number next to it.

       You can now:

       •   Press any number to open an article link in the browser. For numbers larger than 9 type #, then the number and press Enter.

       •   Press O to open the article in the browser.

       •   Press Q to go back to the Article List View.

           Browser view Sometimes the content of an article is empty or just an abstract or short description. You can always press O to view the complete article in a browser. The default browser is
           lynx.

           You can use your browser of choice by configuring browser.

CONFIGURATION
       Several aspects of Newsboat can be configured via a config file, which is stored next to the urls file. A configuration line looks like this in general:

           <config-command> <arg1> ...

       The configuration file can contain comments, which start with the # character and go as far as the end of line.

           User contrib Newsboat also comes with user contributed content like scripts and color themes. The user contributed content can be found in /usr/share/doc/newsboat/contrib/. End users are
           encouraged to take a look as they may find something useful.

   Example
       An example configuration looks like this

           # a comment
           max-items        100 # such comments are possible, too
           browser          links
           show-read-feeds  no

           unbind-key       R
           bind-key         ^R    reload-all

   Splitting long lines into multiple ones
       Settings such as macros and ignore-article can be quite lengthy. A long line can be broken into multiple ones using backslashes. A backslash must be the last character on the line and will
       immediately concatenate it with the following line. It’s important that nothing follows the \ on the same line, otherwise the \ character is treated "as is". For example:

           macro p open; \
           reload; quit; \
           quit;         \
           quit -- "Opens, reloads then makes sure to quit newsboat"

       Please note that a backslash only makes Newsboat ignore the following newline. It doesn’t do anything else at all. For example, this nicely formatted option:

           ignore-article \
               "*" \
               "author =~ \"(\
                   John Doe| \
                   Mary Sue \
               )\""

       does not turn into this:

           ignore-article "*" "author =~ \"(John Doe|Mary Sue)\""

       Instead, as only newlines are removed, it turns to this:

           ignore-article     "*"     "author =~ \"(        John Doe|         Mary Sue     )\""

       For this reason, be conscious of where you’re splitting the lines, because it might matter.

   Using Double Quotes
           TL;DR Use double quotes for strings that contain spaces or double quotes. Escape double quotes (use \") and backslashes (use \\). Don’t escape stuff outside of double quotes, and don’t use
           single quotes for quoting — Newsboat doesn’t support that.

       Many of Newsboat’s options expect strings as arguments, be it commands, passwords, dialog titles, URLs etc. Some options even take multiple strings at once. These strings can contain spaces, which
       might confuse Newsboat since it already uses spaces to separate option names from option arguments.

       To help Newsboat understand your intent, put such strings into double quotes:

           browser "firefox --new-tab %u"

       What if you need a double quote inside a string? Escape it with a backslash:

           ocnews-password "UnbalancedQuotes\"AreSoFun!"

       And what about the backslash itself? Escape it, too! Suppose you have a program called my favourite pager, and you want to view articles with it. Newsboat ultimately passes commands to the shell,
       and shell expects spaces to be escaped if you want them preserved. But since Newsboat interprets backslashes, you have to add another layer of escaping. Thus, you end up with a command like this:

           pager "/usr/bin/my\\ favourite\\ pager"

   Shell Evaluation
       It is also possible to integrate the output of external commands into the configuration. The text between two ` backticks is evaluated as shell command, and its output is used. This works like
       backtick evaluation in Bourne-compatible shells and allows users to use external information from the system within the configuration.

   Escaping
       Backticks and # characters can be escaped with a backslash (e.g. \` and \#). In this case, they are replaced with literal ` or # in the configuration.

   Key Bindings
       You can bind a key to an operation with the bind-key configuration command. You can specify an optional dialog. This is the context in which the key binding is active.

       The syntax for a key binding looks like this:

           bind-key <key> <operation> [<dialog>]

       Key

       Lowercase keys, uppercase keys and special characters are written literally.

       Key combinations with Ctrl are written using the caret ^. For instance Ctrl + R equals to ^R. Please be aware that all Ctrl-related key combinations need to be written in uppercase.

       The following identifiers for special keys are supported:

       •   ENTER (Enter key)

       •   BACKSPACE (backspace key)

       •   LEFT (left cursor)

       •   RIGHT (right cursor)

       •   UP (up cursor)

       •   DOWN (down cursor)

       •   PPAGE (page up cursor)

       •   NPAGE (page down cursor)

       •   HOME (cursor to beginning of list/article)

       •   END (cursor to end of list/article)

       •   ESC (Esc key)

       •   TAB (Tab key)

       •   F1 to F12 (F1 key to F12 key)

       Operation

       An operation gets executed when pressing the corresponding key. For a complete list of available operations see [_newsboat_operations] and [_podboat_operations].

       Dialog

       A dialog is a context in which the key binding is active. Available dialogs are:

       •   all (default if not specified)

       •   feedlist

       •   filebrowser

       •   help

       •   articlelist

       •   article

       •   tagselection

       •   filterselection

       •   urlview

       •   podboat

       •   dirbrowser

       •   searchresultslist

   Colors
       It is possible to configure custom color settings in Newsboat. The basic configuration syntax is:

           color <element> <foreground color> <background color> [<attribute> ...]

       This means that if you configure colors for a certain element, you need to provide a foreground color and a background color as a minimum. The following colors are supported:

       •   black

       •   red

       •   green

       •   yellow

       •   blue

       •   magenta

       •   cyan

       •   white

       •   default

       •   color<n>, e.g. color123

       The default color means that the terminal’s default color will be used. The color<n> color name (where <n> is a decimal number not starting with zero) can be used if your terminal supports 256
       colors (e.g. gnome-terminal, or xterm with TERM set to xterm-256color). Newsboat contains support for 256 color terminals since version 2.1. For a complete chart of colors and their corresponding
       numbers, please see https://www.calmar.ws/vim/256-xterm-24bit-rgb-color-chart.html.

       Optionally, you can also add one or more attributes. The following attributes are supported:

       •   standout

       •   underline

       •   reverse

       •   blink

       •   dim

       •   bold

       •   protect

       •   invis

       Currently, the following elements are supported:

       •   background: the application background

       •   listnormal: a normal list item

       •   listfocus: the currently selected list item

       •   listnormal_unread: an unread list item

       •   listfocus_unread: the currently selected unread list item

       •   title (added in 2.25): current dialog’s title, which is usually at the top of the screen (but see show-title-bar and swap-title-and-hints). If you don’t specify a style for this element, then
           the info style is used

       •   info: the hints bar, which is usually at the bottom of the screen (but see show-keymap-hint and swap-title-and-hints)

       •   hint-key (added in 2.25): a key in the hints bar. If you don’t specify a style for this element, then the info style is used

       •   hint-keys-delimiter (added in 2.25): the comma that separates keys in the hints bar. If you don’t specify a style for this element, then the info style is used

       •   hint-separator (added in 2.25): the colon separating keys from their descriptions in the hints bar. If you don’t specify a style for this element, then the info style is used

       •   hint-description (added in 2.25): a description of a key in the hints bar. If you don’t specify a style for this element, then the info style is used

       •   article: the article text

       •   end-of-text-marker: filler lines (~) below blocks of text

       The default color configuration of Newsboat looks like this:

           color background          white   black
           color listnormal          white   black
           color listfocus           yellow  blue   bold
           color listnormal_unread   white   black  bold
           color listfocus_unread    yellow  blue   bold
           color title               yellow  blue   bold
           color info                yellow  blue   bold
           color hint-key            yellow  blue   bold
           color hint-keys-delimiter white   blue
           color hint-separator      white   blue   bold
           color hint-description    white   blue
           color article             white   black

CONFIGURATION COMMANDS
       always-display-description (parameters: [yes/no]; default value: no)
           If set to yes, then the description will always be displayed even if e.g. a <content:encoded> tag has been found. (example: always-display-description yes)

       always-download (parameters: <url> [<url>...]; default value: n/a)
           Specifies one or more feed URLs that should always be downloaded, regardless of their Last-Modified timestamp and ETag header. This option can be specified multiple times. (example:
           always-download "https://www.n-tv.de/23.rss")

       article-sort-order (parameters: <sortfield>[-<direction>]; default value: date-asc)
           The <sortfield> specifies which article property shall be used for sorting. Currently available are: date, title, flags, author, link, guid, and random. The optional <direction> can be either
           asc for ascending order, or desc for descending order. Note that direction does not affect the random sorting. For date, desc order is the default, i.e. date is the same as date-desc; for all
           others, asc is the default. Also, the directions for date are reversed: desc means the newest items are first, whereas asc means the oldest items are first. These inconsistencies will be fixed
           in a future major version of Newsboat. (example: article-sort-order author-desc)

       articlelist-format (parameters: <format>; default value: "%4i %f %D %6L  %?T?|%-17T|  ?%t")
           This variable defines the format of entries in the article list. See the respective section in the documentation for more information on format strings. (example: articlelist-format "%4i %f %D
           %?T?|%-17T|  ?%t")

       articlelist-title-format (parameters: <format>; default value: "%N %V - Articles in feed '%T' (%u unread, %t total)%?F? matching filter '%F'&? - %U" (localized))
           Format of the title in article list. See "Format Strings" section of Newsboat manual for details on available formats. (example: articlelist-title-format "Articles in feed '%T' (%u unread)")

       auto-reload (parameters: [yes/no]; default value: no)
           If set to yes, all feeds will be automatically reloaded at start up and then continuously after a certain time has passed (see reload-time). See also refresh-on-startup to only reload the
           feeds at start up, but not continuously. Enabling suppress-first-reload omits the reload on start up. (example: auto-reload yes)

       bind-key (parameters: <key> <operation> [<dialog>]; default value: n/a)
           Bind key <key> to <operation>. This means that whenever <key> is pressed, then <operation> is executed (if applicable in the current dialog). For more information see Key Bindings. See also
           unbind-key to remove a key binding. (example: bind-key ^R reload-all)

       bookmark-autopilot (parameters: [yes/no]; default value: no)
           If set to yes, the configured bookmark command is executed without any further input asked from user, unless the url or the title cannot be found/guessed. (example: bookmark-autopilot yes)

       bookmark-cmd (parameters: <command>; default value: "")
           If set, then <command> will be used as bookmarking plugin. See the documentation on bookmarking for further information. (example: bookmark-cmd "~/bin/delicious-bookmark.sh")

       bookmark-interactive (parameters: [yes/no]; default value: no)

TAGGING
       Newsboat comes with the possibility to categorize or "tag", as we call it, RSS feeds. Every RSS feed can be assigned 0 or more tags. Within Newsboat, you can then select to only show RSS feeds
       that match a certain tag. That makes it easy to categorize your feeds in a flexible and powerful way.

       Usually, the urls file contains one RSS feed URL per line. To assign a tag to an RSS feed, simply attach it as a single word, separated by blanks such as space or tab. If the tag needs to contain
       spaces, you must use quotes (") around the tag (see example below). An example urls file may look like this:

           https://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html interesting conspiracy news "cool stuff"
           https://rss.orf.at/news.xml news orf
           https://www.heise.de/newsticker/heise.rdf news interesting

       When you now start Newsboat with this configuration, you can press T to select a tag. When you select the tag "news", you will see all three RSS feeds. Pressing T again and e.g. selecting the
       "conspiracy" tag, you will only see the https://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html RSS feed. Pressing Ctrl + T clears the current tag, and again shows all RSS feeds, regardless of their assigned tags.

       A special type of tag are tags that start with the tilde character (~). When such a tag is found, the feed title is set to the tag name (excluding the ~ character). These type of tags are ignored
       when any kind of "first tag" property is used. With this feature, you can give feeds any title you want in your feed list:

           https://rss.orf.at/news.xml "~ORF News"

       Another special type of tag are tags that start with the exclamation mark (!). When such a tag is found, the feed is hidden from the regular list of feeds and its content can only be found through
       a query feed.

           https://rss.orf.at/news.xml ! news
           http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml ! news
           "query:News from around the globe:tags # \"news\""

       In this example, the first two feeds won’t appear in the feedlist, but their articles will still be accessible through the query feed titled "News from around the globe". The "hidden" tags in this
       example don’t even have names, because their only use is to hide the feed that they’re tagging.

SCRIPTS AND FILTERS
       Newsboat contains support for Snownews extensions. The RSS feed readers Snownews and Liferea share a common way of extending the readers with custom scripts. Two mechanisms, namely "execurl" and
       "filter" type scripts, are available and supported by Newsboat.

       An "execurl" script can be any program that gets executed and whose output is interpreted as RSS feed, while "filter" scripts are fed with the content of a configured URL and whose output is
       interpreted as RSS feed.

       The configuration is simple and straight-forward. Just add to your urls file configuration lines like the following ones:

           exec:~/bin/execurl-script
           filter:~/bin/filter-script:https://some.test/url

       The first line shows how to add an execurl script to your configuration: start the line with exec: and then immediately append the path of the script that shall be executed. If this script
       requires additional parameters, simply use quotes (see Using Double Quotes for details):

           "exec:~/bin/execurl-script param1 param2"

       The second line shows how to add a filter script to your configuration: start the line with filter:, then immediately append the path of the script, then append a colon (:), and then append the
       URL of the file that shall be fed to the script. Again, if the script requires any parameters, simply quote the whole thing:

           "filter:~/bin/filter-script param1 param2:https://url/foobar"

       In both cases, the tagging feature as described above is still available:

           exec:~/bin/execurl-script tag1 tag2 "quoted tag"
           filter:~/bin/filter-script:https://some.test/url tag3 tag4 tag5

       If you need to write your own extension, see this <https://web.archive.org/web/20090724045314/http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/snowscripts/writing> short guide"  for an introduction. A
       collection of existing scripts <https://github.com/msharov/snownews/tree/de3bd8b28191c4d4bc1be18275786613bcbc0c94/docs/untested> and filters
       <https://github.com/msharov/snownews/tree/9fb45e4cdf1cf9dea55b9af66c13a4c238809851/docs/filters> might help, too.

       Newsboat comes with an example exec script which shows one way to generate an RSS channel. It also includes a way to see which exact arguments are passed to the script by Newsboat. This example
       can be found in the doc/examples subdirectory.

COMMAND LINE
       Like other text-oriented software, Newsboat contains an internal commandline to modify configuration variables ad hoc and to run own commands. It provides a flexible access to the functionality of
       Newsboat which is especially useful for advanced users.

       To start the commandline, type :. You will see a ":" prompt at the bottom of the screen, similar to tools like vi(m) or mutt. You can now enter commands. Pressing the Enter key executes the
       command (possibly giving feedback to the user) and closes the commandline. You can cancel entering commands by pressing the Esc key. The history of all the commands that you enter will be saved to
       the history.cmdline file, stored next to the cache.db file. The backlog is limited to 100 entries by default, but can be influenced by setting the history-limit configuration variable. To disable
       history saving, set the history-limit to 0.

       The commandline provides you with some help if you can’t remember the full names of commandline commands. By pressing the Tab key, Newsboat will try to automatically complete your command. If
       there is more than one possible completion, you can subsequently press the Tab key to cycle through all results. If no match is found, no suggestion will be inserted into the commandline. For the
       set command, the completion also works for configuration variable names.

       In addition, some common key combination such as Ctrl + G (to cancel input), Ctrl + K (to delete text from the cursor position to the end of line), Ctrl + U (to clear the whole line) and Ctrl + W
       (to delete the word before the current cursor position) were added.

       Please be aware that the input history of both the command line and the search functions are saved to the filesystems, to the files history.cmdline resp. history.search (stored next to the
       cache.db file). By default, the last 100 entries are saved, but this can be configured (configuration variable history-limit) and also totally disabled (by setting said variable to 0).

       Currently, the following command line commands are available:

       quit
           Quit Newsboat

       q
           Alias for quit

       save <filename>
           Save current article to <filename>

        set <variable>[=<value>|&|!]
           Set (or get) configuration variable value. Specifying a ! after the name of a boolean configuration variable toggles their values, a & directly after the name of a configuration variable of
           any type resets its value to the documented default value.

       tag <tagname>
           Select a certain tag

       goto <case-insensitive substring>
           Go to the next feed whose name contains the case-insensitive substring.

       source <filename> [...]
           Load the specified configuration files. This allows it to load alternative configuration files or reload already loaded configuration files on-the-fly from the filesystem.

       dumpconfig <filename>
           Save current internal state of configuration to file, so that it can be instantly reused as configuration file.

       <number>
           Jump to the <number>th entry in the current dialog

FILES
       By default, Newsboat stores all the files in a traditional Unix fashion, i.e. in a "dotdir" located at ~/.newsboat. However, it also supports a modern way, XDG Base Directory Specification
       <https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>, which splits the files between the following locations:

        1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newsboat/ (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config)

        2. $XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/ (XDG_DATA_HOME defaults to ~/.local/share)

       If the newsboat directory exists under XDG_CONFIG_HOME, then Newsboat will use XDG directories (creating the data directory if necessary). Otherwise, Newsboat will default to ~/.newsboat.

       If you’re currently using ~/.newsboat/ but wish to migrate to XDG directories, you should move the files as follows:

       config, urls
           to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newsboat/

       cache.db, history.search, history.cmdline, queue
           to $XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/

       Newsboat and Podboat also create "lock files". These prevent you from starting two instances of the same program, and thus from corrupting your data. Newsboat and Podboat remove these files when
       you quit the program, so there is no need to copy them anywhere — just be aware of them in case you write scripts that work with cache.db or queue. By default, lock files are located as follows:
       ┌──────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┐
       │          │                           │                                       │
       │          │ dotdir                    │ XDG                                   │
       ├──────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┤
       │          │                           │                                       │
       │ Newsboat │ ~/.newsboat/cache.db.lock │ $XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/cache.db.lock │
       ├──────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┤
       │          │                           │                                       │
       │ Podboat  │ ~/.newsboat/pb-lock.pid   │ $XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/.lock         │
       └──────────┴───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘

       Newsboat places the lock file next to the cache file, so if you specify cache-file setting or pass —cache-file command-line argument, the path to the lock file will change too. Podboat’s lock can
       be placed elsewhere using —lock-file command-line argument.

       dotfiles
           ~/.newsboat/config

           ~/.newsboat/urls

       XDG
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newsboat/config

           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newsboat/urls

           Note: if the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is not set, Newsboat behaves as if it was set to ~/.config.

ENVIRONMENT
       BROWSER
           Tells Newsboat what browser to use if there is no browser setting in the config file. If this variable doesn’t exist, a default of lynx(1) will be used.

       CURL_CA_BUNDLE
           Tells Newsboat to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The file may contain multiple certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM format.

           This option is useful if your libcurl is built without useful certificate information, and you can’t rebuild the library yourself.

       EDITOR
           Tells Newsboat what fallback editor to use when editing the urls file via the edit-urls operation and no VISUAL environment variable is set. If this variable doesn’t exist either, a default of
           vi(1) will be used.

       NO_PROXY
           Tells Newsboat to ignore proxy setting for certain sites.

           This variable contains a comma-separated list of hostnames, domain names, and IP addresses.

           Domain names match subdomains, i.e. "example.com" also matches "foo.example.com". Domain names that start with a dot only match subdomains, e.g. ".example.com" matches "bar.example.com" but
           not "example.com" itself.

           IPv6 addresses are written without square brackets, and are matched as strings. Thus "::1" doesn’t match "::0:1" even though this is the same address.

       PAGER
           Tells Newsboat what pager to use if the pager setting in the config file is explicitly set to an empty string.

       TMPDIR
           Tells Newsboat to use the specified directory for storing temporary files. If this variable doesn’t exist, a default of /tmp will be used.

       VISUAL
           Tells Newsboat what editor to use when editing the urls file via the edit-urls operation. If this variable doesn’t exist, the EDITOR environment variable will be used.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           Tells Newsboat which base directory to use for the configuration files. See also the section on files for more information.

       XDG_DATA_HOME
           Tells Newsboat which base directory to use for the data files. See also the section on files for more information.
