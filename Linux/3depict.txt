NAME
       3Depict - 3D scalar point cloud visualization and analysis

SYNOPSIS
       3depict <file1><file2>...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the 3Depict command

       3depict is a program that allows for visualisation and analysis of point datasets with associated spectral data.

       Note that the program is a best-effort system. It is by no means guaranteed that the algorithms in this program are free form errors in implementation, or follow conventions for any specific user-
       application.

OPTIONS
       This  program  has  no command line options, other than a sequence of data or XML files to open, the XML files being containing a previous program state (this may be generated from within the pro‐
       gram's graphical interface). Currently the program can read "POS" (position) formatted files, which are simply uncompressed sequences of 4-byte floats (IEEE 597) in (x,y,z,value) form.  All  other
       work is done through the graphical interface.

       As a further note, the XML file format has not been stabilised for the 0.0.x series; and may change between revisions
