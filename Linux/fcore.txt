NAME
       fcore - extract a core file from a process

SYNOPSIS
       fcore [options] {pid...}

DESCRIPTION
       fcore constructs a core-file from a running process, and writes it to
       disk.

       -a, -allmaps
           Write all readable segment maps. The default level is to attempt to
           emulate gcore segment writing strategy. By specifying this option,
           fcore will write all readable maps.

       -s, -segments regex
           Writes only the segments that match the regex specified. Elide all
           other segments.

       -o output-file
           Specifies the name of the core file. Default is core. The core-file
           extension will still use the pid of the process being dumped.

   Standard Frysk Options
       -exe
           The full path of the executable to read.

       -noexe
           Do not attempt to read the corresponding executable when loading a
           core file.

       -sysroot directory
           The system root directory under which all executables, libraries,
           and source are located.

       -debug class=level...
           Set internal debug-tracing of the specified Java class to level
           (level can be NONE, INFO, WARNING, FINE, and FINEST). If the level
           is absent, FINE is assumed; if the class is absent, the global
           level is set.

EXAMPLE
