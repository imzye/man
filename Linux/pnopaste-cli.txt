DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes briefly the nopaste-it commandline parameters.

BINARY PARAMETERS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              Display this help and exit.

       -v, --version
              Display version and exit.

       -q, --quite
              Be more quite. Only print URL of post.

       -u, --url <url>
              Use a different nopaste URL than http://nopaste.linux-dev.org/.

       -n, --name
              Use a different author name than your UNIX username (if it is set).

       -l, --language <language>
              Set  the  given  code language. Popular ones are for example: "C", "C++", "Diff", "Perl", "Ruby", etc.  You can get the list of supported languages by using the "-s / --list" option of this
              program.  It will be plain unless nothing different is set.  Note: This is case sensitive.

       -e, --expires <expire>
              Set the expire option.  At the moment it only accepts: "1d", "1w" and "never".  The default value is "1w".

       -f, --file <filename>
              Add the content of the given file to your paste instead of reading from STDIN.

       -s, --list
              Gets supported code languages from remote pnopaste and prints them.  This option could also be mixed with "url".
