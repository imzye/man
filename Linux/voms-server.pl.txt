NAME
         voms-server.pl

SYNOPSIS
         A simple VOMS https server using the VOMS::Lite library.

DESCRIPTION
         This server porvides a minimal, non-forking example of a VOMS server interface for obtaining VOMS attribute certificates.

         It loosely follows the principles of REST where the client simply uses a  GET method to request Attributes they want:
         GET https://voms.server.fqdn:port/VO/Subgroup/.../Role=role/Capability=capability

        This example server doesn't fork
        It relies upon a pecularity of the Net::SSLeay verify callback implementation
          i.e. if Net::SSLeay has verified the incoming credentials to its satisfaction
          then the callback can be used to construct the certificate chain if not then it doesn't
        Therefore it cannot be made to handle GSI proxy certificates without patching NetSSLeay.

SEE ALSO
       VOMS::Lite

       If you want a well behaved server consider using Apache with mod_ssl and mod_perl.  If you want proxy certificates to be able to acces a service like this consider using Apache with mod_gridsite and
       mod_perl
