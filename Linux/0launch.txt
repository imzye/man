NAME
       0launch — download and run programs by URL

SYNOPSIS
       0launch [OPTION]... PROGRAM [ARG]...

DESCRIPTION
       0launch runs the given program. PROGRAM is either a URL in the form `http://site/program.xml' or a local path name like `/path/to/program.xml'.

       If  the program is not already on your computer, 0launch downloads information about which versions are available, and lets you choose one to download. It will also (automatically) do the same for any
       libraries the program needs.

       Note that much of the functionality that was originally in 0launch has now moved to 0install(1).

       0launch PROGRAM ARGS

       is roughly equivalent to

       0install run PROGRAM ARGS

       See the 0install(1) man-page for more information.

EXAMPLES
       When a program is available using 0launch, it will have an associated URL. To run the program, simply invoke 0launch with this as an argument:

       0launch http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

       The first time you do this, details about the program are downloaded and cached, and you will be prompted to confirm the versions to use. In future, the program will run directly from the cache  with‐
       out confirmation.

       To check for new versions:

       0launch --refresh http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit

       To avoid having to keep typing the full URI, use the `0install add' command to create shortcuts to run your programs.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       0launch takes the same options as "0install run".

DEBUGGING TIPS
       To debug 0launch itself, use the --verbose and --console options. For example:

       $ 0launch -vvc http://myprog

       To trace or debug programs run by 0launch, use the --wrapper option.  For example, to run myprog --help, displaying all calls to open(2):

       $ 0launch --wrapper="strace -e open" http://myprog --help

       If your program is interpreted (e.g. a Python program), and you wish to debug the interpreter running it, you can do it like this:

       $ 0launch --wrapper="gdb --args python" http://myprog --help

FILES
       Configuration files (see freedesktop.org basedir spec):

       ~/.config/0install.net/injector/global
              Global configuration settings.

       ~/.config/0install.net/injector/trustdb.xml
              List of trusted keys.

       ~/.config/0install.net/injector/interfaces
              Per-interface settings, and extra feeds.

       Cached data (can be re-downloaded if lost):

       ~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces
              Downloaded cached feed files.

       ~/.cache/0install.net/implementations
              Downloaded cached implementations, indexed by manifest digest.
