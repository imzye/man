NAME
       lazygit — Simple terminal UI for git commands

SYNOPSIS
       lazygit  [git-arg]  [-h  |  --help]  [-v  |  --version]  [-p  |  --path  path]  [-f  |  --filter  path]  [-d  |  --debug]  [-l  |  --logs] [---profile] [-c | ---config] [-cd | ---print-config-dir]
               [-ucd | ---use-config-dir dir] [-w | ---work-tree path] [-g | ---git-dir path] [-ucf | ---use-config-file files] [-sm | ---screen-mode mode]

DESCRIPTION
       lazygit is a simple terminal UI for git commands that makes git easier to use.

       It provides an interactive interface to perform common git operations such as:

       •   Viewing and staging files

       •   Committing changes

       •   Browsing logs and diffs

       •   Managing branches and remotes

       •   Handling stashes

       All features of lazygit can be easily accessed using arrow keys and intuitive keystrokes.

OPTIONS
   Positional Arguments
       git-arg  Panel to focus upon opening lazygit. Accepted values (based on git terminology): status, branch, log, stash.  Ignored if --filter argument is passed.

   Flags
       -h, ---help              Displays help with available flags, subcommands, and positional value parameters.

       -v, ---version           Print the current version of lazygit.

       -p, ---path path         Path of the git repository.  Equivalent to ---work-tree=path and ---git-dir=path /.git.

       -f, ---filter path       Path to filter on in git log -- <path>.  When in filter mode, the commits, reflog, and stash are filtered based on the given path, and some operations are restricted.

       -d, ---debug             Run in debug mode with logging. Use the LOG_LEVEL environment variable to set the log level (debug, info, warn, error).

       -l, ---logs              Tail lazygit logs. Intended for use when lazygit --debug is running in another terminal tab.

       ---profile               Start the profiler and serve it on HTTP port 6060. See /usr/share/doc/lazygit/CONTRIBUTING.md.gz for more details.

       -c, ---config            Print the default config.

       -cd, ---print-config-dir
                                Print the path to the configuration directory.

       -ucd, ---use-config-dir dir
                                Override the default configuration directory with the provided directory.

       -w, ---work-tree path    Set the Git ---work-tree argument.

       -g, ---git-dir path      Set the Git ---git-dir argument.

       -ucf, ---use-config-file file1,file2,...
                                Use a comma-separated list of custom config file(s).

       -sm, ---screen-mode mode
                                Set the initial screen mode, which determines the size of the focused panel.  Valid values are: normal, half, full.
