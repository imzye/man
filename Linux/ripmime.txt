DESCRIPTION
       ripMIME  is  a  command  line tool used to aid in the extraction of email borne attachments to files which can be processed using other UNIX tools.  ripMIME supports both the RFC MIME standards as
       well as being able to behave according to various MUA 'features' which are often used as exploitation holes.

OPTIONS
       -i     Input MIME encoded file (use '-' to input from STDIN)

       -d     Output directory

       -p     Specify prefix filename to be used on files without a filename (default 'text')

       -e [headers file name]
              Dump headers from mailpack (default '_headers_')

       -v     Turn on verbosity

       -q     Run quietly, do not report non-fatal errors

       --verbose-contenttype
              Turn on verbosity of file content type

       --verbose-oldstyle
              Uses the v1.2.x style or filename reporting

       --verbose-defects
              Report MIME header/body defects located in the mailpack

       --stdout
              All reporting goes to stdout (Default)

       --stderr
              All reporting goes to stderr

       --syslog
              All reporting goes to syslog

       --no-paranoid
              [ Deprecated ] Turns off strict ascii-alnum filenaming

       --paranoid
              Converts all filenames to strict 7-bit compliance

       --name-by-type
              Saves a given attachment by its content-type if it has no other name

       --no-nameless
              Do not save nameless attachments

       --overwrite
              Overwrite files if they have the same name on extraction

       --unique-names
              Dont overwrite existing files (This is the default behaviour)

       --prefix
              rename by putting unique code at the front of the filename

       --postfix
              rename by putting unique code at the end of the filename

       --infix
              rename by putting unique code in the middle of the filename

       --recursion-max <maximum level>
              Set the maximum recursion level into a mailpack.  Often emails are forwarded copies of an existing email, each time this is done a new recursion level is required.  Malicious emails can  be
              constructed with many hundereds of recursion levels to induce stack faults in decoding programs.  ripMIME is hard coded with a default of 20 levels, this may be overidden using this parame‐
              ter.

       --mailbox
              Process mailbox file

       --extended-errors
              Returns error codes for non-fatal decoding situations

       --debug
              Produces detailed information about the whole decoding process

   Attachment type decoding switches
       --no-ole
              Turn off OLE decoding

       --no-uudecode
              Turns off the facility of detecting UUencoded attachments in emails

       --no-quotedprintable
              Turns off the facility of decoding QuotedPrintable data

       --no-doublecr
              Turns off saving of double-CR embedded data

       --no-mht
              Turns off MHT (a Microsoft mailpack attachment format ) decoding

       --disable-header-fix
              Turns off attempts to fix broken headers.

       --disable-qmailbounce
              Turns  off  ripMIME's  look-ahead  searching for RFC822 headers within a body of text. Normally the look-ahead is useful for decoding embedded emails which have been bounced back by systems
              like qmail, but have been included in such a way that they are not meant to be decoded, unfortunately some MUA (Outlook for one) still decode it, hence we need to by default check  for  at‐
              tachments in such forwarded bodies.

       --no-multiple-filenames
              Turns off the behaviour of handling multiple filename occurances in a single MIME header. Normally ripMIME will generate a hard link for each additional filename beyond the original attach‐
              ment filename detected.

       Note that this Debian version does not include the --no-tnef switch.  The tnef package may be useful as an alternative.

   Auxillary parameters
       --buildcodes
              Displays the information obtained by the Makefile script when ripMIME was built.  This includes the Unix timestamp, human readable version of the timestamp and the output from 'uname -a'.

       -V --version
              Give version information

       -h     Terse information on how to use ripMIME.

FILES

EXAMPLES
       To unpack an email in a file 'mailpack' to the directory /tmp with verbose output of the files unpacked;

       ripmime -i mailpack -v -d /tmp
