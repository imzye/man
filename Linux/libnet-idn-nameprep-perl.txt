NAME
       Net::IDN::Nameprep - A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain Names (RFC 3491)

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::IDN::Nameprep;
         $output = nameprep $input;

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the nameprep specification, which describes how to prepare internationalized domain name (IDN) labels in order to increase the likelihood that name input and name comparison
       work in ways that make sense for typical users throughout the world.  Nameprep is a profile of the stringprep protocol and is used as part of a suite of on-the-wire protocols for
       internationalizing the Domain Name System (DNS).

FUNCTIONS
       This module implements a single function, "nameprep", which is exported by default.

       nameprep( $input [, AllowUnassigned => 1 ] )
           Processes $input according to the nameprep specification and returns the result.

           If $input contains characters not allowed for nameprep, it throws an exception (so use "eval" if necessary).

           This function takes the following optional parameter:

           AllowUnassigned
               (boolean) If set to a false value, unassigned code points in $input are not allowed.

               False MUST be used for stored strings.

               True MAY be used for queries.

               The default is true (backwards compatibility).
