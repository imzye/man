NAME
       vim-registry - syntax for vim-addons registry files

SYNOPSIS
       PACKAGE-NAME.yaml

DESCRIPTION
       A  registry  file  is a multi-document YAML file (i.e. it can be composed by several different YAML documents separated by “---” lines). Each YAML document represents a registry entry, that is the
       information describing a single addon.

       Ideally, the registry directory contains one file per package shipping addons; with a filename obeying to the convention PACKAGE-NAME.yaml.  Hence a single package can contribute to  the  registry
       with multiple entries described in a single YAML file.

       For  example,  the  “vim-scripts”  package should ship a single /usr/share/vim/registry/vim-scripts.yaml file, containing one YAML document per shipped addon. The first lines of such file can look
       like the following:

           addon: alternate
           description: "alternate pairing files (e.g. .c/.h) with short ex-commands"
           basedir: /usr/share/vim-scripts/
           disabledby: "let loaded_alternateFile = 1"
           files:
             - plugin/a.vim
             - doc/alternate.txt
           ---
           addon: whatdomain
           description: "query the meaning of a Top Level Domain"
           basedir: /usr/share/vim-scripts/
           disabledby: "let loaded_whatdomain = 1"
           files:
             - plugin/whatdomain.vim
           ---

       Each registry entry may contain the following fields, to be typeset according to the YAML specification:

       addon (Required)
              Name of the addon.

       description (Required)
              Human understandable textual description of the addon.

       files (Required)
              List of the files which compose the addon and are required to be present in a component of the Vim runtime path for the addon to be enabled.  Each file is specified relative to a  component
              of the Vim runtime path.

       basedir (Optional)
              Directory where the files shipped by the addon (i.e., where the symlinks of the user/sysadm should point to) reside on the filesystem.  Default is /usr/share/vim/addons.

       disabledby (Optional)
              Vim script command that can be used (usually by adding it to ~/.vimrc) to prevent the addon from being used even when it is installed.  The intended usage of this field is to “blacklist” an
              undesired addon whose files are available, and hence automatically loaded by Vim, in a component of the Vim runtime path.
