NAME
       zerofill - clear unused disk space and blank devices.

SYNOPSIS
       zerofill [options] [devices] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  command is a relative of nullfile.  Like nullfile, it can be used to write all unused disk space with '0', thereby making file systems that are stored on virtual machines easier to pack.  In ad‐
       dition, zerofill can fill unused disk space with random data before zeroing, which can be useful to remove forensic trace of deleted files.  Finally, zerofile can  be  told  to  operate  on  and  zero
       (erase) complete disk devices.

OPTIONS
       --random=count
              Number of passes to use writing random data before wiping data.

       --help Outputs help screen for the user.
