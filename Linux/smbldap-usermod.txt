DESCRIPTION
       The smbldap-usermod  command  modifies the system account files to reflect the changes that are specified on the  command  line.

   UNIX options
       -c, --gecos gecos
           The new value of the user's comment field (gecos). (Don't use this to modify displayName or cn. Use -N and -S options combined instead).

       -d, --homedir home_dir
           The user's new login directory.

       -r, --rename new_user
           Allow to rename a user. This option will update the dn attribute for the user. You can also update others attributes using the corresponding script options.

       -u, --uid uid
           The numerical  value  of  the  user's  ID.   This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.  The value must  be  non negative.  Any files which the user owns  and  which  are located  in
       the directory tree rooted at the user's home directory will have the file user ID  changed  automatically.   Files outside of the user's home directory must be altered manually.

       -o, --canBeNotUnique
           uidNumber can be non unique

       -g, --gid initial_group
           The group name or number of the user's new initial login  group. The  group  name  must  exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group.  The default group number is 1.

       -G, --group [+-]group,[...]
           A list of supplementary groups which the user is also  a  member of.   Each  group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace.  The groups  are  subject  to  the  same
       restrictions as the group given with the -g option.  If the user is currently a member of a group which is not listed, the user will be removed from the group, unless the '+' or '-' caracter is used
       to add or remove groups to inital ones.

       -s, --shel shell
           The name of the user's new login shell.  Setting this  field  to blank causes the system to select the default
           login shell.

       -N, --givenName
           set the user's given name (attribute givenName). Additionally used to set the first name in displayName and cn.

       -S, --surname
           Set the user's surname (attribute sn). Additionally used to set the last name in displayName and cn.

       -P
           End by invoking smbldap-passwd to change the user password (both unix and samba passwords)

       -M, --mailAddresses  mail,[...]
           mailAddresses (comma seperated)

       -T, --mailToAddress  mail,[...]
           mailToAddress (forward address) (comma seperated)

       --shadowExpire <YYYY-MM-DD/n>
           Set the expiration date for the user password. This only affect unix account. The date may be specified as either YYYY-MM-DD or 'n' days from day. The 'n' syntax also supports the extended format
       (#y)(#m)(#d) for years, months, and days from today. One need not specify all three, so all of the following are examples of valid input: '5y4m2d' (5 years, 4 months, and 2 days), '5y' (5 years),
       '5y2d' (5 years and 2 days), and '3' (3 days). This option calls the internal 'timelocal' command to set calculate the number of seconds from Junary 1 1970 to the specified date.

       --shadowMax <n>
           User must change the password, at least, every 'n' days

       --shadowMin <n>
           User must wait 'n' days once the password has changed before changing it again

       --shadowInactive <n>
           Number of days of inactivity allowed for the specified user

       --shadowWarning <n>
           User is warned that the password must be changed four days before the password expires

       -L, --shadowLock
           Lock unix user's password. This puts a '!' in front of the encrypted password, effectively disabling the password.

       -U, --shadowUnlock
           Unlock unix user's password. This removes the '!' in front of the encrypted password.

   SAMBA options
       -a, --addsambaSAMAccount

       -e, --expire <YYYY-MM-DD(HH:MM:SS)/n>
           Sets the expiration for both samba (--sambaExpire) and shadow (--shadowExpire).

       --ou node
           The user's account will be moved to the specified organazional unit. It is relative to the user suffix dn ($usersdn) defined in the configuration file.
           Ex: 'ou=admin,ou=all'

       --sambaExpire <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS/n>
           Set the expiration date for the user account. This only affects the samba account. The date must be in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The n-days format of shadowExpire is also
       supported. This option uses the internal 'timelocal' command to set calculate the number of seconds from Junary 1 1970 to the specified date.

       -A, --sambaPwdCanChange
           can change password ? 0 if no, 1 if yes

       -B, --sambaPwdMustChange
           must change password ? 0 if no, 1 if yes

       -C, --sambaHomePath path
           sambaHomePath (SMB home share, like '\\\\PDC-SRV\\homes')

       -D, --sambaHomeDrive drive
           sambaHomeDrive (letter associated with home share, like 'H:')

       -E, --sambaLogonScript script

       -F, --sambaProfilePath path
           sambaProfilePath (profile directory, like '\\\\PDC-SRV\\profiles\\foo')

       -H, --sambaAcctFlags flags
           sambaAcctFlags, spaces and trailing bracket are ignored (samba account control bits like '[NDHTUMWSLKI]')

       -I, --sambaDisable
           disable user. Can't be used with -H or -J

       -J, --sambaEnable
