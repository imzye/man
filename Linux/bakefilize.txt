BAKEFILIZE(1)                  Running Bakefile                  BAKEFILIZE(1)

NAME
       bakefilize - prepare Bakefile project for use with Autoconf

SYNOPSIS
       bakefilize [--copy] [--dry-run] [--force] [--verbose] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       For the "autoconf" format, Bakefile creates Makefile.in files that
       depend on the availability of common pieces of a GNU build system.
       (config.guess, install-sh, etc.) These tools are part of Automake,
       which can copy these files into a project's directory during
       processing.  bakefilize effectively replaces the automake --add-missing
       feature.

       It is standard practice in Autoconf-based projects to provide a
       "bootstrap" script (commonly called either bootstrap or autogen.sh) to
       run commands like autoconf with the proper flags and in the proper
       order. You should run bakefilize in that script, at some point before
       the configure script runs.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -c, --copy
           Copy the files from the Automake directory, rather than the default
           behavior of making symbolic links.

       -n, --dry-run
           Only show the commands that would be executed.

       -f, --force
           Replace all existing files, instead of only adding missing files.

       -v, --verbose
           Show debugging messages.

       --help
           Display usage information for bakefilize
