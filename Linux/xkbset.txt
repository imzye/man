DESCRIPTION
       This  program can be used to set various options available in the XKB extensions.  This includes such things as mousekeys where one can use the numeric pad keys to move the mouse; stickykeys where
       modifiers like control and shift will lock until the next key press (good for one finger typing); slowkeys where the keys will not work unless they are pressed for a certain amount  of  time;  and
       bouncekeys in which if a key is pressed more than once rapidly, only one key press will be registered.

OPTIONS
       b       The b option controls whether the bell is switched on or off.

       h       The h option (or no options) will type a rather helpful usage message - definitely more informative than this unfinished man page.

       perkeyrepeat hex-mask
               With  this option, hex-mask is a sequence of 64 hex digits, representing 32 bytes.  These bytes represent which keys will autorepeat, and which will not.  The 8n+kth key will autorepeat if
               the kth bit of the nth byte is set.  See also the r or the repeatkey option.

       repeatkeys|r [key-code | rate delay [interval] ]
               The r or repeatkey  option can be used to control the autorepeat feature.  By itself, it can switch the autorepeat on or off.  Followed by a single number, it can be used to switch autore‐
               peat on or off for that particular keycode (see also the perkeyrepeat option).  Followed by rate, it can be used to set the time in milliseconds after the key is pressed before  autorepeat
               will start, and optionally the time in milliseconds between the key repeats.

BUGS
       In  some  earlier versions of X, some of the features do not work properly.  For example, mousekeys acceleration.  Also, the perkeyrepeat option (or repeatkey followed by a key code) did not work.
       These are due to bugs in the XKB extensions.  These bugs are fixed in more recent versions of X.

       Also the man page is woefully incomplete.
