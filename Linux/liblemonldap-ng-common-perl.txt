   COMMANDS
       get

           lemonldap-ng-sessions get <id> [<id> ...]

       This command lets you read the content of a session.

       You must pass one or several session IDs as parameters.

       Examples

               lemonldap-ng-sessions get 9684dd2a6489bf2be2fbdd799a8028e3

               lemonldap-ng-sessions get --persistent dwho

       search

           lemonldap-ng-sessions search [<options>]

       This command lets you search for sessions.

       It can be used to find the session IDs that other commands need.

       You can restrict the search with options. See "OPTIONS"

       Examples

               lemonldap-ng-sessions search

               lemonldap-ng-sessions search --backend persistent

               lemonldap-ng-sessions search --where uid=dwho

               lemonldap-ng-sessions search --where uid=dwho \
                       --id-only

               lemonldap-ng-sessions search --backend persistent \
                       --where _session_uid=dwho

               lemonldap-ng-sessions search --where uid=dwho \
                       --select authenticationLevel

           lemonldap-ng-sessions search --where '_startTime>20240410063538'
           lemonldap-ng-sessions search --where '_startTime<20240410063538'

       And you can just display the number of result using lemonldap-ng-sessions search --count

       delete

           lemonldap-ng-sessions delete --where <filter>

       You may give it one or several session IDs to remove.

               lemonldap-ng-sessions delete --persistent dwho

       Or you can give it a search expression.

           lemonldap-ng-sessions backup > file
           # or
           lemonldap-ng-sessions backup --out file
           # or limited to persistent sessions
           lemonldap-ng-sessions backup --persistent --out file
           # or limited to OIDC refresh_tokens
           lemonldap-ng-sessions backup --refresh-tokens --out file

       Simple command to dump all sessions or only persistent or refresh_tokens.

       restore

           lemonldap-ng-sessions restore < file
           # or
           lemonldap-ng-sessions restore file

       Command to restore sessions using a file generated by "backup" command

   OPTIONS
       --select,-s
           Lets you select which fields to output in the JSON result.

           This option can be set multiple times

       --where,-w
           This option lets you filter your session search according to a filter.

           For now, only one filter can be set.

           Examples:

                   --search uid=dwho
                   --search _sessionType=OIDC
                   --search '_startTime>20240410063538'
                   --search '_startTime<20240410063538'

       --backend,-b
           This option lets you specify which session backend to use.

           You only need it when you configured multiple session backends in your LemonLDAP::NG installation (for Persistent, SAML, CAS or OIDC sessions)

           Examples:

                   --backend persistent
                   --backend saml
                   --backend oidc
                   --backend cas

       --persistent,-p
           This option is a shortcut for specifying --backend persistent and using the UID hash as a session ID

           Example:

                   lemonldap-ng-sessions --backend persistent \
                           get 5efe8af397fc3577e05b483aca964f1b

           is the same as

                   lemonldap-ng-sessions get --persistent dwho

       --id-only,-i
           This option replaces the standard JSON output format with a simpler format of one session ID per line.

           This allows some interesting combos using xargs. For example, if you want to remove all sessions started by "dwho"

                   lemonldap-ng-sessions search --where uid=dwho --id-only | \
                           xargs lemonldap-ng-sessions delete

       --user,-u
           This option forces the system user that runs the script.

       --group,-g
           This option forces the system group that runs the script.

       --hash, -c
           When  the session storage is protected by hashed session storage <https://lemonldap-ng.org/documentation/latest/security.html#configure-security-settings>, this option indicates that the given
           session is the original value (cookie value)
