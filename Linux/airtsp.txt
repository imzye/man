NAME
       airtspBinary executable for the C++ Simulated Airline Schedule Manager Library

SYNOPSIS
       airtsp [--prefix] [-v|--version] [-h|--help] [-b|--builtin] [-i|--input <path-to-input>] [-l|--log <path-to-output-log-file>]

DESCRIPTION
       airtsp is a small program showing how to use the AirTSP library.

       airtsp accepts the following options:

       --prefix
        Show the AirTSP installation prefix.

       -v, --version
        Print the currently installed version of AirTSP on the standard output.

       -h, --help
        Produce that message and show usage.

       -b, --builtin
        The sample BOM tree can be either built-in or parsed from input files. In that latter case, the -i/--input option must be specified as well

       -i, --input <path-to-input-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the (CSV) input file specifying the schedule (flight-period) entries.

       -l, --log <path-to-output-log-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the output log file.

       -r, --read_booking_request
        Indicates that a booking request is given as a command-line option. That latter must then be given with the -b/--bkg_req option.

       -q, --bkg_req <booking-request>
        Booking request word list (e.g. 'NCE BKK NCE 2007-04-21 2007-04-21 10:00:00 C 1 DF RO 5 NONE 10:0:0 2000.0 20.0'), which should be located at the end of the command line (otherwise, the other options
       would be interpreted as part of that booking request word list).

       See the output of the `airtsp --help' command for default options.
