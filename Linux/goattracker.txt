NAME
       goattracker - C64 music editor

SYNOPSIS
       goattracker [songname] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the goattracker command.

       goattracker  is  a  C64  music tracker.  It supports emulated output via the software reSID engine, the HardSID soundcard, or the Catweasel (MK3/MK4) controller card, and produces songs in its own
       format (*.SNG). The program can also export tunes in SID format, BIN format, or Commodore PRG format for inclusion on a floppy you can stick into a 1541/1571/1581 drive.

       Like most tracker programs, the program is able to import instrument files, create and modify track patterns, set the order of playback of patterns and change details of the song such as the title
       and author. If you are familiar with tracker-like programs, then GoatTracker will feel like a simple version of those, though with differences attributable to the hardware. People new to composing
       in general should look up other information on composing on the C64.
