NAME
       ppod2latex - convert PseudoPod to LaTeX

SYNOPSIS
           ppod2latex [--keep_ligatures] [--captions_below] [--full] <file-list>

DESCRIPTION
       Convert a file (or list of files) written in PseudoPod into LaTeX for later processing to e.g. PDF via "pdflatex".

       The output LaTeX text requires a LaTeX preamble and needs to be wrapped within a "document" environment.

OPTIONS
       keep_ligatures
           Retain ligatures in LaTeX output text.  Thus the character pairs fi, fl, and ft will be joined when LaTeX produces its output.

       captions_below
           Put figure and table captions below the object as opposed to above, which is the default.

       full
           Create a standalone document which can immediately be run through "latex" or "pdflatex".
