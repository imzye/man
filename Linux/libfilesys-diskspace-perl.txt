NAME
       Filesys::DiskSpace - Perl df

SYNOPSIS
           use Filesys::DiskSpace;
           ($fs_type, $fs_desc, $used, $avail, $fused, $favail) = df $dir;

DESCRIPTION
       This routine displays information on a file system such as its type, the amount of disk space occupied, the total disk space and the number of inodes.  It tries syscall(SYS_statfs) and
       syscall(SYS_statvfs) in several ways.  If all fails, it "croak"s.

OPTIONS
       $fs_type
           [number] type of the filesystem.

       $fs_desc
           [string] description of this fs.

       $used
           [number] size used (in Kb).

       $avail
           [number] size available (in Kb).

       $ffree
           [number] free inodes.

       $fused
           [number] inodes used.

Installation
       See the INSTALL file.

NOTES
       This module was formerly called File::Df. It has been renamed into Filesys::DiskSpace. It could have be Filesys::Df but unfortunatly another module created in the meantime uses this name.

       Tested with Perl 5.003 under these systems :

                  - Solaris 2.[4/5]
                  - SunOS 4.1.[2/3/4]
                  - HP-UX 9.05, 10.[1/20] (see below)
                  - OSF1 3.2, 4.0
                  - Linux 2.0.*, 2.2.*

       Note for HP-UX users :

          if you obtain this message :
          "Undefined subroutine &main::SYS_statfs called at Filesys/DiskSpace.pm
          line XXX" and if you are using a hp9000s700, then edit the syscall.ph file
          (in the Perl lib tree) and copy the line containing "SYS_statfs {196;}"
          outside the "if (defined &__hp9000s800)" block (around line 356).
