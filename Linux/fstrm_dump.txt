fstrm_dump(1)               General Commands Manual              fstrm_dump(1)

NAME
       fstrm_dump - Display metadata and contents of Frame Streams file.

SYNOPSIS
       fstrm_dump input-file [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       fstrm_dump  opens  input-file and prints its framing metadata to stderr
       and frame data to stdout.  The input-file may  be  "-"  to  read  Frame
       Streams data from standard input.

       Frame data is printed as a single line quoted string with non-printable
       characters replaced by backslash-prefixed hex escape sequences. For ex‐
       ample,  a frame containing "Hello, world\n" would have its data printed
       as:

             "Hello, world\x0a"

       The only framing metadata expected in a  Frame  Streams  file  are  the
       start  frame with a content type field, the data frame lengths, and the
       stop frame. These are printed, respectively, as:

            FSTRM_CONTROL_START

            FSTRM_CONTROL_FIELD_CONTENT_TYPE (N bytes)
             "content-type"

            Data frame (N) bytes

            FSTRM_CONTROL_STOP

       If fstrm_dump is given the second output-file parameter,  input  frames
       are additionally written to output-file.  This is mainly useful for re‐
       gression testing of the fstrm_file_writer code.
