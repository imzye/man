NAME
       pmlogger - create archive log for performance metrics

SYNOPSIS
       pmlogger  [-CLNoPruy?]  [-c conffile] [-h host] [-H hostname] [-K spec]
       [-l logfile] [-m note] [-n pmnsfile] [-p pid] [-s endsize]  [-t  inter‐
       val]  [-T  endtime] [-U username] [-v volsize] [-V version] [-x fd] ar‐
       chive

DESCRIPTION
       pmlogger creates the archive logs of performance metric values that may
       be  ``played  back''  by  other  Performance Co-Pilot (see PCPIntro(1))
       tools.  These logs form the basis of the VCR paradigm and retrospective
       performance analysis services common to the PCP toolkit.

       The  mandatory argument archive is the base name for the physical files
       that constitute an archive log.  The archive argument may contain strf‐
       time(3)  meta-characters,  which  will be substituted prior to creating
       the archive log files.  When pmlogger is run as a service  (see  pmlog‐
       ger_daily(1)), the standard archive base name template is %Y%m%d.%H.%M.

       The  -V option specifies the version for the archive that is generated.
       By default a version 2 archive is generated, and the  only  value  cur‐
       rently supported for version is 2.

       Unless directed to another host by the -h option or when directly using
       PMDAs via the -o option, pmlogger will contact the Performance  Metrics
       Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host and use that as the source of
       the metric values to be logged.

       To support the required flexibility and control over what is logged and
       when,  pmlogger  maintains  an  independent two level logging state for
       each instance of each performance metric.   At  the  first  (mandatory)
       level, logging is allowed to be on (with an associated interval between
       samples), or off or maybe.  In the latter case, the  second  (advisory)
       level  logging is allowed to be on (with an associated interval between
       samples), or off.

       The mandatory level allows universal specification  that  some  metrics
       must  be  logged,  or  must  not  be logged.  The default state for all
       instances of all metrics when pmlogger starts is  mandatory  maybe  and
       advisory off.

       Use  pmlc(1)  to interrogate and change the logging state once pmlogger
       is running.

       If a metric's state is mandatory (on or off) and a request is  made  to
       change  it  to  mandatory  maybe,  the new state is mandatory maybe and
       advisory off.  If a metric's state is already advisory (on or off)  and
       a request is made to change it to mandatory maybe, the current state is
       retained.

       It is not possible for pmlogger to log specific instances of  a  metric
       and  all  instances  of  the  same  metric  concurrently.   If specific
       instances are being logged and a request to log all instances is  made,
       then  all  instances  of the metric will be logged according to the new
       request, superseding any prior  logging  request  for  the  metric.   A
       request  to  log  all instances of a metric will supersede any previous
       request to log all instances.  A request to log specific instances of a
       metric  when  all instances are already being logged is refused.  To do
       this one must turn off logging for all instances of the  metric  first.
       In each case, the validity of the request is checked first; for example
       a request to change a metric's logging state to advisory on when it  is
       currently  mandatory  off is never permitted (it is necessary to change
       the state to mandatory maybe first).

       Optionally, each system running pmcd(1) may also be configured to run a
       ``primary''  pmlogger  instance.  This pmlogger instance is launched by
       $PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger,    and    is    affected     by     the     files
       $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/control,  $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/control.d
       (use chkconfig(8), systemctl(1) or similar  platform-specific  commands
       to  activate  or  disable  the primary pmlogger instance), $PCP_SYSCON‐
       FIG_DIR/pmlogger (environment variable settings for the primary  pmlog‐
       ger)  $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger.options  (command line options
       passed to the primary pmlogger)  and  $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/con‐
       fig.default  (the  default  initial  configuration file for the primary
       pmlogger).

       The primary pmlogger instance is identified by the  -P  option.   There
       may  be  at most one ``primary'' pmlogger instance on each system.  The
       primary pmlogger instance (if any) must be running on the same host  as
       the pmcd(1) to which it connects (if any), so the -h and -P options are
       mutually exclusive.

       Logging of some metrics is possible even in  the  absence  of  a  local
       pmcd(1),  using  the  "local context" mode of operation.  This is acti‐
       vated using the -o option, and causes pmlogger to make use of local DSO
       PMDAs  instead  of  communicating with pmcd(1).  When operating using a
       local context, the -K option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs  that
       should  be  made  accessible.  The spec argument conforms to the syntax
       described in pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option may be used.

       When launched as a non-primary instance, pmlogger will exit immediately
       if  the  configuration  file  causes no metric logging to be scheduled.
       The -L option overrides this behavior, and causes a non-primary  pmlog‐
       ger  instance to ``linger'', presumably pending some future dynamic re-
       configuration and state change via pmlc(1).  pmlogger will also  linger
       without  the  -L  option being used if all the metrics to be logged are
       logged as once only metrics.  When the  once  only  metrics  have  been
       logged,  a  warning  message  will  be generated stating that the event
       queue is empty and no more events will be scheduled.

       By default all diagnostics and errors from pmlogger are written to  the
       file  pmlogger.log in the directory where pmlogger is launched.  The -l
       option may be used to override the default behavior.  If the  log  file
       cannot  be  created  or  is not writable, output is written to standard
       error instead.  If the logfile for the -l option  is  "-"  (i.e.   -l-)
       then  log messages are written to the standard output stream.  This can
       be particularly useful when running pmlogger manually, rather than as a
       service daemon.

       The  -N  option directs pmlogger to notify a service manager, typically
       systemd(1), when it has started and is about to begin writing  PCP  ar‐
       chive  logs.   This option would only normally be used when pmlogger is
       run as a daemon service under the control of a  service  manager.   For
       more   details,  see  __pmServerNotifyServiceManagerReady(3)  and  sys‐
       temd(1).  On platforms that do not use a service manager that  supports
       notifications, the -N option is basically a no-op.

       If  specified,  the  -s  option instructs pmlogger to terminate after a
       certain size in records, bytes or time units has been accumulated.   If
       endsize  is an integer then endsize records will be written to the log.
       If endsize is an integer suffixed by b or bytes then endsize  bytes  of
       the  archive  data will be written out (note, however, that archive log
       record boundaries will not be broken and so this limit may be  slightly
       surpassed).   Other  viable file size units include: K, Kb, KiB, Kbyte,
       Kilobyte for kilobytes and M, Mb, MiB, Mbyte,  Megabyte  for  megabytes
       and  G,  Gb,  GiB,  Gbyte,  Gigabyte for gigabytes.  These units may be
       optionally suffixed by an s and may be of  mixed  case.   Alternatively
       endsize  may  be an integer or a floating point number suffixed using a
       time unit as described in PCPIntro(1) for the interval argument (to the
       standard PCP -t command line option).
       Some examples of different formats:
          -s 100
          -s 100bytes
          -s 100K
          -s 100Mb
          -s 10Gbyte
          -s 10mins
          -s 1.5hours
       The default is for pmlogger to run forever.

       The  -r option causes the size of the physical record(s) for each group
       of metrics and the expected contribution of the group to  the  size  of
       the  PCP  archive  for one full day of collection to be reported in the
       log file.  This information is reported the first time  each  group  is
       successfully written to the archive.

       The  -U  option specifies the user account under which to run pmlogger.
       The default is the current user account for interactive use.  When  run
       as a daemon, the unprivileged "pcp" account is used in current versions
       of PCP, but in older versions the superuser account ("root")  was  used
       by default.

       The  log file is potentially a multi-volume data set, and the -v option
       causes pmlogger to start a new volume after a certain size in  records,
       bytes,  or time units has been accumulated for the current volume.  The
       format of this size specification is identical to that of the -s option
       (see  above).   The  default  is for pmlogger to create a single volume
       log.  Additional volume switches can also be forced  asynchronously  by
       either  using  pmlc(1) or sending pmlogger a SIGHUP signal (see below).
       Note, if a scheduled volume switch  is  in  operation  due  to  the  -v
       option, then its counters will be reset after an asynchronous switch.

       Independent  of  any -v option, each volume of an archive is limited to
       no more than 2^31 bytes, so pmlogger will automatically  create  a  new
       volume for the archive before this limit is reached.

       Normally  pmlogger operates on the distributed Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), however if the -n  option  is  specified  an  alternative
       local PMNS is loaded from the file pmnsfile.

       Under  normal circumstances, pmlogger will run forever (except for a -s
       option or a termination signal).  The -T option may be  used  to  limit
       the  execution  time  using  the format of time as prescribed by PCPIn‐
       tro(1).  The time is interpreted within  the  time  zone  of  the  PMCD
       server,  unless the -y option is given, within which case the time zone
       at this logger host is used.
       Some examples of different formats:
          -T 10mins
          -T '@ 11:30'
       From this it can be seen that -T 10mins and -s 10mins perform identical
       actions.

       Alternatively,  pmlogger  runtime  may  be  limited  to the lifetime of
       another process by using the -p or --PID option to nominate the PID  of
       the  process of interest.  In this case the pmlogger will exit when the
       other process no longer exists.

       When pmlogger receives a SIGHUP signal, the current volume of  the  log
       is closed, and a new volume is opened.  This mechanism (or the alterna‐
       tive mechanism via pmlc(1)) may be used to manage the growth of the log
       files  - once a log volume is closed, that file may be archived without
       ill-effect on the continued operation of pmlogger.   See  also  the  -v
       option above.

       When  pmlogger  receives  a  SIGUSR2 signal, the current archive log is
       closed, and a new archive is opened.  For this to succeed, the original
       archive   argument  must  include  strftime(3)  meta  characters  (e.g.
       %Y%m%d.%H.%M), otherwise pmlogger will exit because the  archive  files
       will  already  exist  and pmlogger will not over-write existing archive
       files.  Note that SIGUSR2 triggers pmlogger to re-exec itself  and  re-
       parse all original arguments.  This means that any relative time limits
       placed on it's termination time or sampling limit are reset  and  begin
       again.   This  only  affects  relative  termination times, not absolute
       times e.g.  -T 5s is affected, but -T 5pm is not.

       Historically the buffers for the current log may  be  flushed  to  disk
       using  the  flush  command  of pmlc(1), or by using the -u option.  The
       current version of pmlogger  and  the  libpcp  routines  that  underpin
       pmlogger  unconditionally  use unbuffered writes and a single fwrite(3)
       for each logical record written, and so ``flushing'' does not force any
       additional  data  to  be written to the file system.  The -u option and
       the pmlc(1) flush command are retained for backwards compatibility.

       When launched with the -x option,  pmlogger  will  accept  asynchronous
       control  requests  on  the  file  descriptor  fd.   This option is only
       expected to be used internally by PCP applications that support  ``live
       record mode''.

       The -m option allows the string note to be appended to the map file for
       this instance of pmlogger in the $PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger directory.  This
       is  currently used internally to document the file descriptor (fd) when
       the -x option is used, or to indicate that this pmlogger  instance  was
       started  under the control of pmlogger_check(1), (-m pmlogger_check) or
       was re-exec'd (see execvp(3)) due to a SIGUSR2 signal being recieved as
       described above (-m reexec).

       The  -H option allows the hostname written into the archive label to be
       overridden.  This mirrors the -H option of pmcd(1) , but allows  it  to
       be  specified  on the pmlogger process.  Without this option, the value
       returned from the logged pmcd(1) is used.

       The -C option will cause the configuration file to be parsed and pmlog‐
       ger  will  then  exit without creating an output archive, so when -C is
       specified, the archive command line  argument  is  not  required.   Any
       errors in the configuration file are reported.

CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
       The  configuration  file may be specified with the -c option.  If it is
       not, configuration specifications are read from standard input.

       If conffile does not exist, then a search  is  made  in  the  directory
       $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger  for a file of the same name, and if found
       that file is used, e.g. if config.mumble does not exist in the  current
       directory  and the file $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.mumble does
       exist, then -c config.mumble and  -c  $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/con‐
       fig.mumble are equivalent.

       The syntax for the configuration file is as follows.

       1.   Words are separated by white space (space, tab or newline).

       2.   The  symbol  ``#'' (hash) introduces a comment, and all text up to
            the next newline is ignored.

       3.   Keywords (shown in bold below)  must  appear  literally  (i.e.  in
            lower case).

       4.   Each  specification begins with the optional keyword log, followed
            by one of the states mandatory on, mandatory off, mandatory maybe,
            advisory on or advisory off.

       5.   For the on states, a logging interval must follow using the syntax
            ``once'', or ``default'', or ``every N timeunits'', or simply  ``N
            timeunits''  -  N  is an unsigned integer, and timeunits is one of
            the keywords msec, millisecond, sec, second, min, minute, hour  or
            the plural form of one of the above.
            Internal  limitations  require  the  interval  to  be smaller than
            (approximately) 74 hours.  An interval value of zero is a  synonym
            for once.  An interval of default means to use the default logging
            interval of 60 seconds; this  default  value  may  be  changed  to
            interval with the -t command line option.

            The interval argument follows the syntax described in PCPIntro(1),
            and in the simplest form may be an unsigned integer  (the  implied
            units in this case are seconds).

       6.   Following  the  state and possible interval specifications comes a
            ``{'', followed by a list of one or more metric specifications and
            a  closing  ``}''.   The list is white space (or comma) separated.
            If there is only one metric specification in the list, the  braces
            are optional.

       7.   A  metric  specification consists of a metric name optionally fol‐
            lowed by a set of instance names.  The  metric  name  follows  the
            standard  PCP  naming  conventions, see PMNS(5), and if the metric
            name is a non-leaf node in the PMNS (see PMNS(5)),  then  pmlogger
            will recursively descend the PMNS and apply the logging specifica‐
            tion to all descendent metric names that are  leaf  nodes  in  the
            PMNS.  The set of instance names is a ``['', followed by a list of
            one or more space (or comma) separated names, numbers or  strings,
            and  a  closing  ``]''.  Elements in the list that are numbers are
            assumed to be internal instance identifiers,  other  elements  are
            assumed  to  be  external instance identifiers - see pmGetInDom(3)
            for more information.

            If no instances are  given,  then  the  logging  specification  is
            applied to all instances of the associated metric.

       8.   There may be an arbitrary number of logging specifications.

       9.   As  of  PCP  version  4.0 and later, any metric name specification
            that does not resolve to a leaf node in the PMNS is  added  to  an
            internal list of possible dynamic subtree roots.  PMDAs can dynam‐
            ically create new metrics below a dynamic root node in their PMNS,
            and  send a notification to clients that the PMNS has changed, see
            pmdaExtSetFlags(3) and in particular the  METRIC  CHANGES  section
            for  API  details.   This  mechanism  is  currently  supported  by
            pmdaopenmetrics(1) and pmdammv(1).  When a fetch issued by  pmlog‐
            ger returns with the PMDA_EXT_NAMES_CHANGE flag set, pmlogger will
            traverse the internal list of possible dynamic subtree  nodes  and
            dynamically  discover  any new metrics.  In effect, as of PCP ver‐
            sion 4.0 and later, pmlogger can be configured to dynamically  log
            new  metrics  that  appear  in the future, after the configuration
            file is initially parsed.

       10.  Following all of the  logging  specifications,  there  may  be  an
            optional  access  control section, introduced by the literal token
            [access].  Thereafter come access control rules that allow or dis‐
            allow operations from particular hosts or groups of hosts.

            The  operations  may  be  used to interrogate or control a running
            pmlogger using pmlc(1) and fall into the following classes:

            enquire        interrogate the status of pmlogger and the  metrics
                           it is logging
            advisory       Change advisory logging.
            mandatory      Change mandatory logging.
            all            All of the above.

            Access  control  rules  are  of the form ``allow hostlist : opera‐
            tionlist ;'' and ``disallow hostlist : operationlist ;''.

            The hostlist follows the syntax and semantics for the access  con‐
            trol  mechanisms used by PMCD and are fully documented in pmcd(1).
            An operationslist is a comma  separated  list  of  the  operations
            advisory, mandatory, enquire and all.

            A  missing [access] section allows all access and is equivalent to
            allow * : all;.

       The configuration (either from standard input or conffile) is initially
       scanned  by  pmcpp(1)  with  the  options  -rs and -I $PCP_VAR_DIR/con‐
       fig/pmlogger.  This extends the configuration file syntax with  include
       file  processing  (%include),  a  common location to search for include
       files  ($PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger),  macro  definitions   (%define),
       macro  expansion (%name and %{name}) and conditional inclusion of lines
       (%ifdef name ... %else ...  %endif  and  %ifndef  name  ...  %else  ...
       %endif).

OPTIONS
       The available command line options are:

       -c conffile, --config=conffile
            Specify the conffile file to use.

       -C, --check
            Parse configuration and exit.

       -h host, --host=host
            Fetch  performance  metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than from
            the default localhost.

       -H hostname, --hostname=hostname
            Specify the hostname  to  use  instead  of  the  one  returned  by
            pmcd(1).

       -K spec, --spec-local=spec
            When fetching metrics from a local context (see -o), the -K option
            may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be made  accessi‐
            ble.   The  spec  argument  conforms  to  the  syntax described in
            pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option may be used.

       -l logfile, --log=logfile
            Write all diagnostics to logfile instead  of  the  default  pmlog‐
            ger.log.

       -L, --linger
            Run even if not the primary logger instance and nothing to log.

       -m note, --note=note
            Append note to the port map file for this instance.

       -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
            Load  an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5)) from
            the file pmnsfile.

       -N, --notify
            Notify service manager such as systemd(1) as needed.

       -o, --local-PMDA
            Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the local
            host without PMCD.  See also -K.

       -p PID, --PID=PID
            Log specified metrics for the lifetime of the pid PID.

       -P, --primary
            Run  as  primary  logger  instance.   See  above for more detailed
            description of this.

            Specify the logging interval.  The default value is 60 seconds.

       -T endtime, --finish=endtime
            Specify the endtime when to end logging.

       -u   Use unbuffered output.  This is the default (so this  option  does
            nothing).

       -x fd
            Allow asynchronous control requests on the file descriptor fd.

       -y   Use local timezone instead of the timezone from the pmcd(1) host.

       -?, --help
            Display usage message and exit.

EXAMPLES
       For each PCP utility, there is a  sample  pmlogger  configuration  file
       that could be used to create an archive log suitable for replaying with
       that tool (i.e. includes all of the performance  metrics  used  by  the
       tool).   For  a  tool  named  foo this configuration file is located in
       $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.foo.

       The following is a simple default  configuration  file  for  a  primary
       pmlogger  instance,  and  demonstrates  most of the capabilities of the
       configuration specification language.

            log mandatory on once { hinv.ncpu hinv.ndisk }
            log mandatory on every 10 minutes {
                disk.all.write
                disk.all.read
                network.interface.in.packets [ "et0" ]
                network.interface.out.packets [ "et0" ]
                nfs.server.reqs [ "lookup" "getattr" "read" "write" ]
            }

            log advisory on every 30 minutes {
                environ.temp
                pmcd.pdu_in.total
                pmcd.pdu_out.total
            }

            %include "macros.default"

            %ifdef %disk_detail
            log mandatory on %disk_detail_freq {
                disk.dev
            }
            %endif

            [access]
            disallow * : all except enquire;
            allow localhost : mandatory, advisory;

DIAGNOSTICS
       The archive logs are sufficiently precious that pmlogger will not trun‐
       cate an existing physical file.  A message of the form
        ...: "foo.index" already exists, not over-written
        ...: File exists
       indicates  this  situation  has arisen.  You must explicitly remove the
       files and launch pmlogger again.

       There may be at most one primary pmlogger instance per monitored  host;
       attempting to bend this rule produces the error:
        pmlogger: there is already a primary pmlogger running

       Various  other  messages  relating  to  the creation and/or deletion of
       files in $PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger suggest a  permission  problem  on  this
       directory, or some feral files have appeared therein.

FILES
       archive.meta
            metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for the ar‐
            chive log

       archive.0
            initial volume of metrics values (subsequent volumes have suffixes
            1, 2, ...)

       archive.index
            temporal  index  to support rapid random access to the other files
            in the archive log

       $PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger
            pmlogger maintains the files in this directory as the map  between
            the  process id of the pmlogger instance and the IPC port that may
            be used to control each pmlogger instance (as used by pmlc(1))

       $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.default
            default  configuration  file  for  the  primary  logger   instance
            launched from $PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger

       $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.*
            assorted  configuration  files suitable for creating logs that may
            be subsequently replayed with the PCP visualization and monitoring
            tools

       $PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/<hostname>
            Default  directory  for  PCP  archive files for performance metric
            values collected from the host <hostname>.

       $PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmlogger
            additional environment variables that will be set when the primary
            pmlogger  instance  executes.   Only  settings of the form "PMLOG‐
            GER_VARIABLE=value" will be honoured.

       ./pmlogger.log
            (or $PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/<hostname>/pmlogger.log when started automat‐
            ically  by  either  $PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger or one of the pmlogger(1)
            monitoring scripts such as pmlogger_check(1))
            all messages and diagnostics are directed here

ENVIRONMENT
       Normally pmlogger creates a socket to  receive  control  messages  from
       pmlc(1)  on  the  first  available TCP/IP port numbered 4330 or higher.
       The environment variable PMLOGGER_PORT may be used to specify an alter‐
       native starting port number.

       If  set  to  the  value 1, the PMLOGGER_LOCAL environment variable will
       cause pmlogger to run in a localhost-only mode of operation,  where  it
       binds only to the loopback interface.

       The  PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT  variable may be set by applications such
       as pmlc(1) to specify a timeout in seconds for connection  requests  to
       the  pmlogger  control port.  If not set, connections may block indefi‐
       nitely.  This variable would not normally be set by pmlogger itself.

       The PMLOGGER_MAXPENDING variable can be set  to  indicate  the  maximum
       length to which the queue of pending pmlc connections may grow.

       The  default  sampling  interval  used by pmlogger can be set using the
       PMLOGGER_INTERVAL variable (if not set, 60 seconds will be used).  Both
       the command line and directives in the configuration file will override
       this value.  It is an integer in units of seconds.

       On platforms using systemd(1), and when the -N  option  is  given,  the
       NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variable would normally be set by the service
       manager prior to launching pmlogger.

PCP ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the
       file  and  directory names used by PCP.  On each installation, the file
       /etc/pcp.conf contains the  local  values  for  these  variables.   The
       $PCP_CONF  variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
       file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
