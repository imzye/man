NAME
       POE::Component::Resolver::Sidecar - delegate subprocess to call getaddrinfo()

VERSION
       version 0.921

SYNOPSIS
       Used internally by POE::Component::Resolver.

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Component::Resolver creates subprocesses to call getaddrinfo() so that the main program doesn't block during that time.

       The actual getaddrinfo() calling code is abstracted into this module so it can be run in a separate executable program.  This reduces the memory footprint of forking the entire main process for
       just getaddrinfo().

       It's a strong, useful pattern that other POE::Components have implemented before.  POE::Quickie does it generically.  POE::Component::SimpleDBI and POE::Component::EasyDBI do it so their DBI
       subprocesses are relatively lightweight.

   main
       The main code to read POE::Component::Resolver requests from STDIN and write getaddrinfo() responses to STDOUT.

SEE ALSO
       POE::Component::Generic is one generic implementation of this pattern.

       POE::Quickie is another generic implementation of this pattern.

BUGS
       None known.
