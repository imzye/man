NAME
       masktest - Find differences in wildcard matching between Samba's implementation and that of a remote server.

SYNOPSIS
       masktest {//server/share} [-U user%pass] [-d debuglevel] [-W workgroup] [-n numloops] [-s seed] [-a] [-E] [-M max protocol] [-f filechars] [-m maskchars] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       masktest is a utility for detecting differences in behaviour between Samba's own implementation and that of a remote server. It will run generate random filenames/masks and check if these match the
       same files they do on the remote file as they do on the local server. It will display any differences it finds.

       This utility is used by the Samba team to find differences in behaviour between Samba and Windows servers.

OPTIONS
       -U user%pass
           Specify the user and password to use when logging on on the shares. This parameter can be specified twice (once for the first server, once for the second).

       -s seed
           Seed the random number generator with the specified value.

       -n numops
           Set the number of operations to perform.

       -a
           Print the operations that are performed.

       -M max_protocol
           Maximum protocol to use.

       -f
           Specify characters that can be used when generating file names. Default: abcdefghijklm.

       -E
           Abort when difference in behaviour is found.

       -m maskchars
           Specify characters used for wildcards.

       -v
           Be verbose
