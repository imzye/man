NAME
       sbuild.conf - configuration file for sbuild

DESCRIPTION
       sbuild.conf  is a Perl script which is sourced by sbuild to permit configuration.  It is run in a sandbox and restricted to setting a small number of variables, detailed below, which may be set to
       configure the behaviour of sbuild.  Each variable has an internal name, shown in all caps, and a perl variable showing the default setting.  Note that the internal name is  not  accessible  within
       sbuild.conf;  only  the variable may be assigned.  Also note that some of the defaults are set to be unique for each build, and so some of the defaults shown here are unique to the user and system
       used to build sbuild, and will be different for your system.

       While sbuild permits many aspects of its behaviour to be configured, this should not normally be required.  The defaults should be adequate for most uses, and should only be changed if you are do‐
       ing something more advanced, or have specialist requirements.

CONFIGURATION
   Build environment
       PATH   STRING type.  PATH to set when running dpkg-buildpackage.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --use-snapshot

              Default:

              $path = '/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games';

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH
              STRING type.  Library search path to use inside the chroot.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --use-snapshot

              Default:

              $ld_library_path = undef;

   Build options
       DISTRIBUTION
              STRING type.  Default distribution.  By default, no distribution is defined, and the user must specify it with the -d option.  However, a default may be configured here if  desired.   Users
              must  take care not to upload to the wrong distribution when this option is set, for example experimental packages will be built for upload to unstable when this is not what is required. In
              unshare mode, this setting controls how the chroot tarball is created as rules like $unshare_mmdebstrap_extra_args and $unshare_mmdebstrap_distro_mangle use the value  of  the  distribution
              and not the chroot name.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              -d
              --dist

              Default:

              $distribution = undef;

       HOST_ARCH
              STRING type.  Host architecture (Arch we are building for)

              --arch-all
              --no-arch-all

              $build_arch_all = undef;

       BUILD_ARCH_ANY
              BOOL type.  Build architecture: any packages by default.

              Default:

              $build_arch_any = 1;

       BUILD_PROFILES
              STRING  type.   Build  profiles.  Separated by spaces. Defaults to the value of the DEB_BUILD_PROFILES environment variable when building natively and to the cross and nocheck profiles when
              cross-building.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --profiles

              Default:

              $build_profiles = undef;

       ENABLE_NETWORK
              STRING type.  By default network access is blocked during build (only implemented for the unshare mode). This lifts the restriction.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --enable-network

              Default:

              $enable_network = 0;

       BUILD_ENV_CMND
              STRING type.  This command is run with the dpkg-buildpackage command line passed to it (in the chroot, if doing a chrooted build).  It is used by the sparc buildd (which is sparc64) to call
              the wrapper script that sets the environment to sparc (32-bit).  It could be used for other build environment setup scripts.  Note that this is superseded by schroot's 'command-prefix'  op‐
              tion

              Default:

              $build_env_cmnd = '';

       PGP_OPTIONS

              Default:

              $pgp_options = [
                               '-us',
                               '-uc'
                             ];

       TOOLCHAIN_REGEX
              ARRAY:STRING  type.   Regular  expressions identifying toolchain packages.  Note that for backward compatibility, this is also settable using the array @toolchain_regex (deprecated), rather
              than an array reference.

              Default:

              $toolchain_regex = [
                                   'binutils$',
                                   'dpkg-dev$',
                                   'gcc-[\d.]+$',
                                   'g\+\+-[\d.]+$',
                                   'libstdc\+\+',
                                   'libc[\d.]+-dev$',
                                   'linux-kernel-headers$',
                                   'linux-libc-dev$',
                                   'gnumach-dev$',
                                   'hurd-dev$',
                                   'kfreebsd-kernel-headers$'
                                 ];

       CLEAN_APT_CACHE
              BOOL type.  Run apt-get distclean before the build to clean the apt package cache if the command is available. This makes sure that the build environment is not polluted by  extra  informa‐
              tion  but  means  that you need to run apt update before manually installing packages for debugging. You can disable this to save the extra call but remember to not use the information from
              the apt cache. Also note that this silently fails when the command is not available to be compatible with older releases.

              Default:

              $clean_apt_cache = 0;

       CHECK_SPACE
              BOOL type.  Check free disk space prior to starting a build.  sbuild requires the free space to be at least twice the size of the unpacked sources to allow a build to proceed.  Can be  dis‐
              abled to allow building if space is very limited, but the threshold to abort a build has been exceeded despite there being sufficient space for the build to complete.

              Default:

              $check_space = 1;

       BUILD_PATH
              STRING  type.   This  option allows one to specify a custom path where the package is built inside the chroot. The sbuild user in the chroot must have permissions to create the path. Common
              writable locations are subdirectories of /tmp or /build. Using /tmp might be dangerous, because (depending on the chroot backend) the /tmp inside the chroot might be a world writable  loca‐
              tion  that  can  be  accessed by processes outside the chroot. The directory /build can only be accessed by the sbuild user and group and should be a safe location. The buildpath must be an
              empty directory because the last component of the path will be removed after the build is finished. Notice that depending on the chroot backend (see CHROOT_MODE), some locations inside  the
              chroot  might  be  bind  mounts that are shared with other sbuild instances. You must avoid using these shared locations as the build path or otherwise concurrent runs of sbuild will likely
              fail. With the default schroot chroot backend, the directory /build is shared between multiple schroot sessions. You can change this behaviour in /etc/schroot/sbuild/fstab. The behaviour of
              other chroot backends will vary. To let sbuild choose a random build location of the format /build/packagename-XXXXXX/packagename-version/ where XXXXXX is a random ascii  string,  set  this
              variable to the empty string.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --build-path

              Default:

              $build_path = '/build/reproducible-path';

       DSC_DIR
              STRING  type.   By  default the package is built in a path of the following format /build/packagename-XXXXXX/packagename-version/ where packagename-version are replaced by the values in de‐
              bian/changelog. This option allows one to specify a custom packagename-version path where the package is built inside the chroot. This is useful to specify a static path for different  ver‐
              sions for example for ccache.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --dsc-dir

              Default:

              $dsc_dir = undef;

       FORCE_ORIG_SOURCE
              BOOL type.  By default, the -s option only includes the .orig.tar.gz when needed (i.e. when the Debian revision is 0 or 1).  By setting this option to 1, the .orig.tar.gz will always be in‐
              cluded when -s is used.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --force-orig-source

              Default:

              $force_orig_source = 0;

       BUILD_SOURCE
              BOOL  type.   By  default, do not build a source package (binary only build).  Set to 1 to force creation of a source package, but note that this is inappropriate for binary NMUs, where the
              option will always be disabled.

       BIN_NMU_TIMESTAMP
              STRING type.  Binary NMU timestamp. The timestamp is either given as n integer in Unix time or as a string in the format compatible with Debian changelog entries (i.e. as it is generated by
              date -R). If set to the default (undef) the date at build time is used.

              Default:

              $gcc_snapshot = 0;

       CLEAN_SOURCE
              BOOL type.  When running sbuild from within an unpacked source tree, run the 'clean' target before generating the source package. This might require some of the build dependencies necessary
              for running the 'clean' target to be installed on the host machine. Only disable if you start from a clean checkout and you know what you are doing.

   Build timeouts
       STALLED_PKG_TIMEOUT
              NUMERIC type.  Time (in minutes) of inactivity after which a build is terminated. Activity is measured by output to the log file.

              Default:

              $stalled_pkg_timeout = 150;

       MAX_LOCK_TRYS
              NUMERIC type.  Number of times to try waiting for a lock.

              Default:

              $max_lock_trys = 120;

       LOCK_INTERVAL
              NUMERIC type.  Lock wait interval (seconds).  Maximum wait time is (max_lock_trys x lock_interval).

              Default:

              $lock_interval = 5;

       INDIVIDUAL_STALLED_PKG_TIMEOUT
              HASH:NUMERIC type.  Some packages may exceed the general timeout (e.g. redirecting output to a file) and need a different timeout.  This has is a mapping between  source  package  name  and
              timeout.  Note that for backward compatibility, this is also settable using the hash %individual_stalled_pkg_timeout (deprecated) , rather than a hash reference.

              Example:

              $individual_stalled_pkg_timeout->{'llvm-toolchain-3.8'} = 300;
              $individual_stalled_pkg_timeout->{'kicad-packages3d'} = 90;

              $autopkgtest_opts = undef;

       AUTOPKGTEST_ROOT_ARGS
              ARRAY:STRING  type.   Preceding arguments to launch autopkgtest as root. With the default value (the empty array) "sudo --" will be used as a prefix unless sbuild is run in unshare mode. If
              the first element in the array is the empty string, no prefixing will be done. If the value is a scalar, it will be prefixed by that string. If the scalar is an empty string,  no  prefixing
              will be done.

              $autopkgtest_root_args = [''];
              $autopkgtest_root_args = ['', 'whatever'];

              Default:

              $autopkgtest_root_args = [];

       AUTOPKGTEST_REQUIRE_SUCCESS
              BOOL type.  Let sbuild fail if autopkgtest fails.

              Default:

              $autopkgtest_require_success = 0;

   Chroot options
       CHROOT STRING  type.   Default  chroot (defaults to distribution[-arch][-sbuild]). In unshare mode, this setting is used to decide the name of the tarball in ~/.cache/sbuild. This setting does not
              influence what options are used to create the chroot in unshare mode (unless as the very last fallback  for  $unshare_mmdebstrap_extra_args).  Use  the  distribution  name  (either  in  de‐
              bian/changelog or by using --dist) for that.

       PACKAGE_CHECKLIST
              STRING type.  Where to store list currently installed packages inside chroot

              Default:

              $package_checklist = '/var/lib/sbuild/package-checklist';

       PURGE_BUILD_DEPS
              STRING type.  When to purge the build dependencies after a build; possible values are "never", "successful", and "always"

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              -p

       PURGE_BUILD_DIRECTORY
              STRING type.  When to purge the build directory after a build; possible values are "never", "successful", and "always"

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              -p

              --purge-build

              Default:

              $purge_build_directory = 'always';

       PURGE_SESSION
              STRING  type.   Purge the schroot session following a build.  This is useful in conjunction with the --purge and --purge-deps options when using snapshot chroots, since by default the snap‐
              shot will be deleted. Possible values are "always" (default), "never", and "successful"

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              -p
              --purge

              Default:

              $purge_session = 'always';

       CHROOT_MODE
              STRING type.  Mechanism to use for chroot virtualisation.  Possible value are "schroot", "sudo", "autopkgtest" and "unshare" (default).

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --chroot-mode

              Default:

              $chroot_mode = undef;

       CHROOT_ALIASES
              HASH:STRING type.  A mapping of distribution names to their aliases which will be used to look up chroots. This is similar to the "aliases" schroot configuration option.  With  the  unshare
              backend,  this  has a similar effect as placing a symlink into ~/.cache/sbuild. Use the $unshare_mmdebstrap_distro_mangle option instead of this option if you want to declare a mapping from
              an "overlay" distribution (like experimental or backcports) to its base. This option is a hash because the order of its entries does not matter. Note, that if you are  using  unshare  mode,
              you might still need an entry in $unshare_mmdebstrap_distro_mangle in addition to an entry in this option because this option only influences the chroot lookup. The distribution name passed
              to mmdebstrap is not influenced by this option.

              Default:

              $chroot_aliases = {
                                  'UNRELEASED' => 'unstable',
                                  'rc-buggy' => 'experimental'
                                };

       CHROOT_SPLIT
              BOOL type.  Run in split mode?  In split mode, apt-get and dpkg are run on the host system, rather than inside the chroot.

              Default:

              $chroot_split = 0;

       CHROOT_SETUP_SCRIPT
              STRING type.  Script to run to perform custom setup tasks in the chroot.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --setup-hook

              Default:

              $chroot_setup_script = undef;

       APT_CLEAN
              BOOL type.  APT clean.  1 to enable running "apt-get clean" at the start of each build, or 0 to disable.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --apt-clean

              Default:

              $apt_clean = 0;

       APT_KEEP_DOWNLOADED_PACKAGES
              BOOL   type.   Keep  downloaded  packages  in  cache  by  APT.  Controls  APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages  option  used  when  downloading  dependencies.  This  option  only  makes  sense  if
              /var/cache/apt/archive inside the chroot is made persistent between multiple sbuild invocations. 1 to keep downloaded packages in cache, or 0 to delete them after installation.

              Default:

              $apt_keep_downloaded_packages = 0;

       APT_UPDATE
              BOOL type.  APT update.  1 to enable running "apt-get update" at the start of each build, or 0 to disable. This option only applies to the default repositories of the chroot:  the  internal
              sbuild apt repository, the repository for extra packages (see EXTRA_PACKAGES) and any repositories set via EXTRA_REPOSITORIES are always updated. It is not recommended to set this option to
              0  because  you  should build using the latest available packages in each distribution. If you do disable updates you need to ensure that the chroot contains downloaded package lists or apt
              will be unable to install any packages. If you are using the unshare chroot mode you can add "--skip=cleanup/apt/lists" to UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_EXTRA_ARGS to retain the package  lists  inside
              the chroot taball.

       APT_UPDATE_ARCHIVE_ONLY
              BOOL  type.   Update  local temporary APT archive directly (1, the default) or set to 0 to disable and do a full apt update (not recommended in case the mirror content has changed since the
              build started).

              Default:

              $apt_update_archive_only = 1;

       APT_UPGRADE
              BOOL type.  APT upgrade.  1 to enable running "apt-get upgrade" at the start of each build, or 0 to disable.

              Default:

              $apt_distupgrade = 1;

       APT_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED
              BOOL type.  Force APT to accept unauthenticated packages.  By default, unauthenticated packages are not allowed.  This is to keep the build environment secure, using apt-secure(8).  By set‐
              ting this to 1, APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated is set to "true" when running apt-get. This is disabled by default: only enable it if you know what you are doing.

              Default:

              $apt_allow_unauthenticated = 0;

       EXTERNAL_COMMANDS
              HASH:ARRAY:STRING type.  External commands to run at various stages of a build. Commands are held in a hash of arrays of arrays data structure. There is no equivalent  for  the  --anything-
              failed-commands command line option. All percent escapes mentioned in the sbuild man page can be used.

              --log-external-command-output

              Default:

       PURGE_EXTRA_PACKAGES
              BOOL  type.   Try to remove all additional packages that are not strictly required for the build right after build dependencies were installed. This currently works best with the aspcud re‐
              solver. The apt resolver will not make as much effort to remove all unneeded packages and will keep all providers of a virtual package and all packages from any dependency alternative  that
              happen  to  be  installed. The aptitude and xapt resolver do not implement this feature yet. The removed packages are not yet added again after the build finished. This can have undesirable
              side effects like lintian not working (because there is no apt to install its dependencies) or bare chroots becoming totally unusable after apt was removed  from  them.  Thus,  this  option
              should only be used with throw-away chroots like schroot provides them where the original state is automatically restored after each build.

              --purge-extra-packages

              Default:

   Chroot options (unshare)
       UNSHARE_TMPDIR_TEMPLATE
              STRING type.  Template used to create the temporary unpack directory for the unshare chroot mode. Uses $TMPDIR if set and /tmp otherwise. In unshare mode, all components of the path need to
              be accessible by the unshared user (world execute permissions). In unshare mode, the unshared user needs to have write permissions to this directory.

              Example:

              # Choose /var/tmp if /tmp is too small
              $unshare_tmpdir_template = '/var/tmp/tmp.sbuild.XXXXXXXXXX'

              Default:

              $unshare_tmpdir_template = '/tmp/tmp.sbuild.XXXXXXXXXX';

       UNSHARE_BIND_MOUNTS
              ARRAY type.  Bind mount directories from the outside to a mountpoint inside the chroot in unshare mode.

              Example:

              $unshare_bind_mounts = [ { directory => "/home/path/outside", mountpoint => "/path/inside" } ];

              Default:

              $unshare_bind_mounts = [];

       UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_AUTO_CREATE
              BOOL  type.   This is an experimental feature. In unshare mode, if the desired chroot tarball does not exist or if it is too old (see UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_MAX_AGE), run mmdebstrap to create a
              new chroot that will be used for the build. Refer to UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_EXTRA_ARGS to learn how to customize the mmdebstrap invocation for your chroots.

              Default:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_auto_create = 1;

       MMDEBSTRAP
              STRING type.  Path to mmdebstrap binary

              Default:

              $mmdebstrap = 'mmdebstrap';

       UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_KEEP_TARBALL
              BOOL type.  This is an experimental feature. In unshare mode and  only  if  UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_AUTO_CREATE  is  true,  write  the  created  tarball  back  to  its  appropriate  location  in
              ~/.cache/sbuild/${release}-${arch}.tar.  If  a chroot tarball was given explicitly by passing a path with the --chroot option, that chroot will never be updated by sbuild. But if the chroot
              tarball was outdated (see UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_MAX_AGE), it will still get re-created and used but not saved back to the given path.

              Default:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_keep_tarball = 0;

       UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_EXTRA_ARGS
              HASH:STRING type.  This is an experimental feature. In unshare mode, when mmdebstrap is run because UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_AUTO_CREATE was set to true, pass these extra arguments to the  mmdeb‐
              strap  invocation.  The  option  array is given as key/value pairs. Each key will be matched against strings created from sbuild configuration variables, namely: DISTRIBUTION, DISTRIBUTION-
              BUILD_ARCH, DISTRIBUTION-BUILD_ARCH-HOST_ARCH as well as against the name of the chroot itself (defined if you use --chroot). If a key matches one of these strings,  the  value,  containing
              extra  mmdebstrap  arguments is appended to the mmdebstrap argument list. A key can be a plain string, in which case glob-style expressions can be used. If the key is a plain string, it has
              to fully match. If the key is a plain string, percentage escapes %a and %r will be replaced by host architecture and distribution of the current build, respectively. A key  can  also  be  a
              precompiled  qr//  regular  expression but match groups cannot be referenced in the extra arguments. The value is an array of extra arguments which are appended to the end of the mmdebstrap
              exec array.

              Example:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_extra_args = [
                 "*-%a-arm64" => [ ... ] # options for cross-builds with arm64 as the host architecture
                 "debcargo-unstable-%a" => ["--include=dh-cargo,cargo"], # %a will be replaced by the host architecture
                 "ubuntu-*" => [ "--components=main,universe,multiverse" ], # add universe and multiverse for ubuntu
                 "/srv/custom-chroot.tar" => [ "--variant=apt", --arch="i386,ppc64el" ],
                 qr/(jessie|stretch)-amd64/ => [ ... ] # do something special for jessie and stretch
                 "{jessie,stretch}-amd64"   => [ ... ] # the same as above but with a glob instead of a regex
              ];

              Default:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_extra_args = [
                                                 '*-{backports}',
                                                 [
                                                   '--setup-hook=echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian %r main" > "$1"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/%r.list'
                                                 ],
                                                 qr/^(experimental|rc-buggy)$/,
                                                 [
                                                   '--setup-hook=echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian experimental main" > "$1"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/experimental.list'
                                                 ]
                                               ];

       UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_ENV_CMND
              ARRAY type.  This is an experimental feature. In unshare mode, when mmdebstrap is used to create the chroot environment, prefix that command with this option array.

              Example:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_env_cmnd = [ "env", "TMPDIR=/dev/shm/" ];

              Default:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_env_cmnd = [];

       UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_MAX_AGE
              NUMERIC type.  This is an experimental feature. In unshare mode, with UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_AUTO_CREATE=1, consider tarballs as outdated if they are older than the number of seconds  given  by
              this option. A negative value completely disables this check.

              Default:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_max_age = 604800;

       UNSHARE_MMDEBSTRAP_DISTRO_MANGLE
              ARRAY:STRING  type.   The  distribution  you want to build for might be an "overlay" for another distribution. For example if you build for stable-backports, you want to create a chroot for
              stable and then add backports or to build for experimental you want to build for unstable and then add experimental on top. This option allows one to perform this name mangling from distri‐
              bution name to desired base distribution. The option array is given as substitution pairs. The first regex which matches is applied and the remaining regexes are  skipped.  If  instead  you
              want  to  define an alias of one name to another like the "aliases" schroot configuration option or symlinks in unshare mode, use the $chroot_aliases option instead. This option is an array
              instead of a hash because the order of entries matters.

              Example:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_distro_mangle = [qr/(.*)-armhf$/ => '$1-arm64']

              Default:

              $unshare_mmdebstrap_distro_mangle = [
                                                    qr/^(experimental|rc-buggy|UNRELEASED.*)$/,
                                                    'unstable',
                                                    qr/^(.*)-backports$/,
                                                    '$1',
                                                    qr/^(.*)-security$/,
                                                    '$1'
                                                  ];

   Core options
       BUILD_USER
              STRING type.  Username used for running dpkg-buildpackage. By default the user running sbuild and `sbuild` for the unshare mode is used within the chroot as well  but  that  might  allow  a
              process from within the chroot to break out of the chroot by attaching to a process running outside the chroot with eg. gdb and then becoming root inside the chroot through schroot and thus
              be able to leave the chroot.

              build_user = ...;

       BUILD_DIR
              STRING type.  Output directory for build artifacts created by dpkg-buildpackage and the log file. Defaults to the current directory if unspecified. It is used as the location of chroot sym‐
              links (obsolete) and for current build log symlinks and some build logs.  There is no default; if unset, it defaults to the current working directory.  $HOME/build is another common config‐
              uration.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --build-dir

              Example:

              $build_dir = '/home/pete/build';

              build_dir = ...;

       SBUILD_MODE
              STRING  type.   sbuild  behaviour;  possible  values  are  "user"  (exit  status reports build failures) and "buildd" (exit status does not report build failures) for use in a buildd setup.
              "buildd" also currently implies enabling of "legacy features" such as chroot symlinks in the build directory and the creation of current symlinks in the build directory.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --sbuild-mode

              Default:

              $sbuild_mode = 'user';

       ENVIRONMENT_FILTER
              ARRAY:STRING type.  Only environment variables matching one of the regular expressions in this arrayref will be passed to dpkg-buildpackage and other programs run  by  sbuild.  The  default
              value for this configuration setting is the list of variable names as returned by Dpkg::BuildInfo::get_build_env_allowed() which is also the list of variable names that is whitelisted to be
              recorded  in  .buildinfo files. Caution: the default value listed below was retrieved from the dpkg Perl library version available when this man page was generated. It might be different if
              your dpkg Perl library version differs.

              Example:

              # Setting the old environment filter
              $environment_filter = ['^PATH$',
                             '^DEB(IAN|SIGN)?_[A-Z_]+$',

   Dependency resolution
       BUILD_DEP_RESOLVER
              STRING type.  Build dependency resolver.  The 'apt' resolver is currently the default, and recommended for most users.  This resolver uses apt-get to resolve dependencies.  Alternative  re‐
              solvers  are  'apt', 'aptitude' and 'aspcud'. The 'apt' resolver uses a built-in resolver module while the 'aptitude' resolver uses aptitude to resolve build dependencies.  The aptitude re‐
              solver is similar to apt, but is useful in more complex situations, such as where multiple distributions are required, for example when building from experimental, where packages are needed
              from both unstable and experimental, but defaulting to unstable. If the dependency situation is too complex for either apt or aptitude to solve it, you can use the 'aspcud'  resolver  which
              (in  contrast to apt and aptitude) is a real solver (in the math sense) and will thus always find a solution if a solution exists. Additionally, the 'null' solver is provided. It is a dummy
              resolver which does not install, upgrade or remove any packages. This allows one to completely control package installation via hooks.

              Related sbuild(1) command line options:

              --build-dep-resolver

              Default:

              $build_dep_resolver = 'apt';

       ASPCUD_CRITERIA
              STRING type.  Optimization criteria in extended MISC 2012 syntax passed to aspcud through apt-cudf.  Optimization criteria are separated by commas, sorted by decreasing  order  of  priority
              and  are  prefixed with a polarity (+ to maximize and - to minimize).  The default criteria is '-removed,-changed,-new' which first minimizes the number of removed packages, then the number
              of changed packages (up or downgrades) and then the number of new packages. A common task is to minimize the number of packages from experimental.  To do this you can add  a  criteria  like
              '-count(solution,APT-Release:=/a=experimental/)'  to  the  default criteria.  This will then minimize the number of packages in the solution which contain the string 'a=experimental' in the
              'APT-Release' field of the EDSP output created by apt. See the apt-cudf man page help on the --criteria option for more information.

       RESOLVE_ALTERNATIVES
              BOOL type.  Should the dependency resolver use alternatives in Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Depends-Indep?  By default, using 'apt' resolver, only the first alternative  will
              be  used;  all other alternatives will be removed.  When using the 'aptitude' resolver, it will default to using all alternatives.  Note that this does not include architecture-specific al‐
              ternatives, which are reduced to the build architecture prior to alternatives removal.  This should be left disabled when building for unstable; it may be useful when building  for  experi‐
              mental or backports.  Set to undef to use the default, 1 to enable, or 0 to disable.
