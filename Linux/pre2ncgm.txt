NAME
       pre2ncgm - convert a pre-CGM NCAR metafile to an NCAR CGM.

SYNOPSIS
       pre2ncgm [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       The  "pre2ncgm"  command reads a pre-CGM NCAR metafile from standard  input  and writes an NCAR CGM file to standard output.  When plotted, the output file should have virtually the same appearance as
       the input file.

OPTIONS
       -n     When this option appears, all text and header records which appear in the input file (created by PRSIM) are not copied to the output file.

EXAMPLES
       The command

           pre2ncgm < input-file > output-file

       causes  "input-file"  (which  should  be  a   pre-CGM   NCAR metafile)  to be read and the equivalent NCAR CGM file to be written to "output-file").

DIAGNOSTICS
       Various errors are detected by "pre2ncgm" and  are  written  to /dev/tty.

FILES
       /usr/local/bin/pre2ncgm.run
