       l mode user group destination source

       L mode user group destination source
            Specifies a symbolic link in the installation. The second form specifies that the link has changed or is new and should be included as part of a patch.

       R mode user group destination
            Specifies  that  the file is to be removed upon patching.  The user and group fields are ignored.  The mode field is only used to determine if a check should be made for a previous version of
            the file.

LIST VARIABLES
       EPM maintains a list of variables and their values which can be used to substitute values in the list file. These variables are imported from the current environment and taken  from  the  command-
       line and list file as provided.  Substitutions occur when the variable name is referenced with the dollar sign ($):

           %postinstall <<EOF
           echo What is your name:
           read $$name
           Your name is $$name
           EOF

           f 0555 root sys ${bindir}/foo foo
           f 0555 root sys $datadir/foo/foo.dat foo.dat

       Variable  names can be surrounded by curley brackets (${name}) or alone ($name); without brackets the name is terminated by the first slash (/), dash (-), or whitespace. The dollar sign can be in‐
       serted using $$.
