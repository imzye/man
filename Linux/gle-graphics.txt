NAME
       manip — manip

SYNOPSIS
       manip

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the manip command.

       This  manual  page  was  written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the PDF format at /usr/share/doc/gle-graph‐
       ics/gle-manual.pdf

       manip is a data manipulation package.  It reads in a text file of numbers and displays them like a spreadsheet.  You can then do simple operations on the columns and write them out in  any  format
       you like.

OPTIONS
       MANIP infile.dat -recover -step -commands c.log -single -size x y
