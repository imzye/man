DESCRIPTION
       This  utility  is  a helper/auxiliary for the ddpt utility which copies
       data between or within SCSI devices (logical units). While ddpt's  com‐
       mand  line  syntax  is  modelled  on that of the POSIX dd command, this
       utility has a more standard Unix command line syntax  with  both  short
       and long variants of each option.

       The T10 committee defines a family of SCSI commands for offloaded copy.
       The central (but not the only) command is EXTENDED COPY often shortened
       to  XCOPY  or  xcopy. There are now two generations of xcopy, the older
       one is given the suffix "LID1" and the newer one: "LID4".  There  is  a
       subset of XCOPY(LID4) that supports disk to disk copies and is based on
       the SBC-3 commands: POPULATE TOKEN (PT) and WRITE  USING  TOKEN  (WUT).
       ODX  is a market name that has become associated with this subset. This
       utility can issue PT, WUT and related commands, read  the  Third  Party
       Copy VPD page and perform several other housekeeping tasks.

       The  xcopy  family of commands are described in the SPC-4,5 and SBC-3,4
       documents found at https://www.t10.org .

       Apart from PT and WUT, other command abbreviations used below are  RRTI
       for  the  RECEIVE ROD TOKEN INFORMATION command and RCS for the RECEIVE
       COPY STATUS(LID4) command.

OPTIONS
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -A, --abort
              this option will issue the COPY OPERATION ABORT command with the
              LID  given in the --list_id=LID option. If the --list_id=LID op‐
              tion is not given then its default LID (257) is used.  If  there
              is  an xcopy operation ongoing on this I-T nexus (i.e. issued by
              this machine to any LU sharing the same target) using  that  LID
              then  the  copy  is  aborted.  Note  there  is a sense key (COPY
              ABORTED) indicating some but not all data has been copied due to
              this action.

       -a, --all_toks
              send the REPORT ALL ROD TOKENS SCSI command to DEVICE and decode
              the response. An ODX implementation is not required  to  support
              this command.

       -B, --block
              treat DEVICE as a block device when checking its --size. The de‐
              fault action of this utility  is  to  treat  DEVICE  as  a  SCSI
              pass-through device.

       -D, --del_tkn
              set the DEL_TKN bit in a WUT command (default: clear the DEL_TKN
              bit).  Since an ODX copy manager deletes the ROD Token when  its
              inactivity  time-out  is  reached,  this option is typically not
              needed. It may be useful for long-lived ROD Tokens that  are  no
              longer needed.
              To delete an unused ROD Token a degenerate scatter list seems to
              be acceptable (e.g. '--wut=0,0 --del_tkn').

       -f, --flexible
              this option currently only effects the parsing of sgl_s in files
              that are in hexadecimal plus they have a leading line with 'HEX'
              in them. Without this option any such line must be invoked  with
              'H@'  before the filename; in other words the 'H' in the invoca‐
              tion needs to match the HEX in the file. With this option a  sgl
              in  a  file  can  be  invoked with '@' and if a line with HEX is
              parsed before any LBA,NUM pairs then it switches to  hexadecimal
              mode; so all the parsed LBA,NUM pairs are assumed to be in hexa‐
              decimal.

       -h, --help
              outputs the usage message summarizing command line options  then
              exits.

       -I, --immed
              set  the  IMMED  bit in the PT or WUT command. When given the PT
              and WUT commands return promptly before  the  data  transfer  is
              complete;  then  this utility exits. The user should then invoke
              the utility again with the --poll option and the  same  LID  and
              DEVICE to await completion and receive the final transfer count.
              The default action of PT and WUT (i.e.  without this option)  is
              to  wait  for completion (i.e.  all data transferred or an error
              occurs) before exiting this utility.

       -i, --info
              when the DEVICE argument is given then  check  its  Third  Party
              Copy  VPD  page  and print out anything found. Also check if the
              3PC bit is set in the standard INQUIRY response.
              If the DEVICE argument is not given and the --rtf=RTF option  is
              given  then decode part of the ROD Token held in the --RTF file.
              SPC-4 defines some parts of a ROD Token that can be decoded  but
              does  not  require the copy manager to set these fields; so many
              fields may appear as zeros. A --RTF file that has been generated
              by  the  ddpt  utility may contain multiple ROD Tokens, each op‐
              tionally followed by an 8 byte "number of bytes represented" in‐
              teger.  They  are  all decoded, based on --RTF file length which
              should either be a multiple of 512 or 520 bytes.

       -l, --list_id=LID
              LID is a list identifier which is used to associate an originat‐
              ing xcopy command (e.g. PT or WUT) with a follow-up command that
              retrieves associated information or aborts  the  operation.  T10
              requires  each  active LID to be unique on a given I-T nexus. An
              I-T nexus is the current machine (more precisely a HBA if a  ma‐
              chine  has two or more) and a specific target which will contain
              one or more logical units (LUs) of which DEVICE is one.  If  the
              DEVICE's  copy  manager  feels that rather complex condition has
              not been met then an error is generated with sense data that de‐
              codes  to  "operation  in progress". Rather than try to work out
              who is doing what elsewhere, try another LID value.
              The default value for LID is 257.

       -O, --oir=OIR
              OIR is the Offset In ROD, a field in the WUT command. It may  be
              be  used together with the --wut=SL option. Its default value is
              0 and its units are the logical block size of DEVICE.

       -p, --poll
              send RRTI (or RCS) command to the DEVICE  using  the  LID  (i.e.
              from the --list_id=LID option). If a copy status is received in‐
              dicating the operation is ongoing, then  this  SCSI  command  is
              sent  periodically  (as  suggested by the previous RRTI (or RCS)
              command or every 500 milliseconds) until some other copy  status
              is detected. If the --list_id=LID option is not given then a LID
              of 257 is assumed.
              If the originating xcopy command was POPULATE TOKEN and the RRTI
              command  indicates  that  it has completed successfully then the
              associated ROD Token (returned in the RRTI response) is  written
              to  the  RTF file. If the --rtf=RTF option is not given then the
              ROD token is written to a file called ddptctl_rod_tok.bin in the
              current directory.

       -q, --prefer_rcs
              prefers  using  the  RECEIVE  COPY STATUS (RCS) command over the
              RRTI command which is the default. This only should be done fol‐
              lowing  a WUT command since after a PT command, the RRTI command
              is needed to fetch the ROD tokane.

       -P, --pt=GL
              send a POPULATE TOKEN (PT) command with the given  gather  list.
              The  format of GL is given in the NOTES section. If used without
              the --immed option then this utility, after the PT command  fin‐
              ishes  successfully,  will  call the RRTI command. When the RRTI
              command finishes, potentially with a new ROD Token, this utility
              will  exit.  Prior to that exit, if a new ROD Token is available
              and the --rtf=RTF option is given then that ROD Token is written
              to  the  RTF file. If the --rtf=RTF option is not given then the
              ROD token is written to a file called ddptctl_rod_tok.bin in the
              current directory.
              If  the --immed option is given this utility will exit after the
              PT command finishes. To  complete  the  operation  this  utility
              should  be invoked again with the --poll option and the same DE‐
              VICE.

       -y, --readonly
              open the DEVICE read-only (e.g. in Unix with the O_RDONLY flag).
              The default is to open it read-write.

       -R, --receive
              send  the RRTI (or RCS) SCSI command to the DEVICE using the LID
              (i.e. from the --list_id=LID option). If the  --list_id=LID  op‐
              tion is not given then a LID of 257 is assumed.
              If the originating xcopy command was POPULATE TOKEN and the RRTI
              command indicates that it has completed  successfully  then  the
              associated  ROD Token (returned in the RRTI response) is written
              to the RTF file. If the --rtf=RTF option is not given  then  the
              ROD token is written to a file called ddptctl_rod_tok.bin in the
              current directory.

       -r, --rtf=RTF
              when RTF is a file containing an ODX ROD Token or the name of  a
              file  the ROD Token is to be written to. A ROD Token used by ODX
              is 512 bytes long. If the RTF file  was  produced  by  the  ddpt
              utility  then it might contain multiple ROD Tokens, each option‐
              ally followed by an 8 byte integer  containing  the  "number  of
              bytes represented" by the preceding ROD Token.
              If an RTF file with multiple ROD Tokens is given to this utility
              with --wut=SL then only the first ROD Token is used. If  an  RTF
              file  is  being decoded (i.e. no DEVICE argument given) then all
              ROD Tokens are decoded.

       -t, --rtype=RTYPE
              where RTYPE is the ROD Type, a field in the  PT  command  (apart
              from "zero"). The default value (0) indicates that the copy man‐
              ager (in the DEVICE) decides. RTYPE can be a decimal  number,  a
              hex  number  (prefixed  by  0x or with a "h" appended) or one of
              "pit-def",  "pit-vuln",  "pit-pers",  "pit-cow",  "pit-any"   or
              "zero".   The  final  truncated  word  can  be  spelt  out (e.g.
              "pit-vulnerable").  The "pit-"  lead-in  stands  for  "point  in
              time" copy.
              The  "zero"  is a special case and is not given to a PT command.
              Instead it causes a special Block Device Zero Token to  be  cre‐
              ated  that  can be used with the --wut=SL option to write blocks
              of zeros to the given DEVICE.

       -s, --size
              prints the number of blocks and the size of each block  for  the
              given DEVICE. Protection information is printed if available. By
              default uses the pass-through interface and  the  READ  CAPACITY
              command  to  obtain  this  information. If the --block option is
              given then the block layer in the OS is query for size  informa‐
              tion (and protection information is not reported).

       -T, --timeout=ITO[,CMD]
              where  ITO  is  the inactivity timeout (units: seconds) given to
              the PT command. The default is 0 in which case the copy  manager
              uses  its own default which is shown in the Third party Copy VPD
              page.
              CMD is the SCSI command timeout (units: seconds) applied to SCSI
              commands  issued  by  this utility; default is 0 which is trans‐
              lated to 600 seconds for originating xcopy commands (e.g. PT and
              WUT) and 60 seconds for other commands. Best not to trigger com‐
              mand timeouts.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

       -w, --wut=SL
              send a WRITE USING TOKEN (WUT) command with  the  given  scatter
              list.  The  format of SL is given in the NOTES section. This op‐
              tion requires the --rtf=RTF option to supply the ROD  Token.  If
              used  without the --immed option then after the WUT command fin‐
              ishes successfully this utility will call the RRTI command. When
              the RRTI command finishes this utility will exit.
              If  the --immed option is given this utility will exit after the
              WUT command finishes. To complete  the  operation  this  utility
              should  be invoked again with the --poll option and the same DE‐
              VICE.

NOTES
       The scatter gather list given to the --pt=GL and  --wut=SL  options  in
       the  simplest case contains a pair a numbers, separated by a comma. The
       first number is the starting LBA and the second number is the number of
       blocks  (no bigger than 32 bits) to read to or write from that starting
       LBA. Another pair of numbers can appear after that forming  the  second
       element of a scatter gather list. Starting LBAs can be in any order but
       T10 prohibits any logical block appearing more than once in  a  scatter
       gather list.

       Scatter gather lists can be placed in a file or read from stdin. A file
       name referring to a file containing a scatter gather list  must  follow
       the  "@"  character (e.g. --pt=@my_sgl.txt"). Reading a list from stdin
       is indicated by "@-" or "-" (e.g. "--pt=-"). Scatter gather lists in  a
       file  have  a  looser  format and can take spaces and tabs as well as a
       comma as separators. Anything from and including a "#" on a line is ig‐
       nored.

       Both  the  PT  and WUT commands are issued "as is" without checking the
       Third Party Copy VPD page. The copy manager may well reject these  com‐
       mands  (with  exit  status  51: invalid field in parameter list) if the
       maximum range descriptors field or  the  maximum  token  transfer  size
       field are exceeded.

       There  is  a  web  page  discussing  ddptctl and ddpt, XCOPY and ODX at
       https://sg.danny.cz/sg/ddpt_xcopy_odx.html

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of ddptctl is 0 when it is  successful.  Otherwise  the
       exit status for this utility is the same as that for ddpt. See the EXIT
       STATUS section in the ddpt man page.

EXAMPLES
       First issue a PT command without the --immed option so RRTI  is  called
       to complete the operation:

         # ddptctl --pt=0x0,10k,20k,5k --rtf=aa.rt /dev/sdb
         PT completes with a transfer count of 15360 [0x3c00]

       The transfer count (10k + 5k == 15360) indicates the operation was suc‐
       cessful and the ROD Token is in the aa.rt file. Now use that ROD  Token
       to write to the same locations on /dev/sdc:

         # ddptctl --rtf=aa.rt --wut=0x0,10k,20k,5k /dev/sdc
         WUT completes with a transfer count of 15360 [0x3c00]

       So the copy was successful. Now taking a closer look at the ROD token:

         # ddptctl --info --rtf=aa.rt
         Decoding information from ROD Token:
           ROD type: point in time copy - default [0x800000]
           Copy manager ROD Token identifier: 0x520000710000000c
           Creator Logical Unit descriptor:
             Peripheral Device type: 0x0
             Relative initiator port identifier: 0x0
             designator_type: NAA,  code_set: Binary
             associated with the addressed logical unit
               0x60002ac0000000000000000c00009502
           Number of bytes represented: 0 [0x0]
           Device  type specific data (for disk) has block size of 0; unlikely
       so skip
           Target device descriptor: unexpected designator type [0x0]

       T10 does not require implementations to supply much of the above  (only
       the ROD type and the token length) so expect to see some empty fields.

       To see information about /dev/sdb relevant to ODX, try:

         # ddptctl --info /dev/sdb
           /dev/sdb  [readcap]:  num_blks=209715200 [0xc800000], blk_size=512,
       107 GB
         3PC (third party copy) bit set in standard INQUIRY response
          Third Party Copy VPD page:
          Block Device ROD Token Limits:
           Maximum Range Descriptors: 8
           Maximum Inactivity Timeout: 60 seconds
           Default Inactivity Timeout: 30 seconds
           Maximum Token Transfer Size: 524288
           Optimal Transfer Count: 524288

       That maximum token transfer size [524288 blocks each  512  bytes  gives
       256  MB]  is the largest size a ROD Token created by /dev/sdb can hold.
       Use that and show the --immed option on the destination:

         # ddptctl --pt=0x0,0x80000 --rtf=aa.rt /dev/sdb
         PT completes with a transfer count of 524288 [0x80000]

         # ddptctl --rtf=aa.rt --wut=0x0,0x80000 --immed /dev/sdc
         Started ODX Write Using Token command in immediate mode.
         User may need --list_id=257 on following invocation with --receive or
         --poll for completion

         # ddptctl --poll --rtf=aa.rt /dev/sdc
         RRTI for Write using token: Operation completed without errors
           transfer count of 524288 [0x80000]

       To copy larger amounts and/or with a larger number  of  scatter  gather
       elements  (than 8 "range descriptors") use one of the four ODX variants
       in the ddpt utility.
