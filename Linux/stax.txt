NAME
       stax - Stax is a collection of puzzle games.

SYNOPSIS
       stax

HOW TO PLAY
       The object of the games is basically to get rid of the blocks as fast as possible and not let them rise to the top. To get rid of blocks, get a horizontal or vertical line of 3 or more of the same
       type of blocks in a row. Usually, getting more than 3 in a row will make the other players blocks rise faster, so go for big combos!

       A few keys work the same in every game:

       Escape Quit        (prompted)

       P      Pause       (any key except P to unpause)

       Backspace
              Screenshot  (named stax????.pcx in current directory)

       The configuration of all other keys is described in the README file in
              the documentation directory of Stax (/usr/share/doc/stax/README.gz).
