NAME
       gman - GTK+ based front-end for man, a good replacment for xman.

SYNOPSIS
       gman

DESCRIPTION
       Gman  is  a  front-end  for the manual page system. gman builds a database of all the available man pages and displays them in a list. Clicking on an entry in the list makes gman launch another window
       with the manual page displayed in it.

       Gman can launch more than one window at same time. The user can use the index/key word search function to look for the man pages that they need.

       It is simple, but it is useful.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options for gman, for now.

DISPLAY OPTIONS
       Currently gman has 4 different modes to present the man pages, available as the following items in the View menu:

       xTerm  This will launch an X terminal emulator with the man output shown inside.

              You can add the following line to your ~/.gman file in order to select the preferred X terminal emulator:

                       xterm_command = rxvt

       GhostView
              gman will present man pages in a GhostView window for you to view and print the man page.

              This requires GhostView (command "gv") to be available on your system.

       Evince gman will present man pages in an Evince window for you to view and print the man page.

              This requires GNOME Evince (command "evince") to be available on your system.

       LocalBrowse
              gman will launch a web browser window to show you the man page.

              This requires man2html and web browser (command "sensible-browser") to be available on your system.

       NetBrowse
              In this mode, you can view the pages with web browser and navigate from one man page to another by clicking the links in the man pages.

              This requires man2html, web browser (command "sensible-browser") and a HTTP server running on localhost.

FILES
       ~/.gman
              Contains configuration information for gman, such as window size and paths where the manual pages are contained.  For example,

              v_size = 400
              h_size = 300
              xterm_command = rxvt
              show_warning = 0
              man_paths = /usr/local/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man

              For more information, see init_context() function in gman.c for all the options avialiable.

              ~/.gman is read by gman on startup, and written on exit.

       man(1), man(7), xterm(1).
