NAME
     4s-import — Import RDF into a 4store KB

SYNOPSIS
     4s-import kbname [-v] [-a] [-M default-model] [-m model] [-f format] [rdf-file] ...

               -v, --verbose
                       Increase verbosity (by default success is silent)

               -a, --add
                       Ordinarily importing RDF to a model replaces any previous contents of that model, by using the --add flag this behaviour is overridden and any triples which were previously in the
                       model are retained.

               -M, --model-default
                       Set a model (graph) URI which is used by default for all imported files

               -m, --model
                       Set a model (graph) URI for the next named file only (overrides -M if it has been used)

               -f, --format
                       Tell the RDF parser the format of the files (if not specified the parser will guess)

     Imports three files into a single graph named <http://example.com/menu>
