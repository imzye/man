NAME
       csdp-graphtoprob - Convert a graph description to SDPA sparse format

SYNOPSIS
       csdp-graphtoprob GRAPH_FILE PROBLEM_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The csdp-graphtoprob program converts a graph into SDPA sparse format.

FILE FORMAT
       The input file should be in the following format:
              n
              m
              i1 j1
              …
              im jm
       where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges, and each i/j pair describes one edge.

       The output file has the same graph written to it in SDPA sparse format.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is zero if the graph is converted successfully.  Otherwise, the exit status is one, and an error message indicating the problem is produced on standard out.
