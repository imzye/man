NAME
       botch-extract-scc - extract all strongly connected components

SYNOPSIS
       botch-extract-scc [options] graph.xml [prefix]

DESCRIPTION
       Extract strongly connected components (SCC) from an input graph in GraphML or dot format.

       The strongly connected components are stored as one file each in either the current directory or the directory given by the --outdir option.

       The file names that were generated for them are printed on standard output.

       By default that filename is of the format PREFIX_VERTEX_SIZE.EXT where PREFIX can be set on the command line, while VERTEX defaults to the vertex ID chosen by network, SIZE is the size of the SCC and
       EXT is xml by default but can be set using the --extension option. This is to reduce the possibility that two output graph files happen to have the same name. You can make them more unique by using
       the --outfnamevert and --outfnameattr options which refine the string that will be printed for VERTEX.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Show help.

       --outdir=DIR
           output directory. Default is current directory

       --outfnamevert=VERT
           This option picks the set of vertices from which the smallest one (by string comparison of the attribute determined by the --outfnameattr option) will be chosen to be stored in place of VERTEX in
           the output file name.  The VERT argument is a key/value pair (separated by a colon) of a graph attribute and its value. By default (without this option), all vertices of the graph are considered.

           The special key "__ID__" allows one to select the unique vertex identifier.

           This option can be specified more than once. The final set of vertices is chosen such that all vertices match all key/value pairs. Multiple --outfnamevert options thus form a logical conjunction
           (they are AND-ed together).

       --outfnameattr=attribute
           This option picks the vertex attribute that is to be printed in VERTEX in the output file name.

       --extension=EXT
           Output files have extension EXT. Default is xml. This option also governs the output format. The xml extension saves in GraphML format while the dot extension saves in the dot format.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

EXAMPLE
       Extract the strongly connected components of a buildgraph and store them in the directory "out", prefixing each filename with "cyclic" and let the VERTEX value be the cudfname field of source packages
       only.

        botch-extract-scc --verbose --outdir=out --outfnameattr=cudfname --outfnamevert type:src buildgraph.xml cyclic
