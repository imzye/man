DETAILS
       The  'repo  sync'  command synchronizes local project directories with the remote repositories specified in the manifest. If a local project does not yet exist, it will clone a new local directory
       from the remote repository and set up tracking branches as specified in the manifest. If the local project already exists, 'repo sync' will update the remote branches  and  rebase  any  new  local
       changes on top of the new remote changes.

       'repo  sync'  will synchronize all projects listed at the command line. Projects can be specified either by name, or by a relative or absolute path to the project's local directory. If no projects
       are specified, 'repo sync' will synchronize all projects listed in the manifest.

       The -d/--detach option can be used to switch specified projects back to the manifest revision. This option is especially helpful if the project is currently on a topic branch, but the manifest re‐
       vision is temporarily needed.

       The -s/--smart-sync option can be used to sync to a known good build as specified by the manifest-server element in the current manifest. The -t/--smart-tag option is similar  and  allows  you  to
       specify a custom tag/label.

       The -u/--manifest-server-username and -p/--manifest-server-password options can be used to specify a username and password to authenticate with the manifest server when using the -s or -t option.

       If -u and -p are not specified when using the -s or -t option, 'repo sync' will attempt to read authentication credentials for the manifest server from the user's .netrc file.

       'repo sync' will not use authentication credentials from -u/-p or .netrc if the manifest server specified in the manifest file already includes credentials.

       By default, all projects will be synced. The --fail-fast option can be used to halt syncing as soon as possible when the first project fails to sync.

       The  --force-sync  option  can be used to overwrite existing git directories if they have previously been linked to a different object directory. WARNING: This may cause data to be lost since refs
       may be removed when overwriting.

       The --force-checkout option can be used to force git to switch revs even if the index or the working tree differs from HEAD, and if there are untracked files.  WARNING: This may cause data  to  be
       lost since uncommitted changes may be removed.

       The  --force-remove-dirty  option  can  be  used  to remove previously used projects with uncommitted changes. WARNING: This may cause data to be lost since uncommitted changes may be removed with
       projects that no longer exist in the manifest.

       The --no-clone-bundle option disables any attempt to use $URL/clone.bundle to bootstrap a new Git repository from a resumeable bundle file on a content delivery network. This may be  necessary  if
       there are problems with the local Python HTTP client or proxy configuration, but the Git binary works.

       The --fetch-submodules option enables fetching Git submodules of a project from server.

       The -c/--current-branch option can be used to only fetch objects that are on the branch specified by a project's revision.

       The --optimized-fetch option can be used to only fetch projects that are fixed to a sha1 revision if the sha1 revision does not already exist locally.

       The --prune option can be used to remove any refs that no longer exist on the remote.

       The --auto-gc option can be used to trigger garbage collection on all projects.  By default, repo does not run garbage collection.

       SSH Connections

       If  at  least one project remote URL uses an SSH connection (ssh://, git+ssh://, or user@host:path syntax) repo will automatically enable the SSH ControlMaster option when connecting to that host.
       This feature permits other projects in the same 'repo sync' session to reuse the same SSH tunnel, saving connection setup overheads.

       To disable this behavior on UNIX platforms, set the GIT_SSH environment variable to 'ssh'. For example:

              export GIT_SSH=ssh repo sync

       Compatibility

       This feature is automatically disabled on Windows, due to the lack of UNIX domain socket support.

       This feature is not compatible with url.insteadof rewrites in the user's ~/.gitconfig. 'repo sync' is currently not able to perform the rewrite early enough to establish the ControlMaster tunnel.

       If the remote SSH daemon is Gerrit Code Review, version 2.0.10 or later is required to fix a server side protocol bug.
