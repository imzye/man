       vltest read [-int] name
       vltest rdup [-int] [-cz|-cy|-cx] [-cc] [-tune lrecmax nidxmax lcnum ncnum] [-fbp num] name rnum pnum

       vltest wicked [-c] [-cz|-cy|-cx] name rnum

DESCRIPTION
       The  command `vltest' is a utility for facility test and performance test.  Check a database generated by the command or measure the execution time of the command.  This command is used in the follow‐
       ing format. `name' specifies a database name.  `rnum' specifies the number of the records.

       vltest write [-int] [-cz|-cy|-cx] [-tune lrecmax nidxmax lcnum ncnum] [-fbp num] name rnum
              Store records with keys of 8 bytes. They change as `00000001', `00000002'...

       vltest read [-int] [-vc] name
              Retrieve all records of the database above.

       vltest rdup [-int] [-cz|-cy|-cx] [-cc] [-tune lrecmax nidxmax lcnum ncnum] [-fbp num] name rnum pnum
              Store records with partway duplicated keys using duplicate mode.

       vltest combo [-cz|-cy|-cx] name
              Perform combination test of various operations.

       vltest wicked [-c] [-cz|-cy|-cx] name rnum
              Perform updating operations selected at random.

       Options feature the following.

              -int : treat keys and values as objects of `int', and use comparing function `VL_CMPINT'.
              -cz : compress leaves in the database with ZLIB.
              -cy : compress leaves in the database with LZO.
              -cx : compress leaves in the database with BZIP2.
              -vc : refer to volatile cache.
              -cc : select `VL_DCAT' or `VL_DDUP' at random.
              -tune lrecmax nidxmax lcnum ncnum : set tuning parameters.
              -fbp num : set the size of the free block pool.
              -c : perform comparison test with map of Cabin.

       This command returns 0 on success, another on failure.  The environment variable `QDBMDBGFD' specifies the file descriptor to output the history of updating the variable `dpecode'.
