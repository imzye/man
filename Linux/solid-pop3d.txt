dot-spop3d(5)                                                                                  User's Manual                                                                                  dot-spop3d(5)

NAME
       dot-spop3d - user configuration data for The Solid POP3 Server.

DESCRIPTION
       A user can specify their maildrop location, type and associated APOP secret in the configuration file ~/.spop3d.

       The file must be set to mode 0600 (-rw-------) or the server will not honour its content.

       Maildrop specification consists of three parts, separated by white space characters:

       MailDrop path type

       Path should be specified in the same format as the -n option in solid-pop3d(8).  Type should be mailbox or maildir.

       APOP secret specification consists of the word APOPSecret followed by an encrypted secret. You shouldn't change this secret manually. Use pop_auth(1) to do this.

       Both  maildrop  and  APOP secret specifications may optionally be followed by a mailbox name. This allows, for instance, user+boxA and user+boxB to be used as login names to access different mail‐
       boxes, where + means value of UserMailDropDelimiter server setting (see spop3d.conf(5)).

       The APOP secret associated with a particular maildrop should be followed with the same mailbox name (or lack thereof). If no secret is specified for a maildrop then the user's standard  POP  pass‐
       word should be used to authenticate instead.

EXAMPLE
              MailDrop       Mail/default   mailbox
              APOPSecret     2345678901
              MailDrop       Mail/bugtraq   mailbox bugtraq
              APOPSecret     0123456789     bugtraq
              MailDrop       Mail/private   mailbox private
              APOPSecret     9876543210     private

       To set the APOP secret for the above maildrops use the following pop_auth(1) commands:
              pop_auth
              pop_auth bugtraq
              pop_auth private

FILES
       ~/.spop3d
              User configuration file.
