NAME
       claws-mail-mailmbox-plugin - handle mbox format mailboxes

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-mailmbox-plugin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-mailmbox-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       Provides the ability of handling mbox format files (used by some other popular mailers) as if they were native mailer's folders. Just add them and play.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...” dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named mailmbox.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

       Mailboxes can be added in the “File” menu, opening the “Add mailbox” item and selecting the “mbox (etPan!)...” option.

SEE ALSO
       claws-mail(1), mbox(5), claws-mail-extra-plugins(7).
