NAME
       corosync-quorumtool - Set and display quorum settings.

SYNOPSIS
       corosync-quorumtool [-s] [-m] [-l] [-p] [-v votes] [-n nodeid] [-e expected] [-H] [-i] [-o <a|n|i>] [-a] [-f] [-h] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       Display the current state of quorum in the cluster and set vote quorum options.

OPTIONS
       -s     show quorum status

       -m     constantly monitor quorum status

       -l     list nodes

       -p     when used with -s or -l, generates machine parsable output

       -v <votes>
              change the number of votes for a node *

       -n <nodeid>
              optional nodeid of node for -v

       -e <expected>
              change expected votes for the cluster *

       -H     show nodeids in hexadecimal rather than decimal

       -i     show node IP addresses instead of the resolved name

       -p     when used with -s or -l, generates machine parsable output

       -o <a|n|i>
              Orders  the  output  of the nodes list. By default or with -oa nodes are listed in IP address order: as they come from corosync. -on will order the nodes based on their name, and -oi will order
              them based on their node ID.

       -a     Show the name or IP address (see -i above) of all interfaces in use on the nodes, rather than just the first one.

       -f     forcefully unregister a quorum device *DANGEROUS* *

       -h (if no other argument)
              show this help text

       -V     show version and exit

       * Starred items only work if votequorum is the quorum provider for corosync

EXIT STATUS
       corosync-quorumtool may return one of several error codes if it encounters problems.

       0      No problems occurred (quorate for -s operation).

       1      Generic error code.

       2      Not quorate (returned only for -s operation).
