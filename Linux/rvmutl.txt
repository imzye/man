NAME
       rvmutl - maintenance utility for RVM log

SYNOPSIS
       rvmutl log

       rvmutl

DESCRIPTION
       The program rvmutl is the maintenance utility for RVM log.  Its priniciple features are log creation and maintenance, but there are also status and statistic display commands, as well as printing com‐
       mands for log records.  There is also a search facility for modifications to segments.  You may find rvmutl a great debugging tools.

       The are two ways to use rvmutl: You may supply the name of the RVM log on the command line, or you do not supply the name on command line but specify the log within rvmutl (see below).

       rvmutl prompts for commands with a * (asterisk) prompt.  Most commands have one or more parameters, which are separated by one or more spaces.  Some commands have abbreviations, these will  be  speci‐
       fied in the command section.

       For example, to examine the status of a RVM log (called logfile in the example), you can do

       > rvmutl
       * open_log logfile
       * status

       Status of log:           /home/clement/linuxobj8/rvm-src/tests/logfile

         log created on:        Tue Nov  4 1997 17:31:10.244793
         log created with:      RVM Interface Version 1.3  7 Mar 1994
         (more display omitted ...)
       * quit

       As another example, suppose you want to create a RVM log device on the partition /dev/hdc7, of size 1 Megabyte, you can do

       > rvmutl
       * i /dev/hdc7 1M
       * quit

       Note that in the preceding example, we use the abbreviation "i" for the command "init_log", and we can use the unit "M" to stand for Megabyte.

I/O REDIRECTION
       You can redirect input and output as in typical Unix shells.  For example, the following command will have all display redirected to the file allrec:

       * show all > allrec
       *

COMMANDS
       In the following, I will detail all the available commands:

       all_spec
              Show all special log records.  Special log records are those non-transaction records, such as wrap-around marker and segment dictionary entry.

       build_seg_dict [all] [clear]

       seg_dict [all] [clear]

              Build the segment dictionary by scanning through the log.  Segment dictionary is a in-memory structure that maps segment code to segment file.  Segment code is used in each transaction range as
              a short hand of the segment file involved. If the all option is specified, the whole log will be scanned, otherwise the scanning will stop when one segment dictionary entry is  found.   If  the
              clear option is specified, the segment dictionary will be cleared before starting the scanning process.

       close_log
              Close the log file.

       copy_log
              This  provide  a  handy  way to copy an existing log to another file or partition.  Since rvm logs start on different offset, depending on whether they are files or partitions, using stock Unix
              commands such as cp or dd sometimes is not as nice as using this command.  Some meta data (such as name of log) in the log status area in the destination log will also be updated to reflect new
              meta data after log copying.

       earliest
              Show the earliest transaction record in the log.

       init_log [log [length]]
              Initialize a log if it does not exist, or re-initialize it if it does exist.  The log will have the name log and the length of data area will be length.  The actual size of the log file or par‐
              tition will be slightly bigger because: 1.  there is a log status area (of size 3 sectors); and 2.  for log used on raw partition, there will be an offset (of 16 sectors) to jump  off  possible
              disklabel of the partition.

              The  length  parameter is specified as an integer, optionally followed by a single character size code.  The following size codes are defined: K or k for kilobytes, M or m for megabytes, S or s
              for sectors (512 bytes), P or p for pages (which have system dependent sizes) and B or b for bytes (default).

              If either parameter is not specified, init_log will prompt for the missing information.

              RVM maintains the log continuously after creation.  If you are going to re-initialize an existing log, make sure the log is  empty  before  the  re-initialization,  otherwise,  the  transaction
              records  in the log would be lost (i.e., they would not be applied to the data segment).  You can apply all transaction records to the data segments and empty the log (also known as truncate in
              this manual) by the recover command.  You can use the command status to check whether a log is empty.

       find_earliest
              Print the offset of the earliest transaction record in the log.

       find_tail
              Print the offset of the tail of the log.

       head   Print the transaction record at the head of log.  (Note that there could be even earlier than the head record -- smaller record number and smaller time stamp.   They  are  considered  truncated
              from the log and can be overwritten upon them freely.  They are still on the log just because it happens that rvm has not yet overwritten on them, and they may be useful for debugging. The com‐
              mand earliest prints the earliest record.)

       log [log] [no_tail] [no_update │ update]

       open_log [log] [no_tail] [no_update │ update]
              Open the rvm log named log.  You must open a log before you can use most of the rest commands.  The optional no_tail switch turns of the search of tail of the log (for  example,  when  the  log
              tail is corrupted).  The optional no_update and update switch controls whether update will be made on the log and segment (they turn on the rvm internal global variable rvm_no_update).

       n [num]

       next [num]
              Print the next num records.  If the optional argument num is not specified, then the next one record will be printed.

       ns [num]

       next_sub_rec [num]
              Print the next num sub-records.  Sub-records are the individual ranges of a transaction.  If the optional argument num is not specified, then the next one sub-record will be printed.

       p

       peek [file] offset / [csf]
              Peek  on (or dump) the content of file.  You must specify the argument file when you first peek or poke on a file, afterward you can omit the argument and rvmutl will continue using the current
              file.  The argument offset determines from where the dump should start.  The argument csf determines how the dump should be done, it comprises of three components: c, s and f; each of them rep‐
              resents  the  count,  size, and format respectively. c is an integer and determines how many units, with size specified by s, should be dumped, and f specifies what is the dump format."  In the
              following two examples, the first command dumps, from offset 0, eight bytes in hexadecimal format; the second command dumps two long integers in decimal format.  Note that  how  the  same  file
              content can be dumped into different format.

              * peek 0 / 8xb
              00000000000: 0x18 0000 0000 0000 0x23 0x17 0x14 0x63
              * peek 0 / 2dl
              00000000000:           24   1662261027

              There  are seven different possible sizes: b for byte, l for long, s for short, O for offset (two long integers representing the high and low order bits respectively), f for float, D for double
              and t for time value.

              There are nine different possible formats: c for character, d for decimal, o for octal, x for hexidecimal, u for unsigned, f for float, D for double, O for offset (two long integers  represent‐
              ing the high and low order bits respectively) and t for time value.

              You may omit the arguments c, s and f, and rvmutl will use the defaults, which are 1, d (decimal) and l (long) respectively, for the three arguments respectively.

       poke [file] offset / cs = val [val ... ]
              Poke  on  (modify) the content of file.  You must specify the argument file when you first peek or poke on a file, afterward you can omit the argument and rvmutl will continue using the current
              file.  The argument offset determines from where the modification should start.  The argument cs determines how the modifications should be done, it comprises of two components: c and  s;  each
              of them represents the count and size respectively.  c is an integer and determines how many units, as specified by s, should be modified.

              Examples:

              * poke 512 / 4db = 25
              * peek 512 / 8db
                     512:  25  25  25  25   0   0   0   0

              * poke 512 / 2xl = 25
              * peek 512 / 8db
                     512:  25   0   0   0  25   0   0   0

              * poke 512 / 2b = 0x26 0x27
              * peek 512 / 8db
                     512:  38  39  38  39  25   0   0   0

              * poke 512 / b = "abcde"
              * peek 512 / 8db
                     512:  97  98  99 100 101   0   0   0

              Note  that in the second example, the character x, which indicates hexidecimal format in peek, is sliently ignored.  To enter a hexidecimal number, you should us prefix '0x' as in the third ex‐
              ample.   Note also that how a pattern is repeated by using the argument c in first and third example.

              There are seven different possible sizes: b for byte, l for long, s for short, O for offset (two long integers representing the high and low order bits respectively), f for float, D for  double
              and t for time value.

              You can also enter string by using the double-quote mark (”), as in the last example.

       pr [num]

       prev [num]
              Print the previous num records.  If the optional argumentnum is not specified, then the previous one record will be printed.

       ps [num]

       prev_sub_rec [num]
              Print the previous num sub-records.  Sub-records are the individual ranges of a transaction.  If the optional argument num is not specified, then the previous one sub-record will be printed.

       quit   Quit rvmutl.

       read_status
              Re-read  the  log  status from on-disk log device (file or partition) to in-memory structure (status).  Note that the command status show the content of the in-memory structure, but not the on-
              disk device.   If you have made changes to the on-disk device, you may want to re-read them into the memory.

       monitor [clear] [no_update │ update]
              You can specify memory ranges to be monitored by this command.  When a memory range is monitored, there will be message printed out whenever there are modification within the range (E.g. in re‐
              cover).  The switch clear will clear all the monitor previous set.  The switch no_update and update carry the usual meaning (c.f. open_log).  You will be asked, interactively, for the addresses
              and formats for the ranges you want to monitor, you should use the syntax similar to poke.  The following example shows how to use monitor, show monitor, as well as how recover prints  out  the
              modification.

              * open_log log3
              * monitor update
                More ranges (y or n [n])? y

                Enter list of addresses/format, terminate with null line
              :  0x200d7550/1l
              :
              * show monitor

              Range    Address/format     Length
                 1    0x200d7550/1dl          4

              * recover
              do_nv: data from log record 2101, range 52
                monitored range 1, 0x200d7550, length 4 matched by
                modified range 0x200d7550, length 4
                0x200d7550:    537286660

              change_tree_insert: inserting entire range
                monitored range 1, 0x200d7550, length 4 matched by
                modified range 0x200d7550, length 4
                0x200d7550:    537286660

              do_nv: data from log record 2101, range 51
                monitored range 1, 0x200d7550, length 4 matched by
                modified range 0x200ced40, length 8367
                0x200d7550:            0

              change_tree_insert: inserting entire range
                monitored range 1, 0x200d7550, length 4 matched by
                modified range 0x200ced40, length 8367
                0x200d7550:            0

              do_nv: data from log record 2101, range 50
                monitored range 1, 0x200d7550, length 4 matched by
                modified range 0x200cdcc4, length 16
                0x200d7550:            0

              change_tree_insert: inserting entire range
                monitored range 1, 0x200d7550, length 4 matched by
                modified range 0x200cdcc4, length 16

       recover [clear] [file] [no_update │ update]
              Truncate the log.  Truncation means applying the transaction records, that were logged on the log, to the data segment, and then reclaiming the space on the log used by those records.

       set [seg_dict] field │ addr = val
              Set  field  (or  memeory  locateion  at addr) to val.  There are five fields that you can set: head, tail, prev_head, prev_tail and log_start.  (You can use prev head and prev tail to represent
              prev_head and prev_tail respectively.)  Only the in-memory structure of the field is changed by this command, you can use write_status to write the in-memory structure (status area) to disk.

       status

       log_status
              Show the log status area, which is the meta data about the log (include head offset, tail offset, space used by records, total log size, first record number, last record  number,  log  creation
              time, last truncation time etc).

       sr

       sub_rec
              Show the current subrecord.

       statistics
              Show the statistics of rvm activities.

       tail   Show the transaction record at the tail of log.

       update Turn on update (i.e. set to false the rvm-internal global variable rvm_no_update.) Update will not be made on the log and segment.

       no_update
              Turn off update (i.e. set to true the rvm-internal global variable rvm_no_update.)  Update will be made on the log and segment.

       write_status
              Write out the in-memory log status structure to the log status block on disk.

BUGS
       The command find_hole is not yet documented.

       Peeking using the format or size of time value (t) does not work.

       The way to poke an offset value is not yet documented.

       sizeof of some structs (e.g. condition, int) wrongly displays the page size rather than the size of the structure.

       The use of no_update does not quite work.  Rvmutl easily crashes when the switch is used.

       The exact semantic of replay command is not documented, and the command itself crashes quite easily.

       The use of seg_dict in set is not yet documented.

       The command show timestamp has no effect.
