DESCRIPTION
       iptotal  reads  configuration  data from /etc/iptotal.cfg (or the file specified with -c on the command line).  The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.  Lines starting with '#' and

       The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that keywords are case-insensitive and arguments are case-sensitive):

       debug <level>

              Interface iptotal is to monitor. The default is eth0.

       filter <filterstr>
              Use pcap filters (see tcpdump).

       fork <choice>
              "no" to run in foreground, "yes" in background. The default is "no".

       maskbits <maskbits>
              Set number of network mask bits (1-32) for subnet traffic aggregation.  Default is 24 (255.255.255.0).

       report <seconds>
              Reporting period - number of seconds, default 300.
