DESCRIPTION
       The rn2ncid gateway obtains Caller ID and messages from a cell phone.  It uses an Android app called Remote Notifier for Android to obtain the information and send it to the NCID server.  The server
       then sends the CID information to the NCID clients.

       The Remote Notifier for Android app uses a 16 digit hex number to identify the smart phone.  The rn2ncid gateway uses 4 of the least significant digits as the phone id.  Therefore you can run the app
       in multiple smart phones without needing to configure them.

       The phone id can be aliased by the NCID server so you can give each phone a meaningful identification such a CELL, or SP-1, or wharever.

       The rn2ncid configuration file is /etc/ncid/rn2ncid.conf.  See the rn2ncid.conf man page for more details.  If you are also using ncid-page or ncid-notify you need to configure the reject variable.

       The rn2ncid gateway can run on any computer, but normally it is run on the same box as the NCID server.  If it is not run on the same box as the NCID server, you must configure the server IP address
       in the configuration file.

REQUIREMENTS
       The NCID server
           http://ncid.sourceforge.net/ncid/ncid.html

       The "Remote Notifier for Android" app on your Android device
           https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/org.damazio.notifier

       perl 5.6 or higher, perl(Config::Simple)

OPTIONS
       -n <[host][:port]>, --ncidhost <[host][:port]>
         Specifies the NCID server.  Port may be specified by suffixing the hostname with :<port>.

         Input must be <host> or <host:port>, or <:port>

         Default:  localhost:3333

       -c <port>, --cellport <port>
         Specifies the port to listen on for messages from a smart phone.

         Default 10600

       -d <seconds>, --delay <seconds>
         If the connection to the NCID server is lost, try every <delay> seconds to reconnect.

         Default: 15

       -D, --debug
         Debug mode, displays all messages that go into the log file.  Use this option to run interactively.

       -H <0|1>, --hostname-flag <0|1>
         When the hostname flag is set to 1, the IDENT string sent to a server will include the hostname with the program name.

         Default: 0

       -h, --help
         Displays the help message and exits.

       -m, --man
         Displays the manual page and exits.

       -C, --configfile <filename>
         Specifies the configuration file to use.  The program will still run if a configuration file is not found.

         Default: /etc/ncid/rn2ncid.conf

       -l, --logfile-append <filename>
       -L, --logfile-overwrite <filename>
         Specifies the logfile name to write.  The program will still run if it does not have permission to write to it.

         If both options are present, --logfile-append takes precedence.

         Default: Append to /var/log/rn2ncid.log

       -p, --pidfile <filename>
         Specifies the pidfile name to write. The program will still run if it does not have permission to write a pidfile. The pid filename that should be used is /var/run/rc2ncid.pid.

         Default: no pidfile

       -t, --test
         Test mode is a connection to the Whozz Calling Network Device without a connection to the NCID server.  It sets debug mode and verbose = 3.  The verbose level can be changed on the command line.

         Default: no test mode

       -v, --verbose <1-9>
         Output information, used for the logfile and the debug option.  Set the level to a higher number for more information.  Levels range from 1 to 9, but not all levels are used.

         Default: verbose = 1

       -V, --version
         Displays the version.

EXAMPLES
       Start rn2ncid in test mode at verbose level 3
           rn2ncid --test

       Start rn2ncid in debug mode at verbose level 1
           rn2ncid -D
