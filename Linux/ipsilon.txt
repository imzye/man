NAME
       ipsilon

DESCRIPTION
       Ipsilon  is  an  Identity Provider (IdP) that implements standard Authentication and Federation protocols like SAML, and integrates with Enterprise Authentication systems to provide easy to use Single
       Sign On capabilities to Web Applications and Services.

       An IdP server allows users to authenticate against any identity backend, whether that is a corporate LDAP server or even just local files, and allows applications to authenticate users without  having
       to worry about the sort of authentication infrastructure is being used.

       Ipsilon supports applications to authenticate users via either the SAML2, OpenID or OpenID Connect/OAuth2 protocols, and more protocols can be added with plugins.
