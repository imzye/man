NAME
       changetrack - track changes to files

SYNOPSIS
       changetrack [-h] [-c configfile] [-d directory] [-e] [-r] [-q] [-m message] [-M message] [-v] [-u] [-o toaddress] [-f fromaddress]

DESCRIPTION
       changetrack  is  a program to monitor changes to a bunch of files. If files are modified one day, and the machine starts working incorrectly some days later, changetrack can provide information on
       which files were modified, and help locate the problem.

       Normally changetrack uses ed to keep track of various revisions of the files by maintaining an .ed script with the change history for each file.

       Alternatively, changetrack can use rcs to keep track of various revisions of the files. Each file is "installed" in the rcs system the first time that changetrack is run after that file  is  added
       to the config file. Whenever changetrack is run after that, a copy of the file is made, which is 'checked in' and implicitly 'checked out' of the rcs system. See the man page of co for information
       on retrieving an old version of the file.

       Backup files (ending in tilde ~) are ignored, unless explicitly included.

       After  each pattern in the file list, adding white space, a colon (:) then more whitespace, followed by email addresses, separated by more whitespace, will result in the changes to that file being
       emailed to that address. All changes from each run are expressed in one email. Using the email feature requires Mail::SendMail to be installed; if it does not work correctly, an error message will
       be printed to standard error.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display a short help message then exit.

       -cconfigfile
              Get the list of files to track from configfile instead of from ~/.changetrackrc (/etc/changetrack.conf for the super-user)

       -doutputdirectory
              Store output in outputdirectory instead of in ~/.changetrack/ (/var/lib/changetrack/ for the super-user)

       -e     Keep a copy of the file from when it was first added to the changetrack configuration, and keep ed styled changes to rebuild the file.  This option is recommended only if rcs does not  work
              on  the  machine.  To recover using this means, the .ed file should have the last several commands removed, to allow the file to be rebuilt to the appropriate state. A command like 'cat my‐
              file.ed | ed myfile.original' should be executed.

       -r     Disable the rcs facility.

       -q     Quiet mode; only print critical messages. Good for scripts.

       -mmessage
              Print message on each file, after checking for any changes. Good for indicating reboots or other system events.

       -Mmessage
              Like -m, but message is only printed on modified files.

       -v     Print version and exit.

       -u     Use unified diffs (this only works with some implementations of diff.

       -oemailaddress
              Mail output to emailaddress. This is supplementary to emails specified in the config file.

       -femailaddress
              Set "From" header to emailaddress, which must be fully qualified.

REQUIREMENTS
       This program requires diff.  Unless the -r switch is used, this program requires rcs to be installed. If the -e switch is used, ed is required.

FILES
       ~/.changetrackrc
              List of files to monitor. Each line may start with '#' indicating a comment.  If a line is not a comment, it contains a file/pattern to monitor, and optionally " : " followed by  any  email
              addresses to send changes to. The filename may be a pattern described in the same way as for ls.  Note: the default is /etc/changetrack.conf for root.

       ~/.changetrack/
              Default  directory  in which to store output information. The default is /var/lib/changetrack/ for root. All rcs files are stored in this directory, unless a subdirectory called RCS exists,
              in which case the rcs files are stored in that directory.

       /etc/cron.daily/changetrack
              Script that creates the list of all files monitor.

       /etc/cron.hourly/changetrack
              Script that invocates changetrack.

       /etc/default/changetrack
              Configuration for the above two scripts.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Each filename is written to standard output.  rcs will print errors if certain things go wrong. It will also print a few lines each time changetrack is run after a new file is added to the config‐
       uration.
