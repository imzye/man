DESCRIPTION
       The  Electronic Logbook ELOG can be used to store and retrieve messages
       through a Web interface. Depending on the configuration, the ELOG  sys‐
       tem can host one or more logbooks which are stored in separate sections
       on the server.  elogd is the daemon program serving  as  a  simple  web
       server for the ELOG system.

              feature)

       elog(1).

       The full documentation for ELOG is maintained as an  html  manual.  You
       can reach it from the package document directory.

WARNINGS
       elogd  is  run under a separate user/group elog , by default. You might
       change it via Usr and Grp options in configuration file. The configura‐
       tion and stylesheet files should be readable by that user.

       Passwords are transferred over the network in plain text and therefore,
       are not secure. So if passwords are used elogd should be  started  with
       the SSL option in the configuration file for secure connections.
