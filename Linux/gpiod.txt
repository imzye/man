NAME
       gpioinfo - libgpiod command-line utility

SYNOPSIS
       gpioinfo [OPTIONS] [line]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print information about GPIO lines.

       Lines are specified by name, or optionally by offset if the chip option is provided.

       If no lines are specified then all lines are displayed.

OPTIONS
       --by-name
              treat lines as names even if they would parse as an offset

       -c, --chip <chip>
              restrict scope to a particular chip

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -s, --strict
              check all lines - don't assume line names are unique

       --unquoted
              don't quote line or consumer names

       -v, --version
              output version information and exit

   Chips:
              A GPIO chip may be identified by number, name, or path.  e.g. '0', 'gpiochip0', and '/dev/gpiochip0' all refer to the same chip.
