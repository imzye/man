NAME
       pnc - a command-line tool for phone number manipulation

SYNOPSIS
       pnc COMMAND [OPTIONS] INPUT

COMMANDS
       valid  Tests  whether  the  phone  number given as INPUT is a valid number or short number. Returns 0 (SUCCESS) if the number is valid, 1 (ERROR) otherwise. Valid options: -c, -v (verbose, default
              off).

       info   Displays information about the phone number given as INPUT. Valid option: -c.

       format Formats a telephone number given as INPUT to the specified standard (E164 by default), result on stdout. Valid options: -c, -f.

       find   Finds phone number in some text given as INPUT, result on stdout (one line per number found).  Valid options: -c, -f, -l.

       dialout
              Formats a phone number given as INPUT in e164 format for out-of-country dialing purposes. Valid options: -c, -l.

OPTIONS
       -c COUNTRY-CODE
              If set, the phone number(s) given in INPUT will be considered as being dialed from the country specified by the 2 uppercase letters COUNTRY-CODE (e.g.  "FR", "US", ...). If this  option  is
              not set, pnc will look for numbers in the international format.

       -f FORMAT
              Sets the phone number output format. FORMAT must be one of e164, int (international), nat (national), or teluri (RFC3966 tel URI). The default value is e164.

       -l LENIENCY
              Sets the phone number search leniency in INPUT. LENIENCY must be one of:

              possible
                     Phone numbers accepted are possible, but not necessarily valid.

              valid  (default  value)  Phone  numbers  accepted are possible and valid. Numbers written in national format must have their national-prefix present if it is usually written for a number of
                     this type.

              strict Phone numbers accepted are valid and are grouped in a possible way for this locale. For example, a US number written as "65 02 53 00 00" and "650253 0000" are not  accepted  at  this
                     leniency level, whereas "650 253 0000", "650 2530000" or "6502530000" are. Numbers with more than one '/' symbol in the national significant number are also dropped at this level.

              exact  Phone  numbers  accepted are valid and are grouped in the same way that we would have formatted it, or as a single block. For example, a US number written as "650 2530000" is not ac‐
                     cepted at this leniency level, whereas "650 253 0000" or "6502530000" are. Numbers with more than one '/' symbol are also dropped at this level.

                     (see https://javadoc.io/doc/com.googlecode.libphonenumber/libphonenumber/8.4.1 for more details)

RETURN STATUS
       pnc returns 0 on successful operations, 1 if an error occurred (option error, parsing error).
