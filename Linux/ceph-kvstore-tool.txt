NAME
       ceph-kvstore-tool - ceph kvstore manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       ceph-kvstore-tool <leveldb|rocksdb|bluestore-kv> <store path> command [args...]

DESCRIPTION
       ceph-kvstore-tool is a kvstore manipulation tool. It allows users to manipulate leveldb/rocksdb's data (like OSD's omap) offline.

COMMANDS
       ceph-kvstore-tool utility uses many commands for debugging purpose which are as follows:

       list [prefix]
              Print key of all KV pairs stored with the URL encoded prefix.

       list-crc [prefix]
              Print CRC of all KV pairs stored with the URL encoded prefix.

       dump [prefix]
              Print key and value of all KV pairs stored with the URL encoded prefix.

       exists <prefix> [key]
              Check if there is any KV pair stored with the URL encoded prefix. If key is also specified, check for the key with the prefix instead.

       get <prefix> <key> [out <file>]
              Get the value of the KV pair stored with the URL encoded prefix and key.  If file is also specified, write the value to the file.

       crc <prefix> <key>
              Get the CRC of the KV pair stored with the URL encoded prefix and key.

       get-size [<prefix> <key>]
              Get estimated store size or size of value specified by prefix and key.

       set <prefix> <key> [ver <N>|in <file>]
              Set the value of the KV pair stored with the URL encoded prefix and key.  The value could be version_t or text.

       rm <prefix> <key>
              Remove the KV pair stored with the URL encoded prefix and key.

       rm-prefix <prefix>
              Remove all KV pairs stored with the URL encoded prefix.

       store-copy <path> [num-keys-per-tx]
              Copy all KV pairs to another directory specified by path.  [num-keys-per-tx] is the number of KV pairs copied for a transaction.

       store-crc <path>
              Store CRC of all KV pairs to a file specified by path.

       compact
              Subcommand compact is used to compact all data of kvstore. It will open the database, and trigger a database's compaction. After compaction, some disk space may be released.

       compact-prefix <prefix>
              Compact all entries specified by the URL encoded prefix.

       compact-range <prefix> <start> <end>
              Compact some entries specified by the URL encoded prefix and range.

       destructive-repair
              Make a (potentially destructive) effort to recover a corrupted database.  Note that in the case of rocksdb this may corrupt an otherwise uncorrupted database--use this only as a last resort!

       stats  Prints  statistics  from  underlying  key-value database. This is only for informative purposes.  Format and information content may vary between releases. For RocksDB information includes com‐
              pactions stats, performance counters, memory usage and internal RocksDB stats.
