NAME
        bregex - Bacula's 'regex' engine

SYNOPSIS
       bregex [options] -f <data-file>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the bregex command.
       This program can be useful for testing regex expressions to be applied against a list of filenames.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -f <data-file>
              The  data-file  is a filename that contains lines of data to be matched (or not) against one or more patterns. When the program is run, it will prompt you for a regular expression pattern, then
              apply it one line at a time against the data in the file. Each line that matches will be printed preceded by its line number. You will then be prompted again for another pattern.

       -n     Print lines that do not match

       -l     Suppress lines numbers.
