NAME
       HTTP::Daemon - A simple http server class

VERSION
       version 6.16

SYNOPSIS
         use HTTP::Daemon;
         use HTTP::Status;

         my $d = HTTP::Daemon->new || die;
         print "Please contact me at: <URL:", $d->url, ">\n";
         while (my $c = $d->accept) {
             while (my $r = $c->get_request) {
             if ($r->method eq 'GET' and $r->uri->path eq "/xyzzy") {
                     # remember, this is *not* recommended practice :-)
                 $c->send_file_response("/etc/passwd");
             }
             else {
                 $c->send_error(RC_FORBIDDEN)
             }
             }
             $c->close;
             undef($c);
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Instances of the "HTTP::Daemon" class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a socket for incoming requests. The "HTTP::Daemon" is a subclass of "IO::Socket::IP", so you can perform socket operations
       directly on it too.

       Please note that "HTTP::Daemon" used to be a subclass of "IO::Socket::INET".  To support IPv6, it switched the parent class to "IO::Socket::IP" at version 6.05.  See "IPv6 SUPPORT" for details.

       The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.  The returned value will be an "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn" object which is another "IO::Socket::IP" subclass.  Calling
       the get_request() method on this object will read data from the client and return an "HTTP::Request" object.  The ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.

       This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you.  Your application, i.e. the user of the "HTTP::Daemon" is responsible for forking if that is desirable.  Also note that the user is responsible for
       generating responses that conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

       The following methods of "HTTP::Daemon" are new (or enhanced) relative to the "IO::Socket::IP" base class:

       $d = HTTP::Daemon->new
       $d = HTTP::Daemon->new( %opts )
           The  constructor  method  takes  the  same  arguments as the "IO::Socket::IP" constructor, but unlike its base class it can also be called without any arguments.  The daemon will then set up a
           listen queue of 5 connections and allocate some random port number.

           A server that wants to bind to some specific address on the standard HTTP port will be constructed like this:

             $d = HTTP::Daemon->new(
                      LocalAddr => 'www.thisplace.com',
                      LocalPort => 80,
                  );

           See IO::Socket::IP for a description of other arguments that can be used to configure the daemon during construction.

       $c = $d->accept
       $c = $d->accept( $pkg )
       ($c, $peer_addr) = $d->accept
           This method works the same as the one provided by the base class, but it returns an "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn" reference by default.  If a package  name  is  provided  as  argument,  then  the
           returned object will be blessed into the given class.  It is probably a good idea to make that class a subclass of "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn".

           The accept method will return "undef" if timeouts have been enabled and no connection is made within the given time.  The timeout() method is described in IO::Socket::IP.

           In list context both the client object and the peer address will be returned; see the description of the accept method of IO::Socket for details.

       $d->url
           Returns a URL string that can be used to access the server root.

       $d->product_tokens
           Returns  the  name that this server will use to identify itself.  This is the string that is sent with the "Server" response header.  The main reason to have this method is that subclasses can
           override it if they want to use another product name.

           The default is the string "libwww-perl-daemon/#.##" where "#.##" is replaced with the version number of this module.

       The "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn" is a subclass of "IO::Socket::IP".  Instances of this class are returned by the accept() method of "HTTP::Daemon".  The following methods are provided:

       $c->get_request
       $c->get_request( $headers_only )
           This method reads data from the client and turns it into an "HTTP::Request" object which is returned.  It returns "undef" if reading fails.  If it fails,  then  the  "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn"
           object ($c) should be discarded, and you should not try to call this method again on it.  The $c->reason method might give you some information about why $c->get_request failed.

           The  get_request()  method will normally not return until the whole request has been received from the client.  This might not be what you want if the request is an upload of a large file (and
           with chunked transfer encoding HTTP can even support infinite request messages - uploading live audio for instance).  If you pass a TRUE value as the $headers_only argument, then get_request()
           will return immediately after parsing the request headers and you are responsible for reading the rest of the request content.  If you are going to  call  $c->get_request  again  on  the  same
           connection you better read the correct number of bytes.

       $c->read_buffer
       $c->read_buffer( $new_value )
           Bytes  read  by $c->get_request, but not used are placed in the read buffer.  The next time $c->get_request is called it will consume the bytes in this buffer before reading more data from the
           network connection itself.  The read buffer is invalid after $c->get_request has failed.

           If you handle the reading of the request content yourself you need to empty this buffer before you read more and you need to place unconsumed bytes here.  You also  need  this  buffer  if  you
           implement services like 101 Switching Protocols.

           This method always returns the old buffer content and can optionally replace the buffer content if you pass it an argument.

       $c->reason
           When $c->get_request returns "undef" you can obtain a short string describing why it happened by calling $c->reason.

       $c->proto_ge( $proto )
           Return TRUE if the client announced a protocol with version number greater or equal to the given argument.  The $proto argument can be a string like "HTTP/1.1" or just "1.1".

       $c->antique_client
           Return TRUE if the client speaks the HTTP/0.9 protocol.  No status code and no headers should be returned to such a client.  This should be the same as !$c->proto_ge("HTTP/1.0").

       $c->head_request
           Return TRUE if the last request was a "HEAD" request.  No content body must be generated for these requests.

       $c->force_last_request
           Make sure that $c->get_request will not try to read more requests off this connection.  If you generate a response that is not self-delimiting, then you should signal this fact by calling this
           method.

           This  attribute  is  turned on automatically if the client announces protocol HTTP/1.0 or worse and does not include a "Connection: Keep-Alive" header.  It is also turned on automatically when
           HTTP/1.1 or better clients send the "Connection: close" request header.

       $c->send_status_line
       $c->send_status_line( $code )
       $c->send_status_line( $code, $mess )
       $c->send_status_line( $code, $mess, $proto )
           Send the status line back to the client.  If $code is omitted 200 is assumed.  If $mess is omitted, then a message corresponding to $code is inserted.  If $proto is missing the content of  the
           $HTTP::Daemon::PROTO variable is used.

       $c->send_crlf
           Send the CRLF sequence to the client.

       $c->send_basic_header
       $c->send_basic_header( $code )
       $c->send_basic_header( $code, $mess )
       $c->send_basic_header( $code, $mess, $proto )
           Send the status line and the "Date:" and "Server:" headers back to the client.  This header is assumed to be continued and does not end with an empty CRLF line.

           See the description of send_status_line() for the description of the accepted arguments.

       $c->send_header( $field, $value )
       $c->send_header( $field1, $value1, $field2, $value2, ... )
           Send one or more header lines.

       $c->send_response( $res )
           Write  an  "HTTP::Response"  object  to  the  client  as  a  response.   We  try  hard  to make sure that the response is self-delimiting so that the connection can stay persistent for further
           request/response exchanges.

           The content attribute of the "HTTP::Response" object can be a normal string or a subroutine reference.  If it is a subroutine, then whatever this callback routine returns is  written  back  to
           the  client  as  the response content.  The routine will be called until it returns an undefined or empty value.  If the client is HTTP/1.1 aware then we will use chunked transfer encoding for
           the response.

       $c->send_redirect( $loc )
       $c->send_redirect( $loc, $code )
       $c->send_redirect( $loc, $code, $entity_body )
           Send a redirect response back to the client.  The location ($loc) can be an absolute or relative URL. The $code must  be  one  of  the  redirect  status  codes,  and  defaults  to  "301  Moved
           Permanently"

       $c->send_error
       $c->send_error( $code )
       $c->send_error( $code, $error_message )
           Send an error response back to the client.  If the $code is missing a "Bad Request" error is reported.  The $error_message is a string that is incorporated in the body of the HTML entity.

       $c->send_file_response( $filename )
           Send back a response with the specified $filename as content.  If the file is a directory we try to generate an HTML index of it.

       $c->send_file( $filename )
       $c->send_file( $fd )
           Copy the file to the client.  The file can be a string (which will be interpreted as a filename) or a reference to an "IO::Handle" or glob.

       $c->daemon
           Return a reference to the corresponding "HTTP::Daemon" object.

IPv6 SUPPORT
       Since version 6.05, "HTTP::Daemon" is a subclass of "IO::Socket::IP" rather than "IO::Socket::INET", so that it supports IPv6.

       For some reasons, you may want to force "HTTP::Daemon" to listen on IPv4 addresses only.  Then pass "Family" argument to "HTTP::Daemon->new":

         use HTTP::Daemon;
         use Socket 'AF_INET';

         my $d = HTTP::Daemon->new(Family => AF_INET);
