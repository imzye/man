Name
       shunit2 - unit test framework for shell scripts

Synopsis
       shunit2 unit-file

Description
       shUnit2 is an xUnit unit test framework for Bourne-based shell scripts, and is designed to work in a similar manner to JUnit, PyUnit, and so forth.  If you have ever had the desire to write a unit
       test for a shell script, shUnit2 can do the job.

       You can either run shunit2 directly from the command line and specify the unit file unit-file or directly source the shunit2 executable.

       If you directly execute shunit2 and don't specify unit-file, shUnit2 assumes an empty test file and will return without an error message.

Options
       shunit2  does  not  support any command-line options at all.  You can either source shunit2 with the shell's . (“dot”) built-in to execute your unit tests or directly run shunit2 as a command with
       unit-file as a parameter.

Example
       The following simple script tests whether 1 equals 1.
              #! /bin/sh
              testEquality()
              {
                assertEquals 1 1
              }

              # load shunit2
              . shunit2

       The above example assumes this is executed on the machine where shunit2 is available as an executable command found in the path specified by the environment variable $PATH.  You can  alternatively
       copy a /usr/bin/shunit2 file from this machine to path/to/shunit2 in the target source tree and use it in the target build environment as follows.
              #! /bin/sh
              testEquality()
              {
                assertEquals 1 1
              }

              # load shunit2
              . path/to/shunit2

       The following is a shell session transcript showing how to write the same test as above and execute it directly.
              $ cat > test_equality.sh <<EOF
              testEquality()
              {
                assertEquals 1 1
              }
              EOF
              $ shunit2 test_equality.sh
       Note that shunit2 is not sourced in this example.
