NAME
       jetring-gen - generates changesets for changes between two keyrings

SYNOPSIS
       jetring-gen oldring.gpg newring.gpg [comment]

DESCRIPTION
       If  you  have  two keyrings, one being an old version of the other, this command can generate a sequence of changesets that, when applied to the old keyring with jetring-apply, should generate the new
       keyring.

       The optional comment parameter is a comment to put in each changeset.

       The names of the generated changesets will be output to stdout.
