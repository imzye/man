PGObject::Type::ByteString(3pm)                                                     User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                     PGObject::Type::ByteString(3pm)

NAME
       PGObject::Type::ByteString - Wrapper for raw strings mapping to BYTEA columns.

VERSION
       Version 1.2.3

SYNOPSIS
          PGObject::Type::ByteString->register();

       Now all BYTEA columns will be returned as ByteString objects.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a basic wrapper around Perl strings, mapping them to BYTEA database columns.

       PGObject::Type::ByteString objects have no traditional properties, however dereferencing them will yield the raw string they contain.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   register([registry => 'default',] [types => $types_arrayref])
       By default registers type PG_BYTEA.

   new
       Instantiates and returns a new object, based on the supplied scalar string, or scalar string reference.

       Dereferencing the returned object will yield the original raw string.

   from_db
       Returns a new PGObject::Type::ByteString object based on the supplied scalar string, or scalar string reference.

   to_db
       Returns the object's binary string value packaged as PG_BYTEA type/value hashref suitable for passing to DBD::Pg.
