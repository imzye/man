NAME
       Tie::ToObject - Tie to an existing object.

SYNOPSIS
               use Tie::ToObject;

               my $stolen = tied(%something);

               tie %something_else, 'Tie::ToObject', $stolen;

DESCRIPTION
       While "tie" in perldoc allows tying to an arbitrary object, the class in question must support this in it's implementation of "TIEHASH", "TIEARRAY" or whatever.

       This class provides a very tie constructor that simply returns the object it was given as it's first argument.

       This way side effects of calling "$object->TIEHASH" are avoided.

       This is used in Data::Visitor in order to tie a variable to an already existing object. This is also useful for cloning, when you want to clone the internal state object instead of going through
       the tie interface for that variable.
