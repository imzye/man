NAME
     unnsbtx — Nintendo NSBTX texture extractor

SYNOPSIS
     unnsbtx [options] command file

DESCRIPTION
     unnsbtx treats Nintendo NSBTX texture as archives and converts the multiple images stored within into TGA files.  The image pixel data and the palettes are automatically combined, provided they are
     named similarly.

OPTIONS
     -h
     --help
           Show a help text and exit.  --version Show version information and exit.
     command
         l   List images inside this NSBTX texture
         e   Extract images as TGA files
     file
         The NSBTX texture to read.

LIMITATIONS
     The palette of an image has to be named similarly to the pixel data.  Specifically, the palette has to be either named the same, or suffixed by “_pl”, “_p” or “_”.  If this not the case, and a palette
     for an image can't be found, unnsbtx throws an error.

EXAMPLES
     List all images contained in the texture texture.nsbtx:

           $ unnsbtx l texture.nsbtx

     Extract all images contained in the texture texture.nsbtx:

           $ unnsbtx e texture.nsbtx
