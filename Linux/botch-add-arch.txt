NAME
       botch-add-arch - add architecture to source packages

SYNOPSIS
       botch-add-arch [-h] [-v] toarch inSources outSources

DESCRIPTION
       Add architecture toarch to the "Architecture" field of all source packages in inSources which have an "Architecture" field that does not match toarch yet. The system's "dpkg-architecture" program is
       used to determine whether any architecture of the source packages' "Architecture" field matches toarch.

       The files inSources and outSources are control files given in deb822 format like the ones found on archive mirrors and locally under /var/lib/apt/lists.

       inSources and outSources can point to the same file name for in-place operation. Compressed inSources files are decompressed on the fly independent of their filename extension. The output will be
       compressed as determined by the filename extension of outSources.

       If inSources is equal to a single hyphen-minus (-) then its content will be read from standard input. If outSources is equal to a single hyphen-minus (-) then the output will be written to standard
       output.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       -h, --help
           Print help message.

EXAMPLE
       Make all source packages compilable on arm64:

        botch-add-arch arm64 inSources outSources
