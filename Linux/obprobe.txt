NAME
     obprobe — create electrostatic probe grid

SYNOPSIS
     obprobe [OPTIONS] type pchg filename

DESCRIPTION
     The obprobe tool creates a grid around a molecule, placing a probe atom with a specified atom type and partial charge at each point to calculate the MMFF94 energy. This can be used for docking experi‐
     ments to test hydrogen-bond affinity, electrostatic potential, etc.  Output is sent to standard output using the Gaussian Cube format.

OPTIONS
     If no filename is given, obprobe will give all options including the example probes.

     -s stepsize
           Set the resolution of the grid (stepsize)

     -p padding
           Set the padding -- extra distance on each side of the box formed by the molecule.

     type  MMFF94 atom type

     pchg  MMFF94 partial charge

EXAMPLES
     Probe the file pyridines.sdf using a carbonyl oxygen -- a hydrogen bond acceptor with partial charge -0.57:
           obprobe 7 -0.57 pyridines.sdf

     Probe the file pyridines.sdf using a phenyl carbon atom -- a hydrophobic atom with no partial charge:
           obprobe 37 0.0 pyridines.sdf
