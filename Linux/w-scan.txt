NAME
       w_scan - a universal ATSC and DVB blind scanner

SYNOPSIS
       w_scan -fa -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan -fc -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan -ft -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan -fs -s <SATELLITE_ID> [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       w_scan scans for DVB-C, DVB-S/S2, DVB-T, ISDB-T and ATSC channels. Any other program accessing the DVB hardware (like e.g. VDR) has to be closed in order to avoid conflicts while running w_scan.
       w_scan provides the channels in different output formats (Default: VDR channels.conf). For other output formats see OPTIONS.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available.

       -f TYPE
              Frontend type,
              "a" = ATSC,
              "c" = DVB-C,
              "s" = DVB-S/S2,
              "t" = DVB-T (and ISDB-T) [default]
              Depending on "TYPE", either of the arguments "-s" or "-c" is mandatory.

       -c COUNTRY_ID
              Mandatory argument for ATSC scans, cable scans and terrestrian scans, see option -f.
              Specifies the country where you try to scan for channels as uppercase two letter identifier, e.g.
              DE = Germany,
              US = United States,
              FR = France
              Use "-c?" for a list of all known identifiers.

       -s SATELLITE_ID
              Mandatory argument for satellite scans, see option -f.
              Specifies the satellite you wish to scan as uppercase identifier, e.g.
              S19E2 = 19.2° east,
              S13E0 = 13.0° east,
              S0W8 = 0.8° west.
              Use "-s?" for a list of all known identifiers.

              2 = VDR-2.0 [default],
              21 = VDR-2.1

       -X     generate zap/czap/xine output instead of VDR channels.conf.

       -x     generate initial tuning data output for (dvb-)scan instead of VDR channels.conf.

       -k     generate channels.dvb for kaffeine instead of VDR channels.conf.

       -L     generate VLC xspf playlist (experimental)

       -M     mplayer output instead of vdr channels.conf

       -G     generate output for Gstreamer dvbsrc plugin

       scan cable (DVB), Germany:
              w_scan -fc -c DE

       scan aerial (DVB), France:
              w_scan -ft -c FR

              w_scan -fa -A2 -c US

       scan aerial (ATSC), United States:
              w_scan -fa -A1 -c US

       use output format kaffeine:
              w_scan [ OTHER OPTIONS ] -k
