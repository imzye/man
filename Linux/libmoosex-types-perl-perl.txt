NAME
       MooseX::Types::Perl - Moose types that check against Perl syntax

VERSION
       version 0.101344

SYNOPSIS
         use MooseX::Types::Perl qw(
           DistName

           ModuleName
           PackageName

           Identifier
           SafeIdentifier

           LaxVersionStr
           StrictVersionStr
           VersionObject
         );

DESCRIPTION
       This library provides Moose types for checking things (mostly strings) against syntax that is, or is a reasonable subset of, Perl syntax.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

TYPES
   ModuleName
   PackageName
       These types are identical, and expect a string that could be a package or module name.  That's basically a bunch of identifiers stuck together with double-colons.  One key quirk is that parts of
       the package name after the first may begin with digits.

       The use of an apostrophe as a package separator is not permitted.

   DistName
       The DistName type checks for a string like "MooseX-Types-Perl", the sort of thing used to name CPAN distributions.  In general, it's like the more familiar ModuleName, but with hyphens instead of
       double-colons.

       In reality, a few distribution names may not match this pattern -- most famously, "CGI.pm" is the name of the distribution that contains CGI.  These exceptions are few and far between, and
       deciding what a "LaxDistName" type would look like has not seemed worth it, yet.

   Identifier
       An Identifier is something that could be used as a symbol name or other identifier (filehandle, directory handle, subroutine name, format name, or label).  It's what you put after the sigil
       (dollar sign, at sign, percent sign) in a variable name.  Generally, it's a bunch of alphanumeric characters not starting with a digit.

       Although Perl identifiers may contain non-ASCII characters in some circumstances, this type does not allow it.  A "UnicodeIdentifier" type may be added in the future.

   SafeIdentifier
       SafeIdentifiers are just like Identifiers, but omit the single-letter variables underscore, a, and b, as these have special significance.

   LaxVersionStr
   StrictVersionStr
       Lax and strict version strings use the is_lax and is_strict methods from "version" to check if the given string would be a valid lax or strict version.  version::Internals covers the details but
       basically:  lax versions are everything you may do, and strict omit many of the usages best avoided.

   VersionObject
       Just for good measure, this type is included to check if a value is a version object.  Coercions from LaxVersionStr (and thus StrictVersionStr) are provided.
