       --history-direction {downwards,leftwards,rightwards,upwards}
              enforce a specific direction of history on Graphviz (default: rightwards)

       --simplify
              remove edges implied by transitivity using Graphviz filter "tred" (default: do not remove implied edges)

       -a, --all

              tion commits can also be thought of as the counterpart of merge commits

       -I, --no-bifurcations
              do not include bifurcation commits
