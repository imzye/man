NAME
       pprofile - Line-granularity, thread-aware deterministic and statistic pure-python profiler

SYNOPSIS
       pprofile3 [options] some-python-module [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pprofile3 command.

       pprofile is a Line-granularity, thread-aware deterministic and statistic pure-python profiler

       Line-granularity, thread-aware deterministic and statistic pure-python profiler.  Line granularity allows locating precisely where time is spent in code.  Thread awareness automatically propagates
       profiling  to  all  threads  (all  threads in statistic mode, or threads spawned by profiled code in deterministic mode).  Deterministic profiling gives precise measures, but at a large speed cost
       (best used on minimal test scenario).  Statistic profiling gives rough measure, but has an extremely low overhead (suitable for live code profiling).  Does not require marking methods to  profile,
       allowing non-method profiling (module imports, class & function declarations and other module-level code).  Can produce callgrind output.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -m MODULE
               Searches sys.path for the named module and runs the corresponding .py file as a
               script. When given, positional argumentsbecome sys.argv[1:].

       -o, --out OUT
              Write annotated sources to this file. Defaults to stdout.

       -z, --zipfile ZIPFILE
              Name of a zip file to generate from all involved source files. Useful with
               callgrind output.

       -t, --threads THREADS
              If non-zero, trace threads spawned by program. Default: 1.

       -f, --format callgrind,text
              Format in which output is generated. If not set, auto-detected from filename if provided, falling back to "text".

       -v, --verbose
              Enable profiler internal tracing output. Cryptic and verbose.

       -s, --statistic STATISTIC
              Use this period for statistic profiling, or use deterministic profiling when 0.
