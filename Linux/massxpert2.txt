NAME
       massXpert2           —             Model linear polymers, simulate chemical reactions and predict mass spectrometric data

SYNOPSIS
       massxpert2 [options]  [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the massxpert2 software shipped within the msXpertSuite software suite.

       This  program  allows one to model linear polymer chemistries using a dedicated grammar. Once the polymer chemistry of interest is defined, the user is allowed to use it to define polymer sequence
       files. These files serve as the starting point for the simulation of a large set of chemical reactions onto that polymer sequence. This software is comprised of four main submodules:

          •  XpertDef: module to define brand new polymer chemistries;

          •  XpertCalc: module to perform any mass calculation taking advantage of defined polymer chemistries;

          •  XpertEdit: module to edit polymer sequences of any specific polymer chemistry and to graphically perform a wide array of chemical reactions along with the corresponding mass spectrum simula‐
             tions;

          •  XpertMiner: module to compare with maximum flexibility any number of mass-to-ratio (m/z) lists.

Useful reading
       The  program  is  documented  fully  in  the  massXpert2  User  Manual,  that  is  packaged  in  massxpert2-doc.  That  manual is available in the form of a PDF-formatted file and of HTML files in
       (/usr/share/doc/massxpert2).
