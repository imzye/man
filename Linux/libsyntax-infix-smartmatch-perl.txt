Syntax::Infix::Smartmatch(3pm)                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                      Syntax::Infix::Smartmatch(3pm)

NAME
       Syntax::Infix::Smartmatch - Smartmatch done right

VERSION
       version 0.011

SYNOPSIS
        say "YES" if $value ~~ [1, 2, qr/42/];

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE: This module is currently still experimental and the details of its behavior may still change.

       This module implements a new, much simplified version of smartmatch. In particular the behavior only depends on the right side argument. In particular it will do the following based on the right
       side argument:

       •   undef

           This will return "not defined $left".

       •   object

           If the object has smartmatch overloading (note: this might disappear in a future Perl version), that is called. Otherwise it returns object identity.

       •   regex

           This is equivalent to "$left =~ $right".

       •   sub

           It will return the value of $right->($left)

       •   array

           This will return true if $left smartmatches any of the members of @$right.

       •   other

           This will return "$left equ $right" ("defined $left and $left eq $right").
