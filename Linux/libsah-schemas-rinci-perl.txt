NAME
       Sah::SchemaR::rinci::function_meta - Rinci function metadata

VERSION
       This document describes version 1.1.98.0 of Sah::SchemaR::rinci::function_meta (from Perl distribution Sah-Schemas-Rinci), released on 2021-07-20.

DESCRIPTION
       This module is automatically generated by Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Sah::Schemas during distribution build.

       A Sah::SchemaR::* module is useful if a client wants to quickly lookup the base type of a schema without having to do any extra resolving. With Sah::Schema::*, one might need to do several lookups
       if a schema is based on another schema, and so on. Compare for example Sah::Schema::poseven vs Sah::SchemaR::poseven, where in Sah::SchemaR::poseven one can immediately get that the base type is
       "int". Currently Perinci::Sub::Complete uses Sah::SchemaR::* instead of Sah::Schema::* for reduced startup overhead when doing tab completion.
