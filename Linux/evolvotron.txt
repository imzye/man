NAME
       evolvotron_mutate - Render an evolvotron function tree to an image.

SYNOPSIS
       evolvotron_mutate < function_in.xml > function_out.xml

       evolvotron_mutate -g > function_out.xml

DESCRIPTION
       evolvotron_mutate  either mutates an existing image function read from standard input, or (with the -g option) creates a new image function.  In either case the output image function is written to
       standard output.

       The mutation parameters and function weightings are the same as used by evolvotron in its default reset state.

       See the evolvotron user manual (accessible from the evolvotron application's Help menu) for more information on image functions.

COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
       -g, --genesis
            Specifies that no function should be read from standard input.  The output function is created at random.

       -h, --help
            Display information on command line arguments and exit.

       -l, --linear
            Created functions (if they are rendered as animations) will sweep z linearly (rather than sinusoidally).

       -p, --spheremap
            Created functions will be tagged as spheremaps.

       -v, --verbose
            Enables some additional logging to standard error.

EXAMPLES
       evolvotron_mutate -g | tee function0.xml | evolvotron_render function0.ppm

       evolvtron_mutate < function0.xml > function1.xml
