NAME
       Role::HasMessage - a thing with a message method

VERSION
       version 0.007

DESCRIPTION
       This is another extremely simple role.  A class that includes Role::HasMessage is promising to provide a "message" method that returns a string summarizing the message or event represented by the
       object.  It does not provide any actual behavior.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
