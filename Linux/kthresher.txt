NAME
       kthresher - purge unused kernels

SYNOPSIS
       kthresher [-h] [-c FILE ] [-d] [-H] [-k [N] ] [-p] [-s] [-v] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       kthresher is a utility to remove kernel packages that are marked as a candidate for autoremoval, such as those installed via unattended-upgrades or meta packages.

       By default the running kernel, the latest kernel and manual installations are marked to 'Never Auto Remove'.  kthresher then will not attempt to remove those packages.

       When no option is passed to kthresher the list of available kernels for autoremoval will be printed.
