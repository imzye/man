NAME
       harmonySEQ - MIDI sequencer designed for live performances

SYNOPSIS
       harmonySEQ [OPTION...]  [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       A MIDI software sequencer designed for live performances and jams.

       harmonySEQ(1) operates a number of synchronized sequencers, each with its own pattern, repeating looped melodies of different length, duration and MIDI channel.

       Main features include:

              • support for complex polyrhythms

              • multi-pattern configuration for each sequencer

              • customizable action triggers – exceptionally useful for live performances

              • chord management system which allows to easily organize melodies that sound great together

              • support for sequencing MIDI control messages

              • an easy-to-use yet powerful interface, with a rich piano-roll pattern editor

       As for now harmonySEQ(1) works on Linux only.

       It uses ALSA (asound) library, and GTKmm for graphical interface.

       No official user documentation exists at the moment, but you can refer to UI tooltips – nearly everything has a detailed explanation.

       More information can be found on the project’s website ⟨https://harmonyseq.wordpress.com⟩.
