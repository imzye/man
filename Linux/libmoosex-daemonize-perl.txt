NAME
       MooseX::Daemonize::WithPidFile - A Role with the core daemonization and pidfile management

VERSION
       version 0.22

SYNOPSIS
         package My::Daemon;
         use Moose;

         with 'MooseX::Daemonize::WithPidFile';

         sub start {
             my $self = shift;
             # daemonize me ...
             $self->daemonize; # << this will write the pidfile for you
             # return from the parent,...
             return unless $self->is_daemon;
             # but continue on in the child (daemon)
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a slightly extended basic daemonization Role, it provides Pidfile management along with the core daemonization features found in MooseX::Daemonize::Core.

ATTRIBUTES
       pidfile (is = rw, isa => MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File)>
           This attribute holds the MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File object used to manage the Pidfile. It will initialize the object using the "init_pidfile" method (which is required by this role).

REQUIRED METHODS
       init_pidfile
           This method is used to build the pidfile attribute's object. It should return a MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File object.

       has_pidfile
           This is a predicate method to tell you if your pidfile attribute has been initialized yet.

METHODS
       daemonize
           This adds an "after" method modifier to the "daemonize" method (from MooseX::Daemonize::Core) and handles writing your Pidfile for you.

       meta
           The "meta()" method from Class::MOP::Class

DEPENDENCIES
       Moose::Role, MooseX::Getopt and MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File
