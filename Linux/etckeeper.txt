NAME
       etckeeper - store /etc in git, mercurial, bazaar, or darcs

SYNOPSIS
       etckeeper command [-d directory]

DESCRIPTION
       etckeeper  manages  /etc  be  stored  in a git, mercurial, bazaar, or darcs repository. By default each of the commands operates on /etc, but a different directory can be specified to operate on a
       clone of the /etc repository located elsewhere.

COMMANDS
       init   This initialises and sets up a git, mercurial, bazaar, or darcs repository (depending on the VCS setting in /etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf). Typically this is run in /etc once when  starting
              to use etckeeper on a machine. It can also be used to initialise a clone of the /etc repository located elsewhere.

       commit [message]
              Commits  all changes in /etc to the repository. A commit message can be specified. You may also use the underlying VCS to commit manually.  (Note that etckeeper commit will notice if a user
              has used sudo or su to become root, and record the original username in the commit.)

       pre-commit
              This is called as a pre-commit hook. It stores metadata and does sanity checks.

       pre-install
              This is called by apt's DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs hook, or by equivalent hooks of other package managers. It allows committing any uncommitted changes before packages are installed,  upgraded,
              etc.

       post-install
              This  is  called  by apt's DPkg::Post-Invoke hook, or by equivalent hooks of other package managers. It commits changes made by packages into the repository. (You can also call this by hand
              after running dpkg by hand.)

       unclean
              This returns true if the directory contains uncommitted changes.

       update-ignore [-a]
              This updates the VCS ignore file. Content outside a "managed by etckeeper" block is not touched. This is generally run when upgrading to a new version of etckeeper. (The -a switch will  add
              a "managed by etckeeper" block if one is not present.)

       vcs subcommand [options ...]
              You can use this to run any subcommand of the VCS that etckeeper is configured to run. It will be run in /etc. For example, "etckeeper vcs diff" will run "git diff", etc.

       uninit [-f]
              This  command  DESTROYS DATA! It is the inverse of the init command, removing VCS information and etckeeper's own bookkeeping information from the directory. Use with caution. A typical use
              case would be to run etckeeper uninit, then modify etckeeper.conf to use a different VCS, and then run etckeeper init. (The -f switch can be used to force uninit without prompting.)

FILES
       /etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf is the configuration file.

       /etc/etckeeper also contains directories containing the programs that are run for each of the above commands.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       ETCKEEPER_CONF_DIR path to configuration directory instead of default /etc/etckeeper.
