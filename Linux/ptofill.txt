NAME
       ptofill - add control points to a Hugin project between likely overlapping photos

SYNOPSIS
       ptofill [options] --output output.pto input.pto

        Options:
         -m | --makefile file  Output Makefile
         -o | --output file    Output project
              --ignoregroups   Match photos even between unconnected groups
         -f | --factor         Distance factor to search for overlaps (default=1.25)
         -h | --help           Outputs help documentation.

DESCRIPTION
       ptofill is a wrapper around various tools that generates control points.  Output is in the form of a .pto project.

       All pairs of photos in a project are examined and angular distances compared to determine if photos likely overlap, if points already exist between photos then matching will be skipped.

       Matching will also be skipped between photos that are not in the same 'connected group' unless the --ignoregroups option is specified.

       If the --makefile option is given, rules for generating the project are written to a Makefile, if --makefile isn't set then these rules will be executed immediately.

       Control point generator parameters are set via Option lines in the input project:

         #hugin_cpgenSize 1500
         #hugin_cpgenNumber 25
         #hugin_cpgenRansac true
         #hugin_cpgenRefine false
