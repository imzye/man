NAME
       redis-benchmark - Redis benchmark

SYNOPSIS
       redis-benchmark [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker, found at http://redis.io/

       The redis-benchmark command is a command to benchmark redis-server.

OPTIONS
       -h hostname    Server hostname (default: 127.0.0.1).

       -p port        Server port (default: 6379).

       -s socket      Server socket (overrides hostname and port).

       -a password    Password to use when connecting to the server.

       -c clients     Number of parallel connections (default 50)

       -dnnum db      SELECT the specified db number (default 0)

       -k boolean     1=keep alive 0=reconnect (default 1)

       -r keyspacelen Use  random keys for SET/GET/INCR, random values for SADD Using this option the benchmark will expand the string __rand_int__ inside an argument with a 12 digits number in the specified
                      range from 0 to keyspacelen-1. The substitution changes every time a command is executed. Default tests use this to hit random keys in the specified range.

       -P numreq      Pipeline <numreq> requests. Default 1 (no pipeline).

       -e             If server replies with errors, show them on stdout.  (no more than 1 error per second is displayed)

       -q             Quiet. Just show query/sec values

       --csv          Output in CSV format

       -l             Loop. Run the tests forever

       -t tests       Only run the comma separated list of tests. The test names are the same as the ones produced as output.

       -I             Idle mode. Just open N idle connections and wait.

EXAMPLES
       Run the benchmark with the default configuration against 127.0.0.1:6379:
            $ redis-benchmark

       Use 20 parallel clients, for a total of 100k requests, against 192.168.1.1:
            $ redis-benchmark -h 192.168.1.1 -p 6379 -n 100000 -c 20

       Fill 127.0.0.1:6379 with about 1 million keys only using the SET test:
            $ redis-benchmark -t set -n 1000000 -r 100000000

       Benchmark 127.0.0.1:6379 for a few commands producing CSV output:
            $ redis-benchmark -t ping,set,get -n 100000 --csv

       Benchmark a specific command line:
            $ redis-benchmark -r 10000 -n 10000 eval 'return redis.call("ping")' 0

       Fill a list with 10000 random elements:
            $ redis-benchmark -r 10000 -n 10000 lpush mylist __rand_int__

       On user specified command lines __rand_int__ is replaced with a random integer
            with a range of values selected by the -r option.
