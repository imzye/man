NAME
       PathFinder - simple file manager

SYNOPSIS
       PathFinder [startdir]

DESCRIPTION
       PathFinder features file mime-type bindings, customizable file- and di‐
       rectory icons, directory bookmarking, drag and  drop  (compatible  with
       KDE  and  GNOME), and wildcard matching to reduce the number of visible
       files.  It is probably the fastest file manager you've ever seen.
