NAME
       rigctlcom - COM port passthru as TS-2000 emulator to your rig

SYNOPSIS
       rigctlcom [-hlLuV] [-m id] [-r device] [-R device] [-p device] [-d device] [-P type] [-D type] [-s baud] [-S baud] [-c id] [-C parm=val] [-v[-Z]]

DESCRIPTION
       Allows programs which can connect to TS-2000 via COM port to use Hamlib radios.  Multiple programs can connect to the radio via FLRig or rigctld.

       Virtual  serial/COM  ports  must  be set up first using socat(1) or similar on POSIX systems (BSD, Linux, OS/X).  On Microsoft Windows available utilities are com0com ⟨http://com0com.sourceforge.net⟩,
       Free Virtual Serial Ports ⟨https://freevirtualserialports.com⟩, or VPSD ⟨http://www.virtualserialportdriver.com/⟩.

       Please report bugs and provide feedback at the e-mail address given in the BUGS section below.  Patches and code enhancements sent to the same address are welcome.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax.  Short options that take an argument may have the value follow immediately or be separated by a space.  Long options starting  with  two  dashes
       (‘-’) require an ‘=’ between the option and any argument.

       Here is a summary of the supported options:

       -m, --model=id
              Select radio model number.

              See model list (use “rigctlcom -l”).

              Note: rigctlcom (or third party software using the C API) will use radio model 2 for NET rigctl (communicating with rigctld).

       -r, --rig-file=device
              Use device as the file name of the port connected to the radio.

              Often  a  serial  port,  but could be a USB to serial adapter.  Typically /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, /dev/ttyUSB0, etc. on Linux, COM1, COM2, etc. on MS Windows.  The BSD flavors and Mac OS/X have
              their own designations.  See your system's documentation.

              The special string “uh-rig” may be given to enable micro-ham device support.

       -R, --rig-file2=device
              Use device as the file name of one of the virtual com ports -- your program will connect to the other com port of the virtual pair.

              Virtual serial ports on POSIX systems can be done with socat(1):

                  $ socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0

              See this Stackoverflow answer for using socat ⟨https://stackoverflow.com/a/19733677⟩.

              On Microsoft Windows available utilities are com0com, Free Virtual Serial Ports, or VPSD (see DESCRIPTION above for WWW links).

       -p, --ptt-file=device
              Use device as the file name of the Push-To-Talk device using a device file as described above.

       -d, --dcd-file=device
              Use device as the file name of the Data Carrier Detect device using a device file as described above.

       -P, --ptt-type=type
              Use type of Push-To-Talk device.

              Supported types are ‘RIG’ (CAT command), ‘DTR’, ‘RTS’, ‘PARALLEL’, ‘NONE’, overriding PTT type defined in the rig's backend.

              Some side effects of this command are that when type is set to DTR, read PTT state comes from the Hamlib frontend, not read from the radio.  When set to NONE, PTT state cannot be  read  or  set
              even if rig backend supports reading/setting PTT status from the rig.

       -D, --dcd-type=type
              Use type of Data Carrier Detect device.

              Supported types are ‘RIG’ (CAT command), ‘DSR’, ‘CTS’, ‘CD’, ‘PARALLEL’, ‘NONE’.

       -s, --serial-speed=baud
              Set serial speed to baud rate.

              Uses maximum serial speed from radio backend capabilities (set by -m above) as the default.

       -S, --serial-speed2=baud
              Set serial speed to baud rate for virtual com port (see -R).

              Uses maximum serial speed from radio backend capabilities (set by -m above) as the default.

       -c, --civaddr=id
              Use id as the CI-V address to communicate with the rig.

              Only useful for Icom and some Ten-Tec rigs.

              Note: The id is in decimal notation, unless prefixed by 0x, in which case it is hexadecimal.

       -L, --show-conf
              List all config parameters for the radio defined with -m above.

       -C, --set-conf=parm=val[,parm=val]
              Set radio configuration parameter(s), e.g.  stop_bits=2.

              Use the -L option above for a list of configuration parameters for a given model number.

       -u, --dump-caps
              Dump capabilities for the radio defined with -m above and exit.

       -l, --list
              List all model numbers defined in Hamlib and exit.

              The list is sorted by model number.

              Note:  In  Linux  the  list  can be scrolled back using Shift-PageUp/Shift-PageDown, or using the scrollbars of a virtual terminal in X or the cmd window in Windows.  The output can be piped to
              more(1) or less(1), e.g. “rigctl -l | more”.

       -n, --no-restore-ai
              On exit rigctl restores the state of auto information (AI) on the controlled rig.

              If this is not desired, for example if you are using rigctl to turn AI mode on or off, pass this option.

       -v, --verbose
              Set verbose mode, cumulative (see DIAGNOSTICS below).

       -Z, --debug-time-stamps
              Enable time stamps for the debug messages.

              Use only in combination with the -v option as it generates no output on its own.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of these options and exit.

       -V, --version
              Show version of rigctl and exit.

       Note: Some options may not be implemented by a given backend and will return an error.  This is most likely to occur with the --set-conf and --show-conf options.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The -v, --verbose option allows different levels of diagnostics to be output to stderr and correspond to -v for BUG, -vv for ERR, -vvv for WARN, -vvvv for VERBOSE, or -vvvvv for TRACE.

       A given verbose level is useful for providing needed debugging information to the email address below.  For example, TRACE output shows all of the values sent to and received from the radio  which  is
       very useful for radio backend library development and may be requested by the developers.

EXIT STATUS
       rigctlcom exits with:

       0      if all operations completed normally;

       1      if there was an invalid command line option or argument;

       2      if an error was returned by Hamlib.

EXAMPLE
       Start  rigctlcom  with  FLRig  as the Hamlib model and virtual com port pair COM9/COM10, e.g.  N1MM Logger+ ⟨http://n1mm.hamdocs.com⟩ attaching to COM10 and using the TS-2000 emulator attached to COM9
       (assumes virtual serial/COM ports pipe has been created with the proper utility as described above):

           $ rigctlcom -m 4 -R COM9 -S 115200

       The following diagram shows the communications flow that allows N1MM Logger+ to communicate with a radio connected to Flrig:

           Flrig -><- rigctlcom -> COM9 <- virt_port_pipe -> COM10 <- N1MM
