NAME
       srf_list - Lists and/or counts the contents of an SRF file

SYNOPSIS
       srf_list  [options] srf_archive ...

DESCRIPTION
       srf_list  lists the filenames held within one or more SRF container.  To simply count the contents rather than list them specify the -c option. Note that when in count-only mode if an index is present
       it will be used to determine the number of entries in the index and hence sequences in the SRF file. The index cannot be used when listing the filenames however as the index itself  does  not  contain
       the full filenames.

       Note that it is not possible to count sequences matching certain patterns or with specific flags set. srf_info is a more general purpose tool that may cover this.

OPTIONS
       -c     Counts sequences instead of listing them. Note that this may be substantially faster than listing if an index exists.

       -v     Verbose mode. This gives summary count information per file rather than just the total at the end.

       -l     Long  format.  When  listing  sequence names this also provides information on the position in the archive and the size of the sequence specific data block and the size of the shared data block
              header.

EXAMPLES
       To count the total number of sequences in several SRF files:

           srf_list -c *.srf

       To produce a "fofn" (file of filenames) for an SRF file:

           srf_list foo.srf > foo.fofn
