NAME
       vfs_time_audit - samba vfs module to log slow VFS operations

SYNOPSIS

       vfs objects = time_audit

DESCRIPTION
       This VFS module is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The time_audit VFS module logs system calls that take longer than the number of milliseconds defined by the variable time_audit:timeout. It will log the calls and the time spent in it.

       It's kind of comparable with strace -T and is helpful to reveal performance problems with the underlying file and storage subsystems.

       This module is stackable.

OPTIONS
       time_audit:timeout = number of milliseconds
           VFS calls that take longer than the defined number of milliseconds that should be logged. The default is 10000 (10s).

EXAMPLES
       This would log VFS calls that take longer than 3 seconds:

                   [sample_share]
                path = /test/sample_share
                vfs objects = time_audit
                time_audit:timeout = 3000

VERSION
       This man page is part of version 4.23.2-Debian-4.23.2+dfsg-1 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is
       developed.

       The time_audit VFS module was created with contributions from Abhidnya Chirmule.
