NAME
       msva-query-agent - query a Monkeysphere Validation Agent

SYNOPSIS
       msva-query-agent CONTEXT PEER PKC_TYPE [PEER_TYPE] < /path/to/public_key_carrier

       msva-query-agent CONTEXT PEER PKC_TYPE PEER_TYPE PKC_DATA

       msva-query-agent --version

ABSTRACT
       msva-query-agent validates certificates for a given use by querying a running Monkeysphere Validation Agent.

USAGE
       msva-query-agent reads a certificate from standard input, and posts it to the running Monkeysphere Validation Agent.  The return code indicates the validity (as determined by the agent) of the
       certificate for the specified purpose.  The agent's return message (if any) is emitted on stdout.

       The various arguments are:

       CONTEXT
           Context in which the certificate is being validated (e.g. 'https', 'ssh', 'ike')

       PEER
           The name of the intended peer.  When validating a certificate for a service, supply the host's full DNS name (e.g.  'foo.example.net')

       PKC_TYPE
           The format of public key carrier data provided on standard input (e.g. 'x509der', 'x509pem', 'opensshpubkey', 'rfc4716', 'openpgp4fpr')

       PEER_TYPE
           The type of peer we are inquiring about (e.g. 'client', 'server', 'peer').  This argument is optional and defaults will be used (based on CONTEXT) if it is not supplied.

       PKC_DATA
           This  is  the  actual  public  key  carrier  data  itself.   If  less than five arguments are given, then the PKC_DATA is expected on stdin.  If five arguments are given, the fifth argument is
           interpreted as the PKC_DATA.  This is likely only useful for supplying an OpenPGP fingerprint with the 'openpgp4fpr' type.

RETURN CODE
       If the certificate is valid for the requested peer in the given context, the return code is 0.  Otherwise, the return code is 1.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       msva-query-agent's behavior is controlled by environment variables:

       MONKEYSPHERE_VALIDATION_AGENT_SOCKET
           Socket over which to query the validation agent.  If unset, the default value is 'http://127.0.0.1:8901'.

       MSVA_LOG_LEVEL
           Log messages about its operation to stderr.  MSVA_LOG_LEVEL controls its verbosity, and should be one of (in increasing verbosity): silent, quiet, fatal, error, info, verbose,  debug,  debug1,
           debug2, debug3.  Default is 'error'.

COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL DETAILS
       Communications  with  the  Monkeysphere  Validation  Agent  are  in the form of JSON requests over plain HTTP.  Responses from the agent are also JSON objects.  For details on the structure of the
       requests and responses, please see http://web.monkeysphere.info/validation-agent/protocol
