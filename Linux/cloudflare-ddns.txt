NAME
       cloudflare-ddns — dynamically update a DNS record

SYNOPSIS
       cloudflare-ddns [api_token record_name] [--config file]

DESCRIPTION
       cloudflare-ddns is a tool that can be used to dynamically update a DNS record using Cloudflare's API.

       This tool is a oneshot program: you run it, it updates the DNS record, and it terminates. To make it run periodically you could use a systemd timer or a cron job.

       To run the tool you'll need an API token: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens; cloudflare-ddns only needs the Zone.DNS edit permission.

       You  can  run  cloudflare-ddns  in  two  different  ways:  you  can  pass  the  API  Token  and  the  record  name  as  command line arguments, or you can use the ini configuration file located in
       /etc/cloudflare-ddns/config.ini by passing no arguments at all. If you prefer, you can even use a configuration file in a custom location, using --config file.

EXIT STATUS
       The cloudflare-ddns utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       $ cloudflare-ddns
