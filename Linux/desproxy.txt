NAME
       desproxy-socksserver - Using desproxy with dynamic connections

SYNOPSIS
         desproxy-socksserver proxy_host proxy_port local_port

OPTIONS
       None.

DESCRIPTION
       You can see that for every application that needs to be un-proxyzed you have to start a desproxy program. That is OK if you are using irc, ssh or other application that always connects to the same
       server. But if you need to dynamically establish TCP connections it's impossible to follow that path.

       That's why desproxy-socksserver, which is just a desproxy implementation of a Socks 5 Server. A Socks 5 Server is like a "TCP proxy": you just request a TCP connection and the Socks 5 Server does
       the work for you. Of course, client applications need to have support for Socks 5 Server.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.
