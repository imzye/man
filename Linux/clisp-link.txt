CLISP-LINK(1)                                                                            Platform: s390x-ibm-linux-gnu                                                                            CLISP-LINK(1)

NAME
       clisp-link - link a new external module to CLISP[1].

SYNOPSIS
       clisp-link [create] [module] [file...]

       clisp-link [add] [source] [destination] [module...]

       clisp-link [run] [source] [module...]

       clisp-link [install] [module...]

DESCRIPTION
       This shell script operates on CLISP[1] module sets and linking sets:

       •   creates new module sets out of source files

       •   adds module sets to a linking set to produce a new linking set

       •   runs CLISP[1] with module sets added

       •   Only in CLISP[1] built without configure flag --without-dynamic-modules.

           installs new module sets for general use

OPTIONS
       create
           The command

               $ clisp-link create module file ...

           creates a module set in module directory which refers (via symbolic links) to files file... The files are expected to be modules of their own.

       add
           The command

               $ clisp-link add source destination module ...

           combines the linking set in directory source and the modules in directories module... to a new linking set, in the directory destination which is newly created.

       run
           The command

               $ clisp-link run source module ...

           runs the linking set in directory source, with the modules in directories module... Unless CLISP[1] has been built with the configuration option --without-dynamic-modules, the loading will be
           performed using SYS::DYNLOAD-MODULES. Otherwise - this is much slower - a temporary linking set will be created and deleted afterwards.

       install
           Only in CLISP[1] built without configure flag --without-dynamic-modules.

           The command

               $ clisp-link install module ...

           installs the modules in directories module... into CUSTOM:*LIB-DIRECTORY* or, if it is not writable to the user (e.g., if a system-wide CLISP[1] installation is used and the user does not have
           administrative privileges), into CUSTOM:*USER-LIB-DIRECTORY*.

           Variable CUSTOM:*USER-LIB-DIRECTORY* is initially set to (MERGE-PATHNAMES[2] ".clisp/" (USER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME[3])) if that directory exists, and can be reset in the RC file.

               Note
               Do not add CUSTOM:*USER-LIB-DIRECTORY* to CUSTOM:*LOAD-PATHS* or under any element thereof. Use REQUIRE instead of LOAD to load dynamic modules.
           For this command to work, each module directory must contain a Makefile with a clisp-module-distrib target which uses LN to distribute the files necessary to run the module into destdir. This is
           in addition to the general requirement that link.sh is present.

EXAMPLES
       See Section 32.2.6, “Example”.

FILES
       clisp-link needs a “link kit” directory containing:

       •   "modules.c"

       •   "clisp.h"

       clisp-link expects to find these files in a subdirectory linkkit/ of the installation directory (i.e., CUSTOM:*LIB-DIRECTORY*) which it acquires by running

           $ `dirname $0`/clisp -b

       This can be overridden by the environment variable[4] CLISP_LINKKIT.
