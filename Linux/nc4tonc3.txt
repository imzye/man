NAME
       nc4tonc3 - a program to convert a classic netCDF 4 file to netCDF 3 format

SYNOPSIS
       nc4tonc3 [-h] [-o] [--chunk] netcdf4filename netcdf3filename

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nc4tonc3 command.

       nc4tonc3 is a program that converts a netCDF 4 file (in NETCDF4_CLASSIC format) to netCDF 3 format.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -h     Shows a summary of the available options.

       -o     Overwrite destination file (default is to raise an error if output file already exists).

       --quiet=(0|1)
              If set to 1, don't print any diagnostic information.

       --format
              Choose the netcdf3 format to use. NETCDF3_64BIT is used by default, or it can be set to NETCDF3_CLASSIC.

       --chunk=(integer)
              The number of records along unlimited dimension to write at once. The default is 10. It is ignored if there is no unlimited dimension. If chunk=0, this means write all the data at once.
