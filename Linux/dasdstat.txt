NAME
       dasdstat - read or modify the statistics of the DASD device driver.

SYNOPSIS
       dasdstat
               [-h]

       dasdstat
               [-e] [-d] [-r] [-i] [-l] [-c] [-w] [-V] [-v] [<statistic> [<statistic>] ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       The dasdstat command provides easy access to the debugfs based statistics of the DASD device driver.

       The  DASD statistics feature allows to gather statistical data for the I/O requests processed by the DASD device driver. This data can be collected for indi‐
       vidual DASD CCW devices (including PAV base and alias devices), DASD block devices, or globally for all requests handled by the DASD device driver.

       When no other options are specified, then the default operation is to print the statistics data in a formatted table. When no specific list of statistics  is
       given, then the operation will be performed on all available statistics.

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
               Print help text.

       -e|--enable
               Enable the statistics.

       -d|--disable
               Disable the statistics.

       -r|--reset
               Reset the statistics.

       -i|--directory
               Specify the directory in which the statistics can be found.

       -l|--long
               Print more detailed information, e.g differentiate between read and write requests.

       -c|--columns <number>
               Format the output in a table with the given number of columns.

       -w|--column-width <width>
               Set the minimum width of the columns in the output table.

       -V|--verbose
               Print more verbose information.

       -v|--version
               Print the version of the s390-tools package and the command.

       <statistic> =
               Name of a statistic that the command should work on.

EXAMPLES
       dasdstat
              Print a statistics table for each enabled statistic.

       dasdstat -e
              Enable all DASD statistics.

       dasdstat -l dasda 0.0.1800 0.0.18fe 0.0.18ff
              Print  a  detailed  statistics  table for DASD block device dasda and CCW devices 0.0.1800, 0.0.18fe and 0.0.18ff. A typical scenario for this example
              would be that dasda is the block device that belongs to PAV base device 0.0.1800, and CCW devices 0.0.18fe and 0.0.18ff are the associated  alias  de‐
              vices.
