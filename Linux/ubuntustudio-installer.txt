NAME
       ubuntustudio-installer - select packages to install from command line.

SYNOPSIS
       ubuntustudio-installer [ package ] [ package ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       ubuntustudio-installer is a program that takes a list of packages on the command line and presents a GUI list of those packages with description for the user to choose from. Only the packages
       included in the PPAs the machine knows about will be displayed. The description is taken from the package control file. This program is meant to be run from an XDG desktop file so that a dis‐
       tribution  can  add  an install selection to a sub-menu that is appropriate for that category.  ubuntustudio-installer is shipped with a menu item that will offer to install workflow software
       groups ( meta-packages ) from the UbuntuStudio flavour.

BUGS
       It could look prettier.
