NAME
       dh_installsysusers - install and integrates systemd sysusers files

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installsysusers [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installsysusers is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing package maintainer supplied systemd sysusers files.

       It also finds the systemd sysusers files installed in a package and generates relevant integration snippets for enabling the users on installation.  These snippets are added to the package by
       dh_installdeb(1).

FILES
       debian/package.sysusers
           If the file exist, it will be installed as /usr/lib/sysusers.d/package.conf.

OPTIONS
       --name=name
           When this parameter is used, dh_installsysusers looks for and installs files named debian/package.name.sysusers instead of the usual debian/package.sysusers.

           Furthermore, the file is installed as /usr/lib/sysusers.d/name.conf rather than /usr/lib/sysusers.d/package.conf.

NOTES
       This command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command (with the same arguments). Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
       maintainer scripts.
