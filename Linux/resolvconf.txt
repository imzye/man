INTERFACE-ORDER(5)                                                                               resolvconf                                                                              INTERFACE-ORDER(5)

NAME
       interface-order - resolvconf configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The  file  /etc/resolvconf/interface-order  is used to control the order in which resolvconf nameserver information records are processed by those resolvconf update scripts that consult this file.
       (The name of the file is apt because a resolvconf nameserver information record is named after the interface with which it is associated.)

       The file contains a sequence of shell glob patterns, one per line.  The position of a record in the order is the point at which its name first matches a pattern.

       Patterns may not contain whitespace, slashes or initial dots or tildes.  Blank lines and lines beginning with a '#' are ignored.

       Resolvconf update scripts in /etc/resolvconf/update.d/ that consult this file include the current default versions of dnsmasq, pdnsd and libc.  (Actually they don't read the  file  directly;  they
       call the utility program /usr/lib/resolvconf/list-records which lists records in the specified order and omits the names of empty records.)

EXAMPLE
       # /etc/resolvconf/interface-order
       # Use nameservers on the loopback interface first.
       lo*
       # Next use records for Ethernet interfaces
       eth*
       # Next use records for Wi-Fi interfaces
       wlan*
       # Next use records for PPP interfaces
       ppp*
       # Last use other interfaces
       *
