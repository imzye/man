NAME
       pads - Passive Asset Detection System

SYNOPSIS
       pads <DhUvV> <-c file > <-d file > <-g group > <-i interface > <-n network(s) > <-p file > <-r file > <-u file > <-w file > <expression>

DESCRIPTION
       PADS is a libpcap based detection engine used to passively detect network assets.  It is designed to complement IDS technology by providing context to IDS alerts.

       Goals:

       - Passive:  Records and identifies traffic seen on a network without
         actively "scanning" a system.   There will never be a packet sent from
         the pads application.

       - Portable:  Has the ability to be placed easily on a remote system.
         Does not require additional external libraries other than those
         associated with libpcap.

       - Lightweight:  Logging is sent to a simple CSV file.  There is no need
         for a database or other data repository installed on the local
         machine.  All correlation is done outside of the pads program.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help / usage information.

       -D     Run PADS in the background (daemon mode).

       -d file
              Dump  banner data into a libpcap formatted file.  This feature will dump the matched packet or the first 4 packets of an unmatched connection into a specified file.  This can be used to further
              identify a service and also aid with signature development.

              Please keep in mind that this feature must be compiled into the application in order to use it.  This can be done by adding ´--enable-banner-grab' to the 'configure' step.

       -g group
              This switch allows you to specify a group that PADS will drop to after the libpcap interface has been initialized.

       -h     Display help

       -i interface
              Specify an interface to be used.

       -n network list
              Specify  a  set  of  networks  to  be  monitored.   Only  assets  that  exist  within  these  networks  will  be  recorded.   The  networks  should  be  specified  in  the   following   format:
              10.10.10.0/24,192.168.0.0/16 .

       -p pid file
              This switch allows you to specify a PID file to be used in conjunction with daemon (-D) mode.

       -r file
              Read packets from a libpcap formatted file.

       -u user
              This switch allows you to specify a user that PADS will drop to after the libpcap interface has been initialized.

       -w file
              Dump data into a file other than assets.csv.

        expression
              selects which packets will be processed.  Please see  tcpdump(1) for details on the libpcap primitives.
