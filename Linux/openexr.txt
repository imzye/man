NAME
       exrmaketiled - for generating tiled and rip/mipmapped images.

SYNOPSIS
       exrmaketiled [options] infile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the exrmaketiled command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       exrmaketiled reads an OpenEXR image from infile, produces a tiled version of the image, and saves the result in outfile.

OPTIONS
       -o     produces a ONE_LEVEL image (default)

       -m     produces a MIPMAP_LEVELS multiresolution image

       -r     produces a RIPMAP_LEVELS multiresolution image

       -f c   when  a  MIPMAP_LEVELS or RIPMAP_LEVELS image is produced, image channel c will be resampled without low-pass filtering. This option can be specified multiple times to disable low-pass fil‐
              tering for multiple channels.

       -t x y sets the tile size in the output image to x by y pixels (default is 64 by 64)

       -d     sets level size rounding to ROUND_DOWN (default)

       -u     sets level size rounding to ROUND_UP

       -z x   sets the data compression method to x (none/rle/zip/piz/pxr24, default is zip)

       -v     verbose mode

       -h     prints these options
