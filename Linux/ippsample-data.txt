NAME
       ipptransform3d - convert 3d document data to alternate formats

SYNOPSIS
       ipptransform3d [ --help ] [ -d device-uri ] [ -i input/format ] [ -m output/format;machine=name ] [ -o name=value [... name=value] ] [ -v ] filename

DESCRIPTION
       ipptransform3d  converts  the  input file into the output format and optionally sends the output to a USB (serial) printer.  ipptransform3d is normally run by ippserver(8) to convert document
       data for printing.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by ipptransform3d:

       --help
            Shows program help.

       -d device-uri
            Specifies an output device as a URI.  Currently only the "usbserial" URI scheme is supported, for example "usbserial:///dev/ttyACM0" to send print data to  an  attached  USB  printer  on
            Linux.

       -i input/format
            Specifies the MIME media type of the input file.  Currently the "model/3mf" (3MF) and "application/sla" (STL) MIME media types are supported.

       -m output/format;machine=name
            Specifies  the  MIME media type of the output file.  Currently only the "application/g-code" (G-code) MIME media type is supported.  The "machine=name" parameter specifies a machine-spe‐
            cific variant such as "ultimaker2".

       -o "name=value[...name=value]"
            Specifies one or more named options for the conversion.  Currently the "materials-col", "platform-temperature", "print-accuracy", "print-base", "print-quality", and "print-supports"  op‐
            tions are supported.  See the NAMED OPTIONS section for more information.

       -v   Increases the verbosity for any diagnostics.

NAMED OPTIONS
       The following named options are supported:

       materials-col
            Specifies  the  material(s)  to  use.   Each  value  is  surrounded  by curley braces and contains a list of material properties and their values, e.g., '{material-diameter=285 material-
            type="pla" ...}'.  The "material-diameter", "material-fill-density", "material-purpose", "material-rate", "material-rate-units", "material-shell-thickness",  "material-temperature",  and
            "material-type" properties are supported.

       platform-temperature
            Specifies the temperature of the build platform in degrees Celsius.

       print-accuracy
            Specifies  the  dimensional  accuracy  requirements for the print.  For example, a horizontal accuracy of 0.1mm and vertical accuracy of 0.05mm is '{x-accuracy=100 y-accuracy=100 z-accu‐
            racy=50 accuracy-units=um}'.

       print-base
            Specifies whether brims, rafts, or skirts should be printed.  The values 'none', 'brim', 'raft', and 'skirt' are supported.

       print-quality
            Specifies the print quality with value 3 (draft), 4 (normal), or 5 (high/best).

       print-supports
            Specifies whether supports are printed.  The values 'none', 'material', and 'standard' are supported.

DIAGNOSTICS
       ipptransform3d sends all messages to the standard error.  Each message is prefixed with "ERROR", "INFO", or "DEBUG" depending on the level of verbosity.

EXIT STATUS
       The ipptransform3d program returns 0 if the input file is converted successfully and 1 otherwise.

ENVIRONMENT
       ipptransform3d recognizes the following environment variables:

       CONTENT_TYPE
            Specifies the MIME media type of the input file.

       DEVICE_URI
            Specifies the output device as a URI.

       DOCUMENT_NAME
            Specifies the title of the input file.

       IPP_xxx
            Specifies the value of the "xxx" Job Template attribute, where "xxx" is converted to uppercase.  For example, the "materials-col" Job Template attribute is  stored  as  the  "IPP_MATERI‐
            ALS_COL" environment variable.

       IPP_xxx_DEFAULT
            Specifies the default value of the corresponding "xxx-default" Printer Description attribute, where "xxx" is converted to uppercase.  For example, the "materials-col-default" Printer De‐
            scription attribute is stored as the "IPP_MATERIALS_COL_DEFAULT" environment variable.

       OUTPUT_TYPE
            Specifies the MIME media type of the output file.  For 'application/g-code' the "flavor" media type parameter specifies the variant of  G-code  to  produce:  'bfb',  'griffin',  'mach3',
            'makerbot', 'reprap' (default), 'reprap-volumatric', and 'ultimaker' are currently supported.

       SERVER_LOGLEVEL
            Specifies the log level (verbosity) as "error", "info", or "debug".

EXAMPLES
       Print a 3MF file to a G-code printer connected via USB on Linux using the default options:

           ipptransform3d -d usbserial:///dev/usbACM0 -m application/g-code \
               filename.3mf
