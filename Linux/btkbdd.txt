BTKBDD(1)                 System management commands                 BTKBDD(1)

NAME
       btkbdd - Bluetooth Keyboard Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       btkbdd [-s addr] [-t addr] [-c file] [-d] device

DESCRIPTION
       This tool starts a Bluetooth HID Keyboard service, serving keystrokes
       obtained via Linux Input subsystem's event device (evdev).  In
       practical terms, it turns your Linux box with a physical keyboard into
       a Bluetooth keyboard, which can be used by various Bluetooth HID
       capable devices, including desktop or tablet computers, smart phones,
       game consoles and so on.

       It implements most of the important HID protocol features, including
       robust connection restores (virtual cabling) and report protocol (as
       required by Apple's Darwin-based devices). It is possible and
       encouraged to use the tool from udev, starting it when event devices
       appear after a keyboard is plugged in.

OPTIONS
       -s addr
           Accept connections on given Bluetooth address. Useful when your
           computer has multiple Bluetooth Host Controller Interfaces (HCI).

           Class of this device is changed into keyboard while the program is
           running and restored upon termination.

           Defaults to accepting connections on any interface, while changing
           the class only of the first interface hci0, which is a sane default
           for computers with a single HCI.

       -t addr
           Attempt connecting to given address upon key press, if no
           connection has been estabilished yet. This can be used to
           effectively "hardwire" the keyboard to a given host.

           Once an incoming connection is estabilished and terminated, btkbdd
           always tries to restore it upon a key press event.

       -c file
           Save the last connected remote address into given file upon
           termination and restore it on startup.

           Use this option if you want to remember last connected device
           between btkbdd runs.

       -d  Become a daemon.  Give up controlling terminal, open file
           descriptors and double-fork to escape parent process control.

           While breaking process hierarchy has certain disadvantages and is
           deprecated with modern service control daemons such as systemd(8)),
           it is necessary to do so with udevd(8), otherwise btkbdd would
           block the whole worker process.

       device
           Linux input subsystem event device to use as source for key
           presses.

EXAMPLES
       Use with udev(7) and systemd(1) is recommended. Look into
       90-btkbdd.rules and btkbdd@.service files distributed with btkbdd for
       examples.

       btkbdd /dev/input/event8
           Most basic usage -- just open a keyboard device and listen for
           incoming connections.  When in doubt about which physical device
           corresponds to an event device node, use "udevadm info
           --attribute-walk --name=file" to identify the device and its
           connection details.

       btkbdd /dev/input/event8 -s EC:55:F9:EF:12:34 -c
       /var/lib/btkbdd/keyboard.cable
           Only accept connections on given HCI and remember the connected
           device.  You can discover your HCI device addresses with "hcitool
           dev" command.

       btkbdd /dev/input/event8 -t EC:55:F9:EF:56:78
           Initiate a connection to given Bluetooth host.  You can discover
           available devices with "hcitool scan".

BUGS
       Bluez bluetoothd(8) daemon is likely to listen for HID events. For
       btkbdd to accept connection you need to disable the Bluez input plugin
       by setting "DisablePlugins = input" in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf.

       Nothing but errors is logged and when in daemon mode even the error
       output is lost. Attach strace(1) or launch btkbdd manually to
       troubleshoot errors.

       Only a common 101-key keyboard is supported.

       To estabilish pairing with iPad, iPod Touch or iPhone, connection must
       be initiated and authenticated via bluetooth-applet(1) before starting
       btkbdd. Otherwise the device will initiate a PIN-based authentication
       that is not supported. Once trust is estabilished, connections will
       work without a need for any other hassle.
