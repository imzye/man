BPQPARMS(8)              Linux System Managers Manual              BPQPARMS(8)

NAME
       bpqparms - Configure BPQ ethernet devices.

SYNOPSIS
       bpqparms device [-a ethaddr] [-d ethaddr] [-vV]

DESCRIPTION
       Bpqparms  allows the setting of the BPQ Ethernet options for a particu‐
       lar device.  Each  BPQ  Ethernet  device  appears  as  a  device  named
       bpq0...bpqN  which  overlays  the  original  Ethernet  device,  usually
       eth0...ethN. This device is an AX.25 device  driver  and  allows  AX.25
       frames  to be transmitted over an Ethernet to another machine using the
       same protocol. The default for the device is to send  and  receive  BPQ
       Ethernet  packets  to  the broadcast address. This program replaces the
       previous “axparms -dev” option.

OPTIONS
       -a ethaddr     Allows the setting of which ethernet address will be ac‐
                      cepted by the BPQ Ethernet device.

       -d ethaddr     If specified on its own, will set the destination ether‐
                      net address will be used for transmitting  and  for  re‐
                      ceiving  of  BPQ ethernet packets. An address of “broad‐
                      cast” sets it to the ethernet broadcast address.

       -v             Displays the version number.

       -V             The original version messages.
