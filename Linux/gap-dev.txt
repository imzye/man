NAME
       GAC - The GAP Compiler

SYNOPSIS
          gac [-c|-d] [-o <output>] {-f<option>} <input>...

DESCRIPTION
       GAC  compiles the input files.   Input files  must be GAP  source code (suffix '.g' or '.gap'),  C source code (suffix '.c'),  or compiled  code files (suffix '.o').

       -c     Compiles the input files to statically loadable object files, which must be linked together to a new kernel.

       -d     Compiles the input files to dynamically loadable object files, which can be loaded by a kernel at runtime.

       -C     Only compiles the input files to C code, which will require compilation and linking to be usable.

       -r     Statically compiled files will be assumed to be given by pathnames relative to the GAP root, and will be compiled for automatic loading when files are sought relative to the GAP root.

       -o <output>
              Name the output file <output>.

       -save-temps
              Tells 'gac' to not delete any intermediate files

       -p <option>
              Pass the option  <option> to  the C compiler.

       -P <option>
              Pass the option  <option> to  the C linker.

       -L <option>
              Tells 'gac' to pass the option  <option> to the C linker when linking dynamic modules. Contrary to -P the option is appended at the end of the link command after the .o files to link.
