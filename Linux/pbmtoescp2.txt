NAME
       pbmtoescp2 - convert a PBM image to a ESC/P2 printer file

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoescp2

       [-compress=compressionmode]                 [-resolution={180|360|720}]
       [-stripeheight=n] [-formfeed] [-raw] [pbmfile]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest  unique  prefix.   You
       may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may use
       either white space or equals signs  between  an  option  name  and  its
       value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtoescp2  reads  a  PBM image as input.  It produces an ESC/P2 raster
       graphic printer control stream as output.

        This program creates an output that is  printable  on  Epson  printers
       that  understand  the  ESC/P2 printer control language (e.g. the Stylus
       models).  For older Epson 9-pin dot  matrix  printers,  which  use  the
       ESC/P protocol, see pbmtoepson.

       The  printed  output  has  one pixel for each pixel of the input image,
       except that it is padded up  to  the  stripe  size  (see  -stripeheight
       option) vertically and to a multiple of 8 columns horizontally.  Before
       Netpbm 10.72 (September 2015), the output is instead truncated to those
       boundaries.

OPTIONS
       Input  is  read  from  file pbmfile if specified, otherwise from stdin.
       Output is written to stdout.

       -compress=compressionmode
              This determines the compression mode that pbmtoescp2 uses in its
              output.   Valid  values  for compressionmode are 0 and 1.  -com‐
              press=0 results in a printer control  stream  with  uncompressed
              raster  graphic  data.  -compress=1 results in a printer control
              stream with RLE compressed raster graphic data  (RLE  means  Run
              Length Encoding).  The default is -compress=1.

       -resolution=dpi
              This determines the horizontal and the vertical print resolution
              set in the printer control stream.  Another way of looking at it
              is  a  declaration  of what the resolution of the input image is
              (PBM images don't have inherent resolution).  Valid  values  for
              dpi  are 180, 360, and 720.  See hints ⟨#hints⟩  for more infor‐
              mation on this.

              The default is -resolution=360.

              Before Netpbm 10.72 (September 2015), 720 is not valid.

       -stripeheight=n
              This option controls the height in lines of the stripes  in  the
              output.

              The  valid  stripe heights in the printer language are 1, 8, and
              24, but it is capable of expressing any height  up  to  255  and
              pbmtoescp2  accepts  any  value in the range 1-255.  It issues a
              warning, though, if you choose something other than 1, 8, or 24.

              The default is 24.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.72  (September  2015).   Before
              that, the stripe size is always 24.

       -formfeed
              This option causes pbmtoescp2 to place a formfeed command at the
              end of the output.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.72 (September 2015).

       -raw   This option causes pbmtoescp2 to generate only the data  blocks.
              It  does not generate printer commands to set up the output (for
              example, setting the line spacing).

              You can use this to insert graphics into a larger  printer  com‐
              mand stream.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.72 (September 2015).

HINTS
       RLE  compresses very well bitmaps of line drawings, preferably horizon‐
       tal oriented contents like texts, sheets of music, etc.  However,  bit‐
       maps derived from photographs are not ideal for RLE.  In extreme cases,
       when no byte repetitions occur in the input, the result  will  be  even
       slightly  bigger than the input.  To avoid this, use compression mode 0
       to switch off RLE.

       Each pixel in the input PBM image becomes one dot in the  printed  out‐
       put.   Therefore,  you must make sure the width and height of the input
       are appropriate for the print resolution you choose and the print  area
       you  want.  E.g. if you print at 180 dpi and want the image to print as
       8 inches by 10, you must supply a PBM that is 1440 pixels wide by  1800
       pixels  high.  You can adjust the size of the input with pamscale, pam‐
       stretch, pbmreduce, or pamenlarge.

HISTORY
       pbmtoescp2  was  added to Netpbm in Release 10.18 (August 2003); it was
       created around the same time.
