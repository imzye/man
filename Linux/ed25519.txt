   NAME
       ed25519-cli - command-line interface for the lib25519 implementation of the Ed25519 signature system

   SYNOPSIS
       Key generation:

              ed25519-keypair 5>publickey 9>secretkey

       Signature generation:

              ed25519-sign 8<secretkey <message >signedmessage

       Signature verification and message recovery:

              ed25519-open 4<publickey <signedmessage >message

   DESCRIPTION
       lib25519  is  an  implementation  of  the X25519 encryption system and the Ed25519 signature system.  The command-line interface for lib25519 provides three Ed25519 tools, documented here, and two
       X25519 tools, documented separately.

       Each tool exits nonzero on failure (e.g., running out of memory), 0 on success.

       These tools allow lib25519 to be easily used from shell scripts.  Other languages can also use lib25519 via these tools, but languages typically have good support for FFI and can use the C  inter‐
       face directly.

   KEY GENERATION
       Alice  runs  the  ed25519-keypair command.  This command randomly generates Alice’s secret key and Alice’s corresponding public key.  It writes the public key to file descriptor 5, and then writes
       the secret key to file descriptor 9.

   SIGNATURE GENERATION
       Alice runs the ed25519-sign command.  This command reads Alice’s secret key from file descriptor 8.  It then reads a message (into memory) from standard input (file descriptor 0).   It  signs  the
       message using Alice’s secret key, and then writes the signed message to standard output (file descriptor 1).

   SIGNATURE VERIFICATION AND MESSAGE RECOVERY
       Bob  runs  the ed25519-open command.  This command reads Alice’s public key from file descriptor 4.  It then reads a signed message (into memory) from standard input (file descriptor 0).  It veri‐
       fies the signed message using Alice’s public key, and then writes the verified message to standard output (file descriptor 1).

       For ed25519-open, exit code 100 specifically indicates an invalid signature; retrying on the same input will then always fail.  In this case, ed25519-open produces an empty output.
