NAME
       dbus-test-runner - run multiple tasks under an independent DBus session bus

SYNOPSIS
       dbus-test-runner [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       dbus-test-runner is a simple little executable for running a couple of programs under a new DBus session.

       Use this DBus tool for unit testing of code that accesses DBus at runtime.

HELP OPTIONS
       dbus-test-runner accepts the following help options on the command line:

       -h, --help
              Display a short help text with application and help command line options and exit.

       --help-all
              Display the full list of available command line options (help, task control, application) and exit.

       --help-task-control
              Display options that are used to control how the task is handled by the test runner.

TASK CONTROL OPTIONS
       dbus-test-runner accepts the following task control options on the command line:

       -t, --task=<executable>
              Defines a new task to run under our private DBus session.

       -n, --task-name=<name>
              A string to label output from the previously defined task.  Defaults to taskN.

       --task-bus={session|system|both}
              Configures which bus the task expects to connect to. Default: both

       -r, --ignore-return
              Do not use the return value of the task to calculate whether the test passes or fails.
                   eturn
       -i, --invert
              Invert the return value of the task before calculating whether the test passes or fails.

       -p, --parameter
              Add a parameter to the call of this utility.  May be called as many times as you'd like.

       -f, --wait-for=<dbus-name>
              A dbus-name that should appear on the bus before this task is started

       -c, --wait-until-complete
              Signal that we should wait until this task exits even if we don't need the return value

APPLICATION OPTIONS
       dbus-test-runner accepts the following application options on the command line:

       --dbus-daemon=<executable>
              Path to the DBus daemon to use.  Defaults to 'dbus-daemon'.

       -d, --dbus-config=<config_file>
              Configuration file for newly created DBus server.  Defaults to '/usr/share/dbus-test-runner/session.conf'.

       --bustle-monitor=<executable>
              Path to the Bustle DBus Monitor to use.  Defaults to 'bustle-dbus-monitor'.

       -b, --bustle-data=<data_file>
              A file to write out data from the bustle logger to.

       -m, --max-wait=<seconds>
              The maximum amount of time the test runner will wait for the test to complete.  Default is 60 seconds.

       --keep-env
              Whether to propagate the execution environment to the dbus-server and all the services activated by it.  By default the environment is cleared.

       --bus-type={session|system|both}
              Configures which buses are represented by the tool to the tasks. Default: session
