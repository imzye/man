NAME
       clean-crl - remove orphaned CRL like files from a certificate directory

SYNOPSIS
       clean-crl [-l crlpath] [-v] [-V] [-n] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       The  clean-crl utility will remove CRL like files named hash.rn from the directory specified with the -l option if there is no corresponding .n file in the same.  In effect, if the directory is solely
       used to hold CA certificates in the common OpenSSL format, it will thus remove CRL files for which the corresponding CA does  not or no longer exists in the directory.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Show help text.

       -l --cadir metadata-directory
              The script will search this directory for files with the suffix .ri.  There is no default - a common choice is /etc/pki/tls/certs, /etc/openldap/cacerts, or /etc/grid-security/certificates.

       -V --version
              Display version number (same as corresponding fetch-crl)

       -v --verbose
              Verbose mode

       -n --dryrun
              Do not actually remove any files (useful primarily with -v)

CONFIGURATION
       None.

NOTES
       This tool does not check the contents of the files removed, and will blindly unlink any file which even remotely looks like an OpenSSL CRL file. Use with extreme caution.

DIAGNOSTICS
