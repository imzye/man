NAME
       IO::HTML - Open an HTML file with automatic charset detection

VERSION
       This document describes version 1.004 of IO::HTML, released September 26, 2020.

SYNOPSIS
         use IO::HTML;                 # exports html_file by default
         use HTML::TreeBuilder;

         my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder->new_from_file(
                      html_file('foo.html')
                    );

         # Alternative interface:
         open(my $in, '<:raw', 'bar.html');
         my $encoding = IO::HTML::sniff_encoding($in, 'bar.html');

DESCRIPTION
       IO::HTML provides an easy way to open a file containing HTML while automatically determining its encoding.  It uses the HTML5 encoding sniffing algorithm specified in section 8.2.2.2 of the draft
       standard.

       The algorithm as implemented here is:

       1.  If the file begins with a byte order mark indicating UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, or UTF-8, then that is the encoding.

       2.  If the first $bytes_to_check bytes of the file contain a "<meta>" tag that indicates the charset, and Encode recognizes the specified charset name, then that is the encoding.  (This portion of
           the algorithm is implemented by "find_charset_in".)

           The "<meta>" tag can be in one of two formats:

             <meta charset="...">
             <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="...charset=...">

           The  search is case-insensitive, and the order of attributes within the tag is irrelevant.  Any additional attributes of the tag are ignored.  The first matching tag with a recognized encoding
           ends the search.

       3.  If the first $bytes_to_check bytes of the file are valid UTF-8 (with at least 1 non-ASCII character), then the encoding is UTF-8.

       4.  If all else fails, use the default character encoding.  The HTML5 standard suggests the default encoding should be locale dependent,  but  currently  it  is  always  "cp1252"  unless  you  set
           $IO::HTML::default_encoding to a different value.  Note: "sniff_encoding" does not apply this step; only "html_file" does that.

SUBROUTINES
   html_file
         $filehandle = html_file($filename, \%options);

       This  function (exported by default) is the primary entry point.  It opens the file specified by $filename for reading, uses "sniff_encoding" to find a suitable encoding layer, and applies it.  It
       also applies the ":crlf" layer.  If the file begins with a BOM, the filehandle is positioned just after the BOM.

       The optional second argument is a hashref containing options.  The possible keys are described under "find_charset_in".

       If "sniff_encoding" is unable to determine the encoding, it defaults to $IO::HTML::default_encoding, which is set to "cp1252" (a.k.a. Windows-1252) by default.   According  to  the  standard,  the
       default should be locale dependent, but that is not currently implemented.

       It dies if the file cannot be opened, or if "sniff_encoding" cannot determine the encoding and $IO::HTML::default_encoding has been set to "undef".

   html_file_and_encoding
         ($filehandle, $encoding, $bom)
           = html_file_and_encoding($filename, \%options);

       This  function  (exported  only  by request) is just like "html_file", but returns more information.  In addition to the filehandle, it returns the name of the encoding used, and a flag indicating
       whether a byte order mark was found (if $bom is true, the file began with a BOM).  This may be useful if you want to write the file out again (especially in  conjunction  with  the  "html_outfile"
       function).

       The optional second argument is a hashref containing options.  The possible keys are described under "find_charset_in".

       It dies if the file cannot be opened, or if "sniff_encoding" cannot determine the encoding and $IO::HTML::default_encoding has been set to "undef".

       The result of calling "html_file_and_encoding" in scalar context is undefined (in the C sense of there is no guarantee what you'll get).

   html_outfile
         $filehandle = html_outfile($filename, $encoding, $bom);

       This  function  (exported only by request) opens $filename for output using $encoding, and writes a BOM to it if $bom is true.  If $encoding is "undef", it defaults to $IO::HTML::default_encoding.
       $encoding may be either an encoding name or an Encode::Encoding object.

       It dies if the file cannot be opened, or if both $encoding and $IO::HTML::default_encoding are "undef".

   sniff_encoding
         ($encoding, $bom) = sniff_encoding($filehandle, $filename, \%options);

       This function (exported only by request) runs the HTML5 encoding sniffing algorithm on $filehandle (which must be seekable, and should have been opened in ":raw" mode).  $filename is used only for
       error messages (if there's a problem using the filehandle), and defaults to "file" if omitted.  The optional third argument is a hashref containing options.  The possible keys are described  under
       "find_charset_in".

       It  returns  Perl's  canonical name for the encoding, which is not necessarily the same as the MIME or IANA charset name.  It returns "undef" if the encoding cannot be determined.  $bom is true if
       the file began with a byte order mark.  In scalar context, it returns only $encoding.

       The filehandle's position is restored to its original position (normally the beginning of the file) unless $bom is true.  In that case, the position is immediately after the BOM.

       Tip: If you want to run "sniff_encoding" on a file you've already loaded into a string, open an in-memory file on the string, and pass that handle:

         ($encoding, $bom) = do {
           open(my $fh, '<', \$string);  sniff_encoding($fh)
         };

       (This only makes sense if $string contains bytes, not characters.)

   find_charset_in
         $encoding = find_charset_in($string_containing_HTML, \%options);

       This function (exported only by request) looks for charset information in a "<meta>" tag in a possibly-incomplete HTML document using the "two step" algorithm specified by HTML5.  It does not look
       for a BOM.  The "<meta>" tag must begin within the first $IO::HTML::bytes_to_check bytes of the string.

       It returns Perl's canonical name for the encoding, which is not necessarily the same as the MIME or IANA charset name.  It returns "undef" if no charset is specified or if the specified charset is
       not recognized by the Encode module.

       The optional second argument is a hashref containing options.  The following keys are recognized:

       "encoding"
           If true, return the Encode::Encoding object instead of its name.  Defaults to false.

       "need_pragma"
           If true (the default), follow the HTML5 spec and examine the "content" attribute only of "<meta http-equiv="Content-Type"".  If set to 0, relax the HTML5 spec, and look for "charset="  in  the
           "content" attribute of every meta tag.

EXPORTS
       By default, only "html_file" is exported.  Other functions may be exported on request.

       For   people   who  prefer  not  to  export  functions,  all  functions  beginning  with  "html_"  have  an  alias  without  that  prefix  (e.g.  you  can  call  "IO::HTML::file(...)"  instead  of
       "IO::HTML::html_file(...)".  These aliases are not exportable.

       The following export tags are available:

       ":all"
           All exportable functions.

       ":rw"
           "html_file", "html_file_and_encoding", "html_outfile".

SEE ALSO
       The HTML5 specification, section 8.2.2.2 Determining the character encoding: <http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#determining-the-character-encoding>

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Could not read %s: %s"
           The specified file could not be read from for the reason specified by $!.

       "Could not seek %s: %s"
           The specified file could not be rewound for the reason specified by $!.

       "Failed to open %s: %s"
           The specified file could not be opened for reading for the reason specified by $!.

       "No default encoding specified"
           The "sniff_encoding" algorithm didn't find an encoding to use, and you set $IO::HTML::default_encoding to "undef".

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       There are two global variables that affect IO::HTML.  If you need to change them, you should do so using "local" if possible:

         my $file = do {
           # This file may define the charset later in the header
           local $IO::HTML::bytes_to_check = 4096;
           html_file(...);
         };

       $bytes_to_check
           This is the number of bytes that "sniff_encoding" will read from the stream.  It is also the number of  bytes  that  "find_charset_in"  will  search  for  a  "<meta>"  tag  containing  charset
           information.  It must be a positive integer.

           The HTML 5 specification recommends using the default value of 1024, but some pages do not follow the specification.

       $default_encoding
           This is the encoding that "html_file" and "html_file_and_encoding" will use if no encoding can be detected by "sniff_encoding".  The default value is "cp1252" (a.k.a. Windows-1252).

           Setting it to "undef" will cause the file subroutines to croak if "sniff_encoding" fails to determine the encoding.  ("sniff_encoding" itself does not use $default_encoding).

DEPENDENCIES
       IO::HTML  has  no  non-core  dependencies for Perl 5.8.7+.  With earlier versions of Perl 5.8, you need to upgrade Encode to at least version 2.10, and you may need to upgrade Exporter to at least
       version 5.57.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       No bugs have been reported.
