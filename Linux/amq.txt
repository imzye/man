AMQ(8)                      System Manager's Manual                     AMQ(8)

NAME
       amq - automounter query tool

SYNOPSIS
       amq [ -fimpqsvwHTU ] [ -h hostname ] [ -l log_file ] [ -x log_options ]
       [ -D debug_options ] [ -P program_number ] [[ -u ] directory ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Amq provides a simple way of determining the current state of amd  pro‐
       gram.  Communication is by RPC.  Three modes of operation are supported
       by the current protocol.  By default a list of mount points  and  auto-
       mounted  filesystems  is  output.  An alternative host can be specified
       using the -h option.

       If directory names are given, as output by default, then per-filesystem
       information is displayed.

OPTIONS
       -f     Ask  the automounter to flush the internal caches and reload all
              the maps.

       -h hostname
              Specify an alternate host to query.  By default the  local  host
              is used.  In an HP-UX cluster, the root server is queried by de‐
              fault, since that is the system on which the automounter is nor‐
              mally run.

       -i     Print information about the mount maps.

       -l log_file
              Tell  amd  to  use  log_file as the log file name.  For security
              reasons, this must be the same log  file  which  amd  used  when
              started.   This option is therefore only useful to refresh amd's
              open file handle on the log file, so that it can be rotated  and
              compressed via daily cron jobs.

       -m     Ask  the  automounter  to provide a list of mounted filesystems,
              including the number of references to each  filesystem  and  any
              error which occurred while mounting.

       -p     Return  the  process  ID  of  the remote or locally running amd.
              Useful when you need to send a signal to the local amd  process,
              and  would  rather not have to search through the process table.
              This option is used in the ctl-amd script.

       -q     Suppress error messages produced when attempting synchronous un‐
              mounts with the -u option.

       -s     Ask the automounter to provide system-wide mount statistics.

       -u     Ask  the  automounter to unmount the filesystems named in direc‐
              tory instead of providing information about them.  Unmounts  are
              requested, not forced.  They merely cause the mounted filesystem
              to timeout, which will be picked up by amd's main scheduler thus
              causing the normal timeout action to be taken.  If the -u option
              is repeated, amq will attempt to unmount the  file  system  syn‐
              chronously  by waiting until the timeout action is taken and re‐
              turning an error if the unmount fails.  Any error messages  pro‐
              duced may be suppressed with the -q option.

       -v     Ask the automounter for its version information.  This is a sub‐
              set of the information output by amd's -v option.

       -w     Translate a full pathname as returned by getcwd(3) into a  short
              Amd  pathname  that goes through its mount points.   This option
              requires that Amd is running.

       -x log_options
              Ask the automounter to use  the  logging  options  specified  in
              log_options  from now on.  Note that the "fatal" and "error" op‐
              tions cannot be turned off.

       -D debug_options
              Ask the automounter to use the debugging  options  specified  in
              debug_options from now on.

       -H     Display short usage message.

       -P program_number
              Contact an alternate running amd that had registered itself on a
              different RPC program_number and apply all other  operations  to
              that  instance  of the automounter.  This is useful when you run
              multiple copies of amd, and need to manage each one  separately.
              If  not  specified,  amq will use the default program number for
              amd, 300019.  For security reasons, the only  alternate  program
              numbers amd can use range from 300019 to 300029, inclusive.

       -T     Contact amd using the TCP transport only.  Normally amq will try
              TCP, and if that failed, will try UDP.

       -U     Contact amd using UDP (connectionless) transport only.  Normally
              amq will try TCP, and if that failed, will try UDP.

CAVEATS
       Amq uses a Sun registered RPC program number (300019 decimal) which may
       not be in the /etc/rpc database.

       If the TCP wrappers  library  is  available,  and  the  use_tcpwrappers
       global amd.conf option is set to ``yes'', then amd will verify that the
       host running amq is authorized to connect.  The amd service  name  must
       used  in  the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files.  For example,
       to  allow  only  localhost  to  connect  to  amd,  add  this  line   to
       /etc/hosts.allow:

              amd: localhost

       and this line to /etc/hosts.deny:

              amd: ALL
