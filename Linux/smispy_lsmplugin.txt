NAME
       smispy_lsmplugin -- LibstorageMgmt SMI-S Plugin

DESCRIPTION
       LibstorageMgmt  SMI-S Plugin allows LibstorageMgmt user to manage stor‐
       age arrays like: EMC VNX/VMAX, HDS AMS and LSI MegaRAID etc.  via  SNIA
       SMI-S  standard. The 'smispy_lsmplugin' executable file is for Libstor‐
       ageMgmt daemon to execute when client user requests SMI-S plugin.

URI
       To use this plugin, users should set their URI to this format:

           # HTTP connection
           smispy://<username>@<smis_provder_host>:<port>?<uri_parameters>

           # HTTPS connection
           smispy+ssl://<username>@<smis_provder_host>:<port>?<uri_parameters>

       username

              The username is the SMI-S provider user account.

       smis_provder_host

              The smis_provder_host is the SMI-S provider's IP address or  DNS
              name.

       port

              By  default, SMI-S plugin will use port 5988 for HTTP connection
              and port 5989 for HTTPS connection. You can skip this in URI  if
              your SMI-S provider is using default ports.

              For  non-default  ports,  SELinux  will likely prevent the SMI-S
              plugin from making a network connection.

       URI parameters
              These URI parameters are supported by this plugin:

              namespace=<name_space>
                     This URI parameter is for  LSI  MegaRAID  and  NetApp  E-
                     Series only.

              system=<system_id>
                     For   those  SMI-S  providers  which  support  multi-sys‐
                     tems(Example EMC ECIM), this URI parameter can be used to
                     limit  network  communication  for specified system only.
                     The system_id is the ID of the system:
                      * lsm.System.id              (Python API)
                      * lsm_system_id_get()        (C API)
                      * lsmcli list --systems      (lsmcli command line)

              no_ssl_verify=yes
                     This URI parameter is for HTTPS  connections  only.  With
                     this  URI  parameter,  the SMI-S plugin will not validate
                     SMI-S provider's server SSL certificate.  It's often used
                     for  self-signed  CA  environment, but it's strongly sug‐
                     gested to remove this URI  parameter  and  install  self-
                     signed CA properly.

Supported Hardware
       The  LibstorageMgmt  SMI-S  plugin is based on 'Block Services Package'
       profile , SNIA SMI-S 1.4 or later. Any storage system which  implements
       that  profile  may be supported. Detailed support status can be queried
       via:

        * lsm.Client.capabilities()  (Python API)
        * lsm_capabilities()         (C API)
        * lsmcli capabilities        (lsmcli command line).

FIREWALL RULES
       By default, this plugin requires access to  the  SMI-S  provider's  TCP
       5988 port for HTTP conenction and TCP 5989 port for HTTPS connection.
