NAME
       vlock-plugins - plugin support for vlock

DESCRIPTION
       If  vlock-main(8)  is  compiled  with  plugin support its default features are very limited: it can only lock the current session and ask for authenticiaton.  However it is possible to extend this
       functions through plugins.  These plugins are loaded when vlock-main starts and can provide hooks that are called at certain points during the lifetime of the vlock-main process.

DEFAULT PLUGINS
       The following plugins are provided when installing vlock with default options:

       all

              This plugin locks all sessions by disabling console switching.  It is also loaded when giving the -a,--all option to vlock(1).

       nosysrq

              Linux only.  This plugin disables the Linux SysRQ mechanism before the console switching is locked by the "all" plugin.  It is also loaded  when  giving  the  -s,--disable-sysrq  option  to
              vlock(1).

ADDITIONAL PLUGINS
       The following plugins are only available if explicitly selected at build time:

       caca

              This plugin runs a random libcaca screensaver when the screen is locked.

WRITING PLUGINS
       For information about writing plugins see the PLUGINS file in the vlock source distribution.
