NAME
       Config::Model::models::Ssh - Configuration class Ssh

DESCRIPTION
       Configuration classes used by Config::Model

       This configuration class was generated from ssh_system documentation.  by parse-man.pl <https://github.com/dod38fr/config-model-openssh/contrib/parse-man.pl>

Elements
   Host
       Restricts the following declarations (up to the next Host or Match keyword) to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns given after the keyword. If more than one pattern is provided,
       they should be separated by whitespace. A single '*' as a pattern can be used to provide global defaults for all hosts. The host is usually the hostname argument given on the command line (see the
       CanonicalizeHostname keyword for exceptions).

       A pattern entry may be negated by prefixing it with an exclamation mark ('!' ) If a negated entry is matched, then the Host entry is ignored, regardless of whether any other patterns on the line
       match. Negated matches are therefore useful to provide exceptions for wildcard matches.

       See PATTERNS for more information on patterns.  Optional. Type hash of node of class Ssh::HostElement .

   AddKeysToAgent
       Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running ssh-agent1.  If this option is set to yes and a key is loaded from a file, the key and its passphrase are added to the agent with
       the default lifetime, as if by ssh-add1. If this option is set to ask ssh(1) will require confirmation using the SSH_ASKPASS program before adding a key (see ssh-add1 for details). If this option
       is set to confirm each use of the key must be confirmed, as if the -c option was specified to ssh-add1. If this option is set to no no keys are added to the agent. Alternately, this option may be
       specified as a time interval using the format described in the TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config5 to specify the key's lifetime in ssh-agent1, after which it will automatically be removed. The
       argument must be no (the default), yes confirm (optionally followed by a time interval), ask or a time interval.  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'ask', 'confirm', 'no', 'yes'.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   AddressFamily
       Specifies which address family to use when connecting. Valid arguments are any (the default), inet (use IPv4 only), or inet6 (use IPv6 only).  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'any', 'inet', 'inet6'.

       upstream_default value :
           any

   BatchMode
       If  set  to  yes  user  interaction  such as password prompts and host key confirmation requests will be disabled. In addition, the ServerAliveInterval option will be set to 300 seconds by default
       (Debian-specific). This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where no user is present to interact with ssh(1), and where it is desirable  to  detect  a  broken  network  swiftly.   The
       argument must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   BindAddress
       Use the specified address on the local machine as the source address of the connection. Only useful on systems with more than one address.  Optional. Type uniline.

   BindInterface
       Use the address of the specified interface on the local machine as the source address of the connection.  Optional. Type uniline.

   CanonicalDomains
       When CanonicalizeHostname is enabled, this option specifies the list of domain suffixes in which to search for the specified destination host.  Optional. Type uniline.

   CanonicalizeFallbackLocal
       Specifies  whether  to fail with an error when hostname canonicalization fails.  The default, yes will attempt to look up the unqualified hostname using the system resolver's search rules. A value
       of no will cause ssh(1) to fail instantly if CanonicalizeHostname is enabled and the target hostname cannot be found in any of the domains specified by CanonicalDomains  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   CanonicalizeHostname
       Controls whether explicit hostname canonicalization is performed. The default, no is not to perform any name rewriting and let the system resolver handle all hostname lookups. If set to yes  then,
       for  connections  that  do  not  use  a  ProxyCommand  or  ProxyJump  ssh(1)  will  attempt  to  canonicalize  the  hostname  specified  on the command line using the CanonicalDomains suffixes and
       CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs rules. If CanonicalizeHostname is set to always then canonicalization is applied to proxied connections too.

       If this option is enabled, then the configuration files are processed again using the new target name to pick up any new configuration in matching Host and Match stanzas. A value of none  disables
       the use of a ProxyJump host.  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'always', 'no', 'none', 'yes'.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   CanonicalizeMaxDots
       Specifies the maximum number of dot characters in a hostname before canonicalization is disabled. The default, 1, allows a single dot (i.e.  hostname.subdomain).  Optional. Type integer.

       upstream_default value :
           1

   CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
       Specifies rules to determine whether CNAMEs should be followed when

       canonicalizing  hostnames.  The  rules consist of one or more arguments of source_domain_list :   target_domain_list where source_domain_list is a pattern-list of domains that may follow CNAMEs in
       canonicalization, and target_domain_list is a pattern-list of domains that they may resolve to.

       For example, Qq *.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com will allow hostnames matching Qq *.a.example.com to be canonicalized to names  in  the  Qq  *.b.example.com  or  Qq  *.c.example.com
       domains.

       A single argument of Qq none causes no CNAMEs to be considered for canonicalization. This is the default behaviour.  Optional. Type uniline.

   CASignatureAlgorithms
       Specifies  which  algorithms  are  allowed for signing of certificates by certificate authorities (CAs). The default is: ssh-ed25519, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
       sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com, sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com, rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256

       If the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a  '-'  character,
       then the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of replacing them.

       ssh(1) will not accept host certificates signed using algorithms other than those specified.  Optional. Type uniline.

   CertificateFile
       Specifies  a  file  from  which the user's certificate is read. A corresponding private key must be provided separately in order to use this certificate either from an IdentityFile directive or -i
       flag to ssh(1), via ssh-agent1, or via a PKCS11Provider or SecurityKeyProvider

       Arguments to CertificateFile may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory, the tokens described in the TOKENS section and environment variables  as  described  in  the  ENVIRONMENT
       VARIABLES section.

       It  is  possible  to  have  multiple  certificate  files specified in configuration files; these certificates will be tried in sequence. Multiple CertificateFile directives will add to the list of
       certificates used for authentication.  Optional. Type uniline.

   ChannelTimeout
       Specifies whether and how quickly ssh(1) should close inactive channels.  Timeouts are specified as one or more ''type=interval'' pairs separated by whitespace, where  the  ''type''  must  be  the
       special keyword ''global'' or a channel type name from the list below, optionally containing wildcard characters.

       The timeout value ''interval'' is specified in seconds or may use any of the units documented in the TIME FORMATS section. For example, ''session=5m'' would cause interactive sessions to terminate
       after five minutes of inactivity.  Specifying a zero value disables the inactivity timeout.

       The  special  timeout  ''global'' applies to all active channels, taken together.  Traffic on any active channel will reset the timeout, but when the timeout expires then all open channels will be
       closed. Note that this global timeout is not matched by wildcards and must be specified explicitly.

       The available channel type names include:

       agent-connection Open connections to ssh-agent1. direct-tcpip , direct-streamlocal@openssh.com Open TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that have been established  from  a  ssh(1)  local
       forwarding,  i.e.   LocalForward  or  DynamicForward  forwarded-tcpip , forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com Open TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections that have been established to a sshd(8)
       listening on behalf of a ssh(1) remote forwarding, i.e. RemoteForward session The interactive main session, including shell session, command execution, scp(1), sftp(1),  etc.  tun-connection  Open
       TunnelForward connections.  x11-connection Open X11 forwarding sessions.

       Note  that  in  all  the  above  cases,  terminating an inactive session does not guarantee to remove all resources associated with the session, e.g. shell processes or X11 clients relating to the
       session may continue to execute.

       Moreover, terminating an inactive channel or session does not necessarily close the SSH connection, nor does it prevent a client from requesting another channel of the same  type.  In  particular,
       expiring an inactive forwarding session does not prevent another identical forwarding from being subsequently created.

       The default is not to expire channels of any type for inactivity.  Optional. Type uniline.

   CheckHostIP
       If  set  to yes ssh(1) will additionally check the host IP address in the known_hosts file. This allows it to detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing and will add addresses of destination
       hosts to ~/.ssh/known_hosts in the process, regardless of the setting of StrictHostKeyChecking If the option is set to no (the default), the check will not be executed.  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   Ciphers
       Specifies the ciphers allowed and their order of preference. Multiple ciphers must be comma-separated. If the specified list begins with a  '+'  character,  then  the  specified  ciphers  will  be
       appended  to  the  default  set  instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '-' character, then the specified ciphers (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set
       instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified ciphers will be placed at the head of the default set.

       The supported ciphers are: 3des-cbc aes128-cbc aes192-cbc aes256-cbc aes128-ctr aes192-ctr aes256-ctr aes128-gcm@openssh.comaes256-gcm@openssh.comchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

       The default is: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, aes128-gcm@openssh.com, aes256-gcm@openssh.com

       The list of available ciphers may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q cipher .  Optional. Type uniline.

   ClearAllForwardings
       Specifies that all local, remote, and dynamic port forwardings specified in the configuration files or on the command line be cleared. This option is primarily useful when  used  from  the  ssh(1)
       command line to clear port forwardings set in configuration files, and is automatically set by scp(1) and sftp(1).  The argument must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   Compression
       Specifies whether to use compression. The argument must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   ConnectionAttempts
       Specifies  the  number  of  tries  (one  per  second)  to  make  before exiting. The argument must be an integer. This may be useful in scripts if the connection sometimes fails. The default is 1.
       Optional. Type integer.

       upstream_default value :
           1

   ConnectTimeout
       Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the SSH server, instead of using the default system TCP timeout. This timeout is applied both  to  establishing  the  connection  and  to
       performing the initial SSH protocol handshake and key exchange. SetupTimeOut is a Debian-specific compatibility alias for this option.  Optional. Type integer.

   ControlMaster
       Enables  the  sharing  of  multiple  sessions  over  a  single  network connection. When set to yes ssh(1) will listen for connections on a control socket specified using the ControlPath argument.
       Additional sessions can connect to this socket using the same ControlPath with ControlMaster set to no (the default). These sessions will try to reuse  the  master  instance's  network  connection
       rather than initiating new ones, but will fall back to connecting normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.

       Setting  this  to ask will cause ssh(1) to listen for control connections, but require confirmation using ssh-askpass1. If the ControlPath cannot be opened, ssh(1) will continue without connecting
       to a master instance.

       X11 and ssh-agent1 forwarding is supported over these multiplexed connections, however the display and agent forwarded will be the one belonging to the master connection i.e. it is not possible to
       forward multiple displays or agents.

       Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a master connection but fall back to creating a new one if one does not already exist. These options are: auto  and  autoask
       The latter requires confirmation like the ask option.  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'ask', 'auto', 'autoask', 'no', 'yes'.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   ControlPath
       Specify  the  path  to the control socket used for connection sharing as described in the ControlMaster section above or the string none to disable connection sharing. Arguments to ControlPath may
       use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory, the tokens described in the TOKENS section and environment variables as described in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section.  It is recommended
       that any ControlPath used for opportunistic connection sharing include at least %h, %p, and %r (or alternatively %C) and be placed in a directory that is not writable by other users. This  ensures
       that shared connections are uniquely identified.  Optional. Type uniline.

   ControlPersist
       When  used  in  conjunction with ControlMaster specifies that the master connection should remain open in the background (waiting for future client connections) after the initial client connection
       has been closed. If set to no (the default), then the master connection will not be placed into the background, and will close as soon as the initial client connection is closed.  If set to yes or
       0, then the master connection will remain in the background indefinitely (until killed or closed via a mechanism such as the Qq ssh -O exit ) . If set to a time in seconds, or a time in any of the
       formats documented in sshd_config5, then the backgrounded master connection will automatically terminate after it has remained idle (with no client connections) for the specified time.   Optional.
       Type uniline.

   DynamicForward
       Specifies that a TCP port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.

       The  argument  must  be  [bind_address  :  port ] IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets. By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts
       setting. However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection to a specific address. The bind_address of localhost indicates that the listening port be bound for  local  use  only,
       while an empty address or '*' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.

       Currently  the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh(1) will act as a SOCKS server. Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be given on the command line.
       Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   EnableEscapeCommandline
       Enables the command line option in the EscapeChar menu for interactive sessions (default '~C' ) . By default, the command line is disabled.  Optional. Type uniline.

   EnableSSHKeysign
       Setting this option to yes in the global client configuration file /etc/ssh/ssh_config enables the use of the helper program ssh-keysign8 during HostbasedAuthentication The argument must be yes or
       no (the default).  This option should be placed in the non-hostspecific section. See ssh-keysign8 for more information.  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   EscapeChar
       Sets the escape character (default: '~' ) . The escape character can also be set on the command line. The argument should be a single character, '^' followed by a letter, or none  to  disable  the
       escape character entirely (making the connection transparent for binary data).  Optional. Type uniline.

   ExitOnForwardFailure
       Specifies  whether ssh(1) should terminate the connection if it cannot set up all requested dynamic, tunnel, local, and remote port forwardings, (e.g. if either end is unable to bind and listen on
       a specified port). Note that ExitOnForwardFailure does not apply to connections made over port forwardings and will not, for example, cause ssh(1) to  exit  if  TCP  connections  to  the  ultimate
       forwarding destination fail. The argument must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   FingerprintHash
       Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints. Valid options are: md5 and sha256 (the default).  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'md5', 'sha256'.

       upstream_default value :
           sha256

   ForkAfterAuthentication
       Requests  ssh  to  go  to  background  just  before command execution. This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the background. This implies the
       StdinNull configuration option being set to ''yes'' The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm which is the same as ssh host xterm  if  the
       ForkAfterAuthentication configuration option is set to ''yes''

       If  the  ExitOnForwardFailure  configuration option is set to ''yes'' then a client started with the ForkAfterAuthentication configuration option being set to ''yes'' will wait for all remote port
       forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the background. The argument to this keyword must be yes (same as the -f option) or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   ForwardAgent
       Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any) will be forwarded to the remote machine. The argument may be yes no (the default), an explicit path to an agent socket or  the
       name of an environment variable (beginning with '$' in which to find the path.

       Agent  forwarding  should  be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the agent's Unix-domain socket) can access the local agent through the
       forwarded connection. An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded  into  the
       agent.  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   ForwardX11
       Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected over the secure channel and DISPLAY set. The argument must be yes or no (the default).

       X11  forwarding  should  be  enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display
       through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   ForwardX11Timeout
       Specify a timeout for untrusted X11 forwarding using the format described in the TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config5. X11 connections received by ssh(1) after this time will be  refused.  Setting
       ForwardX11Timeout  to  zero  will disable the timeout and permit X11 forwarding for the life of the connection. The default is to disable untrusted X11 forwarding after twenty minutes has elapsed.
       Optional. Type integer.

   ForwardX11Trusted
       If this option is set to yes (the Debian-specific default), remote X11 clients will have full access to the original X11 display.

       If this option is set to no (the upstream default), remote X11 clients will be considered untrusted and  prevented  from  stealing  or  tampering  with  data  belonging  to  trusted  X11  clients.
       Furthermore, the xauth(1) token used for the session will be set to expire after 20 minutes. Remote clients will be refused access after this time.

       See the X11 SECURITY extension specification for full details on the restrictions imposed on untrusted clients.  Optional. Type boolean.

   GatewayPorts
       Specifies  whether  remote  hosts  are allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.  By default, ssh(1) binds local port forwardings to the loopback address.  This prevents other remote hosts from
       connecting to forwarded ports.  GatewayPorts can be used to specify that ssh should bind local port forwardings to the wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to  forwarded  ports.
       The argument must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   GlobalKnownHostsFile
       Specifies one or more files to use for the global host key database, separated by whitespace. The default is /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2.  Optional. Type uniline.

       default value :
           /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2

   GSSAPIAuthentication
       Specifies whether user authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed. The default is no  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   GSSAPIClientIdentity
       If set, specifies the GSSAPI client identity that ssh should use when connecting to the server. The default is unset, which means that the default identity will be used.  Optional. Type uniline.

   GSSAPIDelegateCredentials
       Forward (delegate) credentials to the server. The default is no  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   GSSAPIKeyExchange
       Specifies whether key exchange based on GSSAPI may be used. When using GSSAPI key exchange the server need not have a host key. The default is ''no''  Optional. Type uniline.

   GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey
       If  set  to ''yes'' then renewal of the client's GSSAPI credentials will force the rekeying of the ssh connection. With a compatible server, this will delegate the renewed credentials to a session
       on the server.

       Checks are made to ensure that credentials are only propagated when the new credentials match the old ones on the originating client and where the receiving server still has the  old  set  in  its
       cache.

       The default is ''no''

       For this to work GSSAPIKeyExchange needs to be enabled in the server and also used by the client.  Optional. Type uniline.

   GSSAPIServerIdentity
       If  set,  specifies  the  GSSAPI server identity that ssh should expect when connecting to the server. The default is unset, which means that the expected GSSAPI server identity will be determined
       from the target hostname.  Optional. Type uniline.

   GSSAPITrustDns
       Set to ''yes'' to indicate that the DNS is trusted to securely canonicalize the name of the host being connected to. If ''no'' the hostname entered on the command line will be passed untouched  to
       the GSSAPI library. The default is ''no''  Optional. Type uniline.

   GSSAPIKexAlgorithms
       The  list  of  key  exchange algorithms that are offered for GSSAPI key exchange.  Possible values are gss-gex-sha1-, gss-group1-sha1-, gss-group14-sha1-, gss-group14-sha256-, gss-group16-sha512-,
       gss-nistp256-sha256-, gss-curve25519-sha256-

       The default is ''gss-group14-sha256-, gss-group16-sha512-, gss-nistp256-sha256-, gss-curve25519-sha256-, gss-gex-sha1-, gss-group14-sha1-'' This option only applies to  connections  using  GSSAPI.
       Optional. Type uniline.

   HashKnownHosts
       Indicates  that ssh(1) should hash host names and addresses when they are added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts These hashed names may be used normally by ssh(1) and sshd(8), but they do not visually reveal
       identifying information if the file's contents are disclosed. The default is no Note that existing names and addresses in known hosts files will not be converted automatically, but may be manually
       hashed using ssh-keygen1. Use of this option may break facilities such as tab-completion that rely on being able to read unhashed host names from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms
       Specifies the signature algorithms that will be used for hostbased authentication as a comma-separated list of patterns. Alternately if the specified list begins with a  '+'  character,  then  the
       specified  signature algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '-' character, then the specified signature algorithms (including
       wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified signature algorithms will be placed at the head  of
       the    default    set.     The    default    for    this    option   is:   ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,   ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,   ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
       ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com, sk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,  sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,  rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,  rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
       ssh-ed25519, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com, sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com, rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256

       The -Q option of ssh(1) may be used to list supported signature algorithms. This was formerly named HostbasedKeyTypes.  Optional. Type uniline.

       Note: HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms is migrated with '$old' and with:

       •   $old => "- HostbasedKeyTypes"

   HostbasedAuthentication
       Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with public key authentication. The argument must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   HostKeyAlgorithms
       Specifies  the  host  key  signature  algorithms  that  the  client wants to use in order of preference. Alternately if the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified signature
       algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '-' character, then the specified signature algorithms (including wildcards)  will  be
       removed  from  the  default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified signature algorithms will be placed at the head of the default set.
       The default for this option  is:  ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,  ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,  ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,  ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
       sk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,    sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,   rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,   rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,   ssh-ed25519,   ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,
       ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com, sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com, rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256

       If hostkeys are known for the destination host then this default is modified to prefer their algorithms.

       The list of available signature algorithms may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms .  Optional. Type uniline.

   HostKeyAlias
       Specifies an alias that should be used instead of the real host name when looking up or saving the host key in the host key database files and when validating host  certificates.  This  option  is
       useful for tunneling SSH connections or for multiple servers running on a single host.  Optional. Type uniline.

   Hostname
       Specifies  the  real  host  name  to log into. This can be used to specify nicknames or abbreviations for hosts. Arguments to Hostname accept the tokens described in the TOKENS section. Numeric IP
       addresses are also permitted (both on the command line and in Hostname specifications). The default is the name given on the command line.  Optional. Type uniline.

   IdentitiesOnly
       Specifies that ssh(1) should only use the configured authentication identity and certificate files (either the default files, or those explicitly configured in the ssh_config files  or  passed  on
       the  ssh(1)  command-line),  even  if  ssh-agent1  or  a PKCS11Provider or SecurityKeyProvider offers more identities. The argument to this keyword must be yes or no (the default).  This option is
       intended for situations where ssh-agent offers many different identities.  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   IdentityAgent
       Specifies the UNIX socket used to communicate with the authentication agent.

       This option overrides the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable and can be used to select a specific agent. Setting the socket name to none disables the use of an authentication agent. If the  string
       Qq  SSH_AUTH_SOCK  is  specified, the location of the socket will be read from the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable. Otherwise if the specified value begins with a '$' character, then it will be
       treated as an environment variable containing the location of the socket.

       Arguments to IdentityAgent may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory, the tokens described in the TOKENS section and  environment  variables  as  described  in  the  ENVIRONMENT
       VARIABLES section.  Optional. Type uniline.

   IdentityFile
       Specifies  a  file from which the user's ECDSA, authenticator-hosted ECDSA, Ed25519, authenticator-hosted Ed25519 or RSA authentication identity is read.  You can also specify a public key file to
       use the corresponding private key that is loaded in ssh-agent1 when the private key file is not present locally.  The default is ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       and  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk Additionally, any identities represented by the authentication agent will be used for authentication unless IdentitiesOnly is set. If no certificates have been explicitly
       specified by CertificateFile ssh(1) will try to load certificate information from the filename obtained by appending -cert.pub to the path of a specified IdentityFile

       Arguments to IdentityFile may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory or the tokens described in the TOKENS section. Alternately an argument of none may be  used  to  indicate  no
       identity files should be loaded.

       It is possible to have multiple identity files specified in configuration files; all these identities will be tried in sequence. Multiple IdentityFile directives will add to the list of identities
       tried (this behaviour differs from that of other configuration directives).

       IdentityFile  may  be  used  in  conjunction  with  IdentitiesOnly  to  select  which  identities  in  an agent are offered during authentication. IdentityFile may also be used in conjunction with
       CertificateFile in order to provide any certificate also needed for authentication with the identity.  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   IgnoreUnknown
       Specifies a pattern-list of unknown options to be ignored if they are encountered in configuration parsing. This may be used to suppress errors if ssh_config contains options that are unrecognised
       by ssh(1). It is recommended that IgnoreUnknown be listed early in the configuration file as it will not be applied to unknown options that appear before it.  Optional. Type uniline.

   Include
       Include the specified configuration file(s). Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards, tokens as described in the TOKENS section,  environment  variables
       as described in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section and, for user configurations, shell-like '~' references to user home directories. Wildcards will be expanded and processed in lexical order. Files
       without  absolute paths are assumed to be in ~/.ssh if included in a user configuration file or /etc/ssh if included from the system configuration file. Include directive may appear inside a Match
       or Host block to perform conditional inclusion.  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   IPQoS
       Specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP class for connections. Accepted values are af11 af12 af13 af21 af22 af23 af31 af32 af33 af41 af42 af43 cs0 cs1 cs2 cs3 cs4 cs5 cs6  cs7  ef  le  lowdelay
       throughput reliability a numeric value, or none to use the operating system default. This option may take one or two arguments, separated by whitespace. If one argument is specified, it is used as
       the packet class unconditionally. If two values are specified, the first is automatically selected for interactive sessions and the second for non-interactive sessions. The default is lowdelay for
       interactive sessions and throughput for non-interactive sessions.  Optional. Type uniline.

       upstream_default value :
           af21 cs1

   KbdInteractiveAuthentication
       Specifies  whether  to  use  keyboard-interactive  authentication.  The  argument  to  this  keyword must be yes (the default) or no ChallengeResponseAuthentication is a deprecated alias for this.
       Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   KbdInteractiveDevices
       Specifies the list of methods to use in keyboard-interactive authentication.  Multiple method names must be comma-separated. The default is to use the server specified list. The methods  available
       vary depending on what the server supports. For an OpenSSH server, it may be zero or more of: bsdauth and pam  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   KexAlgorithms
       Specifies  the  permitted KEX (Key Exchange) algorithms that will be used and their preference order. The selected algorithm will be the first algorithm in this list that the server also supports.
       Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated.

       If the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a  '-'  character,
       then the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified algorithms
       will be placed at the head of the default set.

       The  default  is:  sntrup761x25519-sha512,  sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com,  mlkem768x25519-sha256,  curve25519-sha256,  curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,  ecdh-sha2-nistp256,  ecdh-sha2-nistp384,
       ecdh-sha2-nistp521, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256, diffie-hellman-group16-sha512, diffie-hellman-group18-sha512, diffie-hellman-group14-sha256

       The list of supported key exchange algorithms may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q kex .  Optional. Type uniline.

   KnownHostsCommand
       Specifies a command to use to obtain a list of host keys, in addition to those listed in UserKnownHostsFile and GlobalKnownHostsFile This command is executed after the files have been read. It may
       write host key lines to standard output in identical format to the usual files (described in the VERIFYING HOST KEYS section in ssh(1)). Arguments to KnownHostsCommand accept the tokens  described
       in  the  TOKENS  section.  The  command  may  be  invoked multiple times per connection: once when preparing the preference list of host key algorithms to use, again to obtain the host key for the
       requested host name and, if CheckHostIP is enabled, one more time to obtain the host key matching the server's address. If the command exits abnormally or returns a non-zero exit status  then  the
       connection is terminated.  Optional. Type uniline.

   LocalCommand
       Specifies a command to execute on the local machine after successfully connecting to the server. The command string extends to the end of the line, and is executed with the user's shell. Arguments
       to LocalCommand accept the tokens described in the TOKENS section.

       The command is run synchronously and does not have access to the session of the ssh(1) that spawned it. It should not be used for interactive commands.

       This directive is ignored unless PermitLocalCommand has been enabled.  Optional. Type uniline.

   LocalForward
       Specifies  that  a  TCP  port on the local machine be forwarded over the secure channel to the specified host and port from the remote machine. The first argument specifies the listener and may be
       [bind_address : port ] or a Unix domain socket path. The second argument is the destination and may be host :   hostport or a Unix domain socket path if the remote host supports it.

       IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.  Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be given on the command line. Only  the  superuser
       can  forward  privileged  ports. By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting. However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection to a specific
       address. The bind_address of localhost indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or '*' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.
       Unix domain socket paths may use the tokens described in the TOKENS section and environment variables as described in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section.  Optional.  Type  list  of  node  of  class
       Ssh::PortForward .

   LogLevel
       Gives  the  verbosity  level  that  is used when logging messages from ssh(1).  The possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3. The default is INFO.
       DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify higher levels of verbose output.  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'DEBUG', 'DEBUG1', 'DEBUG2',  'DEBUG3',  'ERROR',  'FATAL',  'INFO',
       'QUIET', 'VERBOSE'.

       upstream_default value :
           INFO

   LogVerbose
       Specify  one  or more overrides to LogLevel. An override consists of one or more pattern lists that matches the source file, function and line number to force detailed logging for. For example, an
       override pattern of: kex.c:*:1000,*:kex_exchange_identification():*, packet.c:*

       would enable detailed logging for line 1000 of kex.c everything in the Fn kex_exchange_identification function, and all code in the packet.c file. This option is  intended  for  debugging  and  no
       overrides are enabled by default.  Optional. Type uniline.

   MACs
       Specifies the MAC (message authentication code) algorithms

       in  order of preference. The MAC algorithm is used for data integrity protection. Multiple algorithms must be comma-separated. If the specified list begins with a '+' character, then the specified
       algorithms will be appended to the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '-' character, then the specified algorithms (including  wildcards)  will  be  removed
       from the default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified algorithms will be placed at the head of the default set.

       The algorithms that contain Qq -etm calculate the MAC after encryption (encrypt-then-mac). These are considered safer and their use recommended.

       The    default    is:    umac-64-etm@openssh.com,    umac-128-etm@openssh.com,   hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,   hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,   hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com,   umac-64@openssh.com,
       umac-128@openssh.com, hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512, hmac-sha1

       The list of available MAC algorithms may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q mac .  Optional. Type uniline.

   NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost
       Disable host authentication for localhost (loopback addresses). The argument to this keyword must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   NumberOfPasswordPrompts
       Specifies the number of password prompts before giving up. The argument to this keyword must be an integer. The default is 3.  Optional. Type integer.

       upstream_default value :
           3

   ObscureKeystrokeTiming
       Specifies whether ssh(1) should try to obscure inter-keystroke timings from passive observers of network traffic. If enabled, then for interactive sessions, ssh(1) will send  keystrokes  at  fixed
       intervals  of  a  few  tens of milliseconds and will send fake keystroke packets for some time after typing ceases. The argument to this keyword must be yes no or an interval specifier of the form
       interval:milliseconds (e.g. interval:80 for 80 milliseconds). The default is to obscure keystrokes using a 20ms packet interval. Note that smaller intervals will result in  higher  fake  keystroke
       packet rates.  Optional. Type uniline.

       upstream_default value :
           interval:20

   PasswordAuthentication
       Specifies whether to use password authentication. The argument to this keyword must be yes (the default) or no  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   PermitLocalCommand
       Allow local command execution via the LocalCommand option or using the !  command escape sequence in ssh(1). The argument must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   PermitRemoteOpen
       Specifies the destinations to which remote TCP port forwarding is permitted when RemoteForward is used as a SOCKS proxy. The forwarding specification must be one of the following forms:

       PermitRemoteOpen host : port PermitRemoteOpen IPv4_addr : port PermitRemoteOpen [ IPv6_addr ] : port

       Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them with whitespace. An argument of any can be used to remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding requests. An argument of none can be used
       to  prohibit  all  forwarding  requests.  The wildcard '*' can be used for host or port to allow all hosts or ports respectively. Otherwise, no pattern matching or address lookups are performed on
       supplied names.  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   PKCS11Provider
       Specifies which PKCS#11 provider to use or none to indicate that no provider should be used (the default). The argument to this keyword is a path to the PKCS#11 shared library ssh(1) should use to
       communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user authentication.  Optional. Type uniline.

   Port
       Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host. The default is 22.  Optional. Type uniline.

   PreferredAuthentications
       Specifies the order in which the client should try authentication methods. This allows a client to prefer one method (e.g. keyboard-interactive over another method (e.g. password ) The default is:
       gssapi-with-mic, hostbased, publickey, keyboard-interactive, password.  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   ProxyCommand
       Specifies the command to use to connect to the server. The command string extends to the end of the line, and is executed using the user's  shell  'exec'  directive  to  avoid  a  lingering  shell
       process.

       Arguments  to  ProxyCommand  accept  the tokens described in the TOKENS section. The command can be basically anything, and should read from its standard input and write to its standard output. It
       should eventually connect an sshd(8) server running on some machine, or execute sshd -i somewhere.  Host key management will be done using the Hostname of the host being connected  (defaulting  to
       the name typed by the user). Setting the command to none disables this option entirely. Note that CheckHostIP is not available for connects with a proxy command.

       This directive is useful in conjunction with nc(1) and its proxy support.  For example, the following directive would connect via an HTTP proxy at 192.0.2.0: ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x
       192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p.  Optional. Type uniline.

   ProxyJump
       Specifies  one  or more jump proxies as either [user  @ ] host [: port ] or an ssh URI . Multiple proxies may be separated by comma characters and will be visited sequentially. Setting this option
       will cause ssh(1) to connect to the target host by first making a ssh(1) connection to the specified ProxyJump host and then establishing a TCP  forwarding  to  the  ultimate  target  from  there.
       Setting the host to none disables this option entirely.

       Note that this option will compete with the ProxyCommand option - whichever is specified first will prevent later instances of the other from taking effect.

       Note  also  that the configuration for the destination host (either supplied via the command-line or the configuration file) is not generally applied to jump hosts. ~/.ssh/config should be used if
       specific configuration is required for jump hosts.  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   ProxyUseFdpass
       Specifies that ProxyCommand will pass a connected file descriptor back to ssh(1) instead of continuing to execute and pass data. The default is no  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms
       Specifies the signature algorithms that will be used for public key authentication as a comma-separated list of patterns. If the specified list begins with a '+'  character,  then  the  algorithms
       after  it  will  be appended to the default instead of replacing it. If the specified list begins with a '-' character, then the specified algorithms (including wildcards) will be removed from the
       default set instead of replacing them. If the specified list begins with a '^' character, then the specified algorithms will be placed at the head of the default set. The default for  this  option
       is:          ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,         ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,         ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,         ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
       sk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,   sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,   rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com,   rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com,   ssh-ed25519,    ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,
       ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com, sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com, rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256

       The list of available signature algorithms may also be obtained using Qq ssh -Q PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms .  Optional. Type uniline.

       Note: PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms is migrated with '$old' and with:

       •   $old => "- PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes"

   PubkeyAuthentication
       Specifies  whether  to  try public key authentication. The argument to this keyword must be yes (the default), no unbound or host-bound The final two options enable public key authentication while
       respectively disabling or enabling the OpenSSH host-bound authentication protocol extension required for restricted  ssh-agent1  forwarding.   Optional.  Type  enum.  choice:  'host-bound',  'no',
       'unbound', 'yes'.

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   RekeyLimit
       Specifies  the  maximum  amount of data that may be transmitted or received before the session key is renegotiated, optionally followed by a maximum amount of time that may pass before the session
       key is renegotiated. The first argument is specified in bytes and may have a suffix of 'K' 'M' or 'G' to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively. The default is between '1G'  and
       '4G'  depending  on  the  cipher.  The  optional  second  value  is  specified in seconds and may use any of the units documented in the TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config5. The default value for
       RekeyLimit is default none which means that rekeying is performed after the cipher's default amount of data has been sent or received and no time based rekeying is done.  Optional. Type uniline.

   RemoteCommand
       Specifies a command to execute on the remote machine after successfully connecting to the server. The command string extends to the end of  the  line,  and  is  executed  with  the  user's  shell.
       Arguments to RemoteCommand accept the tokens described in the TOKENS section.  Optional. Type uniline.

   RemoteForward
       Specifies  that  a TCP port on the remote machine be forwarded over the secure channel. The remote port may either be forwarded to a specified host and port from the local machine, or may act as a
       SOCKS 4/5 proxy that allows a remote client to connect to arbitrary destinations from the local machine. The first argument is the listening specification and may be [bind_address : port ] or,  if
       the  remote  host  supports  it,  a  Unix domain socket path. If forwarding to a specific destination then the second argument must be host : hostport or a Unix domain socket path, otherwise if no
       destination argument is specified then the remote forwarding will be established as a SOCKS proxy.  When acting as  a  SOCKS  proxy,  the  destination  of  the  connection  can  be  restricted  by
       PermitRemoteOpen

       IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing addresses in square brackets.  Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional forwardings can be given on the command line. Privileged ports can
       be  forwarded  only  when  logging  in  as  root  on  the  remote machine. Unix domain socket paths may use the tokens described in the TOKENS section and environment variables as described in the
       ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section.

       If the port argument is 0, the listen port will be dynamically allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time.

       If the bind_address is not specified, the default is to only bind to loopback addresses. If the bind_address is '*' or an  empty  string,  then  the  forwarding  is  requested  to  listen  on  all
       interfaces. Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed if the server's GatewayPorts option is enabled (see sshd_config5).  Optional. Type list of node of class Ssh::PortForward .

   RequestTTY
       Specifies  whether  to  request a pseudo-tty for the session. The argument may be one of: no (never request a TTY), yes (always request a TTY when standard input is a TTY), force (always request a
       TTY) or auto (request a TTY when opening a login session). This option mirrors the -t and -T flags for ssh(1).  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'auto', 'force', 'no', 'yes'.

   RequiredRSASize
       Specifies the minimum RSA key size (in bits) that ssh(1) will accept. User authentication keys smaller than this limit will be ignored. Servers that present host keys smaller than this limit  will
       cause the connection to be terminated. The default is 1024 bits. Note that this limit may only be raised from the default.  Optional. Type integer.

       upstream_default value :
           1024

   RevokedHostKeys
       Specifies  revoked  host  public  keys. Keys listed in this file will be refused for host authentication. Note that if this file does not exist or is not readable, then host authentication will be
       refused for all hosts. Keys may be specified as a text file, listing one public key per line, or as an OpenSSH Key Revocation List (KRL) as generated by ssh-keygen1. For more information on  KRLs,
       see  the  KEY  REVOCATION  LISTS  section  in ssh-keygen1. Arguments to RevokedHostKeys may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory, the tokens described in the TOKENS section and
       environment variables as described in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section.  Optional. Type uniline.

   SecurityKeyProvider
       Specifies a path to a library that will be used when loading any FIDO authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default of using the built-in USB HID support.

       If the specified value begins with a '$' character, then it will be treated as an environment variable containing the path to the library.  Optional. Type uniline.

   SendEnv
       Specifies what variables from the local environ(7) should be sent to the server. The server must also support it, and the server must be configured to accept these environment variables. Note that
       the TERM environment variable is always sent whenever a pseudo-terminal is requested as it is required by the protocol. Refer to  AcceptEnv  in  sshd_config5  for  how  to  configure  the  server.
       Variables are specified by name, which may contain wildcard characters.  Multiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or spread across multiple SendEnv directives.

       See PATTERNS for more information on patterns.

       It is possible to clear previously set SendEnv variable names by prefixing patterns with - The default is not to send any environment variables.  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   ServerAliveCountMax
       Sets  the  number  of  server  alive messages (see below) which may be sent without ssh(1) receiving any messages back from the server. If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are
       being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of server alive messages is very different  from  TCPKeepAlive  (below).  The  server
       alive  messages  are  sent  through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The server alive mechanism is valuable
       when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.

       The default value is 3. If, for example, ServerAliveInterval (see below) is set to 15 and ServerAliveCountMax is left at the default, if the server becomes unresponsive, ssh will disconnect  after
       approximately 45 seconds.  Optional. Type integer.

       upstream_default value :
           3

   ServerAliveInterval
       Sets  a  timeout  interval  in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server. The
       default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the server, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set (Debian-specific). ProtocolKeepAlives is a  Debian-specific  compatibility  alias
       for this option.  Optional. Type integer.

       upstream_default value :
           0

   SessionType
       May  be  used to either request invocation of a subsystem on the remote system, or to prevent the execution of a remote command at all. The latter is useful for just forwarding ports. The argument
       to this keyword must be none (same as the -N option), subsystem (same as the -s option) or default (shell or command execution).  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'default', 'none', 'subsystem'.

   SetEnv
       Directly specify one or more environment variables and their contents to be sent to the server. Similarly to SendEnv with the exception of the TERM variable, the server must be prepared to  accept
       the environment variable.  Optional. Type uniline.

   StdinNull
       Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from stdin). Either this or the equivalent -n option must be used when ssh is run in the background. The argument to this keyword must be
       yes (same as the -n option) or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   StreamLocalBindMask
       Sets  the  octal  file  creation  mode  mask (umask) used when creating a Unix-domain socket file for local or remote port forwarding. This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain
       socket file.

       The default value is 0177, which creates a Unix-domain socket file that is readable and writable only by the owner. Note that not all operating systems honor the file mode  on  Unix-domain  socket
       files.  Optional. Type uniline.

   StreamLocalBindUnlink
       Specifies  whether  to  remove an existing Unix-domain socket file for local or remote port forwarding before creating a new one. If the socket file already exists and StreamLocalBindUnlink is not
       enabled, ssh will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket file. This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain socket file.

       The argument must be yes or no (the default).  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   StrictHostKeyChecking
       If this flag is set to yes ssh(1) will never automatically add host keys to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to connect  to  hosts  whose  host  key  has  changed.  This  provides  maximum
       protection  against  man-in-the-middle  (MITM)  attacks, though it can be annoying when the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts file is poorly maintained or when connections to new hosts are frequently made.
       This option forces the user to manually add all new hosts.

       If this flag is set to accept-new then ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user's known_hosts file, but will not permit connections to hosts with changed host keys. If this flag is set
       to no or off ssh will automatically add new host keys to the user known hosts files and allow connections to hosts with changed hostkeys to proceed, subject to some restrictions. If this  flag  is
       set  to  ask  (the default), new host keys will be added to the user known host files only after the user has confirmed that is what they really want to do, and ssh will refuse to connect to hosts
       whose host key has changed. The host keys of known hosts will be verified automatically in all cases.  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'yes', 'accept-new', 'no', 'off', 'ask'.

       upstream_default value :
           ask

   SyslogFacility
       Gives the facility code that is used when logging messages from ssh(1). The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7. The default  is
       USER.  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'AUTH', 'DAEMON', 'LOCAL0', 'LOCAL1', 'LOCAL2', 'LOCAL3', 'LOCAL4', 'LOCAL5', 'LOCAL6', 'LOCAL7', 'USER'.

       upstream_default value :
           USER

   TCPKeepAlive
       Specifies  whether  the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side. If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed. This option
       only uses TCP keepalives (as opposed to using ssh level keepalives), so takes a long time to notice when the connection dies. As such, you probably want the  ServerAliveInterval  option  as  well.
       However, this means that connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people find it annoying.

       The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the network goes down or the remote host dies. This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.

       To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to no See also ServerAliveInterval for protocol-level keepalives.  Optional. Type boolean.

       upstream_default value :
           yes

   Tag
       Specify a configuration tag name that may be later used by a Match directive to select a block of configuration.  Optional. Type uniline.

   Tunnel
       Request  tun(4) device forwarding between the client and the server. The argument must be yes point-to-point (layer 3), ethernet (layer 2), or no (the default). Specifying yes requests the default
       tunnel mode, which is point-to-point  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'ethernet', 'no', 'point-to-point', 'yes'.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   TunnelDevice
       Specifies the tun(4) devices to open on the client (local_tun ) and the server (remote_tun )

       The argument must be local_tun  [: remote_tun ] The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword any which uses the next available tunnel device. If  remote_tun  is  not  specified,  it
       defaults to any The default is any:any  Optional. Type uniline.

       upstream_default value :
           any:any

   UpdateHostKeys
       Specifies  whether  ssh(1) should accept notifications of additional hostkeys from the server sent after authentication has completed and add them to UserKnownHostsFile The argument must be yes no
       or ask This option allows learning alternate hostkeys for a server and supports graceful key rotation by allowing a server to send replacement public keys before old ones are removed.

       Additional hostkeys are only accepted if the key used to authenticate the host was already trusted or explicitly accepted by the user, the host was authenticated via UserKnownHostsFile  (i.e.  not
       GlobalKnownHostsFile and the host was authenticated using a plain key and not a certificate.

       UpdateHostKeys is enabled by default if the user has not overridden the default UserKnownHostsFile setting and has not enabled VerifyHostKeyDNS otherwise UpdateHostKeys will be set to no

       If  UpdateHostKeys  is set to ask then the user is asked to confirm the modifications to the known_hosts file. Confirmation is currently incompatible with ControlPersist and will be disabled if it
       is enabled.

       Presently, only sshd(8) from OpenSSH 6.8 and greater support the Qq hostkeys@openssh.com protocol extension used to inform the client of all the server's hostkeys.  Optional.  Type  enum.  choice:
       'ask', 'no', 'yes'.

   User
       Specifies  the  user  to  log  in as. This can be useful when a different user name is used on different machines. This saves the trouble of having to remember to give the user name on the command
       line.  Optional. Type uniline.

   UserKnownHostsFile
       Specifies one or more files to use for the user host key database, separated by whitespace. Each filename may use tilde notation to refer to the user's home directory, the tokens described in  the
       TOKENS  section  and  environment  variables  as  described  in  the  ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES  section.  A  value of none causes ssh(1) to ignore any user-specific known hosts files. The default is
       ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts2.  Optional. Type list of uniline.

   VerifyHostKeyDNS
       Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource records. If this option is set to yes the client will implicitly trust keys  that  match  a  secure  fingerprint  from  DNS.
       Insecure  fingerprints will be handled as if this option was set to ask If this option is set to ask information on fingerprint match will be displayed, but the user will still need to confirm new
       host keys according to the StrictHostKeyChecking option. The default is no

       See also VERIFYING HOST KEYS in ssh(1).  Optional. Type enum. choice: 'ask', 'no', 'yes'.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   VisualHostKey
       If this flag is set to yes an ASCII art representation of the remote host key fingerprint is printed in addition to the fingerprint string at login and for unknown host keys. If this flag  is  set
       to no (the default), no fingerprint strings are printed at login and only the fingerprint string will be printed for unknown host keys.  Optional. Type uniline.

       upstream_default value :
           no

   XAuthLocation
       Specifies the full pathname of the xauth(1) program. The default is /usr/bin/xauth.  Optional. Type uniline.

       upstream_default value :
           /usr/bin/xauth

   FallBackToRsh
       This parameter is now ignored by Ssh. Deprecated  Optional. Type uniline.

   HostbasedKeyTypes
       This parameter is now ignored by Ssh. Deprecated  Optional. Type uniline.

   PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes
       This parameter is now ignored by Ssh. Deprecated  Optional. Type uniline.

   UseRsh
       This parameter is now ignored by Ssh. Deprecated  Optional. Type uniline.

   Match
       Restricts  the following declarations (up to the next Host or Match keyword) to be used only when the conditions following the Match keyword are satisfied. Match conditions are specified using one
       or more criteria or the single token all which always matches. The available criteria keywords are: canonical final exec localnetwork host originalhost tagged user and localuser The  all  criteria
       must  appear  alone  or  immediately  after  canonical or final Other criteria may be combined arbitrarily. All criteria but all canonical and final require an argument. Criteria may be negated by
       prepending an exclamation mark ('!' )

       The canonical keyword matches only when the configuration file is being re-parsed after hostname canonicalization (see the CanonicalizeHostname option). This may be useful  to  specify  conditions
       that work with canonical host names only.

       The final keyword requests that the configuration be re-parsed (regardless of whether CanonicalizeHostname is enabled), and matches only during this final pass. If CanonicalizeHostname is enabled,
       then canonical and final match during the same pass.

       The  exec keyword executes the specified command under the user's shell. If the command returns a zero exit status then the condition is considered true.  Commands containing whitespace characters
       must be quoted. Arguments to exec accept the tokens described in the TOKENS section.

       The localnetwork keyword matches the addresses of active local network interfaces against the supplied list of  networks  in  CIDR  format.  This  may  be  convenient  for  varying  the  effective
       configuration  on  devices that roam between networks. Note that network address is not a trustworthy criteria in many situations (e.g. when the network is automatically configured using DHCP) and
       so caution should be applied if using it to control security-sensitive configuration.

       The other keywords' criteria must be single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section. The criteria for  the  host  keyword
       are  matched  against  the target hostname, after any substitution by the Hostname or CanonicalizeHostname options. The originalhost keyword matches against the hostname as it was specified on the
       command-line. The tagged keyword matches a tag name specified by a prior Tag directive or on the ssh(1) command-line using the -P flag. The user keyword matches against the target username on  the
       remote  host.  The  localuser  keyword matches against the name of the local user running ssh(1) (this keyword may be useful in system-wide ssh_config files).  Optional. Type hash of node of class
       Ssh::HostElement .
