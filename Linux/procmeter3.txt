NAME
       procmetetrc - The procmeterrc configuration file for procmeter3, procmeter3-xaw, gprocmeter3, procmeter3-gtk1, procmeter3-gtk2, procmeter3-gtk3, procmeter3-log and procmeter3-lcd programs.

SYNOPSIS
       This  file  contains the run-time options for the procmeter3, procmeter3-xaw, gprocmeter3, procmeter3-gtk1, procmeter3-gtk2, procmeter3-gtk3, procmeter3-log and procmeter3-lcd programs.  These in‐
       clude the outputs that are displayed, the colours and fonts that are used (for X window outputs), the LCDproc server (for the procmeter-lcd version) and other program options.

DESCRIPTION
       The resources for ProcMeter version 3.x are stored in the .procmeterrc file instead of using X resources.  This gives more flexibility and allows for much simpler customisation.

       When the procmeter3, procmeter3-xaw, gprocmeter3, procmeter3-gtk1, procmeter3-gtk2, procmeter3-gtk3, procmeter3-log or procmeter3-lcd programs start the .procmeterrc file is searched  for  in  the
       current directory, the current users home directory or the system default installation directory (named procmeterrc).  The file is used from the first one of these locations that matches.

       The format of the .procmeterrc file is a number of sections with the section names marked in '[]'.  As well as the fixed sections (described below) there is a section for each module that is named
       using the name that the module reports itself to be.  There are then further sections for each of the possible outputs of each module.  The names of the sections and parameters are not case sensi‐
       tive although the values that they are given may be.  Lines beginning with the characters ';' or '#' are comments and continuation using the '\' character at the end of a line is allowed.

       Below is listed the resource values and the sections of the .procmeterrc file that they can exist in.

library SECTION
       This section contains the information about the ProcMeter modules that are available.  This applies to all versions of the program.

       path=...
              The pathname of the library that contains the compiled ProcMeter modules.  (defaults to the program's compiled-in installation location).

       others=...
              A list of other modules to be loaded (full pathnames separated by spaces).

startup SECTION
       This section controls how the ProcMeter window should look when the program is started.

       order=...
              A  list  of  the outputs that are to be started up in the order that they are to be displayed (separated by spaces).  If command line options are also specified then they appear after those
              specified here.

resources SECTION
       This section contains the general program display resources.  Not all of the options apply to all of the versions of the program.  Specific versions that the options apply to are specified below.

       horizontal=...
              A Boolean to indicate that the outputs are stacked horizontally instead of the default which is vertically. (For X versions of ProcMeter only.)

       background=...
              The colour to use as the default background for all outputs. (An X11 colour name or an RGB value in hex as #RRGGBB; for X versions of ProcMeter only.)

       foreground=...
              The colour to use as the default foreground for all outputs. (An X11 colour name or an RGB value in hex as #RRGGBB; for X versions of ProcMeter only.)

       label-font=...
              The font to use for the label that describes the output. (An X11 font name, also known as an X Logical Font Description; for Xaw and GTK1/2 versions of ProcMeter only.)

       label-font-pango=...
              The font to use for the label that describes the output. (A Pango font name; for GTK3 version of ProcMeter only.)

       label-foreground=...
              The colour to use as the foreground for the label. (An X11 colour name or an RGB value in hex as #RRGGBB; for X versions of ProcMeter only.)

       label-position=...
              The position of the label relative to the body of the output.  (Either top, bottom or none; for X versions of ProcMeter only.)

       grid-foreground=...
              The colour to use for the grid lines. (An X11 colour name or an RGB value in hex as #RRGGBB; for X versions of ProcMeter only.)

       graph-solid=...
              A boolean to indicate if the graph should be solid (the default) or a single line.  (yes or no, true or false, 0 or 1; for X versions of ProcMeter only.)

       grid-min=...
              The minimum number of grid lines to display on a graph or bar chart.  (An integer; for X and LCD versions of ProcMeter only.)  This is particularly important with the bar chart because with
              this set too low the bar will always be the same length on screen and the number of grid lines will change with the data.

       grid-max=...
              The maximum number of grid lines to display on a graph or bar chart.  (An integer; for X and LCD versions of ProcMeter only.)

       text-font=...
              The font to use for the textual outputs.  (An X11 font name, also known as an X Logical Font Description; for Xaw and GTK1/2 versions of ProcMeter only.)

       text-font-pango=...
              The font to use for the textual outputs.  (A Pango font name; for GTK3 version of ProcMeter only.)

       menu-foreground=...
              The colour to use as the foreground for the menus.  (An X11 colour name or an RGB value in hex as #RRGGBB; for Xaw version of ProcMeter only.)

       menu-background=...
              The colour to use as the background for the menus.  (An X11 colour name or an RGB value in hex as #RRGGBB; for Xaw and GTK3 versions of ProcMeter only; the background of all  items  on  the
              same menu must be the same.)

       menu-font=...
              The font to use for the menus.  (An X11 font name, also known as an X Logical Font Description; for Xaw version of ProcMeter only.)

       update=...
              The update interval for the output in seconds (an integer).

LCD SECTION
       This section contains parameters that are only used by the procmeter3-lcd version of the program.

       host=...
              The name of the host that the LCDd daemon is running on.

       port=...
              The port number that the LCDd daemon is running on.

       duration=...
              The length of time that all of the ProcMeter outputs are displayed on the LCD display for before cycling to the next.

       priority=...
              The  priority of all of the ProcMeter outputs when they are displayed on the LCD display.  This values should be a numeric value for LCDd verions before 0.5 or priority names for later ver‐
              sions.  Using numeric values will likely fail for LCDd versions after 0.5 due to a bug in LCDd.  The safest solution is not to use this option unless you are sure what value to use.

MODULE SECTION
       The name of the section is the name of the ProcMeter module (see the help, procmeter3 -h), for example: ProcMeter

       These can contain any of the resource values which will then apply to all outputs of this module.  There are also extra options that can be applied to the module and as defaults for the all of the
       outputs of that module.

       options=...
              A string containing options that are passed to the module at startup, different modules have different options, see the procmeter3_modules(1) manual page.

       graph-scale=...
              The scaling of the graph or bar chart, the number of units between each of the grid lines.  (An integer; for X versions of ProcMeter only.)

       run=...
              A string that specifies a program that can be run by selecting it from the menu for the left mouse button.  (For X versions of ProcMeter only.)  The way that the command is run can be spec‐
              ified using one of the following abbreviations; XTerm( command ) to run command in an xterm then exit.  XTermWait( command ) to run command in an xterm and wait for user input before  exit‐
              ing.  Shell( command ) to run command in an shell and exit.  This last one is equivalent to using none of these abbreviations.

OUTPUT SECTION
       The name of the section is the name of the ProcMeter output (see the help, procmeter3 -h), for example: ProcMeter.Version

       The output sections can contain any of the resource or module options (except ´options') which will then apply only to the specified output.  There are also options that can only be applied to in‐
       dividual outputs.

       label=...
              Changes the default label for the output to the specified string.

        foreground = black
        background = white

        # A large-medium size text font.
        text-font = 8x13
        text-font-pango = Sans 8

        # Solid graphs with at least 5 grid lines in grey.
        graph-solid = yes
        grid-min = 5
        grid-foreground = grey50

        # Black on white output labels, small font, below the data.
        label-font = 5x7
        label-font-pango = Sans 5
        label-foreground = black
        label-position = bottom

        # Black on white menu items in a small-medium size font.
        menu-foreground = black
        menu-background = white
        menu-font = 7x13

        [ProcMeter.Version]

        # A smaller font than normal with no label.
        text-font = 6x10
        text-font-gtk3 = Sans 6
        label-position = none

        [Statistics]

        [Statistics.CPU]

        # The minimum number of grid lines, they are 20% each.
        grid-min = 5

        [Processes]

        run = XTerm(top)

        [Network]

        # To pick up extra devices not automatically recognised.
