NAME
       trf - locate and display tandem repeats in DNA sequences

SYNOPSIS
       trf (File|Match|Mismatch|Delta|PM|PI|Minscore|MaxPeriod) [options]

OPTIONS
       Where: (all weights, penalties, and scores are positive)

       File   sequences input file

       Match  matching weight

       Mismatch
              mismatching penalty

       Delta  indel penalty

       PM     match probability (whole number)

       PI     indel probability (whole number)

       Minscore
              minimum alignment score to report

       MaxPeriod
              maximum period size to report

   [options] = one or more of the following:
       -m     masked sequence file

       -f     flanking sequence

       -d     data file

       -h     suppress html output

       -r     no redundancy elimination

       -l <n> maximum TR length expected (in millions) (eg, -l 3 or -l=3 for 3 million) Human genome HG38 would need -l 6

       -ngs   more  compact  .dat output on multisequence files, returns 0 on success.  Output is printed to the screen, not a file. You may pipe input in with this option using - for file name. Short 50
              flanks are appended to .dat output.
