NAME
       docx2txt - convert Microsoft OOXML files to plain text.

SYNOPSIS
       docx2txt [ infile.docx|-|-h ] [ outfile.txt|- ]
       docx2txt < infile.docx
       docx2txt < infile.docx > outfile.txt

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the docx2txt commands.

       docx2txt  docx2txt  is  a  tool  that attempts to generate equivalent plain text files from Microsoft .docx documents, preserving some formatting and document information (which MS text conversion
       drops) along with appropriate character conversions for a good (ascii or utf-8) text experience.  It is a platform independent solution consisting of (core) Perl and (wrapper)  Unix/Windows  shell
       scripts  and  a  configuration file to control the output text appearance to a fair extent.  It can very conveniently be used to build a Web-based docx document conversion service.  With unzippers
       like CakeCmd that can deal with corrupt Zip archives, this tool can extract text from corrupt docx documents in many cases, where MS Word fails to even open them.

OPTIONS
       -h     As the first argument to get this usage information.

       -      As the infile name to read the docx file from STDIN.

       -      As the outfile name to dump the text on STDOUT.
              Output is saved in infile.txt if second argument is omitted.
