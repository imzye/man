NAME
       MIME::Type - description of one MIME type

SYNOPSIS
         use MIME::Types;
         my $mimetypes = MIME::Types->new;
         my MIME::Type $plaintext = $mimetypes->type('text/plain');
         print $plaintext->mediaType;   # text
         print $plaintext->subType;     # plain

         my @ext = $plaintext->extensions;
         print "@ext"                   # txt asc c cc h hh cpp

         print $plaintext->encoding     # 8bit
         if($plaintext->isBinary)       # false
         if($plaintext->isText)         # true
         if($plaintext->equals('text/plain') {...}
         if($plaintext eq 'text/plain') # same

         print MIME::Type->simplified('x-appl/x-zip') #  'appl/zip'

DESCRIPTION
       MIME types are used in MIME entities, for instance as part of e-mail and HTTP traffic.  Sometimes real knowledge about a mime-type is need.  Objects of "MIME::Type" store the information on one
       such type.

OVERLOADED
       overload: "" stringification
           The stringification (use of the object in a place where a string is required) will result in the type name, the same as type() returns.

           example: use of stringification

             my $mime = MIME::Type->new('text/html');
             print "$mime\n";   # explicit stringification
             print $mime;       # implicit stringification

       overload: == numerical comparison
           Compare whether the type() of the objects is the same.

       overload: cmp string comparison
           When  a  MIME::Type  object is compared to either a string or another MIME::Type, the equals() method is called.  Comparison is smart, which means that it extends common string comparison with
           some features which are defined in the related RFCs.

METHODS
   Initiation
       $class->new(%options)
           Create (instantiate) a new MIME::Type object which manages one mime type.

            -Option    --Default
             charset     undef
             encoding    <depends on type>
             extensions  []
             simplified  <derived from type>
             system      undef
             type        <required>

           charset => $charset
             Specify the default charset for this type.

           encoding => '7bit'|'8bit'|'base64'|'quoted-printable'
             How must this data be encoded to be transported safely.  The default depends on the type: mimes with as main type "text/" will default to "quoted-printable" and all other to "base64".

           extensions => REF-ARRAY
             An array of extensions which are using this mime.

           simplified => STRING
             The mime types main- and sub-label can both start with "x-", to indicate that is a non-registered name.  Of course, after registration this flag can disappear which adds  to  the  confusion.
             The simplified string has the "x-" thingies removed and are translated to lower-case.

           system => REGEX
             Regular expression which defines for which systems this rule is valid.  The REGEX is matched on $^O.

           type => STRING
             The type which is defined here.  It consists of a type and a sub-type, both case-insensitive.  This module will return lower-case, but accept upper-case.

   Attributes
       $obj->charset()
           [2.28] RFC6657 prescribes that IANA registrations for text category types explicitly state their default character-set.  MIME-Types contains a manually produced list of these defaults.

           This method may also return "_REQUIRED", when there is no default, or "_FRAMED" when the charset is determined by the content.

       $obj->encoding()
           Returns the type of encoding which is required to transport data of this type safely.

       $obj->extensions()
           Returns a list of extensions which are known to be used for this mime type.

       $any->simplified( [$string] )
           Returns the simplified mime type for this object or the specified STRING.  Mime type names can get officially registered.  Until then, they have to carry an "x-" preamble to indicate that.  Of
           course, after recognition, the "x-" can disappear.  In many cases, we prefer the simplified version of the type.

           example: results of simplified()

             my $mime = MIME::Type->new(type => 'x-appl/x-zip');
             print $mime->simplified;                     # 'appl/zip'

             print $mime->simplified('text/PLAIN');       # 'text/plain'
             print MIME::Type->simplified('x-xyz/x-abc'); # 'xyz/abc'

       $obj->system()
           Returns the regular expression which can be used to determine whether this type is active on the system where you are working on.

       $obj->type()
           Returns the long type of this object, for instance 'text/plain'

   Knowledge
       $obj->defaultCharset()
           [2.29] As per RFC6657, all "text/*" types must either specify a default charset in its IANA registration, or require the charset parameter.  Non-text types may require a charset as well.

           It is hard to extract this information from the IANA registration files automagically, so is manually maintained.

           example: default charset use

              $charset //= $type->defaultCharset // 'utf-8';

       $obj->equals($string|$mime)
           Compare this mime-type object with a STRING or other object.  In case of a STRING, simplification will take place.

       $obj->isAscii()
           Old name for isText().

       $obj->isBinary()
           Returns "true" when the type is not known to be text.  See isText().

       $obj->isExperimental()
           [2.00] Return "true" when the type is defined for experimental use; the subtype starts with "x."

       $obj->isPersonal()
           [2.00] Return "true" when the type is defined by a person for private use; the subtype starts with "prs."

       $obj->isRegistered()
           Mime-types  which are not registered by IANA nor defined in RFCs shall start with an "x-".  This counts for as well the media-type as the sub-type.  In case either one of the types starts with
           "x-" this method will return "false".

       $obj->isSignature()
           Returns "true" when the type is in the list of known signatures.

       $obj->isText()
           [2.05] All types which may have the charset attribute, are text.  However, there is currently no record of attributes in this module... so we guess.

       $obj->isVendor()
           [2.00] Return "true" when the type is defined by a vendor; the subtype starts with "vnd."

       $obj->mediaType()
           The media type of the simplified mime.  For 'text/plain' it will return 'text'.

           For historical reasons, the 'mainType' method still can be used to retrieve the same value.  However, that method is deprecated.

       $obj->subType()
           The sub type of the simplified mime.  For 'text/plain' it will return 'plain'.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Error: Type parameter is obligatory.
           When a MIME::Type object is created, the type itself must be specified with the "type" option flag.  Cast by new()
