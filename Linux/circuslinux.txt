NAME
       circuslinux - The clowns are trying to pop balloons to score points!

SYNOPSIS
       circuslinux [--disable-sound] [--fullscreen] [--low] | [--digital] [--paddle] [--help | --usage] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in /usr/share/doc/circuslinux/README.gz

       "Circus Linux!" is based on the Atari 2600 game "Circus Atari" by Atari,
        released in 1980. Gameplay is similar to "Breakout" and "Arkanoid"- you
        slide a device left and right to bounce objects into the air which destroy
        a wall.

OPTIONS
   --disable-sound
       If sound support was compiled in, this will disable it for this session of the game.

   --fullscreen
       Run in fullscreen mode.

   --low
       Disable  some features so that the game might run better on low-end hardware.  Titlescreen ballons and game backgrounds are disabled, and the game screen refreshes every 1/15th of a second instead
       of 1/30th of a second.

   --digital
       When using a joystick, left and right cause the teeter-totter to move incrementally.  (This is as opposed to the default mode, where the analog position of the joystick is used literally.)  Useful
       for playing with a digital gamepad.

   --paddle
       For using real Atari 2600 paddles connected to a your PC's joystick port.

   --help
       Display a help message summarizing command-line options, copyright, and game controls.

   --usage
       Display a brief message summarizing command-line options.

   --version
       Display the version of Circus Linux! you're running.

CONTROL
   Starting
       Launch a clown by pressing RETURN, ALT or SHIFT or the Mouse/Joystick button.

   Controlling the Teeter-Totter
       Move the mouse/joystick left and right or press the left and right arrow keys to move the teeter-totter left and right.

       If a clown is in the air, you can also click any of the mouse buttons to flip the teeter-totter.  (This causes the low and high ends of the teeter-totter to change places, useful when the  teeter-
       totter is at a far side of the screen and the low end is on the outside.)

   Pausing
       To pause the game, you can press either the [SPACE], [TAB] or [P] key.  To unpause, press one of those keys again.

   Quitting
       To quit the current game, you can press [ESCAPE].  This forfeits your game (as though you ran out of lives).

       To quit Circus Linux! altogether, you can use your window manager's close command or press EXIT on the title screen.
