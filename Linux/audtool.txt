NAME
       audtool - a small tool to control Audacious from the command line.

SYNOPSIS
       audtool [instance] command [parameter ...] ...

DESCRIPTION
       audtool sends commands to a running instance of Audacious.

       It can send many common commands, such as to skip to the next song in the playlist, and can also print status information, such as the title of the current song.

       instance may be given as -1, -2, etc. (up to -9) to specify which instance of Audacious to control when multiple instances have been started.

COMMANDS
   Current song information:
       --current-song
              Print  the  formatted  title of the current song.  Depending on Audacious settings, this may include information such as the artist and album name.  To print only the song title, use --current-
              song-tuple-data title instead.

       --current-song-filename
              Print the file name (full path or URI) of the current song.

              Print the length of the current song in M:SS format.

       --current-song-length-seconds
              Print the length of the current song in seconds.

       --current-song-length-frames
              Print the length of the current song in milliseconds.

       --current-song-output-length
              Print the playback time counter in M:SS format.

       --current-song-output-length-seconds
              Print the playback time counter in seconds.

       --current-song-output-length-frames
              Print the playback time counter in milliseconds.

       --current-song-bitrate-kbps
              Print the streaming bitrate in kilobits per second (1 kilobit = 1000 bits).

   Playback commands:
       --playback-play

       --playback-pause
              Pause playback, or resume if already paused.

       --playback-playpause

       --playback-stop
              Stop playback.

       --playback-playing
              Return an exit code of 0 (true) if playback is active.

       --playback-paused
              Return an exit code of 0 (true) if playback is paused.

       --playback-stopped
              Return an exit code of 0 (true) if playback is not active.

   Playlist selection:
       --select-displayed
              Specifies that any subsequent playlist commands should apply to the playlist currently displayed by Audacious, regardless of which playlist is playing.  This setting takes effect  until  it  is
              overridden by --select-playing or Audacious is restarted.

              The following commands are also affected:
                     --current-song
                     --current-song-filename
                     --current-song-length[-seconds,-frames]
                     --current-song-tuple-data

       --select-playing
              Specifies  that  when  playback  is active, any subsequent playlist commands should apply to the playlist currently playing.  When playback is stopped, the behavior is the same as --select-dis‐
              played.  This setting is the default.

   Playlist commands:
       --playlist-advance
