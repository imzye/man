NAME
       Test::Mock::Redis - use in place of Redis for unit testing

VERSION
       Version 0.22

SYNOPSIS
       Test::Mock::Redis can be used in place of Redis for running tests without needing a running redis instance.

           use Test::Mock::Redis;

           my $redis = Test::Mock::Redis->new(server => 'whatever');

           $redis->set($key, 'some value');

           $redis->get($key);

           ...

       This module is designed to function as a drop in replacement for Redis.pm for testing purposes.

       See perldoc Redis and the redis documentation at <http://redis.io>

PERSISTENCE
       The "connection" to the mocked server (and its stored data) will persist beyond the object instance, just like a real Redis server. This means that you do not need to save the instance to this
       object in order to preserve your data; simply call "new" with the same server parameter and the same instance will be returned, with all data preserved.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   new
           Create a new Test::Mock::Redis object.

           It can be used in place of a Redis object for unit testing.

           It accepts the "server" argument, just like Redis.pm's new.

   num_databases
       Redis ships with a default of 16 databases, and that's what this module handles by default. If you need to change that, do

           use Test::Mock::Redis num_databases => 21;

       or at run-time

           Test::Mock::Redis::change_num_databases(21);

PIPELINING
       See "PIPELINING" in Redis -- most methods support the use of a callback sub as the final argument. For this implementation, the callback sub will be called immediately (before the result of the
       original method is returned), and "wait_all_responses" does nothing.  Combining pipelining with "multi"/"exec" is not supported.

TODO
       Lots!

       Not all Redis functionality is implemented.  The test files that output "TODO" are still to be done.

       The top of all test files [except 01-basic.t] has the list of commands tested or to-be tested in the file.

       Those marked with an "x" are pretty well-tested.  Those marked with an "o" need help.  Those that are unmarked have no tests, or are un-implemented.  For example:

       x   AUTH          <--- has some tests

       o   KEYS          <--- only partially tested and/or implemented

           ZINTERSTORE   <--- not tested (or maybe not implemented)

       Beyond that, it would be neat to add methods to inspect how often keys were accessed and get other information that allows the module user to confirm that their code interacted with redis (or
       Test::Mock::Redis) as they expected.
