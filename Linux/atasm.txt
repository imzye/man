ATASM(1)                    General Commands Manual                   ATASM(1)

NAME
       atasm  -  assembler  targeted for the 6502 CPU with Atari-specific fea‐
       tures

SYNOPSIS
       atasm [options] filename

DESCRIPTION
       atasm assembles 6502 code to an Atari DOS executable, an Atari XFD disk
       image, or a raw binary file.

       The  syntax  used  is compatible with the Atari 8-bit assembler MAC/65,
       with a few extensions (notably 6502 illegal opcode support)

OPTIONS
       -ofilename
              saves the object file to filename instead of sourcefile [.65o]

       -Dsymbol=value
              Defines symbol to value before assembly begins. This is  equiva‐
              lent to inserting a line like symbol=value before the first line
              of the source file.

       -Idirectory
              specifies a search directory for .INCLUDE directives

       -v     prints assembly trace.

       -s     prints symbol table when assembly is completed.

       -u     enables undocumented opcodes.  This is equivalent to  using  the
              .OPTILL  in  the  source  file.   Notice  that this command-line
              paramter is overriden by any directives in the source files.

       -mfilename
              defines the template emulator state file.

       -xfilename
              saves object file to .XFD image filename

       -r     saves object code as a raw binary image

       -fvalue
              set the raw binary fill byte to value
