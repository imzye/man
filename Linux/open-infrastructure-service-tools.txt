DEVELOPMENT
       Bug  reports,  feature requests, help, patches, support and everything else are welcome on the Open Infrastructure Software Mailing List ( <https://lists.open-infrastructure.net/listinfo/software>
       ).

       Please base patches against the 'next' Git branch using common sense ( <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches> ).

       Debian specific bugs can also be reported in the Debian Bug Tracking System ( <https://bugs.debian.org> ).

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
       Changing from one icon set to the other requires a reload of the apache webserver.

USAGE
       The default icon theme is determined by the /usr/share/apache-icons/default (and /usr/share/apache-icons/default.conf respectivly) file.

       On Debian based system "sudo update-alternatives --config apache-icons" can be used to automatically select the active icon theme (including the default apache icons).

       The following themes are available:

          • awesome-png: Fork Awesome based, PNG format

          • awesome-svg: Fork Awesome based, SVG format

          • tango-png: Tango Icons based, PNG format

          • tango-svg: Tango Icons based, SVG format

       The SVG themes are preferable because they are sharper and scale losless.  Very old browser can not render SVG icons, use PNG if that is a concern.

       An example of the tango-svg theme can be seen on
        <https://get.open-infrastructure.net> .
