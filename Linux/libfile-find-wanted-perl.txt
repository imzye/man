NAME
       File::Find::Wanted - More obvious wrapper around File::Find

VERSION
       Version 1.00

SYNOPSIS
       File::Find is a great module, except that it doesn't actually find anything.  Its find() function walks a directory tree and calls a callback function.  Unfortunately, the callback function is
       deceptively called "wanted", which implies that it should return a boolean saying whether you want the file.  That's not how it works.

       Most of the time you call find(), you just want to build a list of files.  There are other modules that do this for you, most notably Richard Clamp's great File::Find::Rule, but in many cases,
       it's overkill, and you need to learn a new syntax.

       With the "find_wanted" function, you supply a callback sub and a list of starting directories, but the sub actually should return a boolean saying whether you want the file in your list or not.

       To get a list of all files ending in .jpg:

           my @files = find_wanted( sub { -f && /\.jpg$/ }, $dir );

       For a list of all directories that are not CVS or .svn:

           my @files = find_wanted( sub { -d && !/^(CVS|\.svn)$/ }, $dir ) );

       It's easy, direct, and simple.

WHY DO THIS?
       The cynical may say "that's just the same as doing this":

           my @files;
           find( sub { push @files, $File::Find::name if -f && /\.jpg$/ }, $dir );

       Sure it is, but File::Find::Wanted makes it more obvious, and saves a line of code.  That's worth it to me.  I'd like it if find_wanted() made its way into the File::Find distro, but for now, this
       will do.

FUNCTIONS
   find_wanted( &wanted, @directories )
       Descends through @directories, calling the wanted function as it finds each file.  The function returns a list of all the files and directories for which the wanted function returned a true value.

       This is just a wrapper around File::Find::find().  See File::Find for details on how to modify its behavior.
