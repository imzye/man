DESCRIPTION
       From the MAGE-OM documentation for the "MismatchInformation" class:

       Describes how a reporter varies from its ReporterCharacteristics sequence(s) or how a Feature varies from its Reporter sequence.

INHERITANCE
       Bio::MAGE::DesignElement::MismatchInformation has the following superclasses:

       •   Bio::MAGE::Extendable

CLASS METHODS
       The following methods can all be called without first having an instance of the class via the Bio::MAGE::DesignElement::MismatchInformation->methodname() syntax.

       new()
       new(%args)
           The object constructor "new()" accepts the following optional named-value style arguments:

           •   startCoord

               Sets the value of the "startCoord" attribute

           •   newSequence

               Sets the value of the "newSequence" attribute

           •   replacedLength

               Sets the value of the "replacedLength" attribute

           •   propertySets

               Sets the value of the "propertySets" association (this association was inherited from class "Bio::MAGE::Extendable").

               The value must be of type: array of "Bio::MAGE::NameValueType".

       $obj = class->new(%parameters)
           The "new()" method is the class constructor.

           Parameters: if given a list of name/value parameters the corresponding slots, attributes, or associations will have their initial values set by the constructor.

           Return value: It returns a reference to an object of the class.

           Side effects: It invokes the "initialize()" method if it is defined by the class.

       @names = class->get_slot_names()
           The "get_slot_names()" method is used to retrieve the name of all slots defined in a given class.

           NOTE: the list of names does not include attribute or association names.

           Return value: A list of the names of all slots defined for this class.

           Side effects: none

       @name_list = get_attribute_names()
           returns the list of attribute data members for this class.

       @name_list = get_association_names()
           returns the list of association data members for this class.

       @class_list = get_superclasses()
           returns the list of superclasses for this class.

       @class_list = get_subclasses()
           returns the list of subclasses for this class.

       $name = class_name()
           Returns the full class name for this class.

       $package_name = package_name()
           Returns the base package name (i.e. no 'namespace::') of the package that contains this class.

       %assns = associations()
           returns the association meta-information in a hash where the keys are the association names and the values are "Association" objects that provide the meta-information for the association.

INSTANCE METHODS
       $obj_copy = $obj->new()
           When  invoked  with  an  existing  object  reference  and not a class name, the "new()" method acts as a copy constructor - with the new object's initial values set to be those of the existing
           object.

           Parameters: No input parameters  are used in the copy  constructor, the initial values are taken directly from the object to be copied.

           Return value: It returns a reference to an object of the class.

           Side effects: It invokes the "initialize()" method if it is defined by the class.

       $obj->set_slots(%parameters)
       $obj->set_slots(\@name_list, \@value_list)
           The "set_slots()" method is used to set a number of slots at the same time. It has two different invocation methods. The first takes a named parameter list, and  the  second  takes  two  array
           references.

           Return value: none

           Side effects: will call "croak()" if a slot_name is used that the class does not define.

       @obj_list = $obj->get_slots(@name_list)
           The "get_slots()" method is used to get the values of a number of slots at the same time.

           Return value: a list of instance objects

           Side effects: none

       $val = $obj->set_slot($name,$val)
           The "set_slot()" method sets the slot $name to the value $val

           Return value: the new value of the slot, i.e. $val

           Side effects: none

       $val = $obj->get_slot($name)
           The "get_slot()" method is used to get the values of a number of slots at the same time.

           Return value: a single slot value, or undef if the slot has not been initialized.

           Side effects: none

   ATTRIBUTES
       Attributes  are  simple  data types that belong to a single instance of a class. In the Perl implementation of the MAGE-OM classes, the interface to attributes is implemented using separate setter
       and getter methods for each attribute.

       "Bio::MAGE::DesignElement::MismatchInformation" has the following attribute accessor methods:

       startCoord
           Methods for the "startCoord" attribute.

           From the MAGE-OM documentation:

           Offset into the sequence that the mismatch occurs.

           $val = $mismatchinformation->setStartCoord($val)
               The restricted setter method for the "startCoord" attribute.

               Input parameters: the value to which the "startCoord" attribute will be set

           $val = $mismatchinformation->getStartCoord()
               The restricted getter method for the "startCoord" attribute.

               Input parameters: none

               Return value: the current value of the "startCoord" attribute

               Side effects: none

               Exceptions: will call "croak()" if any input parameters are specified

           Methods for the "newSequence" attribute.

           From the MAGE-OM documentation:

           The sequence that replaces the specified sequence starting at start_coord.

           $val = $mismatchinformation->setNewSequence($val)
               The restricted setter method for the "newSequence" attribute.

               Input parameters: the value to which the "newSequence" attribute will be set

               Return value: the current value of the "newSequence" attribute

               Side effects: none

               Exceptions: will call "croak()" if no input parameters are specified, or if too many input parameters are specified

           $val = $mismatchinformation->getNewSequence()
               The restricted getter method for the "newSequence" attribute.

               Input parameters: none

               Return value: the current value of the "newSequence" attribute

               Side effects: none

               Exceptions: will call "croak()" if any input parameters are specified

       replacedLength
           Methods for the "replacedLength" attribute.

           From the MAGE-OM documentation:

           Length of the original sequence that is replaced.  A deletion is specified when the length of the newSequence is less than the replacedLength.

           $val = $mismatchinformation->setReplacedLength($val)
               The restricted setter method for the "replacedLength" attribute.

               Input parameters: the value to which the "replacedLength" attribute will be set

               Return value: the current value of the "replacedLength" attribute

               Input parameters: none

               Return value: the current value of the "replacedLength" attribute

               Side effects: none

               Exceptions: will call "croak()" if any input parameters are specified

   ASSOCIATIONS
       Associations are references to other classes. Associations in MAGE-OM have a cardinality that determines the minimum and maximum number of instances of the 'other' class that maybe included in the
       association:

       1.  There must be exactly one item in the association, i.e. this is a mandatory data field.

       2.  0..1

           There may be one item in the association, i.e. this is an optional data field.

       3.  1..N

           There must be one or more items in the association, i.e. this is a mandatory data field, with list cardinality.

       4.  0..N

           There may be one or more items in the association, i.e. this is an optional data field, with list cardinality.

       Bio::MAGE::DesignElement::MismatchInformation has the following association accessor methods:

       propertySets
           Methods for the "propertySets" association.

           From the MAGE-OM documentation:

           Allows specification of name/value pairs.  Meant to primarily help in-house, pipeline processing of instances by providing a place for values that aren't part of the specification proper.

           $array_ref = $mismatchinformation->setPropertySets($array_ref)
               The restricted setter method for the "propertySets" association.

               Input parameters: the value to which the "propertySets" association will be set : a reference to an array of objects of type "Bio::MAGE::NameValueType"

               Return value: the current value of the "propertySets" association : a reference to an array of objects of type "Bio::MAGE::NameValueType"

               Side effects: none

               Exceptions: will call "croak()" if no input parameters are specified, or  if  too  many  input  parameters  are  specified,  or  if  $array_ref  is  not  a  reference  to  an  array  class
               "Bio::MAGE::NameValueType" instances

           $array_ref = $mismatchinformation->getPropertySets()
               The restricted getter method for the "propertySets" association.

               Input parameters: none

               Return value: the current value of the "propertySets" association : a reference to an array of objects of type "Bio::MAGE::NameValueType"

               Side effects: none

               Exceptions: will call "croak()" if any input parameters are specified

           $val = $mismatchinformation->addPropertySets(@vals)
               Because the propertySets association has list cardinality, it may store more than one value. This method adds the current list of objects in the propertySets association.

               Input parameters: the list of values @vals to add to the propertySets association. NOTE: submitting a single value is permitted.

               Return value: the number of items stored in the slot after adding @vals

               Side effects: none

               Exceptions: will call "croak()" if no input parameters are specified, or if any of the objects in @vals is not an instance of class "Bio::MAGE::NameValueType"

           sub initialize {

             my $self = shift;
             return 1;

           }

SLOTS, ATTRIBUTES, AND ASSOCIATIONS
       In the Perl implementation of MAGE-OM classes, there are three types of class data members: "slots", "attributes", and "associations".

   SLOTS
       This  API uses the term "slot" to indicate a data member of the class that was not present in the UML model and is used for mainly internal purposes - use only if you understand the inner workings
       of the API. Most often slots are used by generic methods such as those in the XML writing and reading classes.

       Slots are implemented using unified getter/setter methods:

       $var = $obj->slot_name();
           Retrieves the current value of the slot.

       $new_var = $obj->slot_name($new_var);
           Store $new_var in the slot - the return value is also $new_var.

       @names = $obj->get_slot_names()
           Returns the list of all slots in the class.

       DATA CHECKING: No data type checking is made for these methods.

   ATTRIBUTES AND ASSOCIATIONS
       The terms "attribute" and "association" indicate data members of the class that were specified directly from the UML model.

       In the Perl implementation of MAGE-OM classes, association and attribute accessors are implemented using three separate methods:

       get*
           Retrieves the current value.

           NOTE: For associations, if the association has list cardinality, an array reference is returned.

           DATA CHECKING: Ensure that no argument is provided.

       set*
           Sets the current value, replacing any existing value.

           NOTE: For associations, if the association has list cardinality, the argument must be an array reference. Because of this, you probably should be using the add* methods.

           DATA CHECKING: For attributes, ensure that a single value is provided as the argument. For associations, if the association has list cardinality, ensure that the argument is a reference to  an
           array of instances of the correct MAGE-OM class, otherwise ensure that there is a single argument of the correct MAGE-OM class.

       add*
           NOTE: Only present in associations with list cardinality.

           Appends a list of objects to any values that may already be stored in the association.

           DATA CHECKING: Ensure that all arguments are of the correct MAGE-OM class.

   GENERIC METHODS
       The unified base class of all MAGE-OM classes, "Bio::MAGE::Base", provides a set of generic methods that will operate on slots, attributes, and associations:

       $val = $obj->get_slot($name)
       \@list_ref = $obj->get_slots(@name_list);
       $val = $obj->set_slot($name,$val)
       $obj->set_slots(%parameters)
       $obj->set_slots(\@name_list, \@value_list)
           See elsewhere in this page for a detailed description of these methods.
