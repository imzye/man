NAME
       horst.conf - configuration file for horst(8)

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/horst.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  file  /etc/horst.conf is the default configuration file. The configuration file consists of zero or more lines.  Each line must be either EMPTY, COMMENT or OPTION and must end with a new line
       character ('\n', ASCII 0xa).

       EMPTY lines must have zero or more spaces (' ', ASCII 0x20).

       COMMENT lines must begin with a hash sign ('#', ASCII 0x23).

       OPTION lines must be in the following form:

              option[=value]

       Options and their acceptable values are described below in section OPTIONS.

       Lines not matching the format described above will cause horst to exit with non-zero status.

OPTIONS
       channel=CHANNEL_NUMBER
              Set the initial channel number to which horst tunes the radio at startup.

       channel_dwell=MILLISECONDS
              Set the time horst scans each channel when channel_scan=1 is defined.

       channel_scan
              Make horst change/scan channels automatically in ascending numeric order.

       channel_scan_rounds=N
              Set the number of rounds horst scans the channel range when channel_scan=1 is defined. When N is reached, horst exits with zero status. If N is a negative number, horst  scans  the  channel
              range infinitely.

       channel_upper=CHANNEL_NUMBER
              Set the highest channel horst will change to when channel_scan=1 is defined. When CHANNEL_NUMBER is reached, the next channel will be 1.

       client=SERVER_ADDRESS
              Run horst in client mode and connect to a server running in SERVER_ADDRESS.

       control_pipe=FILEPATH
              Accept control commands on a named pipe.

       display_interval=MILLISECONDS
              Set the refresh interval of the user interface display. This option can be used to reduce CPU load by using longer intervals.

       display_view=history|essid|statistics|spectrum
              Set the initial display view.

       filter_bssid=BSSID[,BSSID]...
              Ignore all packets except packets belonging to BSSID.

       filter_mac=MAC_ADDRESS[,MAC_ADDRESS]...
              Ignore all packets except packets originating from MAC_ADDRESS.

       filter_mode=MODE[,MODE]...
              Ignore all packets/nodes except packets/nodes of mode MODE.

       filter_packet=PACKET_TYPE[,PACKET_TYPE]...
              Ignore all packets except packets of type PACKET_TYPE.

       interface=INTERFACE_NAME
              Set  the  wireless interface which horst uses to monitor the radio spectrum. If interface INTERFACE_NAME is not already in monitor mode at startup, horst first tries to put the interface in
              monitor mode and if it fails, a temporary virtual monitor interface is added and used instead. The name of the temporary virtual monitor interface is in the form  horst[0-9]+.  The  virtual
              interface created by horst is deleted at exit.

       add_monitor
              Always add virtual monitor interface. Don't try to set existing interface to monitor mode.

       mac_names=FILEPATH
              The  file  containing  a  mapping  from  MAC  addresses  to  host  names.  The  file  can  either  be a dhcp.leases file from dnsmasq or contain mappings in the form "MAC<space>name" (e.g.:
              "00:01:02:03:04:05 test") line by line.

       node_timeout=SECONDS
              Set the time after nodes will be removed if no frames have been received from them.

       outfile=FILEPATH
              Write information about each received packet to FILEPATH.

       port=PORT_NUMBER
              Set the port horst listens to when run in server mode or the port which horst connects to when run in client mode.

       quiet  Make horst less verbose and suppress the user interface.

       receive_buffer=BYTES
              Set the size of the receive buffer. This option can be used to tune memory consumption and reduce packet loss under high load.

       server Run horst in server mode.
