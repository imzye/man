NAME
       gpstrans - communicate with Garmin GPS receiver

SYNOPOSIS
       gpstrans [ options ]  [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       gpstrans  allows  the  user  with a Garmin GPS receiver to upload and download waypoints, routes, almanacs (satellite orbital elements) and trackroutes.  If file is not supplied, data will be read
       from stdin (-ux switch) or written to stdout (-dx switch).

OPTIONS
       -pport set serial I/O device

       -s     set datum, format, offset, and device interactively, and save them in $HOME/.gpstrans.

       -i     identify connected GPS

       -o     turn off GPS device

       -t     get time from GPS

       -ts    get time from GPS and set system time on host

       -dx    download data indicated by x: r=route, t=track, w=waypoint, a=almanac

       -m     With -dt, downloads track data in the format which can be displayed by Mayko mXmap(1).  With -dr or -ur, downloads or uploads route data in a format compatible with Mayko mXmap.

       -ux    upload data indicated by x: r=route, t=track, w=waypoint, a=almanac

       -v     print program version.

       --verbose
              Increase verbosity.

       --debug
              Add debug printouts.

       --help Print help text.

CONNECTION
       For a DB-25 connector, you may need to connect pin 4, 5 and 6, 8, 20 together. This sets handshake signals so that your workstation can use the serial port to communicate with the GPS.

                               1     ### #####
                               o o o # # # o # o o o o o
                                o o o o o o # o o o o o

       Connect the Garmin cable as follows:

                                 2 3       7
                               o o o o o o o o o o o o o
                                o o o o o o o o o o o o

            Pin 2 goes to DATA IN  (White)
            Pin 3 goes to DATA OUT (Brown)
            Pin 7 goes to GROUND   (Black)

       If it doesn't work in this way, try exchanging pins 2 and 3 at the connector.

       The circular connector on a Garmin GPS II receiver can be wired to a DB-9 connector as follows:

               DB-9 pin 2 goes to circular connector pin 2
               DB-9 pin 3 goes to circular connector pin 4
               DB-9 pin 5 goes to circular connector pin 3
               other pins are not connected

               (Note: the pin numbers for the circular connector are
               arbitrary, and may not match the `official' numbers.)

        If your plug is more recent than the one above (ex: etrex) then you need DB-9 or DB-25 to be connected to your Garmin GPS like this:

                                              _____,-----,
                                   POWER(+)  |     |     |

                                   DATA OUT  |     |     |    ||
                                   GROUND(-) |_____|     |    ||
                                                   `-----'    ||
                                                              ||
                                                              ||
                                                              ||
                                                              ||
                                                              ||

            Pin 2 goes to DATA IN  (White)      Pin 3 goes to DATA OUT (Brown)      Pin 7 goes to GROUND   (Black)

                                               o o o o

                pin 2 goes to DATA IN  (White)
                pin 3 goes to DATA OUT (Brown)
                pin 5 goes to GROUND   (Black)
                other pins are not connected

       For testing, you might try setting the GPS to NMEA-Output and using a terminal emulator program like Kermit. The GPS will send a data record every 2 seconds. As long as you don't see any  data  on
       your computer, gpstrans won't work.

       After finishing the test, be sure to set your GPS receiver to GRMN/GRMN.

ENVIRONMENT
       GPSDEV Serial I/O device (overrides contents of $HOME/.gpstrans, and is overridden by -p switch).

FILES
       $HOME/.gpstrans
              Has user preferences for datum, format, offset, and serial I/O device (see -s switch, above).
