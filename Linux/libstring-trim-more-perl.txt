NAME
       String::Trim::More - Various string trimming utilities

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.03 of String::Trim::More (from Perl distribution String-Trim-More), released on 2017-01-27.

DESCRIPTION
       This is an alternative to String::Trim (and similar modules, see "SEE ALSO"). Instead of a single "trim" function, this module provides several from which you can choose on, depending on your
       needs.

FUNCTIONS
   ltrim($str) => STR
       Trim whitespaces (including newlines) at the beginning of string. Equivalent to:

        $str =~ s/\A\s+//s;

   ltrim_lines($str) => STR
       Trim whitespaces (not including newlines) at the beginning of each line of string. Equivalent to:

        $str =~ s/^\s+//mg;

   rtrim($str) => STR
       Trim whitespaces (including newlines) at the end of string. Equivalent to:

        $str =~ s/[ \t]+\z//s;

   rtrim_lines($str) => STR
       Trim whitespaces (not including newlines) at the end of each line of string. Equivalent to:

        $str =~ s/[ \t]+$//mg;

   trim($str) => STR
       ltrim + rtrim.

   trim_lines($str) => STR
       ltrim_lines + rtrim_lines.

   trim_blank_lines($str) => STR
       Trim blank lines at the beginning and the end. Won't trim blank lines in the middle. Blank lines include lines with only whitespaces in them.

   ellipsis($str[, $maxlen, $ellipsis]) => STR
       Return $str unmodified if $str's length is less than $maxlen (default 80).  Otherwise cut $str to ($maxlen - length($ellipsis)) and append $ellipsis (default '...') at the end.
