NAME
       vidcat - capture a frame from a video4linux device

SYNOPSIS
       vidcat [-h?blgV] [-d <device>] [-f jpeg|ppm|png] [-i tv|comp1|com1|s-video] [-n pal|ntsc|secam] [-q <1..100>] [-s WIDTHxHEIGHT] [-o <file>]

DESCRIPTION
       vidcat captures a frame from a video4linux device and writes the result to the standard output device. With the following options you can define output format, size etc..

OPTIONS
       -d device
              Use an alternate v4l device, '/dev/video' is the default device.

       -b     This applies only to PPM output. With this option the PPM ouput is written in binary mode.

       -f ppm|jpeg|png|yuv4mpeg
              Define the file format to use for the output stream. The default is "jpeg".

       -g     Use greyscale instead of RGB24 for the output data.

       -i tv|comp1|comp2|s-video
              Set the input channel to use. The default value is none, which means the preset of the device is used.

       -l     Loops until CTRL+C is pressed. This is the default for the YUV4MPEG output.

       -n pal|ntsc|secam
              Select the input norm for the grabbing device. The default value is none.

       -o file
              Use the named file for output instead of standard out.

       -p c|g|y|Y
              Set the palette to use: c = RGB24, g=GREY, y=YUV420P, Y=YUV422P.

       -q 1..100
              Set the quality for JPEG output. The value could be a number between 1 and 100. The default value is 80.

       -s WIDTHxHEIGHT
              Define the size of the output frame in pixels. The default setting is 320x240.

       -V     Show version number and exit.
