NAME
       Astro::FITS::Header::GSD - Manipulate FITS headers from GSD files

SYNOPSIS
         use Astro::FITS::Header::GSD;

         $hdr = new Astro::FITS::Header::GSD( Cards => \@cards );
         $hdr = new Astro::FITS::Header::GSD( gsdobj => $gsd );
         $hdr = new Astro::FITS::Header::GSD( File => $file );

DESCRIPTION
       This module makes use of the Starlink GSD module to read from a GSD header.

       It stores information about a FITS header block in an object. Takes an hash as an argument, with either an array reference pointing to an array of FITS header cards, or a filename, or
       (alternatively) a GSD object.

METHODS
       configure
           Reads a header from a GSD file.

             $hdr->configure( Cards => \@cards );
             $hdr->configure( Items => \@items );
             $hdr->configure( gsdobj => $gsd );
             $hdr->configure( File => $filename );

           Accepts a GSD object or a filename. If both "gsdobj" and "File" keys exist, "gsdobj" key takes priority.

       writehdr
           The GSD library is read-only. The writehdr method is not implemented for this sub-class.

NOTES
       This module requires the Starlink GSD module.

       GSD supports keys that are longer than the 8 characters allowed as part of the FITS standard. GSD keys are truncated to 8 characters by this module.
