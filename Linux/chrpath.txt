NAME
       chrpath - change the rpath or runpath in binaries

SYNOPSIS
       chrpath [ -v | --version ] [ -d | --delete ] [ -r <path> |  --replace <path> ] [ -c | --convert ] [ -l | --list ] [ -h | --help ] <program> [ <program> ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       chrpath changes, lists or removes the rpath or runpath setting in a binary.  The rpath, or runpath if it is present, is where the runtime linker should look for the libraries needed for a program.

OPTIONS
       -v | --version
              Display program version number

       -d | --delete
              Delete current rpath or runpath setting

       -c | --convert
              Convert the rpath setting into a runpath setting

       -r <path> | --replace <path>
              Replace current rpath or runpath setting with the path given.  The new path must be shorter or the same length as the current path.

       -k | --keepgoing
              Do not fail on first error, but process all arguments before returning the error.

       -l | --list
              List the current rpath or runpath (default)

       -h | --help
              Show usage information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      If all operations were successful

       >0     if one of the operations failed.  A failing operation terminates the program unless -k is specified.

BUGS
       This program cannot create an RPATH tag if the ELF does not have one, and it can only replace an RPATH with one of equal or shorter length. (Moving ELF sections following a lengthened string table
       would be difficult and error-prone at best, and is sometimes outright impossible due to issues like limited ranges in jump instructions.)
