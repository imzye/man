NAME
       dbic_form_generator - Generate HTML form from DB schema with DBIC

DESCRIPTION
       Using the database passed in the command option, dbic_form_generator will query the DB for a schema and generate a HTML form to update the content of the DB.

       Options:

         rs_name       -- Resultset Name
         schema_name   -- Schema Name
         db_dsn        -- dsn connect info
         class_prefix  -- [OPTIONAL] Prefix for generated classes (Default: '')
         label         -- [OPTIONAL] Flag to toggle generation of form labels (Default: 0)
         label_column  -- [OPTIONAL] Flag to toggle generation of dummy form labels_columns for type: 'select' (Default: 0)

       This package should be considered still experimental since the output, of the generated classes will be changed from time to time.  This should not impact the main usage for this module that we
       had in mind, that is generating the initial version of a FormHandler form class, copying it to the project and modifying it.

       This script is installed into the system with the rest of FormHandler.
