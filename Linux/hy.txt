NAME
       hy - a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python

SYNOPSIS
       hy [<file.hy>]

DESCRIPTION
       Hy  (or "Hylang" for long) is a multi-paradigm general-purpose programming language in the Lisp family. It's implemented as a kind of alternative syntax for Python. Compared to Python, Hy offers a
       variety of extra features, generalizations, and syntactic simplifications, as would be expected of a Lisp.  Compared to other Lisps, Hy provides direct access to Python's built-ins and third-party
       Python libraries, while allowing you to freely mix imperative, functional, and object-oriented styles of programming.

       To get a list of allowable arguments to hy, type

              hy --help
