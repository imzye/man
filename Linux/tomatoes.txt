NAME
       tomatoes - Tomatoes smashing game

SYNOPSIS
       tomatoes

SYNOPSIS
       I Have No Tomatoes is an extreme leisure time activity idea of which culminates in the following question: How many tomatoes can you smash in ten short minutes? If you have the time to spare, this
       game has the vegetables just waiting to be eliminated!

NOTES
       Before  starting the game, you should know that the game uses OpenGL for hardware accelerated 2d & 3d graphics. This means that you must have fully OpenGL compatible graphics card in your PC. Your
       card also needs to be able to use 512x512 textures, and this rules out Voodoo 1, 2 and 3 (limited to 256x256 textures).

       As for the CPU and memory requirements, I'd recommend something along the lines of Pentium II (or an AMD equivalent) and 64MB. The game works on much slower systems as  well,  as  the  game  skips
       frames if the system can't keep up with the 60 FPS rate; this ensures that the game runs at the right speed, you just don't get very smooth animation.

       This  game  features solid game play with beautiful OpenGL API driven isometric 3d graphics and nice music. It also includes a MOD player, and you can use your own MOD-type music in the game back‐
       ground. Just copy your XM/S3M/IT/MOD - files to the music subdirectory of I Have No Tomatoes and the game plays them. You can press F1 to skip a song when ingame. There's room for 128  MODs.  Btw,
       if you don't have any MOD music, ModArchive (www.modarchive.com <URL:www.modarchive.com>) is a good place to download some.

CONFIGURATION
       You may also want to set some options, such as the screen resolution and color depth. By default, I Have No Tomatoes starts fullscreen in 800x600 resolution, 32bpp. To fine-tune the preferences to
       suit your PC better, open the file config.cfg in a text editor (Notepad will do). Under Unix this file is stored in ~/.tomatoes/.

       Most likely you'll be interested in these lines:

       • video_mode = 800 x 600

       • video_mode_color_depth = 32

       • video_mode_fullscreen = 1

       • sound_enabled = 1

       To  set  the  resolution,  change  the  video_mode  -  line  (some  common  resolutions  include  640  x  480,  800  x  600,  1024 x 768). Most common color depths are 16 and 32, and sometimes 24.
       video_mode_fullscreen controls whether the game starts in fullscreen or in a window. When running in windowed mode, you can use any resolution you want (the 4:3 aspect ratio modes are  still  pre‐
       ferred). If you don't have a sound card (or want to turn the sounds off), set sound_enabled to 0 (zero).

       Finally, if you want to know how many frames your system draws per second (FPS), set show_fps to 1. FPS should be over 60 for smooth animation.

       The default keys can be changed from the Options menu in game, so no need change them here.

       When you're satisfied with the config.cfg settings, by all means, proceed to start the game :)
