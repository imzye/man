NAME
       airracCommand-line utility for the C++ Simulated Revenue Accounting (RAC) System Library

SYNOPSIS
       airrac [--prefix] [-v|--version] [-h|--help] [-b|--builtin] [-i|--input <path-to-input>] [-l|--log <path-to-output-log-file>]

DESCRIPTION
       airrac is a small program showing how to use the AirRAC library.

       airrac accepts the following options:

       --prefix
        Show the AirRAC installation prefix.

       -v, --version
        Print the currently installed version of AirRAC on the standard output.

       -h, --help
        Produce that message and show usage.

       -b, --builtin
        The sample BOM tree can be either built-in or parsed from an input file. When that option is selected, an input file must then be given with the -y/--yield option. When that option is not selected,
       the airrac program builds a simple use case directly from internal hard-coded parameters (yield rules).

       -y, --yield <path-to-input-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the (CSV) input file specifying the yield rules.

       -l, --log <path-to-output-log-file>
        Path (absolute or relative) of the output log file.

       See the output of the `airrac --help' command for default options.
