NAME
       exactimage - image processing library

DESCRIPTION
       ExactImage is a fast C++ image processing library. Unlike many other library frameworks it allows operation in several color spaces and bit depths natively, resulting in low memory and
       computational requirements.

FILE FORMATS
       ExactImage supports the following file formats:

       •   BMP

       •   Digital camera RAW

       •   GIF

       •   JPEG

       •   JPEG2000

       •   OpenEXR

       •   PNG

       •   PBM

       •   RAW

       •   TIFF

       •   XPM

       •   SVG (read-only, partial support)

       •   PDF (write-only, allows embedding JPEG and JPEG2000, vector geometry and fonts, and writing multiple pages)

       •   PostScript (write-only, allows embedding JPEG)

       •   Encapsulated PostScript (write-only, allows embedding JPEG)

       •   PCX

       •   Targa, TGA
