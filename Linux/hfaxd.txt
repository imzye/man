HFAXD(8)                                                                                    System Manager's Manual                                                                                    HFAXD(8)

NAME
       hfaxd - HylaFAX client-server protocol server

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/hfaxd [ -d ] [ -q dir ] [ -o port ] [ -O ] [ -l bindaddress ] [ -i port ] [ -I ] [ -s port ] [ -S ]

DESCRIPTION
       hfaxd is the HylaFAX program that implements the server portion of:

       •  the client-server protocol and

       •  the Simple Network Paging Protocol (SNPP) used to submit message pager jobs to the IXO/TAP and UCP support.

       Additional client-server protocols are planned and hfaxd is intended to be the ``carrier'' through which they are supported.

       hfaxd  is  typically  used in one of two ways; either as a standalone process that is started at system boot time to listen for client connections on one or more ports (in which case the -i, -o, or -s
       option must be used), or as a subservient process to the inetd(8) program.  The two forms of use may however be combined so long as the same service is not provided both by the  standalone  hfaxd  and
       through inetd.

HYLAFAX (NEW) CLIENT-SERVER PROTOCOL SUPPORT
       If  hfaxd is started with the -i option it will service clients using the HylaFAX client-server protocol.  This protocol is strongly related to the Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP); so much so in
       fact that FTP client programs that include support for ``quoted commands'' may be used to communicate with hfaxd using the new protocol.  (It should also be possible to use FTP-aware  World  Wide  Web
       browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator to access HylaFAX servers through the new protocol; but the current format for information returned in directory listings confuses them.)

       The  hfaxd  server  currently recognizes the following protocol requests; case is not distinguished.  Entries marked with a ¹ can be used only when the client has established administrative privileges
       with ADMIN.

       The following non-standard or experimental commands are supported through the SITE request.

       Request          Description
       ADDMODEM¹        add/configure new modem for use
       ADDUSER¹         add client access control entry
       CONFIG¹          send configuration parameter setting to server
       DELMODEM¹        deconfigure/remove modem
       DELUSER¹         remove client access control entry
       TRIGGER          register realtime event trigger
       HELP             give help information, e.g., SITE HELP

       In addition FTP requests that are specified in Internet RFC 959 but not listed here are recognized, but not implemented.

       The hfaxd server will abort an active data transfer only when the ABOR command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream, as  de‐
       scribed in Internet RFC 959.  If a STAT command is received during a data transfer, preceded by a Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be returned.

SIMPLE NETWORK PAGING PROTOCOL (SNPP) SUPPORT
       If hfaxd is started with the -s option it will service clients using the Simple Network Pager Protocol (SNPP) as specified in RFC 1861 (which obsoletes RFC 1645).

       The hfaxd server currently recognizes the SNPP protocol requests listed below.  Requests marked with a ¹ are non-standard extensions to RFC 1861 that may be added to SNPP at some future time.  Case is
       not distinguished and only the first four characters of requests are used in identifying commands.

       Request      Description
       2WAY         preface a 2-way transaction
       ABOR¹        abort previous command
       ACKR         set read acknowledgement handling for subsequent requests
       ALER         set the alter-level for subsequent requests
       CALL         set the caller-ID for subsequent requests
       COVE         set the alternate coverage area for subsequent requests
       DATA         specify a multi-line message
       EXPT         set the expiration time for subsequent requests
       HELP         give help information
       HOLD         set the time at which subsequent requests are to be delivered
       KTAG         kill a previously submitted request
       LEVE         set the service level for subsequent requests
       LOGI         login to server
       MCRE         specify multiple response text and code
       MESS         specify a single-line message
       MSTA         return the status of a previously submitted request
       NOQU         disable message queueing
       PAGE         specify the destination pager
       PING         locate/validate a pager
       QUIT         terminate session
       RESE         reset server state
       RTYP         set the reply type code for subsequent requests
       SEND         send message(s)
       SITE¹        site-specific commands (see next section)
       STAT¹        return server status
       SUBJ         set the message text for subsequent requests

       The hfaxd server will abort an active SEND operation when an ABOR command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream.

       The following non-standard or experimental commands are also supported through the SITE request.

       Request        Description
       FROMUSER       specify the sender's identity
       IDLE           set idle-timer (in seconds)
       JPARM          query job parameter status
       JQUEUE         control whether or not job is queued
       LASTTIME       set the time to terminate an unfinished job
       MAILADDR       set the e-mail address to use for notification
       MAXDIALS       set the maximum number of times to dial the phone
       MAXTRIES       set the maximum number of times to try sending the page
       MODEM          set the modem or class of modems to use
       NOTIFY         set the e-mail notification
       RETRYTIME      set the time to delay between job retries
       SCHEDPRI       set the scheduling priority for the job
       HELP           give help information, e.g., SITE HELP

       Note that hfaxd requires that SNPP clients login first with the LOGI directive while RFC 1861 permits clients to submit pages anonymously.

CLIENT ACCESS CONTROL
       hfaxd controls client access according to the information in the file /var/spool/hylafax/etc/hosts.hfaxd.  This file defines the set of users and machines that may receive service and, optionally, de‐
       fines  password challenges to use in authenticating clients.  Clients may be permitted access to services with or without a password challenge.  Access may also be restricted based on the host machine
       that a request for service originates from.  Consult hosts.hfaxd(5) for information on the format and content of this file.  The SITE ADDUSER protocol request is provided for adding  new  users  to  a
       server (available only to clients with administrative privileges).

       Server  resources  are  controlled based on clients' identities.  Jobs and documents, both received and submitted, are protected by the server.  Typically clients are permitted access to anything they
       own or that is publicly accessible.  There are also administrative privileges that clients may acquire and which permit them wide access to objects that reside on the server.

       A complete client-server protocol specification is still outstanding.

       hfaxd operates with its root directory set to the top of the HylaFAX spooling area; /var/spool/hylafax.  This is done so that clients see a virtual file hierarchy that is completely  contained  within
       the  HylaFAX operating environment on the server machine.  Administrators however must be aware of this action when specifying files in the hfaxd configuration file: absolute pathnames relative to the
       root of the spooling should be used to specify filenames.

SERVER ACCESS CONTROL
       The file /var/spool/hylafax/etc/shutdown, when present, specifies when to restrict access to a server machine.  When this file is present and contains valid information hfaxd will  permit  only  users
       with  administrative privileges to access the server.  Any other users that request service will be denied access and negative server responses will include any shutdown message specified in the shut‐
       down file.  Consult hylafax-shutdown(5) for information on the format and content of this file.

       The SHUT protocol request can be used to schedule a server shutdown; it is available only to clients with administrative privileges.  To make a shutdown server available again the shutdown file can be
       deleted with the DELE protocol request (this is to be replaced with an ``unshut'' protocol request so that implementation details are not part of the protocol).

CONFIGURATION FILES
       hfaxd reads configuration information from the file /etc/hylafax/hfaxd.conf each time a new server process is started (i.e. for each new client).  This file uses the same conventions used by other Hy‐
       laFAX configuration files; as described in hylafax-config(5).  The following configuration parameters are recognized; items marked ``(SNPP)'' are used only by the SNPP support.
       Tag                      Type       Default                             Description

       XferLogFile              string     /var/spool/hylafax/etc/clientlog    name of file for logging client data transfers

       The configuration parameters are explained below:

       AllowSortFormat
                 This controls whether the server accept the *SORTFMT commands which the client issues to change the server sort the listings.

       FaxContact
                 The e-mail address to display as a point of contact in the help text returned to a client in response to the HELP or SITE HELP commands.  By default  this  is  ``FaxMaster@hostname'',  where
                 hostname is the fully qualified name for the machine where the server is running.

       FileFmt   The  format  string  to  use when returning file status information with the LIST and STAT commands.  Formats are specified using printf(3S) style conventions but using the field identifiers
                 listed below.  Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-8p for an 8-character  wide,  left-justified,  blank-padded  field
                 containing the file protection flags.

                 Format    Description
                 a         Last access time
                 c         Creation time
                 d         Device number (octal)
                 f         Filename
                 g         Group identifier (decimal)
                 i         Inode number (decimal)
                 l         Link count (decimal)
                 m         Last modification time
                 o         Owner (based on file GID)
                 p         Fax-style protection flags (no group bits)
                 q         UNIX-style protection flags
                 r         Root device number (octal)
                 s         File size in bytes (decimal)
                 u         User identifier (decimal)

                 The  default  format string is ``%-7p %3l %8o %8s %-12.12m %.48f''.  It is recommended that all items include a field width so that client applications that construct headers from the format
                 string can constrain the width of column title strings.

       FileSortFmt
                 The format string to use when sorting the listing for directories using the LIST command.  Follows the FileFmt formatting rules.

       IdleTimeout
                 The initial/default timeout to use in timing out idle clients.  This value defines the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that hfaxd will wait for a command from a client before terminating
                 the connection.  Unprivileged clients may alter the idle timeout up to the value of MaxIdleTimeout; privileged clients may set the timeout to any value.

       JobFmt    The  format  string  to  use  when returning job status information for jobs in the sendq and doneq directories.  Formats are specified using printf(3S) style conventions but using the field
                 identifiers listed below.  Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-3j for  a  3-character  wide,  left-justified,  blank-
                 padded field containing the job state.

                 Format    Description
                 A         Destination SubAddress
                 B         Destination Password
                 C         Destination company name

                 z         Time to send job

                 The  default format string is ``%-4j %3i %1a %6.6o %-12.12e %5P %5D %7z %.25s''.  This string constrains each status line to be less than 80 characters.  It is recommended that all items in‐
                 clude a field width so that client applications, such as faxstat(1) that construct headers from the format string can constrain the width of column title strings.

       JobSortFmt
                 The format string to use when sorting the listing for jobs in the sendq and doneq directories.  Follows the JobFmt formatting rules.

       JobProtection
                 The file mode setting for job qfiles in the HylaFAX queues (sendq and doneq).  The default setting of ``0644'' allows all users to view all job parameters in the send/done queues.   If  Pub‐
                 licJobQ  is  set to false, then this file mode determines the permissions of the clients to see the jobs, following the HylaFAX permission model of the group bits controlling uid permissions
                 and the other bits controlling other permissions.

       KillTimeMap
                 The mapping from SNPP service level (0-11) to job expiration time (kill time).  A mapping is specified as a string of space-separate numbers where each value is the number of minutes to per‐
                 mit a job to run.  The default mapping is ``5 5 5 15 60 240 720 1440 1440 1440 1440 1440'' which expires a job in 5 minutes for service levels 0-2, 15 minutes for level three, 60 minutes for
                 level four, etc.

       LogFacility
                 The symbolic name for the syslog(3) facility to use when logging error messages and informational/debugging messages requested through the ServerTracing  parameter.   The  list  of  facility
                 names is found in the system include file <syslog.h>; comparisons are case-insensitive.

       MaxAdminAttempts
                 The  maximum  number of unsuccessful attempts gain administrative privileges with the ADMIN command that hfaxd will permit a client before terminating the connection.  Note that the count of
                 attempts is reset if/when the client successfully gains administrative privileges.

       MaxConsecutiveBadCmds
                 The maximum number of consecutive unrecognized, unimplemented, syntactically incorrect, or otherwise unacceptable commands to permit a client before terminating the connection.  This control
                 has  two purposes: to handle naive or malicious clients from sending long streams of nonsense commands to a server, and to insure that clients are forcibly terminated when a server is marked
                 shutdown.

       MaxIdleTimeout
                 The maximum value that a client may set the idle timeout to.  This value is not enforced if the client has administrative privileges.

       MaxLoginAttempts
                 The maximum number of unsuccessful attempts to login with the USER and PASS commands that hfaxd will permit a client before terminating the connection.

       MaxMsgLength
                 The maximum number of characters to accept in a pager message specified with the DATA or MESS commands.  Messages longer than this value are rejected.

       ModemFmt  The format string to use when returning modem status information for modems listed in the status directory.  Formats are specified using printf(3S) style  conventions  but  using  the  field
                 identifiers  listed  below.   Each  item can include field width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-8h for an 8-character wide, left-justified, blank-
                 padded field containing the name of the host the server is running on.

                 Format    Description
                 h         Server hostname
                 l         Local identifier string
                 m         Canonical modem name
                 n         FAX phone number
                 r         Maximum pages that can be received in a single call
                 s         Status information string
                 t         Server and session tracing levels (xxxxx:yyyyy)
                 v         Modem speaker volume as one-character symbol
                 z         A ``*'' if a faxgetty(8) process is running; otherwise `` '' (space)

                 The default format string is ``Modem %m (%n): %s''.

       ModemSortFmt
                 The format string to use when sorting the listsin for  modem status information in the status directory.

       PagerIDMapFile
                 The absolute pathname of the file that contains directions for mapping pager identifiers to IXO/TAP or UCP  service  providers  (and  optionally  a  pager  identification  number).   Consult
                 pagermap(5) for information on the format and content of this file.  (Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the root of the spooling area).

       PriorityMap
                 The mapping from SNPP service level (0-11) to job scheduling priority.  A mapping is specified as a string of space-separate numbers where each value is the priority to assign to a job.  The
                 default mapping is ``63 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127'' which assigns a high priority to service level zero and normal (default) priority to all other service levels.

       PublicJobQ
                 By default, HylaFAX has always made the listings of the sendq/doneq include all jobs to any client connected to hfaxd.  By setting this to false, hfaxd will also enforce it's  normal  access
                 restrictions on the listing of jobs in the sendq/doneq.  These access restrictions are based on the file mode (see JobProtection ) and the logged in uid (see hosts.hfaxd )

       PublicRecvQ
                 By  default,  HylaFAX  has always made the listings of the recvq include all faxes to any client connected to hfaxd.  By setting this to false, hfaxd will also enforce it's normal access re‐
                 strictions on the listing of faxes in the recvq.  These access restrictions are based on the file mode faxgetty (and it's related FaxDispatch ) set for the fax, and the logged  in  uid  (see
                 hosts.hfaxd )

       RcvFmt    The  format string to use when returning status information for received facsimile in the recvq directory.  Formats are specified using printf(3S) style conventions but using the field iden‐
                 tifiers listed below.  Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for printf; e.g. %-3b for a 3-character  wide,  left-justified,  blank-padded
                 field containing the signalling rate.

                 Format    Description
                 a         SubAddress received from sender (if any)
                 b         Signalling rate used during receive
                 d         Data format used during receive
                 e         Error description if an error occurred during receive
                 f         Document filename (relative to the recvq directory)
                 h         Time spent receiving document (HH:MM:SS)
                 l         Page length in mm
                 m         Fax-style protection mode string (``-rwxrwx'')
                 n         File size (number of bytes)
                 o         File owner
                 p         Number of pages in document
                 q         UNIX-style protection flags
                 r         Resolution of received data
                 s         Sender identity (TSI)
                 t         Compact representation of the time when the receive happened
                 w         Page width in mm
                 z         A ``*'' if receive is going on; otherwise `` '' (space)

                 The  default format string is ``%-7m %4p%1z %-8.8o %14.14s %7t %f''.  This string constrains each status line to be less than 80 characters.  It is recommended that all items include a field
                 width so that client applications, such as faxstat(1) that construct headers from the format string can constrain the width of column title strings.

       RcvSortFmt
                 The format string to use when sorting the listing for received facsimile in the recvq directory.  Follows the RcvFmt formatting rules.

       RetryTimeMap
                 The mapping from SNPP service level (0-11) to job retry time.  A mapping is specified as a string of space-separate numbers where each value is the number of seconds to delay between  deliv‐
                 ery  attempts.   A  value of zero causes retries to be scheduled using the default algorithm used by the HylaFAX job scheduler.  The default mapping is ``30 60 60 180 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0'' which
                 retries a level 0 job after a 30 second delay, levels 1 and 2 after 60 seconds, level 3 after 3 minutes, and other jobs are retried according to the usual scheduling algorithm.

       ServerTracing
                 A number that controls the generation of tracing information by a server.  areas that are individually controlled.  To enable tracing of multiple areas of operation, the flag associated with
                 each area should be bit-or'd to form the value for this tag.
                 Flag             Description
                 1 (0x00001)      General server operation
                 2 (0x00002)      Client-server protocol requests and responses
                 4 (0x00004)      File transfers from client to server
                 8 (0x00008)      File transfers from server to client
                 16 (0x00010)     Client logins
                 32 (0x00020)     All network connections
                 64 (0x00040)     FIFO messages to and from faxq(8)
                 128 (0x00080)    TIFF Library errors and warnings
                 256 (0x00100)    Configuration file processing

                 Tracing  messages  are directed to syslog(3) using the facility specified with the LogFacility configuration parameter.  Note that syslogd(8) must be configured to capture facility.info, fa‐
                 cility.debug, facility.warning, and facility.err messages.

       ShutdownFile
                 The absolute pathname of the server shutdown file; see hylafax-shutdown(5) for information on the format and content of this file.  (Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the root  of
                 the spooling area).

       UserAccessFile
                 The  absolute  pathname of the user access control file; see hosts.hfaxd(5) for information on the format and content of this file.  (Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the root of
                 the spooling area).

       XferLogFile
                 The absolute pathname of the file to use for logging client-server file transfers (when enabled through the ServerTracing parameter).  (Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the  root
                 of the spooling area).

OPTIONS
       -q dir    The specified directory is treated as the spooling area.  The default spooling area, /var/spool/hylafax, is defined at the time the software is built.

       -d        Stop hfaxd from detaching itself from the controlling terminal.  This option is normally used only when running hfaxd under a debugger or when hfaxd is started up from the inetd(8) process.

       -l bindaddress
                 Bind to the specified bindaddress the tcp port. Please note that this argument need to be specified before the -i otherwise it will be ignored. A better approach to improve security would be
                 to run hfaxd from xinetd, binding its service to the specific port. This will also make hylafax benefits from tcp wrappers and other options provided by xinetd.

       -i port   Listen on the specified port for service requests and respond with the client-server protocol.  The port may be specified either symbolically, e.g. ``hylafax'' or numerically.  This flag may
                 be  specified  multiple times to request service on multiple different ports.  Each time this flag is specified, it will listen on the specified port, bound to the last -l bindaddress speci‐
                 fied.  If no -l bindaddress was specified, it will bind to the system configured default wildcard address, which could be any of IPv6, or IPv4, or both.

       -s port   Listen on the specified port for service requests and respond with the Simple Network Paging (SNPP) protocol.  The port may be specified either symbolically, e.g.  ``snpp''  or  numerically.
                 This flag may be specified multiple times to request service on multiple different ports.

       -I        Service the client-server protocol using the standard input and output.  This option is useful when hfaxd is started up by inetd(8).

       -S        Service the Simple Network Paging (SNPP) protocol using the standard input and output.  This option is useful when hfaxd is started up by inetd(8).

DIAGNOSTICS
       Diagnostics generated by hfaxd are logged using syslog(3).
