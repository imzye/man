SYNOPSIS
       deco  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-foreground color] [-background
       color] [-window] [-root] [-mono] [-install]  [-visual  visual]  [-delay

DESCRIPTION
       The deco program subdivides and colors rectangles randomly.   It  looks
       kind  of  like  Brady-Bunch-era  rec-room  wall paneling.  (Raven says:
       "This screensaver is ugly enough to peel  paint.")   Can  also  produce
       more aesthetically pleasing displays via options.

OPTIONS
       deco accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -mono   If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify  which  visual  to use.  Legal values are the name of a
               visual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of  a  specific
               visual.

       -delay seconds
               How long to wait before starting over.  Default 5 seconds.

       -max-depth integer
               How deep to subdivide.  Default 12.

       -min-width integer

       -min-height integer
               The size of the smallest rectangle to draw.  Default 20x20.

       -line-width integer
               Width  of lines drawn between rectangles. Default zero (minimal
               width).

       -smooth-colors

       -no-smooth-colors
               Whether to use a smooth color palette instead of a random  one.

               Whether  to subdivide rectangles using the golden ratio instead

               ing. Default false.
