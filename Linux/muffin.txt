NAME
       MUFFIN - Clutter based compositing GTK2 Window Manager

SYNOPSIS
       muffin [--display=DISPLAY] [--replace] [--sm-client-id=ID] [--sm-disable] [--sm-save-file=FILENAME] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly muffin.

       muffin is a minimal X window manager aimed at nontechnical users and is designed to integrate well with the GNOME desktop.  muffin lacks some features that may be expected by traditional UNIX or other
       technical users; these users may want to investigate other available window managers for use with GNOME or standalone.

OPTIONS
       --display=DISPLAY
              Connect to X display DISPLAY.

       --replace
              a window manager which is running is replaced by muffin.  Users are encouraged to change the GNOME window manager by running the new WM with the --replace or -replace option,  and  subsequently
              saving the session.

       --sm-client-id=ID
              Specify a session management ID.

       --sm-disable
              Disable the session management.

       --sm-save-file=FILENAME
              Load a session from FILENAME.

       --version
              Print the version number.

       -?, --help
              Show summary of options.

CONFIGURATION
       muffin configuration can be found under Preferences->Windows and Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts on the menu-panel. Advanced configuration can be achieved directly through gsettings.
