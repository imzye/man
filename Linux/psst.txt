NAME
       psst - Power Stress and Shaping Tool

SYNOPSIS
       psst [options <value>]

DESCRIPTION
       The Power Stress and Shaping Tool (PSST) is a controlled power 'virus' for Intel SoC components such as CPU and GPU.
       The  objective  is  to subject the SoC at different run-time-varying utilization levels for analysis. This is done by controlled duty-cycling of utilization to specific contour. A simplest contour
       could be fixed low utilization. This allows simple usage, such as logging of system parameters at fixed low overhead even at small polling intervals (ms). More complex usage, such as study of gov‐
       ernors, workloads e.t.c., are possible by applying different power shape contours and options.

OPTIONS
       -C --cpumask CPUMASK
              CPUMASK is hexadecimal bit mask of cpu selected. (e.g., a1 selects cpu 0, 5, 7. default: every online cpu, maximum 1024)

       -p --poll-period pollperiod
              pollperiod specifies period for logging in milliseconds (default 500 ms)

       -d --duration m
              specifies duration m in milliseconds to run psst (default is 3600000; 1 hour)

       -l --log-file path
              specifies the full path to the logfile (default is /var/log/psst.csv)

       -v --verbose
              enables verbose mode (default: disabled when args specified)

       -V --version
              prints version

       -T --track-max-cpu
              Track the cpu# with maxed freq during poll period

       -h --help
              prints help

       -s --shape-func shape-func,arg
              Specifies power shape function and argument:
              Shape Function             Argument
              single-step,v              where v is load step height [C0%]. (default shape: single-step,0.1)
              sinosoid,w,a               where w is wavelength [seconds] and a is the amplitude (max load %)
              stair-case,v,u             where v is load step height [C0%], u is step length (sec)
              single-pulse,v,u           where v is load step height [C0%], u is step length (sec)
              linear-ramp,m              where m is the slope (load/sec)
              saw-tooth,m,a              slope m (load/sec); reversed after max a% or min(0.1)%

EXAMPLES
       1.  Use psst just for logging various power/thermal parameters:
               sudo psst  # same as $./psst -s single-step,0.1 -p 500 -v

       2.  Linear ramp CPU power with slope 3% usage-per-sec applied for cpu 1 and 3, polling and reporting every 700mS, output on termial, running for 33 seconds:
               sudo psst -s linear-ramp,3 -C a -p 700 -d 33000 -v
