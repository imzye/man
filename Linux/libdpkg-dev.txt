NAME
       libdpkg - Debian package manager C library

DESCRIPTION
       The libdpkg C library provides functions and infrastructure for the dpkg tool set, and external projects that need to integrate tightly with it.

       The library provides a pkgconf(1) entry named libdpkg.

       Warning: The API provided by this library is highly volatile, still in the process of being cleaned up. It is only supposed to be used internally by dpkg for now. Header files, functions,
       variables and types might get renamed, removed or change semantics. If you still have a need to use it, which you would be doing anyway, say by locally building dpkg to get the library, then
       define the C preprocessor macro LIBDPKG_VOLATILE_API in your build to acknowledge that fact.

       Due to the currently API volatility, only a static library is provided.
