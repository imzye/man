NAME
       nbdkit-ocaml-plugin - writing nbdkit plugins in OCaml

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit /path/to/plugin.so [arguments...]

        nbdkit plugin [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes how to write nbdkit plugins in natively compiled OCaml code.

       Note this requires OCaml ≥ 4.02.2, which has support for shared libraries.  See http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6693

WRITING AN OCAML NBDKIT PLUGIN
       For an example plugin written in OCaml, see: https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/nbdkit/blob/master/plugins/ocaml/example.ml

       Broadly speaking, OCaml nbdkit plugins work like C ones, so you should read nbdkit-plugin(3) first.

       You should also look at NBDKit(3) which describes the plugin interface for OCaml plugins.

       Your OCaml code should call "NBDKit.register_plugin" like this:

        let plugin = {
          NBDKit.default_callbacks with
            NBDKit.name     = "myplugin";
            version         = "1.0";
            open_connection = Some myplugin_open;
            get_size        = Some myplugin_get_size;
            pread           = Some myplugin_pread;
            thread_model    =
                Some (fun () -> NBDKit.THREAD_MODEL_SERIALIZE_ALL_REQUESTS);
            (* etc *)
        }

        let () = NBDKit.register_plugin plugin

       Your plugin must call "register_plugin" exactly once when the plugin is loaded.

   Compiling an OCaml nbdkit plugin
       OCaml nbdkit plugins are natively compiled into shared object ("*.so") files which nbdkit loads like regular C plugins.

       After writing your OCaml plugin ("myplugin.ml"), compile and link it using this command:

        ocamlopt.opt -output-obj -runtime-variant _pic \
                     -o nbdkit-myplugin-plugin.so \
                     NBDKit.cmx myplugin.ml \
                     -cclib -lnbdkitocaml

       You can then use "nbdkit-myplugin-plugin.so" as an nbdkit plugin (see nbdkit(1), nbdkit-plugin(3)):

        nbdkit ./nbdkit-myplugin-plugin.so [args ...]

       or if the ".so" file is installed in the $plugindir directory:

        nbdkit myplugin [args ...]

   Handle
       Your "open_connection" callback can return an OCaml value of any type.  The same value is passed back to the per-connection callbacks like "get_size" and "pread".

       Typically (although this is not a requirement) you define your own handle struct in your plugin:

        type handle = {
          (* any per-connection data you want to store goes here *)
          h_id : int; (* this is just an example field *)
          h_readonly : bool;
        }

        let id = ref 0
        let myplugin_open readonly =
          (* return a newly allocated handle *)
          incr id;
          { h_id = !id; h_readonly = readonly }

        let myplugin_get_size handle =
          printf "handle ID = %d\n" handle.h_id;
          (* ... *)

       If you don't need to store per-connection data, "open_connection" can return "()".

   Errors
       Plugins can return errors from methods by raising an exception.

       If you need to control which errno is sent back to the client you have to call "NBDKit.set_error" before raising the exception.

       Note if you call some function in the OCaml "Unix" module or another library which fails, then the errno of the failing system call will not be returned to the client.  You have to catch the exception
       and call "NBDKit.set_error" before re-raising the exception if you need to control this.

   Threads
       One of the members in the plugin record passed to "NBDKit.register_plugin" is "thread model", which must return one of the values in the table below.  For more information on thread models, see
       "THREADS" in nbdkit-plugin(3).  If this optional function is not provided, the thread model defaults to THREAD_MODEL_PARALLEL.  Note that because of the garbage collector lock in OCaml, callbacks are
       never truly concurrent.

       "NBDKit.THREAD_MODEL_SERIALIZE_CONNECTIONS"
       "NBDKit.THREAD_MODEL_SERIALIZE_ALL_REQUESTS"
       "NBDKit.THREAD_MODEL_SERIALIZE_REQUESTS"
       "NBDKit.THREAD_MODEL_PARALLEL"

   Debugging
       You can add debugging messages which are printed only when nbdkit is in verbose mode by calling:

        NBDKit.debug fs [...]

       This function works like "Printf.printf".

   OCaml scripts
       Using nbdkit-cc-plugin(1) it is possible to write OCaml plugins which are compiled just before use, and so appear to work more like scripts.

VERSION
       OCaml plugins first appeared in nbdkit 1.2.
