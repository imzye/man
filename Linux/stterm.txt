NAME
       st - simple terminal

SYNOPSIS
       st [-aiv] [-c class] [-f font] [-g geometry] [-n name] [-o iofile] [-T title] [-t title] [-l line] [-w windowid] [[-e] command [arguments...]]

       st [-aiv] [-c class] [-f font] [-g geometry] [-n name] [-o iofile] [-T title] [-t title] [-w windowid] -l line [stty_args...]

DESCRIPTION
       st is a simple terminal emulator.

OPTIONS
       -a     disable alternate screens in terminal

       -c class
              defines the window class (default $TERM).

       -f font
              defines the font to use when st is run.

       -g geometry
              defines the X11 geometry string.  The form is [=][<cols>{xX}<rows>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]. See XParseGeometry(3) for further details.

       -i     will fixate the position given with the -g option.

       -n name
              defines the window instance name (default $TERM).

       -o iofile
              writes all the I/O to iofile.  This feature is useful when recording st sessions. A value of "-" means standard output.

       -T title
              defines the window title (default 'st').

       -t title
              defines the window title (default 'st').

       -w windowid
              embeds st within the window identified by windowid

       -l line
              use  a tty line instead of a pseudo terminal.  line should be a (pseudo-)serial device (e.g. /dev/ttyS0 on Linux for serial port 0).  When this flag is given remaining arguments are used as
              flags for stty(1).  By default st initializes the serial line to 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and a 38400 baud rate. The speed is set  by  appending  it  as  last  argument  (e.g.  'st  -l
              /dev/ttyS0 115200'). Arguments before the last one are stty(1) flags. If you want to set odd parity on 115200 baud use for example 'st -l /dev/ttyS0 parenb parodd 115200'. Set the number of
              bits by using for example 'st -l /dev/ttyS0 cs7 115200'. See stty(1) for more arguments and cases.

       -v     prints version information to stderr, then exits.

       -e command [ arguments ... ]
              st  executes  command instead of the shell.  If this is used it must be the last option on the command line, as in xterm / rxvt.  This option is only intended for compatibility, and all the
              remaining arguments are used as a command even without it.

SHORTCUTS
       Break  Send a break in the serial line.  Break key is obtained in PC keyboards pressing at the same time control and pause.

       Ctrl-Print Screen
              Toggle if st should print to the iofile.

       Shift-Print Screen
              Print the full screen to the iofile.

       Print Screen
              Print the selection to the iofile.

       Ctrl-Shift-Page Up
              Increase font size.

       Ctrl-Shift-Page Down
              Decrease font size.

       Ctrl-Shift-Home
              Reset to default font size.

       Ctrl-Shift-y
              Paste from primary selection (middle mouse button).

       Ctrl-Shift-c
              Copy the selected text to the clipboard selection.

       Ctrl-Shift-v
              Paste from the clipboard selection.

CUSTOMIZATION
       st can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
