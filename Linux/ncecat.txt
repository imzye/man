DESCRIPTION
       ncecat concatenates an arbitrary number of input files into a single output file.  Input files are glued together by creating a record dimension in the output file.  Input files must be the same size.
       Each  input  file  is  stored consecutively as a single record in the output file.  Each variable (except coordinate variables) in each input file becomes one record in the same variable in the output
       file.  Coordinate variables are not concatenated, they are instead simply copied from the first input file to the output-file.  Thus, the size of the output file is the sum of the sizes of  the  input
       files.

       Consider  five  realizations, 85a.nc, 85b.nc,...  85e.nc of 1985 predictions from the same climate model.  Then ncecat 85?.nc 85_ens.nc glues the individual realizations together into the single file,
       85_ens.nc.  If an input variable was dimensioned [ lat, lon], it will have dimensions [ record, lat, lon] in the output file.  A restriction of ncecat is that the hyperslabs of the processed variables
       must be the same from file to file.  Normally this means all the input files are the same size, and contain data on different realizations of the same variables.

EXAMPLES
       Consider  a model experiment which generated five realizations of one year of data, say 1985.  You can imagine that the experimenter slightly perturbs the initial conditions of the problem before gen‐
       erating each new solution.  Assume each file contains all twelve months (a seasonal cycle) of data and we want to produce a single file containing all the seasonal cycles.  Here the  numeric  filename
       suffix denotes the experiment number (not the month):
              ncecat 85_01.nc 85_02.nc 85_03.nc 85_04.nc 85_05.nc 85.nc
              ncecat 85_0[1-5].nc 85.nc
              ncecat -n 5,2,1 85_01.nc 85.nc
       These three commands produce identical answers.  The output file, 85.nc, is five times the size as a single input-file.  It contains 60 months of data (which might or might not be stored in the record
       dimension, depending on the input files).
