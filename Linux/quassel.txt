NAME
       quassel — a modern, cross-platform and distributed IRC client

SYNPOSIS
       quassel [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Quassel  IRC  is  a  modern,  cross-platform,  distributed IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core -- much like the popular combination of
       screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical.

       quassel provides a standalone IRC client experience, integrating the core and client into a single program. To connect to and manage a running quasselcore, use the quasselclient client program.

COMMON OPTIONS
       -c, --configdir=CONFIGDIR
              Specify the directory holding the configuration files, the SQLite database with chat logs, and the SSL/TLS certificate.

       -d, --debug
              Enable extra debugging output.

       -h, --help
              Show help message.

       -L, --loglevel=LOGLEVEL
              Set the logging level to LOGLEVEL: Debug, Info, Warning, Error. Default is: Info

       -l, --logfile=LOGFILE
              Log to a file.

       --syslog
              Log to syslog.

       -v, --version
              Display version information.

CLIENT OPTIONS
       --debugbufferswitches
              Enables debugging for bufferswitches.

       --debugmodel
              Enables debugging for models.

       --hidewindow
              Start the client minimized to the system tray.

       --icontheme=THEME
              Override the system icon theme. 'breeze' is recommended. This may also be configured in the client settings.

       --qss=QSS
              Load a custom application stylesheet.

INTERNAL CORE OPTIONS
       NOTE: These options should not need modified in most cases. Running a separate quasselcore is the recommended way to allow multiple clients to connect to a core.

       --add-user
              Starts an interactive session to add a new core user

       --change-userpass=USERNAME
              Starts an interactive session to change the password of the user identified by USERNAME.

       --config-from-environment
              Load configuration from environment variables, ignoring the configuration file.  See the section on ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.

       --debug-irc
              Enable logging of all raw IRC messages to debug log, including passwords!  In most cases you should also set --loglevel Debug.

       --debug-irc-id=DATABASENETWORKID
              Limit raw IRC logging to this network ID. Implies --debug-irc.

       --ident-daemon
              Enable internal ident daemon.

       --ident-listen=IDENTLISTEN
              The address(es) quasselcore will listen on for ident requests. Same format as --listen. Only meaningful with --ident-daemon. Default is: ::1,127.0.0.1 (only localhost)

       --ident-port=IDENTPORT
              The port the quasselcore will listen at for ident requests. Only meaningful with --ident-daemon. Default is: 10113

       --listen=LISTEN
              The address(es) quasselcore will listen on when --port is specified.  Default is: ::,0.0.0.0 (all addresses)

       -n, --norestore
              Don't restore last core's state, such as previously connected networks.

       --oidentd
              Enable oidentd integration. In most cases you should also enable --strict-ident.

       --oidentd-conffile=OIDENTCONF
              Set path to oidentd configuration file.

       -p, --port=PORT
              The port the internal quasselcore will listen at. If not specified, the internal core will not accept connections from other clients.

       --require-ssl
              Require SSL for remote (non-loopback) client connections.

       --select-authenticator=AUTHENTICATOR
              Starts an interactive session to switch your current user authentication backend to the new one.

       --select-backend=BACKEND
              Starts an interactive session to switch your current storage backend to the new one. Attempts a merge if the new backend is uninitialized and the old backend supports  migration,  otherwise
              prompts for new user credentials.

       --ssl-cert=SSLCERTFILE
              Specify the path to the SSL certificate. Reloaded when quasselcore is sent a SIGHUP. Default is: CONFIGDIR/quasselCert.pem

       --ssl-key=SSLKEYFILE
              Specify the path to the SSL key. Reloaded when quasselcore is sent a SIGHUP.  Only needed if not combined with the SSL certificate.

       --strict-ident
              Use  users' quasselcore username as ident reply. Ignores each user's configured ident setting.  Useful for multi-user quasselcores connecting to IRC networks that require a fixed identifier
              for each user.

ENVIRONMENT
       When --config-from-environment is specified, the quasselcore will use the following environment variables instead of the configuration file. This may be useful for container  setups  or  automated
       deployment.
