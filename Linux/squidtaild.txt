NAME
       squidtaild — Squid log monitoring program

SYNOPSIS
       squidtaild

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the squidtaild command.

       squidtaild  is  a  program that uses the information contained in /etc/squidtaild/squidtaild.conf to  create html pages that display the violations that people have made against one or more of the
       filters you have applied to the squid proxy logging system.

CONFIGURATION
       Configuration can be done by editing /etc/squidtaild/squidtaild.conf and by adding filters to /etc/squidtaild/filters/.

       Filters are nothing more than wildcards that are monitored in the URL's visited by the people using the proxy server.
