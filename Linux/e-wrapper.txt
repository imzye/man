NAME
       e - invoke your editor, with optional file:lineno handling

SYNOPSIS
       e [<editor's options>] <file>[:line] [<file>...]
       <pipeline> | e -: [<editor's options>]
       <pipeline> | e -:: [<editor's options>]

DESCRIPTION
       Programs that mention line numbers in messages have mostly standardized on "file:line: Message" or "file:line:col: Message".  Alas, this is not what editors support, which is almost always "+line"
       "file".

       e  takes  a list of file names, optionally followed with :line, then possibly with :column and/or an additional colon, and gives to your editor.  The line numbers are passed as a separate argument
       "+line" before the file name which is what editors expect.

       Alternatively, you can provide file names on the standard input, and specify -: or -:: as the first argument.  The former allows file names without line numbers, the latter silently  ignores  any‐
       thing not in the expected format.

       Examples:

              git grep FIXME|e -:

              make 2>&1 >/dev/null|grep error:|e -::

       This is roughly a shorthand for "e `pipeline|cut -d: -f1-2`".

       e is also handy as a general-purpose smart alias for running the editor.  If yours has a long name like "jstar" or "emacs", you save four keystrokes on what for a typical Unix user is the most of‐
       ten issued command.

EDITOR SELECTION
       If  the  environment  variable  $EDITOR is set, e will use that.  Otherwise, it calls sensible-editor, which asks what editor to use then saves your answer.  You can run select-editor to get asked
       again.
