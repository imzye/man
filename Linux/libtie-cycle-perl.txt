NAME
       Tie::Cycle - Cycle through a list of values via a scalar.

SYNOPSIS
               use v5.10;
               use Tie::Cycle;

               tie my $cycle, 'Tie::Cycle', [ qw( FFFFFF 000000 FFFF00 ) ];

               say $cycle; # FFFFFF
               say $cycle; # 000000
               say $cycle; # FFFF00
               say $cycle; # FFFFFF  back to the beginning

               (tied $cycle)->reset;  # back to the beginning

DESCRIPTION
       You use "Tie::Cycle" to go through a list over and over again.  Once you get to the end of the list, you go back to the beginning.  You don't have to worry about any of this since the magic of tie
       does that for you.

       The tie takes an array reference as its third argument. The tie should succeed unless the argument is not an array reference.  Previous versions required you to use an array that had more than one
       element (what's the pointing of looping otherwise?), but I've removed that restriction since the number of elements you want to use may change depending on the situation.

       During the tie, this module makes a shallow copy of the array reference. If the array reference contains references, and those references are changed after the tie, the elements of the cycle will
       change as well. See the included test.pl script for an example of this effect.

OBJECT METHODS
       You can call methods on the underlying object (which you access with tied() ).

       reset
           Roll the iterator back to the starting position. The next access will give the first element in the list.

       previous
           Give the previous element. This does not affect the current position.

       next
           Give the next element. This does not affect the current position.  You can peek at the next element if you like.
