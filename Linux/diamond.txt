NAME
       diamond - accelerated BLAST compatible local sequence aligner

SYNOPSIS
       diamond COMMAND [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
        DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches
        and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST software
        tools. It is suitable for protein-protein search as well as DNA-protein
        search on short reads and longer sequences including contigs and
        assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000.
