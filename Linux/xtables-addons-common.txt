NAME
       pknlusr — userspace monitor for successful xt_pknock matches

Synopsis
       pknlusr [group-id]

Description
       xt_pknock  is  an  xtables match extension that implements so-called port knocking. It can be configured to send information about each successful match via a netlink socket to userspace. pknluser
       listens for these notifications.

       By default, pknlusr listens for messages sent to netlink multicast group 1. Another group ID may be passed as a command-line argument.
