NAME
       git-rebase-theirs - Resolve rebase conflicts and failed cherry-picks by
       favoring 'theirs' version

SYNOPSIS
       git-rebase-theirs [options] [--] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Resolve git rebase conflicts in FILE(s) by favoring 'theirs' version.

       When using git rebase, conflicts are usually wanted to be resolved by
       favoring the <working branch> version (the branch being rebased,
       'theirs' side in a rebase), instead of the <upstream> version (the base
       branch, 'ours' side)

       But git rebase --strategy -X theirs is only available from git 1.7.3
       For older versions, git-rebase-theirs is the solution. And Despite the
       name, it's also useful for fixing failed cherry-picks.

       It works by discarding all lines between '<<<<<<< ' and '========'
       inclusive, and also the the '>>>>>> commit' marker.

       By default it outputs to stdout, but files can be edited in-place using
       --in-place, which, unlike sed, creates a backup by default.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               show usage information.

       -v, --verbose
               print more details in stderr.

       --in-place[=SUFFIX]
               edit files in place, creating a backup with SUFFIX extension.
               Default if blank is ".bak"

       --no-backup
               disables backup
