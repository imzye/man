NAME
       type1afm - create a font metrics file from a Type 1 font file

SYNOPSIS
       type1afm [ -l ] fontfile [ fontfile...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       type1afm reads in Type 1 font files specified on the command line, rasterizes them to 1000bp, and writes AFM (font metrics) files based on the observed metrics information.

       The AFM file is created in the same directory as the font file, so be sure that you have write access there before running this program.

OPTIONS
       -l     Write a log file
