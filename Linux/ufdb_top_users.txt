NAME
       ufdb_top_users - retrieve the most frequent users from the log files

SYNOPSIS
       ufdb_top_users [options] <logfiles>

DESCRIPTION
       ufdb_top_users is a log analysis utility which scans one or more log files of ufdbguardd and prints the most frequent users.

       The various options control which users are included in the report.

OPTIONS
       -report-size <N>
              specifies the number of lines of the report.  The default is 20 lines.

       -count-passed (default), -no-count-passed
              specifies whether or not to include URLs that are PASSed.

       -count-blocked, -no-count-blocked (default)
              specifies whether or not to include URLs that are BLOCKed.

WARNINGS
       Retrieval of top users is slow since (very) large log files are processed.  It may take 50 seconds to process 400 MB on a common server.
