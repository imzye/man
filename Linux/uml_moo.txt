NAME
       uml_moo — merge a COW file with its backing file

SYNOPSIS
       uml_moo [COW file]  [new_backing_file]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the uml_moo command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in HTML format; see below.

       uml_moo  is  a program to merge a COW (copy-on-write) file with its backing file, and write the result to a new backing file.  This can be used periodically to update the backing file with the changes
       made in the COW file.

       NOTE: you can save a lot of disk space using COW files.  When checking the size of the COW file in order to see the gobs of space that you're saving, make sure you use 'ls -ls' to see the actual  disk
       consumption rather than the length of the file. The COW file is sparse, so the length will be very different from the disk usage.
