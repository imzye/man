NAME
       bskk - Bayesian estimation for SKK

SYNOPSIS
       bskk [options]

DESCRIPTION
       bskk is a helper program for skk-bayesian.el which handles history with Bayesian estimation for SKK Japanese input systems.

       The options are as follows:

       -f history_file
               Use history_file as a history file.

       -s      Run as a server.

       -p port Use port (default=51178).

       -v      Verbose.

       -d      Debug mode.

       -h      Show a help and exit.

       To  terminate  bskk,  send  TERM  signal  to  bskk (regardless of -s or not).  If bskk receives TERM signal, bskk terminates immediately without saving history.  To save history, send COMMAND_SAVE
       (#save) to bskk before bskk is terminated.
