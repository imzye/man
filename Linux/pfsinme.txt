NAME
       pfsinme - Read image files containing multiple exposures to be merged into an HDR image

SYNOPSIS
       pfsinme <file> [<file>]

DESCRIPTION
       Use this program to read multiple exposure JPEG or RAW images. The output of this command should be piped to pfshdrcalibrate to recover a camera response or merge images into an HDR image.

       All listed files must be the same type, that is mixing JPEG and RAW images is not allowed. You can use wildcards.

       This command is a convinience wrapper for jpeg2hdrgen, dcraw2hdrgen and pfsinhdrgen, which skips the step of generating an hdrgen file

EXAMPLES
       pfsinme *.jpg | pfsrotate -r | pfshdrcalibrate -s response.m -v

              Read all JPEG images in the current directory, rotate them and merge into an HDR image

SEE ALSO
       pfshdrcalibrate(1) jpeg2hdrgen(1) dcraw2hdrgen(1) pfsinhdrgen(1)

BUGS
       The command cannot handle files with a space in the file name because of the pfsinhdrgen limitation.
