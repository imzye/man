NAME
       mimesend - send files via MIME mail, from the command line

USAGE
       Pretty basic:

           mimesend [-n] [-t to] [-s subj] (-f file [-m type])+
               -n        Don't actually send it; just print it to stdout.
               -t to     The "to" address.
               -s subj   The subject of the message.
               -f file   Path to attached file, or - for STDIN.
               -m type   MIME type of previous -f; therefore -m must follow -f.

       For example:

           mimesend -t you@yourhost.com -s "Hello, nurse!"
                 -f greetings.htm -f foo.gif
