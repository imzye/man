NAME
       claws-mail-multi-notifier - several modules for new mail notification

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-multi-notifier package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-multi-notifier is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       Provides various ways to notify the user of new and (possibly) unread email.

       The following modules are currently implemented:

       Banner
           A mail ticker.

       Popup
           A popup window on mail arrival.

       Command
           Execute a custom command on mail arrival.

       LCD Send a message to a LCDd server on mail arrival.

       SysTrayicon
           A system tray icon, with or without toaster popup.

       Indicator
           An indicator icon.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For  this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named notification.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

CAVEATS
       Some IMAP servers (for example Gmail™) doesn't implement the "\Recent" flag on messages (see NOTES). Therefore, notifications about new mail will be unreliable on these servers.

SEE ALSO
       claws-mail(1), notify-send(1), osd_cat(1), play(1), claws-mail-extra-plugins(7).

NOTES
       See support page “Does Gmail support all IMAP features?” at <http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=78761>
