NAME
       ddir - display hierarchical directory tree

SYNOPSIS
         ddir [options] [DIR]

DESCRIPTION
       Display an indented directory tree using ASCII graphical characters to represent the hierarchical structure. The directories to include or exclude can be specified with command line options. Ddir
       is a Perl implementation of the tree(1) program. The extra "d" in front of name was used to differentiating the utility from an existing dir(1) program.

OPTIONS
       -d, --dir
           Display only directories.

       -i, --include REGEXP
           Include files matching regexp. The match is done against whole path. The option can be used multiple times.

           If this option is not supplied, every file is automatically included.  The matches can be further filtered by using options --exclude.

       -n, --no-exclude-vcs
           Do not exclude version controlled dirs.

       -v, --verbose LEVEL
           Print informational messages. Increase numeric LEVEL for more verbosity.

       -x, --exclude REGEXP
           Ignore files matching regexp. The match is done against whole path. The option can be used multiple times.

           This option is applied after possible --include matches.

       -X, --exclude-vcs
           Enabled by default. Exclude version control directories.  See --help-exclude.

           Use --no-exclude-vcs to include all in listing.

       -h, --help
           Print text help

       --help-exclude
           Print default exclude value when --exclude-vcs is used.

       --help-html
           Print help in HTML format.

       --help-man
           Print help in manual page man(1) format.

       -V, --version
           Print contact and version information.
