NAME
       Geo::Inverse - Calculate geographic distance from a latitude and longitude pair

SYNOPSIS
         use Geo::Inverse;
         my $obj                         = Geo::Inverse->new();                       #default "WGS84"
         my ($lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2) = (38.87, -77.05, 38.95, -77.23);
         my ($faz, $baz, $dist)          = $obj->inverse($lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2); #array context
         my $dist                        = $obj->inverse($lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2); #scalar context
         print "Input Lat: $lat1 Lon: $lon1\n";
         print "Input Lat: $lat2 Lon: $lon2\n";
         print "Output Distance: $dist\n";
         print "Output Forward Azimuth: $faz\n";
         print "Output Back Azimuth: $baz\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a pure Perl port of the NGS program in the public domain "inverse" by Robert (Sid) Safford and Stephen J. Frakes.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
       The new() constructor may be called with any parameter that is appropriate to the ellipsoid method which establishes the ellipsoid.

         my $obj = Geo::Inverse->new(); # default "WGS84"

METHODS
   initialize
   ellipsoid
       Method to set or retrieve the current ellipsoid object.  The ellipsoid is a Geo::Ellipsoids object.

         my $ellipsoid = $obj->ellipsoid;  #Default is WGS84

         $obj->ellipsoid('Clarke 1866'); #Built in ellipsoids from Geo::Ellipsoids
         $obj->ellipsoid({a=>1});        #Custom Sphere 1 unit radius

   inverse
       This method is the user frontend to the mathematics. This interface will not change in future versions.

         my ($faz, $baz, $dist) = $obj->inverse($lat1,$lon1,$lat2,$lon2);

LIMITATIONS
       No guarantees that Perl handles all of the double precision calculations in the same manner as Fortran.
