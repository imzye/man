NAME
       fd2pascal - Free Pascal forms description to pascal program converter

SYNOPSIS
       fd2pascal [-compensate] [-altformat] [-main] [-callback] filename

DESCRIPTION
       fd2pascal  reads  a  XForms  designer file ( .fd ) and creates pascal code to create the form described in the file. The pascal code is written to a file with the same name as the input file, but with
       extension .pp if a file with that name already exists, then it will be renamed to a file with the extension .bak appended.

OPTIONS
       fd2pascal has a small number of options to control its behaviour:

       -altformat
              By default, a record type is emitted for the form definition, with a field for each widget (object) on the form. The alternate form declares a global variable for the form and  each  widget  on
              the form.

       -compensate
              If this option is given then a call to fl_adjust_form_size is emitted after the form is created.

       -callback
              If this option is given, then a callback procedure is generated for each widget on the form.

       -main  By default, a unit is created which can be included in the uses clause of a program. If this option is specified, a program file is emitted instead.
