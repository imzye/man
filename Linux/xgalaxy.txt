NAME
       xgalaxy - X11 Galaga like game

SYNOPSIS
       xgalaxy [-scores] [-display display] [-mouse] [-keyboard] [-nosound] [-b] [-window] [-winsize widthxheight] [-b] [-noclipmask] [-nouseor] [-nostars]

       xgalaxy-hyperspace [-scores] [-display display] [-mouse] [-keyboard] [-nosound] [-b] [-window] [-winsize widthxheight] [-b] [-noclipmask] [-nouseor] [-nostars]

INSTRUCTIONS
       It's just like Galaxian / Galaga, you know how to play Galaxian/ Galaga, stop bothering me. (Ship follows the mouse, button fires.  Auto-fire by holding it down, so no-one accuses me of breaking their
       mouse!)

       The xgalaxy-hyperspace version features some new weapons and different gameplay.

OPTIONS
       -scores Prints out the high score file and exits

       -display host:dpy
               Set your display

       -mouse  Use mouse control (same as 'm').

       -keyboard
               Use keyboard control (same as 'k').  If you have a joystick it can also be used if you select keyboard control.

       -nosound
               Turn sound OFF

       -level lvl
               Choose starting level (>= 1)

       -window Run in a window, not full screen. Full screen is the default.

       -winsize widthxheight
               Set windowsize, default 468x596.

       -b      Turn buffered mode off, use this if it runs too slowly.  Will cause flicker, maybe lots, maybe only a little.

       -noclipmask
               Don't use clip masks for drawing (affects unbuffered mode only).

       -nouseor
               Don't draw using OR mode.

       -nostars
               Don't draw stars in the background.

       Combinations of the last four options can be used to get faster drawing if the video card can't keep up with the required 30 frames/sec.  The fastest drawing will come from

              xgalaxy -b -noclipmask -nouseor -nostars

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
       p - pauses

       q - end this game

       b - Toggle buffering (flicker vs. speed.)

       o - Toggle OR mode.  Don't use this, it sucks.

       m - Use mouse control. Note that you may switch in mid-game.

       k - Use keyboard control

       x - use your shields (xgalaxy-hyperspace only)

       alt-enter - Toggle full screen node.
