NAME
       dh_buildinfo - register the versions of build-dependencies used to build a package

SYNOPSIS
       dh_buildinfo [debhelper options] [generate] [cat] [install]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_buildinfo is a debhelper program that registers in a file the list of packages declared as build-time dependencies, as well as build-essential packages, together with their versions, as
       installed in the build machine.

       This will hopefully help to track packages (auto-)built with package versions which are known to be buggy, and, more generally, to find out whether a package needs to be rebuilt because of a
       significant change in a package it has a build-time dependency on.

       You will usually just run this in your package's binary rule. If you need extra control over the operation, you can specify the actions to be taken. The default actions are generate install.

OPTIONS
       generate
           Generate the list of versions of the build dependencies in use.

       cat Output the list of versions to stdout.

       install
           Installs the compressed list of versions to the package's build directory, in /usr/share/doc/package/buildinfo.gz

perl v5.26.1                                                                                  2018-01-10                                                                              DH_BUILDINFO(1p)
