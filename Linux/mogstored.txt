NAME
       mogstored -- MogileFS storage daemon

USAGE
       This is the MogileFS storage daemon, which is just an HTTP server that supports PUT, DELETE, etc.  It's actually a wrapper around Perlbal, doing all the proper Perlbal config for you.

       In addition, it monitors disk usage, I/O activity, etc, which are checked from the MogileFS tracker.
