NAME
       geogebra - Dynamic mathematics software for education

SYNOPSIS

       geogebra [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the geogebra command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation in HTML format available at upstream website
       http://wiki.geogebra.org/.

       geogebra is an educational program that lets you draw and interactively modify compositions of many geometric or algebraic objects in a two-dimensional plane.

OPTIONS
       geogebra is mainly meant to be used via its graphical interface and doesn't support many command-line arguments. You can have a list of the supported options with their meanings using the --help
       option.

       The non-option arguments will be interpreted as file names to open once the program has started.
