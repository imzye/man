NAME
       Mail::RBL - Perl extension to access RBL-style host verification services

SYNOPSIS
         use Mail::RBL;

         my $list = new Mail::RBL('list.org');

         # You can also specify a resolver to use with Net::DNS::Resolver

         my $list = new Mail::RBL('list.org', $res);

         if ($list->check($host)) {
             print "$host is in the list";
         }

         my ($ip_result, $optional_info_txt) = $list->check($host);
         # $optional_info_txt will be undef if the list does not provide TXT
         # RRs along with the A RRs.

         print "The list says ", ($list->check($host))[1], " in its TXT RR\n";

         my ($ip_result, $optional_info_txt) = $list->check_rhsbl($hostname);

DESCRIPTION
       This module eases the task of checking if a given host is in the list. The methods available are described below:

       "->new(suffix, resolver)"
           Creates a list handle. The "suffix" parameter is mandatory and specifies which suffix to append to the queries. If left unspecified, defaults to "bl.spamcop.net".

           An optional DNS resolver can be specified. An object of the Net::DNS::Resolver(3) class is expected.

       "->check($host)"
           $host  can  be  either  a hostname or an IP address. In the case of an IP Address. In the case of a hostname, all the IP addresses will be looked up and checked against the list. If any of the
           addresses is in the list, the host will be considered in the list as a whole.

           Returns either a "NetAddr::IP" object as returned by the RBL itself, or "undef" in case the RBL does not supply an answer. This is important because many lists inject some semantics on the DNS
           response value, which now can be recovered easily with the program that uses this module.

           In array context,  any IP addresses are returned,  followed by any TXT RR (or undef if none). If no match is found, an empty list is returned instead. In  scalar context, only  the   first  IP
           address  (or undef) is returned.

       "->check_rhsbl($host)"
           Analogous to "->check()", but  queries RHSBLs instead of IP-based lists.   This  is   useful   for   using  lists   such   as  some   of http://www.rfc-ignorant.org/.

           Results and return values are the same as "->check()".

HISTORY
         $Log: RBL.pm,v $
         Revision 1.10  2007/04/25 04:22:04  lem
         Finished adding support for the custom resolver code - Implementation
         was incomplete

         Revision 1.9  2006/12/08 00:01:14  lem
         Get version straight from the CVS revision.

         Revision 1.8  2006/12/07 23:58:07  lem
         Allow the user to provide a Net::DNS::Resolver object to perform DNS
         resolution - This allows finer control over how the queries are
         performed. Suggested by Eric Langheinrich.

       1.00
           Original version.

       1.01
           Minor bug fixes. Cleaned up MS-DOS line endings. Changed test cases (more and better tests). Now requires Test::More. More useful return values. Improved docs. First crypto-signed distribution
           of this module.
