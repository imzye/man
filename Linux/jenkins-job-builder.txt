NAME
       jenkins-jobs - Jenkins Job Builder Documentation

       Jenkins  Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML or JSON format and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions in human readable text format in a ver‐
       sion control system to make changes and auditing easier. It also has a flexible template system, so creating many similarly configured jobs is easy.

       To install:

          $ pip install --user jenkins-job-builder

WRITING A PATCH
       We ask that all code submissions be pep8 and pyflakes clean.  The easiest way to do that is to run tox before submitting code for review in Gerrit.  It will run pep8 and pyflakes in the same  man‐
       ner as the automated test suite that will run on proposed patchsets.

       When creating new YAML components, please observe the following style conventions:

       • All YAML identifiers (including component names and arguments) should be lower-case and multiple word identifiers should use hyphens.  E.g., "build-trigger".

       • The Python functions that implement components should have the same name as the YAML keyword, but should use underscores instead of hyphens. E.g., "build_trigger".

       This consistency will help users avoid simple mistakes when writing YAML, as well as developers when matching YAML components to Python implementation.

UNIT TESTS
       Unit  tests  have been included and are in the tests folder. Many unit tests samples are included as examples in our documentation to ensure that examples are kept current with existing behaviour.
       To run the unit tests, execute the command:

          tox -e py38

       Unit tests could be run in parallel, using pytest-parallel pytest plugin:

          tox -e py38 -- --workers=auto

       • Note: View tox.ini to run tests on other versions of Python, generating the documentation and additionally for any special notes on running the test to validate documentation external URLs  from
         behind proxies.

INSTALLING WITHOUT SETUP.PY
       For YAML support, you will need libyaml installed.

       Mac OS X:

          $ brew install libyaml

       Then install the required python packages using pip:

          $ sudo pip install PyYAML python-jenkins

QUICK START GUIDE
       This guide was made with the impatient in mind so explanation is sparse.  It will guide users through a set of typical use cases for JJB using the same job definitions we use to test JJB.

       1. Clone the repository to get the JJB job definition examples

       2. The Installation can be either from pypi (released version) or from the clone (master).

       Usage of the commands below assumes that you are at the root of the cloned directory.

   Use Case 1: Test a job definition
       JJB  creates Jenkins XML configuration file from a YAML/JSON definition file and just uploads it to Jenkins.  JJB provides a convenient test command to allow you to validate the XML before you at‐
       tempt to upload it to Jenkins.

       Test a YAML job definition:

          jenkins-jobs test tests/yamlparser/job_fixtures/templates002.yaml

       The above command prints the generated Jenkins XML to the console.  If you prefer to send it to a directory:

          jenkins-jobs test -o output tests/yamlparser/job_fixtures/templates002.yaml

       The output directory will contain files with the XML configurations.

   Use Case 2: Updating Jenkins Jobs
       Once you've tested your job definition and are happy with it then you can use the update command to deploy the job to Jenkins.  The update command requires a configuration file.  An  example  file
       is supplied in the etc folder, you should update it to match your Jenkins master:

          jenkins-jobs --conf etc/jenkins_jobs.ini-sample update tests/yamlparser/job_fixtures/templates002.yaml

       The above command will update your Jenkins master with the generated jobs.

       Caution: JJB caches Jenkins job information locally.  Changes made using the Jenkins UI will not update that cache, which may lead to confusion.  See Updating Jobs for more information.

   Use Case 3: Working with JSON job definitions
       You can also define your jobs in json instead of yaml:

          jenkins-jobs --conf etc/jenkins_jobs.ini-sample update tests/jsonparser/fixtures/simple.json

       The above command just uses a simple job definition.  You can also convert any of the YAML examples to JSON and feed that to JJB.

   Use Case 4: Deleting a job
       To delete a job:

          jenkins-jobs --conf etc/jenkins_jobs.ini-sample delete simple

       The above command deletes the job simple from the Jenkins master.

   Use Case 5: Providing plugins info
       To generate a plugins info, using an account with Administrator rights:

          jenkins-jobs get-plugins-info -o plugins_info.yaml

       To run JJB update using the plugins_info.yaml:

          jenkins-jobs update -p plugins_info.yaml ./myjobs

       Please refer to the jenkins-jobs Command Reference and the Job Definitions pages for more details.

INSTALLATION
       To install Jenkins Job Builder from source, run:

          pip install git+https://opendev.org/jjb/jenkins-job-builder/

       A virtual environment is recommended for development.  For example, Jenkins Job Builder may be installed from the top level directory:

          $ virtualenv .venv
          $ source .venv/bin/activate
          $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt -e .

       Alternatively, the current release can be installed from pypi:

          sudo pip install jenkins-job-builder

       The OpenStack project uses Puppet to manage its infrastructure systems, including Jenkins.  If you use Puppet, you can use the OpenStack Jenkins module to install Jenkins Job Builder.

   Documentation
       Documentation is included in the doc folder. To generate docs locally execute the command:

          tox -e docs

       The generated documentation is then available under doc/build/html/index.html.

       As over time URLs change or become stale there is also a testenv available to verify any links added. To run locally execute the command:

          tox -e docs-linkcheck

       • Note: When behind a proxy it is necessary to use TOX_TESTENV_PASSENV to pass any proxy settings for this test to be able to check links are valid.

   Unit Tests
       Unit  tests  have been included and are in the tests folder.  We recently started including unit tests as examples in our documentation so to keep the examples up to date it is very important that
       we include unit tests for every module.  To run the unit tests, execute the command:

          tox -e py38

       • Note: View tox.ini to run tests on other versions of Python.

   Test Coverage
       To measure test coverage, execute the command:

          tox -e cover

CONFIGURATION FILE
       After installation, you will need to create a configuration file.  By default, jenkins-jobs looks for ~/.config/jenkins_jobs/jenkins_jobs.ini,  <script  directory>/jenkins_jobs.ini  or  /etc/jenk‐
       ins_jobs/jenkins_jobs.ini (in that order), but you may specify an alternative location when running jenkins-jobs.  The file should have the following format:

          [job_builder]
          ignore_cache=True
          keep_descriptions=False
          include_path=.:scripts:~/git/
          recursive=False
          exclude=.*:manual:./development
          allow_duplicates=False
          update=all

          [jenkins]
          user=jenkins
          password=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
          url=https://jenkins.example.com
          query_plugins_info=False
          ##### This is deprecated, use job_builder section instead
          #ignore_cache=True

          [plugin "hipchat"]
          authtoken=dummy

          [plugin "stash"]
          username=user
          password=pass

   job_builder section
       ignore_cache
              (Optional) If set to True, Jenkins Job Builder won't use any cache.

       keep_descriptions
              By  default  jenkins-jobs  will  overwrite the jobs descriptions even if no description has been defined explicitly.  When this option is set to True, that behavior changes and it will only
              overwrite the description if you specified it in the yaml. False by default.

       include_path
              (Optional) Can be set to a ':' delimited list of paths, which jenkins job builder will search for any files specified by the custom application yaml tags 'include', 'include-raw'  and  'in‐
              clude-raw-escape'.

       recursive
              (Optional) If set to True, jenkins job builder will search for job definition files recursively.

       exclude
              (Optional)  If  set  to  a  list  of values separated by ':', these paths will be excluded from the list of paths to be processed when searching recursively.  Values containing no / will be
              matched against directory names at all levels, those starting with / will be considered absolute, while others containing a / somewhere other than the start of the value will be  considered
              relative to the starting path.

       allow_duplicates
              (Optional)  By  default jenkins-jobs will abort when a duplicate macro, template, job-group or job name is encountered as it cannot establish the correct one to use. When this option is set
              to True, only a warning is emitted.

       allow_empty_variables
              (Optional) When expanding strings, by default jenkins-jobs will raise an exception if there's a key in the string, that has not been declared in the input YAML files. Setting this option to
              True will replace it with the empty string, allowing you to use those strings without having to define all the keys it might be using.

       print_job_urls
              (Optional) If set to True it will print full jobs urls while updating jobs, so user can be sure which instance was updated. User may click the link to go directly to that job. False by  de‐
              fault.

       retain_anchors
              (Optional)  If set to True, YAML anchors will be retained across files, allowing jobs to be composed from bits of YAML defined in separate files.  Note this means that the order of process‐
              ing files matters - jenkins-jobs loads files in alphabetical order (all files in a dir are loaded before any files in subdirs). For example, if your anchors are in a file named foo.yml they
              will be accessible in qux.yml but not in bar.yml. They will also be accessible in mydir/bar.yml and mydir/qux.yml. False by default.

       update (Optional) If set, allows the user to specify if only "jobs" or "views" (or "all") are updated. Users can override the setting here by  passing  --jobs-only  or  --views-only  CLI  options.
              (Valid options: jobs, views, all)

       filter_modules
              (Optional)  A space-separated set of strings which of names of additional modules to load Jinja2 filters from when templating YAML objects. Note that the modules must be in the Python path.
              To learn about writing custom Jinja2 filters, please see the Jinja2 Documentation

   jenkins section
       user   This should be the name of a user previously defined in Jenkins.  Appropriate user permissions must be set under the Jenkins security matrix: under the Global group  of  permissions,  check
              Read, then under the Job group of permissions, check Create, Delete, Configure and finally Read.

       password
              The API token for the user specified.  You can get this through the Jenkins management interface under People -> username -> Configure and then click the Show API Token button.

       url    The base URL for your Jenkins installation.

       timeout
              (Optional) The connection timeout (in seconds) to the Jenkins server.  By default this is set to the system configured socket timeout.

       query_plugins_info
              Whether  to  query the Jenkins instance for plugin info. If no configuration files are found (either in the default paths or given through the command-line), jenkins-jobs will skip querying
              for plugin information.  False by default.

   hipchat section
       send-as
              This is the hipchat user name that will be used when sending notifications.

       authtoken
              The API token necessary to send messages to hipchat.  This can be generated in the hipchat web interface by a user with administrative access for your organization. This  authtoken  is  set
              for each job individually; the JJB Hipchat Plugin does not currently support setting different tokens for different projects, so the token you use will have to be scoped such that it can be
              used for any room your jobs might be configured to notify. For more information on this topic, please see the Hipchat API Documentation

   stash section
       username
              This is the stash user name that will be used to connect to stash when using the stash publisher plugin and not defining it in the yaml part.

       password
              This is the related password that will be used with the stash username when using the stash publisher plugin and not defining it in the yaml part.

   __future__ section
       This  section is to control enabling of beta features or behaviour changes that deviate from previously released behaviour in ways that may require effort to convert existing JJB configs to adopt.
       This essentially will act as a method to share these new behaviours while under active development so they can be changed ahead of releases.

       param_order_from_yaml
              Used to switch on using the order of the parameters are defined in yaml to control the order of corresponding XML elements being written out. This is intended as a global flag and  can  af‐
              fect multiple modules.

RUNNING
       After it's installed and configured, you can invoke Jenkins Job Builder by running jenkins-jobs.  You won't be able to do anything useful just yet without a configuration; that is discussed in the
       next section.

   Test Mode
       Once you have a configuration defined, you can run the job builder in test mode.

       If you want to run a simple test with just a single YAML job definition file and see the XML output on stdout:

          jenkins-jobs test /path/to/foo.yaml

       You can also pass JJB a directory containing multiple job definition files:

          jenkins-jobs test /path/to/defs -o /path/to/output

       which will write XML files to the output directory for all of the jobs defined in the defs directory.

       If you run:

          jenkins-jobs test /path/to/defs -o /path/to/output --config-xml

       the output directory will contain config.xml files similar to the internal storage format of Jenkins.  This might allow you to more easily compare the output to an existing Jenkins installation.

   Updating Jobs
       When you're satisfied with the generated XML from the test, you can run:

          jenkins-jobs update /path/to/defs

       which  will  upload  the job and view definitions to Jenkins if needed.  Jenkins Job Builder maintains, for each host, a cache [1] of previously configured jobs and views, so that you can run that
       command as often as you like, and it will only update the jobs configurations in Jenkins if the defined definitions have changed since the last time it was run.  Note: if you modify a job directly
       in Jenkins, jenkins-jobs will not know about it and will not update it.

       To update a specific list of jobs/views, simply pass the job/view names as additional arguments after the job definition path. To update Foo1 and Foo2 run:

          jenkins-jobs update /path/to/defs Foo1 Foo2

       You can also enable the parallel execution of the program passing the workers option with a value of 0, 2, or higher. Use 0 to run as many workers as cores in the host  that  runs  it,  and  2  or
       higher to specify the number of workers to use:

          jenkins-jobs update --workers 0 /path/to/defs

       To update only views or only jobs, simply add the argument --views-only or --jobs-only after the command:

          jenkins-jobs update --views-only Foo-view
          jenkins-jobs update --jobs-only Foo-job

   Passing Multiple Paths
       It is possible to pass multiple paths to JJB using colons as a path separator on *nix systems and semi-colons on Windows systems. For example:

          jenkins-jobs test /path/to/global:/path/to/instance:/path/to/instance/project

       This  helps  when  structuring  directory layouts as you may selectively include directories in different ways to suit different needs. If you maintain multiple Jenkins instances suited to various
       needs you may want to share configuration between those instances (global). Furthermore, there may be various ways you would like to structure jobs within a given instance.

   Recursive Searching of Paths
       In addition to passing multiple paths to JJB it is also possible to enable recursive searching to process all yaml files in the tree beneath each path.  For example:

          For a tree:
            /path/
              to/
                defs/
                  ci_jobs/
                  release_jobs/
                globals/
                  macros/
                  templates/

          jenkins-jobs update -r /path/to/defs:/path/to/globals

       JJB will search defs/ci_jobs, defs/release_jobs, globals/macros and globals/templates in addition to the defs and globals trees.

   Excluding Paths
       To allow a complex tree of jobs where some jobs are managed differently without needing to explicitly provide each path, the recursive path processing supports excluding paths  based  on  absolute
       paths, relative paths and patterns. For example:

          For a tree:
            /path/
              to/
                defs/
                  ci_jobs/
                    manual/
                  release_jobs/
                    manual/
                  qa_jobs/
                globals/
                  macros/
                  templates/
                  special/

          jenkins-jobs update -r -x man*:./qa_jobs -x /path/to/defs/globals/special \
            /path/to/defs:/path/to/globals

       JJB will search the given paths, ignoring the directories qa_jobs, ci_jobs/manual, release_jobs/manual, and globals/special when building the list of yaml files to be processed. Absolute paths are
       denoted by starting from the root, relative by containing the path separator, and patterns by having neither.  Patterns use simple shell globing to match directories.

   Deleting Jobs/Views
       Jenkins Job Builder supports deleting jobs and views from Jenkins.

       To delete a specific job:

          jenkins-jobs delete Foo1

       To delete a list of jobs or views, simply pass them as additional arguments after the command:

          jenkins-jobs delete Foo1 Foo2

       To delete only views or only jobs, simply add the argument --views-only or --jobs-only after the command:

          jenkins-jobs delete --views-only Foo1
          jenkins-jobs delete --jobs-only Foo1

       The update command includes a delete-old option to remove obsolete jobs:

          jenkins-jobs update --delete-old /path/to/defs

       Obsolete jobs are jobs once managed by JJB (as distinguished by a special comment that JJB appends to their description), that were not generated in this JJB run.

       There is also a command to delete all jobs and/or views.  WARNING: Use with caution.

       To delete all jobs and views:

          jenkins-jobs delete-all

       TO delete all jobs:

          jenkins-jobs delete-all --jobs-only

       To delete all views:

          jenkins-jobs delete-all --views-only

   Globbed Parameters
       Jenkins job builder supports globbed parameters to identify jobs from a set of definition files.  This feature only supports JJB managed jobs.

       To update jobs/views that only have 'foo' in their name:

          jenkins-jobs update ./myjobs \*foo\*

       To delete jobs/views that only have 'foo' in their name:

          jenkins-jobs delete --path ./myjobs \*foo\*

   Providing Plugins Info
       With  Jenkins LTS 1.651.1+ retrieving plugins info became a secure feature and now requires Administrator rights to use [2]. This causes JJB to no longer be able to work in situations where a user
       wants to publish jobs to Jenkins but is not able to receive the Administrator permissions. In this case we can provide a plugins_info.yaml file containing the plugin versions data needed by JJB to
       parse the job templates.

       To generate a plugins info, using an account with Administrator rights:
          jenkins-jobs get-plugins-info -o plugins_info.yaml

       To run JJB update using the plugins_info.yaml:
          jenkins-jobs update -p plugins_info.yaml ./myjobs

JOB DEFINITIONS
       The job definitions for Jenkins Job Builder are kept in any number of YAML or JSON files, in whatever way you would like to organize them.  When you invoke jenkins-jobs you may specify either  the
       path  of  a  single  YAML file, or a directory.  If you choose a directory, all of the .yaml/.yml or .json files in that directory will be read, and all the jobs they define will be created or up‐
       dated.

       NOTE:
          Jenkins Job Builder 2.x plugins are designed to default to generating the xml format for the latest supported version of JJB. This is a change in behaviour from 1.x and below which defaulted to
          the oldest supported plugin version.

   Definitions
       Jenkins Job Builder understands a few basic object types which are described in the next sections.

   Job
       The most straightforward way to create a job is simply to define a Job in YAML.  It looks like this:

          - job:
              name: job-name

       That's not very useful, so you'll want to add some actions such as Builders, and perhaps Publishers.  Those are described later.

       These are job parameters that are common to every type of Jenkins job.

       Example:

          - job:
              name: job-name
              project-type: freestyle
              defaults: global
              description: 'Do not edit this job through the web!'
              disabled: false
              display-name: 'Fancy job name'
              concurrent: true
              workspace: /srv/build-area/job-name
              quiet-period: 5
              block-downstream: false
              block-upstream: false
              retry-count: 3
              node: NodeLabel1 || NodeLabel2
              logrotate:
                daysToKeep: 3
                numToKeep: 20
                artifactDaysToKeep: -1
                artifactNumToKeep: -1

       Job Parameters

              • project-type: Defaults to "freestyle", but "maven" as well as "multijob", "flow", "pipeline" or "externaljob" can also be specified.

              • defaults: Specifies a set of Defaults to use for this job, defaults to ''global''.  If you have values that are common to all of your jobs, create a global Defaults object to  hold  them,
                and no further configuration of individual jobs is necessary.  If some jobs should not use the global defaults, use this field to specify a different set of defaults.

              • description: The description for the job.  By default, the description "!-- Managed by Jenkins Job Builder" is applied.

              • disabled: Boolean value to set whether or not this job should be disabled in Jenkins. Defaults to false (job will be enabled).

              • display-name:  Optional name shown for the project throughout the Jenkins web GUI in place of the actual job name.  The jenkins_jobs tool cannot fully remove this trait once it is set, so
                use caution when setting it.  Setting it to the same string as the job's name is an effective un-set workaround.  Alternately, the field can be cleared manually using the Jenkins web  in‐
                terface.

              • concurrent: Boolean value to set whether or not Jenkins can run this job concurrently. Defaults to false.

              • workspace: Path for a custom workspace. Defaults to Jenkins default configuration.

              • folder: The folder attribute provides an alternative to using '<path>/<name>' as the job name to specify which Jenkins folder to upload the job to.

                Requires the Jenkins CloudBees Folders Plugin.

              • child-workspace: Path for a child custom workspace. Defaults to Jenkins default configuration. This parameter is only valid for matrix type jobs.

              • quiet-period: Number of seconds to wait between consecutive runs of this job.  Defaults to 0.

              • block-downstream: Boolean value to set whether or not this job must block while downstream jobs are running. Downstream jobs are determined transitively. Defaults to false.

              • block-upstream: Boolean value to set whether or not this job must block while upstream jobs are running. Upstream jobs are determined transitively. Defaults to false.

              • auth-token:  Specifies  an  authentication token that allows new builds to be triggered by accessing a special predefined URL. Only those who know the token will be able to trigger builds
                remotely.

              • retry-count: If a build fails to checkout from the repository, Jenkins will retry the specified number of times before giving up.

              • node: Restrict where this job can be run. If there is a group of machines that the job can be built on, you can specify that label as the node to tie on, which will cause Jenkins to build
                the job on any of the machines with that label. For matrix projects, this parameter will only restrict where the parent job will run.

              • logrotate: The Logrotate section allows you to automatically remove old build history. It adds the logrotate attribute to the Job definition. All  logrotate  attributes  default  to  "-1"
                (keep forever).  Deprecated on jenkins >=1.637: use the build-discarder property instead

              • jdk: The name of the jdk to use

              • raw: If present, this section should contain a single xml entry. This XML will be inserted at the top-level of the Job definition.

   Job Template
       If  you need several jobs defined that are nearly identical, except perhaps in their names, SCP targets, etc., then you may use a Job Template to specify the particulars of the job, and then use a
       Project to realize the job with appropriate variable substitution.  Any variables not specified at the project level will be inherited from the Defaults.

       A Job Template has the same syntax as a Job, but you may add variables anywhere in the definition.  Variables are indicated by enclosing them in braces, e.g., {name} will substitute  the  variable
       name.  When using a variable in a string field, it is good practice to wrap the entire string in quotes, even if the rules of YAML syntax don't require it because the value of the variable may re‐
       quire  quotes  after  substitution.  In the rare situation that you must encode braces within literals inside a template (for example a shell function definition in a builder), doubling the braces
       will prevent them from being interpreted as a template variable.

       You must include a variable in the name field of a Job Template (otherwise, every instance would have the same name).  For example:

          - job-template:
              name: '{name}-unit-tests'

       Will not cause any job to be created in Jenkins, however, it will define a template that you can use to create jobs with a Project definition.  It's name will depend on what  is  supplied  to  the
       Project.

       If you use the variable {template-name}, the name of the template itself (e.g. {name}-unit-tests in the above example) will be substituted in. This is useful in cases where you need to trace a job
       back to its template.

       Sometimes  it  is  useful  to have the same job name format used even where the template contents may vary. Ids provide a mechanism to support such use cases in addition to simplifying referencing
       templates when the name contains the more complex substitution with default values.

   Default Values for Template Variables
       To facilitate reuse of templates with many variables that can be substituted, but where in most cases the same or no value is needed, it is possible to specify defaults for  the  variables  within
       the templates themselves.

       There are 2 ways JJB allows us to define defaults for a parameter in a job-template.

       1. Defining the default variable value in the job-template itself

          With this method we declare the default value of the variable in the job-template itself just once. We can section off the job-template into two sections like this:

             - job-template:
                 name: '{project-name}-verify'

                 #####################
                 # Variable Defaults #
                 #####################

                 branch: master

                 #####################
                 # Job Configuration #
                 #####################

                 parameters:
                   - string:
                       name: BRANCH
                       default: '{branch}'

                 scm:
                   - git:
                       refspec: 'refs/heads/{branch}'

          In this case there is still two branch definitions for the job-template.  However we also provide the default value for the {branch} variable at the top of the file. Just once. This will be the
          value that the job takes on if it is not passed in by a project using the template.

          And, you can do the same in Macro definitions.

       2. Using {var|default}

          In this method we can define the default with the definition of the variable. For example:

             - job-template:
                 name: '{project-name}-verify'
                 parameters:
                   - string:
                       name: BRANCH
                       default: '{branch|master}'

          However where this method falls apart if we need to use the same JJB variable in more than one place as we will have multiple places to define the default value for the template. For example:

             - job-template:
                 name: '{project-name}-verify'
                 parameters:
                   - string:
                       name: BRANCH
                       default: '{branch|master}'

                 scm:
                   - git:
                       refspec: 'refs/heads/{branch|master}'

          We can see in this case the {branch|master} variable is defined in two places. Not ideal.

       More complex example:

          - project:
              name: template_variable_defaults
              jobs:
                  - 'template-variable-defaults-{num}':
                      num: 1
                      disabled_var: true
                  - 'template-variable-defaults-{num}':
                      test_var: Goodbye World
                      num: 2

          - job-template:
              # template specific defaults
              # empty value causes disabled_var to be ignored internally
              disabled_var:
              test_var: Hello World
              type: periodic

              # template settings
              name: 'template-variable-defaults-{num}-{type}'
              id: 'template-variable-defaults-{num}'
              disabled: '{obj:disabled_var}'
              builders:
                - shell: |
                   echo "Job Name: template-variable-defaults-{num}-{type}"
                   echo "Variable: {test_var}"

       To use a default value for a variable used in the name would be uncommon unless it was in addition to another variable. However you can use Ids simplify such use cases.

   Project
       The purpose of a project is to collect related jobs together, and provide values for the variables in a Job Template.  It looks like this:

          - project:
              name: project-name
              jobs:
                - '{name}-unit-tests'

       Any number of arbitrarily named additional fields may be specified, and they will be available for variable substitution in the job template.  Any job templates listed under jobs: will be realized
       with those values.  The example above would create the job called 'project-name-unit-tests' in Jenkins.

       The jobs: list can also allow for specifying job-specific substitutions as follows:

          - project:
              name: project-name
              jobs:
                - '{name}-unit-tests':
                    mail-to: developer@nowhere.net
                - '{name}-perf-tests':
                    mail-to: projmanager@nowhere.net

       If  a  variable is a list, the job template will be realized with the variable set to each value in the list.  Multiple lists will lead to the template being realized with the cartesian product of
       those values.  Example:

          - project:
              name: project-name
              pyver:
                - 26
                - 27
              jobs:
                - '{name}-{pyver}'

       If there are templates being realized that differ only in the variable used for its name (thus not a use case for job-specific substitutions), additional variables can  be  specified  for  project
       variables. Example:

          - job-template:
              name: '{name}-{pyver}'
              builders:
                - shell: 'git co {branch_name}'

          - project:
             name: project-name
             pyver:
              - 26:
                 branch_name: old_branch
              - 27:
                 branch_name: new_branch
             jobs:
              - '{name}-{pyver}'

       You  can also specify some variable combinations to exclude from the matrix with the exclude keyword, to avoid generating jobs for those combinations. You can specify all the variables of the com‐
       bination or only a subset, if you specify a subset, any value of the omited variable will match:

          - project:
              name: project-name
              axe1:
                - axe1val1
                - axe1val2
              axe2:
                - axe2val1
                - axe2val2
              axe3:
                - axe3val1
                - axe3val2
              exclude:
                - axe1: axe1val1
                  axe2: axe2val1
                  axe3: axe3val2
                - axe2: axe2val2
                  axe3: axe3val1
              jobs:
                - build-{axe1}-{axe2}-{axe3}

          - job-template:
              name: build-{axe1}-{axe2}-{axe3}
              builders:
                - shell: "echo Combination {axe1}:{axe2}:{axe3}"

       The above example will omit the jobs:

          • build-axe1val1-axe2val1-axe3val2

          • build-axe1val1-axe2val2-axe3val1

          • build-axe1val2-axe2val2-axe3val1

       To achieve the same without the exclude tag one would have to do something a bit more complicated, that gets more complicated for each dimension in the combination, for the previous  example,  the
       counterpart would be:

          - project:
              name: project-name_comb1
              axe1:
                - axe1val1
                - axe1val2
              axe2: axe2val1
              axe3: axe3val1
              jobs:
                - build-{axe1}-{axe2}-{axe3}

          - project:
              name: project-name_comb2
              axe1:
                - axe1val1
                - axe1val2
              axe2: axe2val2
              axe3: axe3val2
              jobs:
                - build-{axe1}-{axe2}-{axe3}

          - project:
              name: project-name_comb3
              axe1: axe1val2
              axe2: axe2val1
              axe3: axe3val2
              jobs:
                - build-{axe1}-{axe2}-{axe3}

          - job-template:
              name: build-{axe1}-{axe2}-{axe3}
              builders:
                - shell: "echo Combination {axe1}:{axe2}:{axe3}"

   Job Group
       If you have several Job Templates that should all be realized together, you can define a Job Group to collect them.  Simply use the Job Group where you would normally use a Job Template and all of
       the Job Templates in the Job Group will be realized.  For example:

          - job-template:
              name: '{name}-unit-tests'
              builders:
              - shell: unittest
              publishers:
              - email:
                  recipients: '{mail-to}'

          - job-template:
              name: '{name}-perf-tests'
              builders:
              - shell: perftest
              publishers:
              - email:
                  recipients: '{mail-to}'

          - job-group:
              name: '{name}-tests'
              jobs:
              - '{name}-unit-tests':
                  mail-to: developer@nowhere.net
              - '{name}-perf-tests':
                  mail-to: projmanager@nowhere.net

          - project:
              name: project-name
              jobs:
              - '{name}-tests'

       Would cause the jobs project-name-unit-tests and project-name-perf-tests to be created in Jenkins.

   Views
       A  view  is  a  particular  way of displaying a specific set of jobs. To create a view, you must define a view in a YAML file and have a variable called view-type with a valid value. It looks like
       this:

          - view:
              name: view-name
              view-type: list

       Views are processed differently than Jobs and therefore will not work within a Project or a Job Template.

   View Template
       Allow views to also be configured via templates similar to job-templates. This is useful when you have multiple views defined that have similar configuration except for a few variables. View  Tem‐
       plates can be passed variables to fill in sections automatically via a project configuration using the new 'views' key.

       Minimal Example:

          - view-template:
              name: '{name}-template-{seq}'
              description: 'testing view templates feature'
              view-type: list
              regex: 'test-view-.*'

          - project:
              name: 'test-view'
              views:
                  - '{name}-template-{seq}'
              seq:
                  - a
                  - b
                  - c

   Macro
       Many  of the actions of a Job, such as builders or publishers, can be defined as a Macro, and then that Macro used in the Job description.  Builders are described later, but let's introduce a sim‐
       ple one now to illustrate the Macro functionality.  This snippet will instruct Jenkins to execute "make test" as part of the job:

          - job:
              name: foo-test
              builders:
                - shell: 'make test'

       If you wanted to define a macro (which won't save much typing in this case, but could still be useful to centralize the definition of a commonly repeated task), the configuration would look like:

          - builder:
              name: make-test
              builders:
                - shell: 'make test'

          - job:
              name: foo-test
              builders:
                - make-test

       This allows you to create complex actions (and even sequences of actions) in YAML that look like first-class Jenkins Job Builder actions.  Not every attribute supports Macros, check the documenta‐
       tion for the action before you try to use a Macro for it.

       Macros can take parameters, letting you define a generic macro and more specific ones without having to duplicate code:

          # The 'add' macro takes a 'number' parameter and will creates a
          # job which prints 'Adding ' followed by the 'number' parameter:
          - builder:
              name: add
              builders:
               - shell: "echo Adding {number}"

          # A specialized macro 'addtwo' reusing the 'add' macro but with
          # a 'number' parameter hardcoded to 'two':
          - builder:
              name: addtwo
              builders:
               - add:
                  number: "two"

          # Glue to have Jenkins Job Builder to expand this YAML example:
          - job:
              name: "testingjob"
              builders:
               # The specialized macro:
               - addtwo
               # Generic macro call with a parameter
               - add:
                  number: "ZERO"

       Then <builders /> section of the generated job show up as:

          <builders>
            <hudson.tasks.Shell>
              <command>echo Adding two</command>
            </hudson.tasks.Shell>
            <hudson.tasks.Shell>
              <command>echo Adding ZERO</command>
            </hudson.tasks.Shell>
          </builders>

       As you can see, the specialized macro addtwo reused the definition from the generic macro add.

   Folders
       Jenkins supports organising jobs, views, and slaves using a folder hierarchy.  This allows for easier separation of access as well credentials and resources which can be assigned to only be avail‐
       able for a specific folder.

       JJB has two methods of supporting uploading jobs to a specific folder:

       • Name the job to contain the desired folder <folder>/my-job-name

       • Use the folder attribute on a job definition, via a template, or through Defaults.

       Supporting both an attributed and use of it directly in job names allows for teams to have all jobs using their defaults automatically use a top-level folder, while still allowing for them to  ad‐
       ditionally nest jobs for their own preferences.

       Job Name Example:

          - job:
              name: python-jobs/tox-py27
              builders:
                - shell: |
                    tox -e py27

       Folder Attribute Example:

          # 'folders' attribute from defaults should be used (combined with job name) for jobs.

          - defaults:
              name: team1
              folder: team1-jobs

          - job:
              name: ruby-jobs/rspec
              defaults: team1
              builders:
                - shell: |
                    rvm use --create ruby-2.3.0@rspec
                    bundle install
                    bundle exec rspec

   Item ID's
       It's possible to assign an id to any of the blocks and then use that to reference it instead of the name. This has two primary functions:

       • A unique identifier where you wish to use the same naming format for multiple templates. This allows you to follow a naming scheme while still using multiple templates to handle subtle variables
         in job requirements.

       • Provides a simpler name for a job-template where you have multiple variables including default values in the name and don't wish to have to include this information in every use. This also makes
         changing the template output name without impacting references.

       Example:

          - project:
              name: test_template_id
              jobs:
                  - 'simple-template':
                      test_var: Hello World
                      type: periodic
                      num: 1
                  - 'not-as-simple-template':
                      test_var: Goodbye World
                      type: canary
                      num: 2

          - job-template:
              name: 'template-test-ids-{num}-{type}'
              id: simple-template
              builders:
                - shell: |
                   echo "Template name: {template-name}"
                   echo "Job name: template-test-ids-{num}-{type}"
                   echo "{test_var}"

          - job-template:
              name: 'template-test-ids-{num}-{type}'
              id: not-as-simple-template
              builders:
                - shell: |
                   echo "Template name: {template-name}"
                   echo "Job name: template-test-ids-{num}-{type}"
                - shell: |
                   echo "{test_var}"

   Raw config
       It is possible, but not recommended, to use raw within a module to inject raw xml into the job configs.

       This is relevant in case there is no appropriate module for a Jenkins plugin or the module does not behave as you expect it to do.

       For example:

          wrappers:
            - raw:
                xml: |
                  <hudson.plugins.xvnc.Xvnc>
                    <takeScreenshot>true</takeScreenshot>
                    <useXauthority>false</useXauthority>
                  </hudson.plugins.xvnc.Xvnc>

       Is the raw way of adding support for the xvnc wrapper.

       To get the appropriate xml to use you would need to create/edit a job in Jenkins and grab the relevant raw xml segment from the config.xml.

       The xml string can refer to variables just like anything else and as such can be parameterized like anything else.

       You can use raw in most locations, the following example show them with arbitrary xml-data:

          - project:
              name: complete002
              version:
                  - 1.2
              jobs:
                  - 'complete001_{version}'

          - job-template:
              name: 'complete001_{version}'
              project-type: maven
              scm:
                - raw:
                    xml: |
                      <!-- <scm> for raw replaces the whole scm section.
                       where as for others the raw part is added to the existing.
                      -->
                      <scm>
                        <scmraw/>
                      </scm>
              triggers:
                - raw:
                    xml: |
                      <triggersraw/>
              wrappers:
                - raw:
                    xml: |
                      <wrappersraw/>
              builders:
                - raw:
                    xml: |
                      <buildersraw/>
              publishers:
                - raw:
                    xml: |
                      <publishersraw/>
              properties:
                - raw:
                    xml: |
                      <propertiesraw/>
              parameters:
                - raw:
                    xml: |
                      <parametersraw/>
              notifications:
                - raw:
                    xml: |
                      <metadataraw/>
              reporters:
                - raw:
                    xml:
                      <reportersraw/>

       Note: If you have a need to use raw please consider submitting a patch to add or fix the module that will remove your need to use raw.

   Defaults
       Defaults  collect  job  attributes  (including actions) and will supply those values when the job is created, unless superseded by a value in the Job definition.  If a set of Defaults is specified
       with the name global, that will be used by all Job, Job Template and Macro definitions unless they specify a different Default object with the defaults attribute.  For example:

          - defaults:
              name: global
              description: 'Do not edit this job through the web!'

       Will set the job description for every job created.

       You can define variables that will be realized in a Job Template.

          - defaults:
              name: global
              arch: 'i386'

          - project:
              name: project-name
              jobs:
                  - 'build-{arch}'
                  - 'build-{arch}':
                      arch: 'amd64'

          - job-template:
              name: 'build-{arch}'
              builders:
                  - shell: "echo Build arch {arch}."

       Would create jobs build-i386 and build-amd64.

       In job templates, you can also reference a variable {template-name} in any value and it will be subtitued by the name of the current job template being processed.

   Variable References
       If you want to pass an object (boolean, list or dict) to templates you can use an {obj:key} variable in the job template.  This triggers the use of code that retains the original object type.

       For example:

          - project:
              name: test_custom_distri
              disabled: true
              distributions: !!python/tuple [precise, jessie]
              architectures: !!python/tuple &architectures
                - amd64
                - i386
              axis_a:
                  type: user-defined
                  name: architectures
                  values: *architectures
              jobs:
                - '{name}-source'

          - job-template:
                name: '{name}-source'
                project-type: matrix
                disabled: '{obj:disabled}'
                axes:
                  - axis:
                      type: user-defined
                      name: distribution
                      values: '{obj:distributions}'
                  - axis: '{obj:axis_a}'

       JJB also supports interpolation of parameters within parameters. This allows a little more flexibility when ordering template jobs as components in different projects and job groups.

       For example:

          - job-template:
              name: '{value-stream}_{project-id}_foo'
              display-name: '{value-stream} {project-id} foo'
              publishers:

       By default JJB will fail if it tries to interpolate a variable that was not defined, but you can change that behavior and allow empty variables with the allow_empty_variables configuration option.

       For example, having a configuration file with that option enabled:

          [job_builder]
          allow_empty_variables = True

       Will prevent JJb from failing if there are any non-initialized variables used and replace them with the empty string instead.

       TIP:
          Refer to Default Values for Template Variables for details on setting variable defaults.

   Variable Inheritance
       It is possible in JJB to define defaults for variables at different levels such that it is possible for users of job-templates to override variables defined in the job-template.

       Variable priorities for each definition type are as follows:

       1. job-group

       2. project

       3. job-template

       4. defaults

       From this list we can immediately see that if we want to make variables in job-templates override-able then using defaults configuration is useless as it has the lowest precedence when JJB is  de‐
       ciding where to pull from.

       On  the other side of the spectrum, job-groups has the highest precedence. Which unfortunately means if we define a variable in a job-group with the intention of overriding it at the project level
       then we are out of luck. For this reason avoid setting variables in job-groups unless we want to enforce a setting for a set of jobs and prevent projects from overriding it.

   Declaring variable defaults
       Refer to Default Values for Template Variables for details on how to declare variable defaults.

   Overriding job-template variables
       When a project wants to use a job-template it can use override it as follows:

          - project:
              name: foo
              jobs:
                - '{project-name}-merge'
                - '{project-name}-verify'

              branch: master

       This is the standard way that most folks use and it will set branch: master for every job-template in the list. However sometimes we may want to provide an alternative value for a specific job  in
       the list. In this case the more specific declaration takes precedence:

          - project:
              name: foo
              jobs:
                - '{project-name}-merge':
                    branch: production
                - '{project-name}-verify'

              branch: master

       In this case the verify job will get the value master but the merge job will instead get the branch value production.

   Yaml Anchors & Aliases
       The yaml specification supports anchors and aliases which means that JJB definitions allow references to variables in templates.

       For example:

          - _wrapper_defaults: &wrapper_defaults
              name: 'wrapper_defaults'
              wrappers:
                - timeout:
                    timeout: 180
                    fail: true
                - timestamps

          - _job_defaults: &job_defaults
              name: 'defaults'
              <<: *wrapper_defaults

          - job-template:
              name: 'myjob'
              <<: *job_defaults

          - project:
              name: myproject
              jobs:
                - myjob

       The anchors and aliases are expanded internally within JJB's yaml loading calls and are not limited to individual documents. That means you can't use the same anchor name in included files without
       collisions.

       A simple example can be seen in the specs full length example with the following being more representative of usage within JJB:

          - wrapper_defaults: &wrapper_defaults
              name: 'wrapper_defaults'
              wrappers:
                - timeout:
                    timeout: 180
                    fail: true
                - timestamps

          - job_defaults: &job_defaults
              name: 'defaults'
              <<: *wrapper_defaults

          - job-template:
              name: 'myjob'
              <<: *job_defaults

       Which will be expanded to the following yaml before being processed:

          - wrapper_defaults:
              name: wrapper_defaults
              wrappers:
              - timeout:
                  fail: true
                  timeout: 180
              - timestamps
          - job_defaults:
              name: defaults
              wrappers:
              - timeout:
                  fail: true
                  timeout: 180
              - timestamps
          - job-template:
              name: myjob
              wrappers:
              - timeout:
                  fail: true
                  timeout: 180
              - timestamps

   Custom Yaml Tags
       Custom application specific yamls tags are supported to provide enhancements when reading yaml configuration.

   Action Tags
       These  allow  manipulation  of  data being stored in one layout in the source yaml for convenience and/or clarity, to another format to be processed by the targeted module instead of requiring all
       modules in JJB being capable of supporting multiple input formats.

       The tag !join: will treat the first element of the following list as the delimiter to use, when joining the remaining elements into a string and returning a single string to  be  consumed  by  the
       specified module option.

       This  allows users to maintain elements of data in a list structure for ease of review/maintenance, and have the yaml parser convert it to a string for consumption as any argument for modules. The
       main expected use case is to allow for generic plugin data such as shell properties to be populated from a list construct which the yaml parser converts to a single string, instead  of  trying  to
       support this within the module code which would require a templating engine similar to Jinja.

       Generic Example:

              - job:
                  name: sample-job
                  builders:
                    - shell:
                      - string-with-comma: !join:
                          - ','
                          -
                              - item1
                              - item2
                              - item3

                      - string-with-space: !join:
                          - ' '
                          -
                              - item1
                              - item2

       While  this mechanism can also be used items where delimiters are supported by the module, that should be considered a bug that the existing code doesn't handle being provided a list and delimiter
       to perform the correct conversion for you. Should you discover a module that takes arguments with delimiters and the existing JJB codebase does not handle accepting lists, then this can be used as
       a temporary solution in place of using very long strings:

       These allow inclusion of arbitrary files as a method of having blocks of data managed separately to the yaml job configurations. A specific usage of this is inlining scripts contained in  separate
       files, although such tags may also be used to simplify usage of macros or job templates.

       The tag !include: will treat the following string as file which should be parsed as yaml configuration data.

       Example:

              - job:
                  name: test-job-1
                  builders:
                    !include: include001.yaml.inc

          contents of include001.yaml.inc:

              - copyartifact: &copytarball
                  project: foo
                  filter: "*.tar.gz"
                  target: /home/foo
                  which-build: last-successful
                  optional: true
                  flatten: true
                  do-not-fingerprint: true
                  parameter-filters: PUBLISH=true
              - copyartifact:
                  <<: *copytarball
                  project: bar
                  which-build: specific-build
                  build-number: 123
              - copyartifact:
                  <<: *copytarball
                  project: baz
                  which-build: upstream-build

       The  tag  !include-raw-expand:  will  treat the given string or list of strings as filenames to be opened as one or more data blob, which should be read into the calling yaml construct without any
       further parsing. Any data in a file included through this tag, will be treated as string data.

       It will expand variables inside the file. If your file contains curly braces, you should double them. Or, you can use tag !include-raw-verbatim:, which does not substitute variables.

       Examples:

              - job-template:
                  name: test-include-raw-verbatim-job-{num}
                  builders:
                    - shell:
                        !include-raw-verbatim: include-raw-hello-world.sh
                    - shell:
                        !include-raw-verbatim: include-raw-vars.sh

              - project:
                  name: test-job-template-1
                  num: 1
                  jobs:
                    - 'test-include-raw-verbatim-job-{num}'

          contents of include-raw-hello-world.sh:

                 #!/bin/bash
                 #
                 # Sample script showing how the yaml !include-raw-verbatim: tag can be used
                 # to inline scripts that are maintained outside of the jenkins
                 # job yaml configuration.

                 echo "hello world"

                 exit 0

          contents of include-raw-vars.sh:

                 #!/bin/bash
                 #
                 # sample script to check that variables aren't expanded
                 # when using the !include-raw-verbatim: application yaml tag

                 VAR1="hello"
                 VAR2="world"
                 VAR3="${VAR1} ${VAR2}"

                 [[ -n "${VAR3}" ]] && {
                     # this next section is executed as one
                     echo "${VAR3}"
                     exit 0
                 }

          Using a list of files:

              - job-template:
                  name: test-job-include-raw-{num}
                  builders:
                    - shell:
                        !include-raw-verbatim:
                            - include-raw-hello-world.sh
                            - include-raw-vars.sh

              - project:
                  name: test-job-template-1
                  num: 1
                  jobs:
                    - 'test-job-include-raw-{num}'

       For all the multi file includes, the files are simply appended using a newline character.

       You can also use variables in included file paths.

       Example:

              - wrapper:
                  !include: lazy-load-jobs-timeout.yaml.inc

              - project:
                  name: test
                  version:
                    - 1.1
                  jobs:
                    - 'build_myproject_{version}'

              - job-template:
                  name: 'build_myproject_{version}'
                  wrappers:
                    !include: lazy-load-wrappers-{version}.yaml.inc
                  builders:
                    - shell:
                        !include-raw-verbatim: echo_vars_{version}.sh

          with variable substitution inside included files:

              # Variables should be substituted in included raw files
              # when their path themselves contains variables.

              - job-template:
                  name: 'sample-job-{version}'
                  builders:
                  - shell:
                      !include-raw-expand: lazy-load-scripts/subst_vars_{version}.sh

              - project:
                  name: sample-project
                  branch: master
                  version:
                  - 1.1
                  - 1.2:
                      branch: feature
                  jobs:
                  - 'sample-job-{version}'

          using a list of files:

              - wrapper:
                  !include: lazy-load-jobs-timeout.yaml.inc

              - project:
                  name: test
                  num: "002"
                  version:
                    - 1.1
                  jobs:
                    - 'build_myproject_{version}'

              - job-template:
                  name: 'build_myproject_{version}'
                  wrappers:
                    !include: lazy-load-wrappers-{version}.yaml.inc
                  builders:
                    - shell:
                        !include-raw-verbatim:
                          - lazy-load-scripts/echo_vars_{version}.sh
                          - include-raw{num}-cool.sh

       The tag !include-jinja2: will treat the given string or list of strings as filenames to be opened as Jinja2 templates, which should be rendered to a string and included in the  calling  YAML  con‐
       struct.  (This is analogous to the templating that will happen with !include-raw.)

       Examples:

              - builder:
                  name: test-builder
                  builders:
                      - shell:
                          !include-jinja2: jinja01.yaml.inc

              - job:
                  name: test-job
                  builders:
                      - test-builder:
                          var: "test variable"
                          test_list:
                              - a
                              - b
                              - c

          contents of jinja01.yaml.inc:

                 {{ var }}
                 {% for item in test_list -%}
                 {{ item }}
                 {% endfor %}

       The tag !j2: takes a string and treats it as a Jinja2 template.  It will be rendered (with the variables in that context) and included in the calling YAML construct.

       Examples:

              - builder:
                  name: test-builder
                  builders:
                      - shell:
                          !j2: |
                              {{ var }}
                              {% for item in test_list -%}
                              {{ item }}
                              {% endfor %}

              - job:
                  name: test-job
                  builders:
                      - test-builder:
                          var: "test variable"
                          test_list:
                              - a
                              - b
                              - c

       The  tag !j2-yaml: is similar to the !j2: tag, just that it loads the Jinja-rendered string as YAML and embeds it in the calling YAML construct. This provides a very flexible and convenient way of
       generating pieces of YAML structures. One of use cases is defining complex YAML structures with much simpler configuration, without any duplication.

       Examples:

              - job-template:
                  name: test-job-template
                  triggers:
                  - gerrit:
                      projects:
                          !j2-yaml: |
                              {% for item in triggers %}
                              - branches:
                                - branch-compare-type: PLAIN
                                  branch-pattern: '{{ item.branch }}'
                                project-compare-type: REG_EXP
                                project-pattern: '{{ item.repositories|join("|") }}'
                              {% endfor %}

              - project:
                  name: test-job-project

                  jobs:
                  - test-job-template:
                      triggers:
                      - repositories:
                          - a
                          - b
                          - c
                        branch: master
                      - repositories:
                          - d
                          - e
                          - f
                        branch: stable

       Another use case is controlling lists dynamically, like conditionally adding list elements based on project configuration.

       Examples:

              - job-template:
                  name: 'test-job-{variant}'
                  properties: !j2-yaml: |
                      - rebuild
                      {% if discard_old_builds|default %}
                      - build-discarder:
                          days-to-keep: 7
                      {% endif %}

              - project:
                  name: test-project

                  jobs:
                  - 'test-job-{variant}':
                      variant: abc

                  - 'test-job-{variant}':
                      variant: def
                      discard_old_builds: true

   Modules
       The bulk of the job definitions come from the following modules.

   ExternalJob Project
       The External Job Project module handles creating ExternalJob Jenkins projects.  You may specify externaljob in the project-type attribute of the Job definition.

       This type of job allows you to record the execution of a process run outside Jenkins, even on a remote machine. This is designed so that you can use Jenkins as a dashboard of your existing automa‐
       tion system.

       Requires the Jenkins External Monitor Job Type Plugin.

       Example:

              name: openstack-infra
              project-type: externaljob

       class project_externaljob.ExternalJob(registry)

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   Flow Project
       The flow Project module handles creating Jenkins flow projects.  You may specify flow in the project-type attribute of the Job definition.

       Requires the Jenkins Build Flow Plugin.

       In order to use it for job-template you have to escape the curly braces by doubling them in the DSL: { -> {{ , otherwise it will be interpreted by the python str.format() command.

       Job Parameters

              • dsl (str): The DSL content. (optional)

              • needs-workspace (bool): This build needs a workspace.     (default false)

              • dsl-file (str): Path to the DSL script in the workspace.     Has effect only when needs-workspace is true. (optional)

       Job example:

              - job:
                    name: test_job
                    project-type: flow
                    dsl: |
                      build("job1")
                      parallel (
                        {{ build("job2a") }},
                        {{ build("job2b") }}
                      )

       Job template example:

              - job-template:
                  name: '{name}-unit-tests'
                  project-type: flow
                  dsl: |
                      build("job1")
                      parallel (
                          {{ build("job2a") }},
                          {{ build("job2b") }}
                      )
                      build("job2c")
                  builders:
                  - shell: unittest
                  publishers:
                  - email:
                      recipients: '{mail-to}'

              - job-group:
                  name: '{name}-tests'
                  jobs:
                  - '{name}-unit-tests':
                      mail-to: developer@nowhere.net

              - project:
                  name: project-name
                  jobs:
                  - '{name}-tests'

       Job example runninng a DSL file from the workspace:

              - job:
                    name: test_job
                    project-type: flow
                    needs-workspace: true
                    dsl-file: script.groovy

       class project_flow.Flow(registry)

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   Folder Project
       The folder Project module handles creating Jenkins folder projects.  You may specify folder in the project-type attribute of the Job definition.

       Requires the Jenkins CloudBees Folders Plugin.

       Job example:

              - job:
                  name: folder_test
                  project-type: folder

       Job template example:

              - job-template:
                  name: 'folder-{name}'
                  project-type: folder

              - project:
                  name: test
                  jobs:
                  - 'folder-{name}'

       class project_folder.Folder(registry)

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   Freestyle Project
       The Freestyle Project module handles creating freestyle Jenkins projects (i.e., those that do not use Maven).  You may specify freestyle in the project-type attribute to the Job definition if  you
       wish, though it is the default, so you may omit project-type altogether if you are creating a freestyle project.

       Example:

          job:
            name: test_job
            project-type: freestyle

       class project_freestyle.Freestyle(registry)

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   GitHub Organization Project
       The  Github  Organization project module handles creating Jenkins Github Organization jobs, which are made up of multibranch pipelines for all repositories containing the specified Jenkinsfile(s).
       You may specify githuborg in the project-type attribute of the Job definition.

       Plugins required:

       • GitHub Branch Source Plugin

                fault none)

              • prune-dead-branches (bool): If dead branches upon check should result in their job being dropped. (default true)

              • number-to-keep (int): How many builds should be kept.  (default '-1, all')

   Matrix Project
       The  matrix project module handles creating Jenkins matrix projects. To create a matrix project specify matrix in the project-type attribute to the Job definition.  Currently it supports four axes
       which share the same internal YAML structure:

       • label expressions (label-expression)

       • user-defined values (user-defined)

       • slave name or label (slave)

       • JDK name (jdk)

       Requires the Jenkins Matrix Project Plugin.

       The module also supports additional, plugin-defined axes:

       • DynamicAxis (dynamic), requires the Jenkins DynamicAxis Plugin

       • GroovyAxis (groovy), requires the Jenkins GroovyAxis Plugin

       • YamlAxis (yaml), requires the Jenkins Yaml Axis Plugin

       To tie the parent job to a specific node, you should use node parameter.  On a matrix project, this will tie only the parent job.  To restrict axes jobs, you can define a single value slave axis.

       Job Parameters

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   MultiJob Project
       The MultiJob Project module handles creating MultiJob Jenkins projects.  You may specify multijob in the project-type attribute of the Job definition.

       This project type may use jenkins_jobs.modules.builders.multijob() builders.

       Requires the Jenkins Multijob Plugin.

       Example:

          job:
            name: test_job
            project-type: multijob
            builders:
              - multijob:
                  name: PhaseOne
                  condition: SUCCESSFUL
                  projects:
                    - name: PhaseOneJobA

                      git-revision: true
                    - name: PhaseOneJobB
                      current-parameters: true
                      property-file: build.props
              - multijob:
                  name: PhaseTwo

                    - name: PhaseTwoJobA
                      current-parameters: true
                      predefined-parameters: foo=bar
                    - name: PhaseTwoJobB
                      current-parameters: false

       class project_multijob.MultiJob(registry)

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   Pipeline Project
       The Pipeline Project module handles creating Jenkins Pipeline projects (formerly known as the Workflow projects).  You may specify pipeline in the project-type attribute of the Job definition.

       Requires the Jenkins Pipeline Plugin.

       In order to write an inline script within a job-template you have to escape the curly braces by doubling them in the DSL: { -> {{ , otherwise it will be interpreted by the python str.format() com‐
       mand.

       Job Parameters

              • sandbox (bool): If the script should run in a sandbox (default false)

              • dsl (str): The DSL content or,

              • pipeline-scm (str): in case "Pipeline as code" feature is used.  Then you should specify:

                   • scm: single scm component (or a reference) describing the source code repository

                   • script-path: path to the Groovy file containing the job's steps (optional, default: Jenkinsfile)

                   • lightweight-checkout (bool): If selected, try to obtain the Pipeline script contents directly from the SCM without performing a full checkout. (optional, default: false)

       Note that dsl and pipeline-scm parameters are mutually exclusive.

       Inline DSL job example:

              - job:
                  name: test_job
                  project-type: pipeline
                  dsl: |
                    build job: "job1"
                    parallel [
                      2a: build job: "job2a",
                      2b: node "dummynode" {{
                        sh "echo I'm alive!"
                      }}
                    ]

       Inline DSL job template example:

              - job-template:
                  name: '{name}-unit-tests'
                  project-type: pipeline
                  dsl: |
                      build job: "job1"
                      parallel [
                        2a: build job: "job2a",
                        2b: node "dummynode" {{
                          sh "echo {isay}"
                        }}
                      ]

              - job-group:
                  name: '{name}-tests'
                  jobs:

                    scm:
                      - hg:
                          url: http://hg.example.org/test_job
                          clean: true
                    script-path: Jenkinsfile.groovy
                    lightweight-checkout: true

       class project_pipeline.Pipeline(registry)

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   Workflow Project
       Deprecated: please use Pipeline Project instead.

       The workflow Project module handles creating Jenkins workflow projects.  You may specify workflow in the project-type attribute of the Job definition.  For now only inline scripts are supported.

       Requires the Jenkins Workflow Plugin.

       In order to use it for job-template you have to escape the curly braces by doubling them in the DSL: { -> {{ , otherwise it will be interpreted by the python str.format() command.

       Job Parameters

              • dsl (str): The DSL content.

              • sandbox (bool): If the script should run in a sandbox (default false)

       Job example:

              - job:
                  name: test_job
                  project-type: workflow
                  dsl: |
                    build job: "job1"
                    parallel [
                      2a: build job: "job2a",
                      2b: node "dummynode" {{
                        sh "echo I'm alive!"
                      }}
                    ]

       Job template example:

              - job-template:
                  name: '{name}-unit-tests'
                  project-type: workflow
                  dsl: |
                      build job: "job1"
                      parallel [
                        2a: build job: "job2a",
                        2b: node "dummynode" {{
                          sh "echo {isay}"
                        }}
                      ]

                  name: project-name
                  jobs:
                  - '{name}-tests'

       class project_workflow.Workflow(registry)

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   Multibranch Pipeline Project
       The Multibranch Pipeline project module handles creating Jenkins workflow projects.  You may specify multibranch in the project-type attribute of the Job definition.

       Multibranch Pipeline implementantion in JJB is marked as experimental which means that there is no guarantee that its behavior (or configuration) will not change, even between minor releases.

       class view_pipeline.Pipeline(registry)

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   Builders
       Builders  define  actions that the Jenkins job should execute.  Examples include shell scripts or maven targets.  The builders attribute in the Job definition accepts a list of builders to invoke.
       They may be components defined below, locally defined macros (using the top level definition of builder:, or locally defined components found via the jenkins_jobs.builders entry point.

       Component: builders

              Macro  builder

              Entry Point
                     jenkins_jobs.builders

       Example:

          job:
            name: test_job

            builders:
              - shell: "make test"

       class builders.Builders(registry)

              component_list_type = 'builders'
                     The component list type will be used to look up possible implementations of the component type via entry points (entry points provide a list of components, so it should  be  plural).
                     Set both component_type and component_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              component_type = 'builder'
                     The  component  type for components of this module.  This will be used to look for macros (they are defined singularly, and should not be plural).  Set both component_type and compo‐
                     nent_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              gen_xml(xml_parent, data)
                     Update the XML element tree based on YAML data.  Override this method to add elements to the XML output.  Create new Element objects and add them to the xml_parent.   The  YAML  data
                     structure must not be modified.

                     :arg class:xml.etree.ElementTree xml_parent: the parent XML element :arg dict data: the YAML data structure

              sequence = 60
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

       ant()  Execute an ant target. Requires the Jenkins Ant Plugin.

              To setup this builder you can either reference the list of targets or use named parameters. Below is a description of both forms:

              1) Listing targets:

              After the ant directive, simply pass as argument a space separated list of targets to build.

              Parameter
                     space separated list of Ant targets

              Example to call two Ant targets:

                 builders:
                   - ant: "target1 target2"

              The build file would be whatever the Jenkins Ant Plugin is set to use per default (i.e build.xml in the workspace root).

              2) Using named parameters:

              Parameters

                     • targets (str) -- the space separated list of ANT targets.

                     • buildfile (str) -- the path to the ANT build file.

                     • properties (list) -- Passed to ant script using -Dkey=value (optional)

                     • ant-name (str) -- the name of the ant installation, (default 'default') (optional)

                     • java-opts (str) -- java options for ant, can have multiples, must be in quotes (optional)

              Example specifying the build file too and several targets:

                 builders:
                   - ant:
                      targets: "debug test install"
                      buildfile: "build.xml"
                      properties:
                         builddir: "/tmp/"
                         failonerror: true
                      java-opts:
                         - "-ea"
                         - "-Xmx512m"
                      ant-name: "Standard Ant"

       artifact-resolver()
              Allows one to resolve artifacts from a maven repository like nexus (without having maven installed)

       conditional-step()
              Conditionally execute some build steps.

              Requires the Jenkins Conditional BuildStep Plugin.

              Depending on the number of declared steps, a Conditional step (single) or a Conditional steps (multiple) is created in Jenkins.

              Parameters

                     • condition-kind (str) -- Condition kind that must be verified before the steps are executed. Valid values and their additional attributes are described in the conditions table.

                     • on-evaluation-failure (str) -- What should be the outcome of the build if the evaluation of the condition fails. Possible values are fail, mark-unstable, run-and-mark-unstable, run
                       and dont-run.  (default 'fail').

                     • steps (list) -- List of steps to run if the condition is verified. Items in the list can be any builder known by Jenkins Job Builder.

   Hipchat
       Enable HipChat notifications of build execution.

       Supports hipchat plugin versions < 1.9. Will automatically redirect to the publishers module for newer versions, but still recommended that you convert to the newer module.

       Parameters

              • enabled  (bool):  general  cut  off switch. If not explicitly set to true, no hipchat parameters are written to XML. For Jenkins HipChat plugin of version prior to 0.1.5, also enables all
                build results to be reported in HipChat room. For later plugin versions, explicit notify-* setting is required (see below).

              • room (str): name of HipChat room to post messages to (default '')

                Deprecated since version 1.2.0: Please use 'rooms'.

              • rooms (list): list of HipChat rooms to post messages to (default empty)

              • start-notify (bool): post messages about build start event

                Deprecated since version 1.2.0: use notify-start parameter instead

              • notify-start (bool): post messages about build start event (default false)

              • notify-success (bool): post messages about successful build event (Jenkins HipChat plugin >= 0.1.5) (default false)

              • notify-aborted (bool): post messages about aborted build event (Jenkins HipChat plugin >= 0.1.5) (default false)

              • notify-not-built (bool): post messages about build set to NOT_BUILT status (Jenkins HipChat plugin >= 0.1.5). This status code is used in a multi-stage build (like maven2) where a problem
                in earlier stage prevented later stages from building. (default false)

              • notify-unstable (bool): post messages about unstable build event (Jenkins HipChat plugin >= 0.1.5) (default false)

              • notify-failure (bool):  post messages about build failure event (Jenkins HipChat plugin >= 0.1.5) (default false)

              • notify-back-to-normal (bool): post messages about build being back to normal after being unstable or failed (Jenkins HipChat plugin >= 0.1.5) (default false)

       Example:

          hipchat:
            enabled: true
            rooms:
                - My Room

              component_list_type = 'properties'
                     The component list type will be used to look up possible implementations of the component type via entry points (entry points provide a list of components, so it should  be  plural).
                     Set both component_type and component_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              component_type = 'property'
                     The  component  type for components of this module.  This will be used to look for macros (they are defined singularly, and should not be plural).  Set both component_type and compo‐
                     nent_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              gen_xml(xml_parent, data)
                     Update the XML element tree based on YAML data.  Override this method to add elements to the XML output.  Create new Element objects and add them to the xml_parent.   The  YAML  data

       batch-tasks()
              Batch tasks can be tasks for events like releases, integration, archiving, etc. In this way, anyone in the project team can execute them in a way that leaves a record.

              A batch task consists of a shell script and a name. When you execute a build, the shell script gets run on the workspace, just like a build.  Batch tasks and builds "lock" the workspace, so
              when one of those activities is in progress, all the others will block in the queue.

              Requires the Jenkins Batch Task Plugin.

              Parameters
                     batch-tasks (list) --

                     Batch tasks.

                     Set both component_type and component_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              component_type = 'publisher'
                     The  component  type for components of this module.  This will be used to look for macros (they are defined singularly, and should not be plural).  Set both component_type and compo‐
                     nent_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

       cloverphp()
              Capture code coverage reports from PHPUnit Requires the Jenkins Clover PHP Plugin.

              Your  job  definition  should  pass  to PHPUnit the --coverage-clover option pointing to a file in the workspace (ex: clover-coverage.xml). The filename has to be filled in the xml-location
              field.

              Parameters

                     • xml-location (str) -- Path to the coverage XML file generated by PHPUnit using --coverage-clover. Relative to workspace. (required)

                     • html (dict) --

                       When existent, whether the plugin should generate a HTML report.  Note that PHPUnit already provide a HTML report via its --cover-html option which can be set in your builder  (op‐
                       tional):

                       •

                         dir (str): Directory where HTML report will be generated relative
                                to workspace. (required in html dict).

                       • archive (bool): Whether to archive HTML reports (default true).

                     • metric-targets (list) --

                       List of metric targets to reach, must be one of healthy, unhealthy and failing. Each metric target can takes two parameters:

                       • method  Target for method coverage

                       • statement Target for statements coverage

                       Whenever  a metric target is not filled in, the Jenkins plugin can fill in defaults for you (as of v0.3.3 of the plugin the healthy target will have method: 70 and statement: 80 if
                       both are left empty). Jenkins Job Builder will mimic that feature to ensure clean configuration diff.

              Minimal example:

                 # Test for the defaults, only xml-location is required
                 publishers:
                  - cloverphp:
                        xml-location: 'build/clover.xml'

              Full example:

                 # Exercise all options with non defaults values
                 publishers:
                  - cloverphp:
                        xml-location: 'build/clover.xml'
                        html:
                          dir: 'html'
                          archive: false
                        metric-targets:
                         - healthy:
                            method: 80
                            statement: 90
                         - unhealthy:
                            method: 40
                            statement: 50
                         - failing:
                            method: 10

       conditional-publisher()
              Conditionally execute some post-build steps. Requires the Jenkins Flexible Publish Plugin.

              A Flexible Publish list of Conditional Actions is created in Jenkins.

              Parameters

                     • condition-kind (str) -- Condition kind that must be verified before the action is executed. Valid values and their additional attributes are described in the conditions table.

                     • condition-aggregation (bool) -- If true Matrix Aggregation will be enabled. (default false)

                     • condition-aggregation-kind (str) -- Condition Aggregation kind that must be verified before the action is executed. Valid values and their additional attributes  are  described  in
                       the conditions table.

                     • on-evaluation-failure (str) -- What should be the outcome of the build if the evaluation of the condition fails. Possible values are fail, mark-unstable, run-and-mark-unstable, run
                       and dont-run.  Default is fail.

                     • action (list) -- Action to run if the condition is verified. Item can be any publisher known by Jenkins Job Builder and supported by the Flexible Publish Plugin.

              You  can  build  pipeline jobs that are re-usable in different pipelines by using a Job Template to define the pipeline jobs, and variable substitution to specify the name of the downstream
              job in the pipeline.  Job-specific substitutions are useful here (see Project).

              See 'samples/pipeline.yaml' for an example pipeline implementation.

              The script-only-if-succeeded and bool script-only-if-failed options are confusing. If you want the post build to always run regardless of the build status,  you  should  set  them  both  to
              false.

       scp()  Upload files via SCP Requires the Jenkins SCP Plugin.

              When writing a publisher macro, it is important to keep in mind that Jenkins uses Ant's SCP Task via the Jenkins SCP Plugin which relies on FileSet and DirSet patterns.  The relevant  piece
              of documentation is excerpted below:
                 Source  points  to files which will be uploaded. You can use ant includes syntax, eg. folder/dist/*.jar. Path is constructed from workspace root. Note that you cannot point files outside
                 the workspace directory.  For example providing: ../myfile.txt won't work...  Destination points to destination folder on remote site. It will be created if doesn't exists  and  relative
                 to root repository path. You can define multiple blocks of source/destination pairs.

              This  means  that  absolute  paths, e.g., /var/log/** will not work and will fail to compile. All paths need to be relative to the directory that the publisher runs and the paths have to be
              contained inside of that directory. The relative working directory is usually:

                 /home/jenkins/workspace/${JOB_NAME}

              Parameters

                     • site (str) -- name of the scp site (required)

                     • target (str) -- destination directory (required)

                     • source (str) -- source path specifier (default '')

                     • keep-hierarchy (bool) -- keep the file hierarchy when uploading (default false)

                     • copy-after-failure (bool) -- copy files even if the job fails (default false)

                     • copy-console (bool) -- copy the console log (default false); if specified, omit 'source'

              Example:

                 publishers:
                   - scp:
                       site: 'example.com'
                       files:
                         - target: 'dest/dir'

       slack()
              Publisher that sends slack notifications on job events.

              Requires the Jenkins Slack Plugin

              When using Slack Plugin version < 2.0, Slack Plugin itself requires a publisher as well as properties please note that you have to create those too.  When using Slack Plugin version >= 2.0,
              you should only configure the publisher.

              For backward compatibility, the publisher needs to query version of the Slack Plugin. Hence the query_plugins_info parameter shouldn't be set to False in the jenkins section of the configu‐
              ration file.

       tasks()
              Scans the workspace files for open tasks and generates a trend report.

              Requires the Jenkins Task Scanner Plugin (https://github.com/jenkinsci/tasks-plugin).

              Parameters

                     • files-to-scan (list) -- Fileset includes setting that specifies the workspace files to scan for tasks, such as **/*.java. Basedir of the fileset is  the  workspace  root.  (default
                       '**/*.java')

                     • files-to-exclude  (list)  --  Fileset excludes setting that specifies the workspace files to exclude scanning for tasks, such as library source files. Basedir of the fileset is the
                       workspace root. (default '')

                     • tasks-tags-high (list) -- Tags identifiers for high priority that should be looked for in the workspace files. Only alphanumerical characters are allowed as tags as  these  strings
                       are pasted into a regular expression. (default '')

                     • tasks-tags-normal  (list)  --  Tags  identifiers  for  normal priority that should be looked for in the workspace files. Only alphanumerical characters are allowed as tags as these
                       strings are pasted into a regular expression. (default '')

                     • tasks-tags-low (list) -- Tags identifiers for low priority that should be looked for in the workspace files. Only alphanumerical characters are allowed as tags as these strings are
                       pasted into a regular expression.  (default '')

                     • ignore-case (bool) -- Ignore the case of the the tag identifiers. (default false)

                     • regular-expression (bool) -- Treat the tag identifiers as regular expression. Note that the regular expression must contain two capturing groups, the first one  is  interpreted  as
                       tag name, the second one as message. An example of such a regular expression would be ^.*(TODO(?:[0-9]*))(.*)$. (default false)

                     • run-always  (bool)  --  By default, this plug-in runs only for stable or unstable builds, but not for failed builds. If this plug-in should run even for failed builds then activate
                       this check box. (default false)

                     • detect-module (bool) -- Determines if Ant or Maven modules should be detected for all files that contain warnings. Activating this option may increase your build time since the de‐
                       tector scans the whole workspace for build.xml or pom.xml files in order to assign the correct module names. (default false)

                     • health-thresholds-100 (int) -- Configure the upper thresholds for the build health. If left empty then no health report is created. If the actual number of warnings is between  the
                       provided thresholds then the build health is interpolated. (default '')

                     • health-thresholds-0  (str)  --  Configure the lower thresholds for the build health. If left empty then no health report is created. If the actual number of warnings is between the
                       provided thresholds then the build health is interpolated. (default '')

                     • health-priorities (str) -- Determines which warning priorities should be considered when evaluating the build health. Can be high (only priority high), normal (priorities high  and
                       normal) or low (all priorities). (default 'low')

                     • status-thresholds (dict) --

                       Configure  the  build  status  and  health. If the number of total or new warnings is greater than one of these thresholds then a build is considered as unstable or failed, respec‐
                       tively. I.e., a value of 0 means that the build status is changed if there is at least one warning found. Leave this field empty if the state of the build should not depend on  the
                       number of warnings. Note that for new warnings, you need to enable the next option (compute-new-warnings).

                       status-thresholds

                              • unstable-total-all (str): Total number for all priorities, unstable threshold (default '')

                              • unstable-total-high (str): Total number for high priority, unstable threshold (default '')

                              • unstable-total-normal (str): Total number for normal priority, unstable threshold (default '')

                              • unstable-total-low (str): Total number for low priority, unstable threshold (default '')

                              • failed-total-all (str): Total number for all priorities, failure threshold (default '')

                              • failed-total-high (str): Total number for high priority, failure threshold (default '')

                              • failed-total-normal (str): Total number for normal priority, failure threshold (default '')

                              • failed-total-low (str): Total number for low priority, failure threshold (default '')

                              • unstable-new-all (str): New number for all priorities, unstable threshold (default '')

                              • unstable-new-high (str): New number for high priority, unstable threshold (default '')

                              • unstable-new-normal (str): New number for normal priority, unstable threshold (default '')

                              • unstable-new-low (str): New number for low priority, unstable threshold (default '')

                              • failed-new-all (str): New number for all priorities, failure threshold (default '')

                              • failed-new-high (str): New number for high priority, failure threshold (default '')

                              • failed-new-normal (str): New number for normal priority, failure threshold (default '')

                              • failed-new-low (str): New number for low priority, failure threshold (default '')

                     • compute-new-warnings (bool) -- Compute new warnings (based on the last successful build unless another reference build is chosen below).  (default false)

                     • use-delta  (bool)  -- If set the number of new warnings is computed by subtracting the total number of warnings of the reference build from the total number of warnings of the cur‐
                       rent build. This may lead to wrong results if you have both fixed and new warnings in a build. If unset the number of new warnings is computed by a  more  sophisticated  algorithm:
                       instead  of  using totals an asymmetric set difference of the warnings in the current build and the warnings in the reference build is used. This will find all new warnings even if
                       the number of total warnings has decreased. Note that sometimes false positives will be reported due to minor changes in a warning (e.g. refactoring of variables or method  names).
                       It is recommended to uncheck this option in order to get the most accurate results for new warnings. Depends on compute-new-warnings option. (default false)

                     • use-prev-build-as-ref  (bool)  --  If  set the number of new warnings will always be computed based on the previous build, even if that build is unstable (due to a violated warning
                       threshold). Otherwise the last build that did not violate any given threshold will be used as reference. It is recommended to uncheck this option if the plug-in should ensure  that
                       all new warnings will be finally fixed in subsequent builds. Depends on compute-new-warnings option. (default false)

                     • only-use-stable-as-ref  (bool)  --  Use  the last stable build as the reference to compute the number of new warnings against. This allows you to ignore interim unstable builds for
                       which the number of warnings decreased. Note that the last stable build is evaluated only by inspecting the unit test failures. The static analysis results are not considered.  De‐
                       pends on compute-new-warnings option. (default false)

                     • default-encoding (str) -- Default encoding when parsing or showing files.  Leave this field empty to use the default encoding of the platform.  (default '')

                     • min (int) -- sunny threshold

                     • max (int) -- stormy threshold

                     • unstable (int) -- unstable threshold

                     • pattern (str) -- report filename pattern

              Any system without a dictionary provided will use default values.

              Valid systems are:
                 checkstyle, codenarc, cpd, cpplint, csslint, findbugs, fxcop, gendarme, jcreport, jslint, pep8, perlcritic, pmd, pylint, simian, stylecop

              • messages-to-ignore  (str)  --  Newline separated list of regular expressions that specifies the warning messages to exclude form the report (based on the warning messages). By default all
                warning messages are included

              • categories-to-ignore (str) -- Newline separated list of regular expressions that specifies the warning messages to exclude form the report (based on the warning  categories).  By  default

              • run-always  (bool) -- By default, this plug-in runs only for stable or unstable builds, but not for failed builds.  Set to true if the plug-in should run even for failed builds.  (default
                false)

              • detect-modules (bool) -- Determines if Ant or Maven modules should be detected for all files that contain warnings.  Activating this option may increase your build time since the detector

              • use-delta-for-new-warnings  (bool)  -- If set then the number of new warnings is calculated by subtracting the total number of warnings of the current build from the reference build. This
                may lead to wrong results if you have both fixed and new warnings in a build. If not set, then the number of new warnings is calculated by an asymmetric set difference of the warnings  in
                the  current  and  reference  build.  This  will find all new warnings even if the number of total warnings is decreasing. However, sometimes false positives will be reported due to minor
                changes in a warning (refactoring of variable of method names, etc.) (default false)

              • use-previous-build-as-reference (bool) -- If set the number of new warnings will always be computed based on the previous build, even if that build is unstable (due to a violated  warning
                threshold).   Otherwise  the  last build that did not violate any given threshold will be used as reference. It is recommended to uncheck this option if the plug-in should ensure that all
                new warnings will be finally fixed in subsequent builds. (default false)

              • only-use-stable-builds-as-reference (bool) -- The number of new warnings will be calculated based on the last stable build, allowing reverts of unstable builds where the number  of  warn‐
                ings was decreased.  (default false)

              • default-encoding (str) -- Default encoding when parsing or showing files Leave empty to use default encoding of platform (default '')

   SCM
       The SCM module allows you to specify the source code location for the project.  It adds the scm attribute to the Job definition, which accepts any number of scm definitions. It is also possible to
       pass [] to the scm attribute. This is useful when a set of configs has a global default scm and you want to a particular job to override that default with no SCM.

       Component: scm

              Macro  scm

              Entry Point
                     jenkins_jobs.scm

       The scm module allows referencing multiple repositories in a Jenkins job.  Note: Adding more than one scm definition requires the Jenkins Multiple SCMs plugin.

       Example of multiple repositories in a single job:

                 - scm:
                     name: first-scm
                     scm:
                       - git:
                          url: ssh://jenkins@review.openstack.org:29418/first.git
                          branches:
                           - origin/master

                 - scm:
                     name: second-scm
                     scm:
                       - git:
                          url: ssh://jenkins@review.openstack.org:29418/second.git
                          branches:
                           - origin/master

                 - scm:
                     name: first-and-second
                     scm:
                       - first-scm
                       - second-scm

                 - job:
                     name: my-job
                     scm:
                       - first-and-second

       Example of an empty scm:

                 scm: []

       class scm.PipelineSCM(registry)

              component_list_type = 'pipeline-scm'
                     The  component  list type will be used to look up possible implementations of the component type via entry points (entry points provide a list of components, so it should be plural).
                     Set both component_type and component_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              component_type = 'pipeline-scm'
                     The component type for components of this module.  This will be used to look for macros (they are defined singularly, and should not be plural).  Set both component_type  and  compo‐
                     nent_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              gen_xml(xml_parent, data)
                     Update  the  XML  element tree based on YAML data.  Override this method to add elements to the XML output.  Create new Element objects and add them to the xml_parent.  The YAML data
                     structure must not be modified.

                     :arg class:xml.etree.ElementTree xml_parent: the parent XML element :arg dict data: the YAML data structure

              sequence = 30
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

       class scm.SCM(registry)

              component_list_type = 'scm'
                     The component list type will be used to look up possible implementations of the component type via entry points (entry points provide a list of components, so it should  be  plural).
                     Set both component_type and component_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              component_type = 'scm'
                     The  component  type for components of this module.  This will be used to look for macros (they are defined singularly, and should not be plural).  Set both component_type and compo‐
                     nent_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              gen_xml(xml_parent, data)
                     Update the XML element tree based on YAML data.  Override this method to add elements to the XML output.  Create new Element objects and add them to the xml_parent.   The  YAML  data
                     structure must not be modified.

                     :arg class:xml.etree.ElementTree xml_parent: the parent XML element :arg dict data: the YAML data structure

              sequence = 30
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

       openshift-img-streams()
              Rather than a Build step extension plugin, this is an extension of the Jenkins SCM plugin, where this baked-in polling mechanism provided by Jenkins is leveraged by  exposing  some  of  the
              common semantics between OpenShift ImageStreams (which are abstractions of Docker repositories) and SCMs - versions / commit IDs of related artifacts (images vs. programmatics files)

              Requires the Jenkins OpenShift Pipeline Plugin.

              Parameters

                     • image-stream-name  (str)  --  The  name  of  the  ImageStream  is what shows up in the NAME column if you dump all the ImageStream's with the oc get is command invocation. (default
                       nodejs-010-centos7)

                     • tag (str) -- The specific image tag within the ImageStream to monitor.  (default latest)

                     • api-url (str) -- This would be the value you specify if you leverage the --server option on the OpenShift oc command.  (default https://openshift.default.svc.cluster.local)

                     • namespace (str) -- The value here should be whatever was the output form oc project when you created the BuildConfig you want to run a Build on. (default test)

                     • auth-token (str) -- The value here is what you supply with the --token option when invoking the OpenShift oc command. (default '')

                     • verbose (bool) -- This flag is the toggle for turning on or off detailed logging in this plug-in. (default false)

              Full Example:

                 scm:
                   - openshift-img-streams:
                       image-stream-name: nodejs-010-fedora
                       tag: prod
                       api-url: https://openshift.example.local.url/

       tfs()  Specifies the Team Foundation Server repository for this job.

              Requires the Jenkins Team Foundation Server Plugin (https://github.com/jenkinsci/tfs-plugin).

              NOTE:  TFS  Password must be entered manually on the project if a user name is specified. The password will be overwritten with an empty value every time the job is rebuilt with Jenkins Job
              Builder.

              Parameters

                     • server-url (str) -- The name or URL of the team foundation server.  If the server has been registered on the machine then it is only necessary to enter the name.

                     • project-path (str) -- The name of the project as it is registered on the server.

                     • login (str) -- The user name that is registered on the server. The user name must contain the name and the domain name. Entered as domain\\user or  user@domain  (optional).   NOTE:
                       You must enter in at least two slashes for the domain\\user format in JJB YAML. It will be rendered normally.

                     • use-update  (str)  --  If true, Hudson will not delete the workspace at end of each build. This causes the artifacts from the previous build to remain when a new build starts. (de‐
                       fault true)

                     • local-path (str) -- The folder where all files will be retrieved into.  The folder name is a relative path, under the workspace of the current job. (default .)

                     • workspace (str) --

                       The name of the workspace under which the source should be retrieved. This workspace is created at the start of a download, and deleted at the end. You can normally omit the  prop‐
                       erty  unless  you  want to name a workspace to avoid conflicts on the server (i.e. when you have multiple projects on one server talking to a Team Foundation Server). (default Hud‐
                       son-${JOB_NAME}-${NODE_NAME})

                       The TFS plugin supports the following macros that are replaced in the workspace name:

                       • ${JOB_NAME} - The name of the job.

                       •

                         ${USER_NAME} - The user name that the Hudson server or slave is
                                running as.

                       •

                         ${NODE_NAME} - The name of the node/slave that the plugin currently
                                is executed on. Note that this is not the hostname, this value is the Hudson configured name of the slave/node.

                       • ${ENV} - The environment variable that is set on the master or slave.

                     • web-access (dict) --

                       Adds links in "changes" views within Jenkins to an external system for browsing the details of those changes. The "Auto" selection attempts to infer  the  repository  browser  from
                       other jobs, if supported by the SCM and a job with matching SCM details can be found. (optional, default Auto).

                       web-access value

                              • web-url  --  Enter  the URL to the TSWA server. The plugin will strip the last path (if any) of the URL when building URLs for change set pages and other pages. (optional,
                                default uses server-url)

   Triggers
       Triggers define what causes a Jenkins job to start building.

       Component: triggers

              Macro  trigger

              Entry Point
                     jenkins_jobs.triggers

       Example:

          job:
            name: test_job

            triggers:
              - timed: '@daily'

       class triggers.Triggers(registry)

              component_list_type = 'triggers'
                     The component list type will be used to look up possible implementations of the component type via entry points (entry points provide a list of components, so it should  be  plural).
                     Set both component_type and component_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              component_type = 'trigger'
                     The  component  type for components of this module.  This will be used to look for macros (they are defined singularly, and should not be plural).  Set both component_type and compo‐
                     nent_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              gen_xml(xml_parent, data)
                     Update the XML element tree based on YAML data.  Override this method to add elements to the XML output.  Create new Element objects and add them to the xml_parent.   The  YAML  data
                     structure must not be modified.

                     :arg class:xml.etree.ElementTree xml_parent: the parent XML element :arg dict data: the YAML data structure

              sequence = 50
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

       artifactory()
              Artifactory trigger. Trigger if files are added or modified in configured path(s) to watch on chosen Artifactory server.

              Requires the Jenkins Artifactory Plugin.

              Parameters

                     • artifactory-server  (str) -- Artifactory server where the configured path(s) are monitored from. Available Artifactory servers must be configured on Jenkins Global Configuration in

                     • readable-message (bool) --

                       If  parameters regarding multiline text, e.g. commit message, should be as human readable or not. If false, those parameters are Base64 encoded to keep environment variables clean.
                       (default false)

                       Deprecated since version 3.5.0: Please use commit-message-parameter-mode parameter.

                     • change-subject-parameter-mode (str) -- The parameter mode for the GERRIT_CHANGE_SUBJECT parameter. This can either be 'NONE' to avoid passing the parameter all together, 'PLAIN' to
                       pass the parameter in human readable form, or 'BASE64' to pass the parameter in base64 encoded form (default 'PLAIN'). Requires Gerrit Trigger Plugin version >= 2.18.0.

                       2.11.0

              You  may select one or more Gerrit events upon which to trigger.  You must also supply at least one project and branch, optionally more.  If you select the comment-added trigger, you should
              also indicate which approval category and value you want to trigger the job.

              Until version 0.4.0 of Jenkins Job Builder, camelCase keys were used to configure Gerrit Trigger Plugin, instead of hyphenated-keys.  While still supported, camedCase  keys  are  deprecated
              and should not be used. Support for this will be removed after 1.0.0 is released.

                   - gerrit:

              The JMS Messaging Plugin provides the following functionality:

                     • A build trigger to submit jenkins jobs upon receipt of a matching message.

                     • A builder that may be used to submit a message to the topic upon the completion of a job

                     • A post-build action that may be used to submit a message to the topic upon the completion of a job

              JMS Messaging provider types supported:

              Parameters

                     • no-squash (bool) -- true = schedule a new job for every triggering message.  (default false) Normally if a job is queued and another triggering message is received, a  new  job  is
                       not submitted and the job is "squashed" into the job already queued.  Setting this option to 'True' forces a new job to be submitted for every triggering message that is received.

                     • override-topic (str) -- If you need to override the default topic.  (default '')

                     • selector  (str)  --  The JSON or YAML formatted text that conforms to the schema for defining the various OpenShift resources. (default '') note: topic needs to be in double quotes

                     • provider-name (str) -- Name of message provider setup in the global config. (default '')

                     • checks (list) -- List of checks to monitor. (default [])

                     • field (str) -- Check the body of messages for a field. (default '')

                     • expected-value (str) -- Expected value for the field. regex (default '')

              Full Example:

       rabbitmq()
              This plugin triggers build using remote build message in RabbitMQ queue.

              Requires the Jenkins RabbitMQ Build Trigger Plugin.

              Parameters

                     • token (str) -- the build token expected in the message queue (required)

                     • filters (list) --

                       list of filters to apply (optional)

                       Filter

                              • field (str) - Some field in message (required)

                              • value (str) - value of specified field (required)

              Example:

                 triggers:
                   - rabbitmq:
                       token: 'build_trigger_token'

              Example with filters:

                 triggers:
                   - rabbitmq:
                       token: 'build_trigger_token'
                       filters:
                         - field: 'field1'
                           value: 'value1'
                         - field: 'field2'
                           value: 'value2'

       reverse()
              This trigger can be configured in the UI using the checkbox with the following text: 'Build after other projects are built'.

              Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish building, a new build is scheduled for this project. This is convenient for running an extensive test after a build is complete, for
              example.

              This configuration complements the "Build other projects" section in the "Post-build Actions" of an upstream project, but is preferable when you want to configure the downstream project.

              Parameters

                     • jobs (str) -- List of jobs to watch. Can be either a comma separated list or a list.

                     • result (str) -- Build results to monitor for between the following options: success, unstable and failure. (default 'success').

              Example:

                 triggers:

       class wrappers.Wrappers(registry)

              component_list_type = 'wrappers'
                     The  component  list type will be used to look up possible implementations of the component type via entry points (entry points provide a list of components, so it should be plural).
                     Set both component_type and component_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              component_type = 'wrapper'
                     The component type for components of this module.  This will be used to look for macros (they are defined singularly, and should not be plural).  Set both component_type  and  compo‐
                     nent_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              gen_xml(xml_parent, data)
                     Update  the  XML  element tree based on YAML data.  Override this method to add elements to the XML output.  Create new Element objects and add them to the xml_parent.  The YAML data

   Zuul
       The Zuul module adds jobs parameters to manually run a build as Zuul would have. It is entirely optional, Zuul 2.0+ pass the parameters over Gearman.

       class zuul.Zuul(registry)

              amend_job_dict(job)
                     This method is called before any XML is generated.  By overriding this method, a module may arbitrarily modify a job data structure which will probably be the  JJB  Job  intermediate
                     data dict representation. If it has changed the data structure at all, it must return True, otherwise, it must return False.

                     Parameters
                            job (dict) -- the intermediate representation of job data loaded from JJB Yaml files after variables interpolation and other yaml expansions.

                     Return type
                            bool

              sequence = 0
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

       zuul() Configure this job to be triggered by Zuul.

              Adds parameters describing the change triggering the build such as the branch name, change number and patchset.

              See parameters expected by Zuul.

              Example:

                 triggers:
                   - zuul

       zuul-post()
              Configure this post-merge job to be triggered by Zuul.

              Adds parameters describing the reference update triggering the build, which are the previous and next revisions in full (40 hexadecimal sha1) and short form.

              See parameters expected by Zuul.

              Example:

                 triggers:
                   - zuul-post

   Module Execution
       The jenkins job builder modules are executed in sequence.

       Generally the sequence is:

              1. parameters/properties

              2. scm

              3. triggers

              4. wrappers

              5. prebuilders (maven only, configured like Builders)

              6. builders (maven, freestyle, matrix, etc..)

              7. postbuilders (maven only, configured like Builders)

              8. publishers/reporters/notifications

EXTENDING
       Jenkins  Job  Builder is quite modular.  It is easy to add new attributes to existing components, a new module to support a Jenkins plugin, or include locally defined methods to deal with an idio‐
       syncratic build system.

   The Builder
       The Builder class manages Jenkins jobs. It's responsible for creating/deleting/updating jobs and can be called from your application. You can pass it a filename or an open  file-like  object  that
       represents your YAML configuration. See the jenkins_jobs/builder.py file for more details.

   XML Processing
       Most  of the work of building XML from the YAML configuration file is handled by individual functions that implement a single characteristic.  For example, see the jenkins_jobs/modules/builders.py
       file for the Python module that implements the standard Jenkins builders.  The shell function at the top of the file implements the standard Execute a shell build step.  All of  the  YAML  to  XML
       functions in Jenkins Job Builder have the same signature:

       component(xml_parent, data)
              :arg class:xml.etree.ElementTree xml_parent: this attribute's parent XML element :arg dict data: the YAML data structure for this attribute and below

       The function is expected to examine the YAML data structure and create new XML nodes and attach them to the xml_parent element.  This general pattern is applied throughout the included modules.

   Modules
       Nearly  all  of Jenkins Job Builder is implemented in modules.  The main program has no concept of builders, publishers, properties, or any other aspects of job definition.  Each of those building
       blocks is defined in a module, and due to the use of setuptools entry points, most modules are easily extensible with new components.

       To add a new module, define a class that inherits from jenkins_jobs.modules.base.Base, and add it to the jenkins_jobs.modules entry point in your setup.py.

       class jenkins_jobs.modules.base.Base(registry)
              A base class for a Jenkins Job Builder Module.

              The module is initialized before any YAML is parsed.

              Parameters
                     registry (ModuleRegistry) -- the global module registry.

              amend_job_dict(job)
                     This method is called before any XML is generated.  By overriding this method, a module may arbitrarily modify a job data structure which will probably be the  JJB  Job  intermediate
                     data dict representation. If it has changed the data structure at all, it must return True, otherwise, it must return False.

                     Parameters
                            job (dict) -- the intermediate representation of job data loaded from JJB Yaml files after variables interpolation and other yaml expansions.

                     Return type
                            bool

              component_list_type = None
                     The  component  list type will be used to look up possible implementations of the component type via entry points (entry points provide a list of components, so it should be plural).
                     Set both component_type and component_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              component_type = None
                     The component type for components of this module.  This will be used to look for macros (they are defined singularly, and should not be plural).  Set both component_type  and  compo‐
                     nent_list_type to None if module doesn't have components.

              dispatch_component_list(component_type, component_list, xml_parent, job_data=None)

              gen_xml(xml_parent, data)
                     Update  the  XML  element tree based on YAML data.  Override this method to add elements to the XML output.  Create new Element objects and add them to the xml_parent.  The YAML data
                     structure must not be modified.

                     :arg class:xml.etree.ElementTree xml_parent: the parent XML element :arg dict data: the YAML data structure

              sequence = 10
                     The sequence number for the module.  Modules are invoked in the order of their sequence number in order to produce consistently ordered XML output.

   Components
       Most of the standard modules supply a number of components, and it's easy to provide your own components for use by those modules.  For instance, the Builders  module  provides  several  builders,
       such  as the shell builder as well as the trigger_builds builder.  If you wanted to add a new builder, all you need to do is write a function that conforms to the Component Interface, and then add
       that function to the appropriate entry point (via a setup.py file).

   Module Registry
       All modules and their associated components are registered in the module registry. It can be accessed either from modules via the registry field, or via the parser parameter of components.

       class jenkins_jobs.registry.ModuleRegistry(jjb_config, plugins_list=None)

              dispatch(component_type, xml_parent, component, template_data={}, job_data=None, component_pos=None)
                     This is a method that you can call from your implementation of Base.gen_xml or component.  It allows modules to define a type of component, and benefit from extensibility via  Python
                     entry points and Jenkins Job Builder Macros.

                     Parameters

                            • component_type (str) -- the name of the component (e.g., builder)

                            • xml_parent -- the parent XML element

                            • component -- component definition

                            • template_data (dict) -- values that should be interpolated into the component definition

                            • job_data (dict) -- full job definition

                     See jenkins_jobs.modules.base.Base for how to register components of a module.

                     See the Publishers module for a simple example of how to use this method.

              get_plugin_version(plugin_name, alt_plugin_name=None, default=None)
                     Provide plugin version to be used from a module's impl of Base.gen_xml.

                     The return value is a plugin version obtained directly from a running Jenkins instance.  This allows module authors to differentiate generated XML output based on it.

                     Parameters

                            • plugin_name (str) -- Either the shortName or longName of a plugin as seen in a query that looks like: http://<jenkins-hostname>/pluginManager/api/json?pretty&depth=2

                            • alt_plugin_name (str) -- Alternative plugin name. Used if plugin_name is missing in plugin list.

                            • default (str) -- Default value. Used if plugin name is missing in plugin list.

                     During  a  'test'  run, it is possible to override JJB's query to a live Jenkins instance by passing it a path to a file containing a YAML list of dictionaries that mimics the plugin
                     properties you want your test output to reflect:

                        jenkins-jobs test -p /path/to/plugins-info.yaml

                     Below is example YAML that might be included in /path/to/plugins-info.yaml.

                        - longName: 'Jenkins HipChat Plugin'
                          shortName: 'hipchat'
                          version: "0.1.8"

   Release 5.0.0
   Changes breaking backward compatibility
       • YAML parser/expander is rewritten.

         • More aggressive parameter expansion. This may lead to parameters expanded in places where they were not expanded before.  See changes in this test for examples:

           • inter-parameter-expansion.yaml

           • inter-parameter-expansion.xml

         • Top-level elements, which is not known to parser (such as 'job', 'view', 'project' etc), are now lead to parse failures.  Fix: Prepend them with underscore to be ignored by parser.  For  exam‐
           ple:

           • custom_retain_anchors_include001.yaml

         • Files included using !include-raw: elements and having formatting in it's path ('lazy-loaded' in previous implementation) are now expanded too.  Fix: Use !include-raw-escape: for them instead.
           See changes in these tests for examples:

           • lazy-load-jobs-multi001.yaml

           • lazy-load-jobs-multi002.yaml

           • lazy-load-jobs001.yaml

         • Parameters  with template value using themselves were substituted as is. For example: timer: '{timer}' was expanded to {timer}.  Now it leads to recursive parameter error.  See changes in this
           test for example:

           • parameter_name_reuse_default.yaml

           • parameter_name_reuse_default.xml

           • parameter_name_reuse_default.error

         • When job group includes a job which was never declared, it was just ignored. Now it fails: job is missing.  See changes in this test for example:

           • job_group_includes_missing_job.yaml

           • job_group_includes_missing_job.xml

           • job_group_includes_missing_job.error

   Features added
       • Error handling is improved: now JJB shows tracebacks with error locations See these tests for examples.

       • Added support for Python 3.9 and 3.10.

       • Added configuration for Suppress SCM Triggering (by Piotr Falkowski).

       • Added discord-notifier publisher (by Ettore Leandro Tognoli).

   Bugs fixed
       • --enabled-only option when updating jobs (by Thomas Bechtold).

       • Default value does not propertly unescape curly braces (Story 2006270).

       • Different behaviour on defaults list and inline variables for Jenkins Job Builder (Story 2008510).

       • TypeError: argument of type Jinja2Loader is not iterable (Story 2010428).
