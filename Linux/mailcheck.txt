NAME
       mailcheck - Check multiple mailboxes and/or Maildirs for new mail

SYNOPSIS
       mailcheck [-lbcsh] [-f rcfile]

DESCRIPTION
       mailcheck is a simple, configurable tool that allows multiple mailboxes to be checked for the existence of mail.  For local mail, it supports both the traditional mbox format and the newer Maildir
       format.  Mail can also be checked for on remote servers using either the POP3 or IMAP protocol.

       Typically,  one  would invoke mailcheck in /etc/profile or a user-specific login script.  E-mail junkies may also find it useful to invoke mailcheck occasionally to check for new mail in alternate
       mailboxes.

       The author uses mailcheck to keep track of messages arriving in mailboxes corresponding to several mailing lists he subscribes to.

OPTIONS
       -l     Runs mailcheck in login mode.  If a ~/.hushlogin file exists, mailcheck will exit silently.  This option is intended to be used on systems that invoke mailcheck from a global  login  script
              such as /etc/profile.

       -b     Brief mode.  Produces less verbose output.  If mailbox or Maildir is inside user's home directory, only relative path is printed to output.

       -c     Use  more advanced counting method.  While counting mails, mailcheck looks inside mboxes and Maildirs and count new and unread messages separately.  If mbox/maildir does not contain any new
              or unread mail, it's excluded from report.  Produced output contains more valuable information, but this method is more time-consuming.

       -s     Print "no mail" summary.  If no new mail message is found, print at least "no mail message" at the end.  Only makes sense in combination with -c.

       -f     Specify alternative rc file location.  If provided, default locations (see FILES) are not checked.

       -h     Print short usage information.

CONFIGURATION
       Configuring mailcheck is simple.  Upon startup, mailcheck looks for a file called .mailcheckrc in the user's home  directory.   If  that  file  does  not  exist,  the  default  configuration  file
       /etc/mailcheckrc is used instead.

       Lines  beginning with a hash sign (#) are treated as comments and will not be processed.  Lines beginning with pop3: or imap: are parsed like URLs and used to connect to network mail servers.  All
       other lines are treated as pathnames to mailbox files or Maildir directories.

       Environment variables in the format $(NAME) will be expanded inline.  For example:

       /var/spool/mail/$(USER)
              Will check the user's mailbox in /var/spool/mail.

       $(HOME)/Mailbox
              Will check the default mailbox used by qmail installations.

       When connecting to POP3 or IMAP servers, the account password is not stored in the mailcheckrc file.  Instead, the .netrc file in the user's home directory is used.  This file, originally intended
       for use with ftp(1) and later used by fetchmail(1), should be readable only by the user owning it.  It stores server/user/password combinations in the form:

       machine servername login username password password

FILES
       /etc/mailcheckrc
              This is the site-default mailcheck configuration file.  It should be edited by the system administrator to meet the needs of most users on the system.

       ~/.mailcheckrc
              This is the user-specific mailcheck configuration file.  If it exists for a particular user, the site-default configuration file will not be used.

       ~/.netrc
              This tells mailcheck what password to use for a given server/user combination when checking POP3 or IMAP mail.
