NAME
       cvereport - Generate an HTML report for the cvechecker output

SYNOPSIS
       cvereport [-d | -D] <targetdir> <acknowledgementfile>

DESCRIPTION
       The cvereport tool will generate an HTML report based on the cvechecker
       output. The report is generated based on some simple XML/XSLT transfor‐
       mations  and uses an acknowledgement file to keep track of the state of
       the CVE entries matching your system.

USAGE
   COMMAND USAGE
       The command requires two user-specified options:

       • The targetdir is an existing, writeable directory where cvereport can
         store its report.html output.

       • The  acknowledgementfile  is an existing, readable XML file that con‐
         tains the analysis of the CVE entries for your system

       The difference between -d and -D is that

       • -d runs the standard cvechecker report, whereas

       • -D runs the cvechecker report including matches for  higher  versions
         of the installed software

   ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FILE FORMAT
       The XML file for the acknowledgements uses the following syntax:

       <?xml version="1.0"?>
       <acknowledgements>
         <resolution id="resolution_id_1">Comment about why a CVE entry is irrelevant for your system</resolution>
         <resolution id="resolution_id_2">Another comment</resolution>
         <comment id="comment_id_1">Comment why the CVE is acknowledged, but not resolved</comment>
         <file name="/path/to/filename1" cve="CVE-2000-1234" state="irrelevant" resolution="resolution_id_1" />
         <file name="/path/to/filename2" cve="CVE-2000-5678" state="irrelevant" resolution="resolution_id_2" />
         <file name="/path/to/filename3" cve="CVE-2001-9012" state="acknowledged" comment="comment_id_1" />
       </acknowledgements>

       The use of comments or resolutions within the file entity is not manda‐
       tory, but recommended.
