NAME
       nbdkit-ssh-plugin - access disk images over the SSH protocol

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit ssh host=HOST [path=]PATH
                   [compression=true] [config=CONFIG_FILE] [identity=FILENAME]
                   [known-hosts=FILENAME] [password=PASSWORD|-|+FILENAME]
                   [port=PORT] [timeout=SECS] [user=USER]
                   [verify-remote-host=false]

DESCRIPTION
       This is an nbdkit(1) plugin which lets you access remote disk images over Secure Shell (SSH).  Any server which hosts disk images and runs an SSH server can be turned into an NBD source using this
       plugin.

EXAMPLES
       nbdkit ssh host=ssh.example.com disk.img
           Open a file called disk.img on remote host "ssh.example.com".  Because the pathname is relative, it is opened relative to the user’s home directory on the remote server.

           The remote file can be read or written.  To force read-only access add the -r flag.

       nbdkit ssh host=ssh.example.com disk.img user=bob
           As above but log in using username "bob" (instead of trying the local username).

PARAMETERS
       compression=true
           Enable compression.  You should only use this on slow or bandwidth-limited connections.  On fast connections it will slow things down.

       config=CONFIG_FILE
           Read local SSH configuration from an alternate configuration file.  Libssh expands some "%"-sequences in "CONFIG_FILE", see "Path expansion" below.  "CONFIG_FILE" must expand to an absolute path.

       config=
           Do not read any local SSH configuration.

           The "config" parameter is optional.  If it is not specified at all then ~/.ssh/config and /etc/ssh/ssh_config are both read.  Missing or unreadable files are ignored.

       host=HOST
           Specify the name or IP address of the remote host.

           This parameter is required.

       identity=FILENAME
           Prepend the private key (identity) "FILENAME" to the list of identity files used.  Libssh examines several identity files by default such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_rsa and
           ~/.ssh/id_dsa.  Libssh expands some "%"-sequences in "FILENAME", see "Path expansion" below.  "FILENAME" must expand to an absolute path.

           You can give this parameter multiple times.

       known-hosts=FILENAME
           Set name of the file which records the identity of previously seen hosts.  Libssh expands some "%"-sequences in "FILENAME", see "Path expansion" below.  "FILENAME" must expand to an absolute path.

           The default is to check ~/.ssh/known_hosts followed by /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.

       password=PASSWORD
           Set the password to use when connecting to the remote server.

           Note that passing this on the command line is not secure on shared machines.

       password=-
           Ask for the password (interactively) when nbdkit starts up.

       password=+FILENAME
           Read the password from the named file.  This is a secure method to supply a password, as long as you set the permissions on the file appropriately.

       password=-FD
           Read the password from file descriptor number "FD", inherited from the parent process when nbdkit starts up.  This is also a secure method to supply a password.

       [path=]PATH
           Specify the path to the remote file.  This can be a relative path in which case it is relative to the remote home directory.

           This parameter is required.

           "path=" is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.  See "Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).

       port=PORT
           Specify the SSH protocol port name or number.

           This parameter is optional.  If not given then the default ssh port is used.

       timeout=SECS
           Set the SSH connection timeout in seconds.

       user=USER
           Specify the remote username.

           This parameter is optional.  If not given then the local username is used.

       verify-remote-host=true
       verify-remote-host=false
           Set whether or not we verify the remote host is one we have previously seen, using a local file such as ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  The default is "true", meaning that we verify the remote host’s
           identity has not changed.

           Setting this to "false" is dangerous because it allows a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack to be conducted against you.

NOTES
   Known hosts
       The SSH server’s host key is checked at connection time, and must be present and correct in the local "known hosts" file.

       If you have never connected to the SSH server before then the connection will usually fail.  You can:

       ·   connect to the server first using ssh(1) so you can manually accept the host key, or

       ·   provide the host key in an alternate file which you specify using the "known-hosts" option, or

       ·   set verify-remote-host=false on the command line.  This latter option is dangerous because it allows a MITM attack to be conducted against you.

   Supported authentication methods
       This plugin supports only the following authentication methods: "none", "publickey" or "password".  In particular note that "keyboard-interactive" is not supported.

   SSH agent
       There is no means for nbdkit to ask for the public key passphrase when it is running as a server.  Therefore "publickey" authentication must be done in conjunction with ssh-agent(1).

   Path expansion
       In the "config", "identity" and "known-hosts" options, libssh expands some "%"-sequences.

       %d  The user’s SSH directory, usually ~/.ssh

       %u  The local username.

       %l  The local hostname.

       %h  The remote hostname.

       %r  The remote username.

       %p  The SSH port number.

       "%%"
           In libssh > 0.9.0 this expands to a single "%" character.  In earlier versions of libssh there was no way to escape a "%" character.

DEBUG FLAGS
   -D ssh.log=[1..4]
       Set the libssh log level to increasing levels of verbosity.  Each level includes messages from the previous levels.  Currently the levels are:

       1   informational and warning messages

       2   SSH and SFTP protocol steps

       3   SSH and SFTP packets

       4   libssh functions

       Use level 2 to diagnose SSH protocol or server problems.  Levels 3 and 4 are extremely verbose and probably only useful if you are debugging libssh itself.

       If diagnosing SSH problems it is also useful to look at server-side logs, eg. /var/log/secure or "journalctl -u sshd"

FILES
       ~/.ssh/config
       /etc/ssh/ssh_config
           These are the default SSH config files which are read to get other options.  You can change this using the "config" option.

       ~/.ssh/id_dsa
       ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
       ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       ~/.ssh/id_rsa
           These are some of the default private key (identify) files used by libssh.  You can prepend more to the list using the "identity" option.

       ~/.ssh/known_hosts
       /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
           These are the default SSH files recording the identity of previously seen hosts.  You can change this using the "known-hosts" option.

       $plugindir/nbdkit-ssh-plugin.so
           The plugin.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $plugindir.
