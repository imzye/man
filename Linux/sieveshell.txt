          The  user  whose mailboxes you want to work on. If not specified, it
          uses the same as -a.

       -a authname, --authname=authname
          The user to use for authentication. If not specified, it defaults to
          the current login user.

          The realm to attempt authentication in.

       -p password, --password=password

          parameter can be seen in the process list. Use with caution!

       -e script, --exec=script
          Instead of working interactively, run commands from script, and exit
          when done.

       -f file, --execfile=file
          Instead  of  working  interactively, run commands from file file and
          exit when done.
