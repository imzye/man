NAME
       tzc - trivial zephyr client

SYNOPSIS
       tzc [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Tzc is a zephyr client program which talks to the zephyr servers (via the "zephyr host manager") and to a gnu-emacs running zephyr-mode.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -a nseconds
              Restart tzc every nseconds seconds.

       -e exposure
              Set exposure.  (values: NONE, OPSTAFF, REALM-VISIBLE, REALM-ANNOUNCED, NET-VISIBLE, NET-ANNOUNCED)

       -l, location
              Set zlocation tty to the string location.  The default is tzc.n, where n is tzc's pid.

       -h, hostname
              Set zlocation hostname to the string hostname.  The default is the current hosts hostname.

       -p filename
              Write tzc's process-id to the file filename.

       -s     Use zctl for subscriptions (read from ~/.zephyr.subs.tzc)

       -t nseconds
              If no zephyrgrams arrive in nseconds seconds, send a test message to mkae sure we're alive.  If nseconds is zero, disable this feature.  Default is 300 seconds.

       -o     Run tzc in output-only mode.  Tzc will just print zephyrgrams, and not accept commands from stdin

       -i     Ignore eof on input

       -d     Print debugging information.
