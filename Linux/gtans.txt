NAME
       gtans - Tangram game for X

SYNOPSIS
       gtans [no options]

DESCRIPTION
       Gtans is a tangram game that runs in X. Tangram is a kind of puzzle game where the player has to arrange a set of pieces to match a given shape.

OPTIONS
            No command-line options
            Use the graphical interface to customize the program. See below.

USAGE
       move the pieces (known as tans) until they match the figure drawn on the right window.  You must always use the seven tans and they should not be laid on top of one another.

       To  move  a tan, click and drag it with left mouse button, for rotation click AROUND it.  You can flip the selected tan by right-clicking. This is usefull for the parallelogram tan (all posi‐
       tions can not be reached by rotating only).

       If you are a beginner to Tangram you should try the first 10 figures.  The other ones are not sorted, some of them are very difficult (to my taste).

       When a figure has been solved the background color of the silhouette area changes. The solved figures are remembered by saving a status  file  in  the  user's  directory  (~/.gtans/afile.fig‐
       ures.status for a figure file called afile.figures)

       Show a tan This button shows the position of a tan. Each further click will display an other tan.

       Show outline Draw the figure in the main area. This makes the game much easier.

       Preferences Most of this menu's options allow you to change the colors used by the game. For the main area you may choose textures (pixmap files) instead of colors. Some sample files are sup‐
       plied  (I  can't remember where I found them) but as the complete pathname is saved in the config file you can choose a file located anywhere (for example in /usr/share/pixmaps/). On a 8 bits
       display the colors may not be exactly what you want (GTK tries to find the best matching color).

       Preferences/Tans size/Increase Makes the tans 5 % bigger relatively to the game area. If you resize the window the tans size will be scaled.

       Preferences/Tans size/Decrease Makes the tans 4.76 % smaller

       Preferences/Accuracy Changes the precision of the comparison between the tans position and the solution. A lower accuracy makes the game more easy.

       Preferences/Rotation Step by step allows only rotation by increment of 11.5 degrees.  Continuous rotation makes the game more difficult and you probably shouldn't use  it  unless  you  really
       dislike step by step rotation.

       Preferences/Figures file Allows you to choose another figures file.

       Preferences/Save config Save a config file in the user's home directory.

       Misc/Clear figure status Set the current figure as unsolved.

       Misc/Clear all figures status Set all the loaded figures (i.e. from the current figure file) as unsolved.

FILES
            ~/.gtans/.gtansrc           Configuration options for gtans.  All of  these options can be set from the interface, there should be no need to edit this file.

            ~/.gtans/somename.figures.status            Status files (for each figures file the user played with) remenbering which figures where solved.
