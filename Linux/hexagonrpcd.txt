NAME
       hexagonrpcd - Server for FastRPC remote procedure calls from Qualcomm DSPs

SYNOPSIS
       hexagonrpcd [options...] -f DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       Server for FastRPC remote procedure calls from Qualcomm DSPs.

OPTIONS
       -d DSP DSP name (default: )

       -f DEVICE
              FastRPC device node to attach to

       -p PROGRAM
              Run client program with shared file descriptor

       -R DIR Root directory of served files (default: /usr/share/qcom/)

       -s     Attach to sensorspd

NOTES
       Hexagonrpcd serves files to the remote processor via a reverse tunnel interface to the remote processor. These files are by default searched for in:

       Physical file/dir                       Android file/dir
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       /usr/share/qcom/acdb                    /vendor/etc/acdbdata
       /usr/share/qcom/dsp                     /vendor/dsp
       /usr/share/qcom/sensors/config          /vendor/etc/sensors/config
       /usr/share/qcom/sensors/registry        /mnt/vendor/persist/sensors/registry/registry
       /usr/share/qcom/sensors/sns_reg.conf    /vendor/etc/sensors/sns_reg_config
       /usr/share/qcom/socinfo                 /sys/devices/soc0

       These files and directories should be populated with files from your device's Android firmware.
