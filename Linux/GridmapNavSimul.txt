NAME
       GridmapNavSimul - GUI robot simulation within a gridmap

SYNOPSIS
       GridmapNavSimul

DESCRIPTION
       A GUI application for simulation of robot motion within a simulated environment defined by an occupancy grid map. The program simulates noisy odometry and laser measurements and generates a rawlog
       which can then be used as the input of SLAM algorithms. A ground truth file is also generated.

       The robot is controlled with a joystick or the cursor arrow keys.
