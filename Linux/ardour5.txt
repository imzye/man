NAME
       ardour - a digital audio workstation

SYNOPSIS
       ardour -b [-U file] [session]
       ardour --help

DESCRIPTION
       Ardour  is  a  multichannel  hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio workstation (DAW).  It is capable of simultaneous recording 24 or more channels of 32 bit audio at 48kHz.  Ardour is intended to
       function as a "professional" HDR system, replacing dedicated hardware solutions such as the Mackie HDR, the Tascam 2424 and more traditional tape systems like the Alesis ADAT series.  It is  also  in‐
       tended to provide the same or better functionality as software systems such as ProTools, Samplitude, Logic Audio, Nuendo and Cubase VST (we acknowledge these and all other names as trademarks of their
       respective owners).  It supports MIDI Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC controller, such as the Mackie Digital 8 Bus mixer and many other modern digital mixers.

OPTIONS
       -b     Print all possible keyboard binding names.

       -U     Specify the path to the GTK RC file to use.  The provided one is called ardour_ui.rc and lives in the top level Ardour source directory.  This file controls all color and font  use  within  Ar‐
              dour.  Ardour will run without it, but its appearance is, uhm, ugly.

       --help Displays the help message.
