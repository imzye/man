NAME
       sackd - Slurm Auth and Cred Kiosk Daemon.

SYNOPSIS
       sackd [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       sackd  is  the  Slurm  Auth and Cred Kiosk Daemon. It can be used on login nodes that are not running slurmd daemons to allow authentication to the cluster. The program will run as the SlurmdUser.
       When running in Slurm's "configless" mode, in which case configuration files are retrieved and written under the /run/slurm/conf directory.

OPTIONS
       --conf-server host[:port]
              Retrieve configs from slurmctld running at host[:port].  Requires slurmctld support provided by setting enable_configless in SlurmctldParameters.

       -f config
              Read configuration from the specified file.

       -h     Help; print a brief summary of command options.

       --systemd
              To be used when started from a systemd unit file.

       -v     Verbose mode. Multiple -v's increase verbosity.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables can be used to override settings compiled into sackd.

       ABORT_ON_FATAL
              When a fatal error is detected, use abort() instead of exit() to terminate the process. This allows backtraces to be captured without recompiling Slurm.

       SACKD_DEBUG
              Set debug level explicitly for syslog and stderr. Valid values are 0-9, or the same string values as the debug options such as SlurmctldDebug in slurm.conf(5).

       SACKD_STDERR_DEBUG
              Set debug level explicitly for stderr. Valid values are 0-9, or the same string values as the debug options such as SlurmctldDebug in slurm.conf(5).

       SACKD_SYSLOG_DEBUG
              Set debug level explicitly for syslog. Valid values are 0-9, or the same string values as the debug options such as SlurmctldDebug in slurm.conf(5).

       SLURM_CONF
              The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS
              Specify debug flags for sackd to use. See DebugFlags in the slurm.conf(5) man page for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.

SIGNALS
       SIGINT
             sackd will shutdown cleanly.

       SIGHUP
             sackd will reconfigure.

       SIGUSR2 SIGPIPE
             This signal is explicitly ignored.
