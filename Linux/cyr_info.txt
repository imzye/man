DESCRIPTION
       cyr_info  is  a tool for getting information from Cyrus.  The intent is
       to extend this tool with useful commands to make managing and configur‐
       ing Cyrus easier.

       cyr_info  reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file
       unless specified otherwise by -C.

       cyr_info provides the following sub-commands:

       conf   Print the configuration options which have been set to  a  value
              other than their default, and their value.

              With  -s  version,  configuration  options  whose  behaviour has
              changed since version will be highlighted.

       conf-all
              Print ALL configuration options and their configured values (in‐
              cluding  those  using  their default value).  This command shows
              which options will be in effect at runtime.

              With -s version, configuration options which have been added  or
              whose behaviour has changed since version will be highlighted.

       conf-default
              Print  the  default  values  for all available configuration op‐
              tions.

              With -s version, configuration options which have been added  or
              whose behaviour has changed since version will be highlighted.

       conf-lint
              Print only configuration options which are NOT recognised.  This
              command should not print anything.  It uses cyrus.conf  to  find
              the  names  of configured services to avoid displaying any known
              configuration options for the named service.

       proc   Print all currently connected processes in the proc directory

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -M config-file
              Read  service  specifications  from config-file (cyrus.conf for‐
              mat).

       -n servicename
              Read the configuration as if for the service named name.

       -s version
              Highlight configuration options that have been  added  or  whose
              behaviour  has been modified since version.  Use this option af‐
              ter a server upgrade, specifying your previous version, to  find
              which  options you need to review and maybe change before start‐
              ing up the upgraded server.

              For use with the conf, conf-all, and conf-default sub-commands.

EXAMPLES
       cyr_info proc
          List all the proc files and who they're logged in as.

       cyr_info conf-lint
          Lint the configuration for unrecognized settings.
