NAME
       testu01-tcode - a very rudimentary literate-programming tool

SYNOPSIS
       testu01-tcode <FileIn>  <FileOut>

DESCRIPTION
       Program  testu01-tcode makes compilable code from a [La]TeX document.  It creates a file FOut for a compiler like a C compiler starting from a file FIn.  The names of these two files must be given
       by the user, with appropriate extension, when calling the program.

       Basically only text included between the \code and \endcode delimiters will appear in the output file FOut, everything between them being compiler legal code except for a small set of [La]TeX com‐
       mands.

       bian package.
