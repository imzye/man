NAME
       "getnameinfo" - command-line tool to "getnameinfo(3)" resolver

SYNOPSIS
       getnameinfo [options...] address port

DESCRIPTION
       This tool provides a convenient command-line wrapper around the
       getnameinfo(3) resolver function. It will perform a single reverse
       lookup to convert an address and port number into its host and service
       names. This is mainly useful when debugging names resolution problems,
       because it allows inspection of the getnameinfo(3) behaviour itself,
       outside of any real program that is trying to use it.

OPTIONS
       --address, -A ADDR
               Numerical form of address to look up. If not supplied, will use
               the first positional argument.

       --port, -P PORT
               Port number to look up. If not supplied, will use the second
               positional argument.

       --dgram Sets the "NI_DGRAM" flag; looks up a "SOCK_DGRAM" (udp) port
               allocation rather than "SOCK_STREAM" (tcp).

       --help  Display a help summary and exit
