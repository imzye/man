NAME
       Class::C3::XS - XS speedups for Class::C3

VERSION
       version 0.15

SYNOPSIS
         use Class::C3; # Automatically loads Class::C3::XS
                        #  if it's installed locally

DESCRIPTION
       This contains XS performance enhancers for Class::C3 version 0.16 and higher.  The main Class::C3 package will use this package automatically if it can find it.  Do not use this package directly,
       use Class::C3 instead.

       The test suite here is not complete, although it does verify a few basic things.  The best testing comes from running the Class::C3 test suite *after* this module is installed.

       This module won't do anything for you if you're running a version of Class::C3 older than 0.16.  (It's not a dependency because it would be circular with the optional dependency from that package
       to this one).
