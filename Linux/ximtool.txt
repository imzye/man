NAME
       ximtool - interactive image display program for the X Window System

SYNOPSIS
       ximtool [-toolkitoption ...] [ options ...] [imagename]

OPTIONS
       -basePixel N
            The base colormap cell used by the colormap.  This essentially allows you to reserve basePixel colors in the global colormap for other applications.  The default is 64, if changed you'll need
            to also specify the -cmapInitialize option or resource.

       -cmap1 file
            User colormap 1.  This flag allows you to specify a colormap to be made available at task startup.

       -cmap2 file
            User colormap 2.  This flag allows you to specify a second colormap to be made available at task startup.

       -cmapDir1 dir
            User colormap directory 1.  Specifies a directory to be searched for colormaps.

       -cmapDir2 dir
            User  colormap directory 2.  Specifies a directory to be searched for colormaps.  By default this points to the system directory /usr/local/lib/imtoolcmap, allowing a set of site default col‐
            ormaps to be defined here.

       -cmapInitialize bool
            Initialize the ximtool colormap at startup.  When setting the basePixel option or resource this is required in order to force the Gterm widget to update its global colormap resource in the  X
            server.  The default is false.

       -cmapName name
            Name  used  for  private  colormap.  The default for all IRAF imaging applications is image.  Gterm widget based imaging applications which have the same value of cmapName will share the same
            colormap, minimizing colormap flashing and allowing multiple applications to be run at the same time.

       -config N
            Initial frame buffer configuration number.  The default value is 1, indicating a 512x512 frame buffer with 2 frames.  See below for information on the frame buffers.

       -defgui
            Print the default GUI to the stdout.  The GUI is a Tcl program that may be customized by the user and reloaded using the -gui option or the gui resource parameter.

       -displayPanner bool
            Display panner marker window at startup.  If set, a panner window showing the full frame buffer will appear in the upper-right side of the main display window.

       -displayCoords bool
            Display WCS coordinate marker window at startup.  If set, a coordinate readout text marker showing will appear in the lower-right side of the main display window.

       -fifo pipe
            Specifies the name of the fifo pipe to be used, the i and o suffixes will be added automatically.  The default pipe names will be /dev/imt1i (input pipe) and /dev/imt1o (output pipe).

       -fifo_only
            If set, only fifo pipes will be used for communication with a client program, sockets will be disabled.

       -gui file
            Specifies the GUI file to be used.

       -help
            Print a summary of command line options to the screen.

       -imtoolrc file
            Specifies the frame buffer configuration file to be used.  See below for information on frame buffers.

       -inet_only
            If set, only inet sockets will be used for communication with a client program, fifo pipes and unix sockets will be disabled.

       -invert
            Start XImtool using inverted colormaps.  When set, a "normalized" display will always be the inverse of the selected colormap.

       -ismdev dev
            Specifies the plug-in ISM connection socket.  This should be a unix domain socket of the form "/tmp/.ISM%d", where the %d will be replaced by the user id.  Once an ISM has connected this port
            is freed to accept other connections.

       -maxColors N
            Specify the max number of colors to be used for the display.

       -memModel type
            Determines how ximtool uses memory in the ximtool client and the X server.  The options are fast, beNiceToServer, and small.  The default is fast, which uses  server  pixmaps  to  make  frame
            blink  fast.   This  is recommended unless server memory is very limited.  Note that even in fast mode, the server pixmap is only the size of the display window, so memory usage is reasonable
            even if the frame buffer is very large.

       -nframes N
            Specifies the number of frame buffers to configure at startup.  By default there will be 2 frames available, a maximum of 4 frames are allowed.

       -port N
            Specifies the port number to use when connecting through an inet socket.

       -port_only
            Same as -inet_only option.  If set, only inet sockets will be used for communication with a client program.

       -printConfig name
            Specifies the printer configuration file to use.  By default this will be /usr/local/lib/ximprint.cfg.  See below for more information on configuring output devices.

       -tile
            The default display mode is to view one frame at a time. In tile frames mode, 2 or 4 frames may be viewed simultaneously in the display window.  All the usual operations (zoom and  pan,  col‐
            ortable enhancement, cursor readback, etc.)  still work for each frame even when in tile frames mode.

       -unix name
            Specifies the unix domain socket name to use.  A "%d" in the filename will be replaced with the user id.

       -unix_only
            If set, only unix domain sockets will be used for communication with a client program, inet sockets and fifos will be disabled.

APPLICATION RESOURCES
       XImtool  is  implemented  as  a client program which is responsible for loading the frame buffers/colormaps, communicating with clients, etc, and a user-modifiable GUI file written as a Tcl script
       which handles all the user interface details.  The client resources described below will be common to any user-defined GUI, the gui resources may change depending on how extensively  the  GUI  has
       been modified by the user.  Each of these components has its own set of resources, but to the user setting them is the same as with any other application.

       Gterm  widget  resources (i.e. those for the main image window or colorbar) may be set as either client or GUI resources.  See the xgterm(1) man page for a complete description of Gterm widget re‐
       sources.

   CLIENT RESOURCES
       The client resources generally define the initial state of the application or set configuration parameters.

              ism_task                 "ism_wcspix.e wcspix &"

       Description of ximtool client resources:

       defConfig         Default frame buffer configuration number on startup.  See below for more information on frame buffers.

       defNFrames        Default number of frames on startup.  Set to zero to use the value from the frame buffer configuration (imtoolrc) file.

       tileBorderWidth

       tileBorderColor   Used by the tile frames option.  Specifies how far apart to space the frames in tile frames mode.  Color "9" refers to the Gterm widget resource color9, which is assigned a color
                         with its own resource.

       autoscale         Enable/disable the autoscale option.

       antialias         Enable/disable the antialias option.

       antialiasType     Type of antialiasing.  Options include boxcar (default), bilinear, nearest, area, blkavg, lowpass, and gaussian.

       tileFrames        Enable/disable the tile frames option.

       highlightFrames   Determines whether the current frame is highlighted when in tile frames mode.

       gui               The GUI to be executed.  "default" refers to the default, builtin ximtool GUI.  You can replace this with your own GUI file if you are bold enough, and completely change the look
                         and functionality of the GUI if desired.

       imtoolrc          Where to find the imtoolrc file.  This defines the recognized frame buffer configurations.

       invert            Start Ximtool using an inverted colormap.  When set, a "normalized" display will always be the inverse of the selected colormap.

       memModel          Determines how ximtool uses memory in the ximtool client and the X server.  The options are fast, beNiceToServer, and small.  The default is fast, which uses  server  pixmaps  to
                         make  frame blink fast.  This is recommended unless server memory is very limited.  Note that even in fast mode, the server pixmap is only the size of the display window, so mem‐
                         ory usage is reasonable even if the frame buffer is very large.

       basePixel

       maxColors         These two resources determine the region of colormap space used to render image pixels.

       cmapInitialize    Initialize the ximtool colormap at startup.  This is a required resource to clear a previous ximtool colormap allowing a new basePixel and maxColors to take effect.

       cmap1

       cmap2             User colormap files.  The intent here is to allow individual colormaps to be conveniently specified as a resource.

       cmapDir1

       cmapDir2          User or system colormap directories.  By default cmapDir2 points to the system directory /usr/local/lib/imtoolcmap, allowing a set of site default colormaps to be  defined  here.
                         This leaves cmapDir1 available to a user colormap directory.

       input_fifo

       output_fifo       The input and output fifos for fifo i/o.  "Input" and "output" are from the client's point of view.  Note that only one display server can use a fifo-pair at one time.

       unixaddr          Template address for unix domain socket.  The user must have write permission on this directory, or the file must already exist.  %d, if given, is replaced by the user's UID.

       port              TCP/IP port for the server.  Note that only one server can listen on a port at one time, so if multiple ximtool servers are desired on the same machine, they should be given dif‐
                         ferent ports.

       ism_addr          Template address for ISM unix domain socket. The user must have write permission on this directory, or the file must already exist.  %d, if given, is replaced by the user's UID.

       ism_task          Command string to execute for the real-time pixel and WCS readout ISM (Image Support Module) task.

   GUI RESOURCES
       In principle ximtool can have any number of different GUIs, each of which defines its own set of resources.  GUIs typically define a great many resources, but most of these are not really intended
       for modification by the user (although one can modify them if desired).

       The following are some of the more useful resources used by the default ximtool GUI.  The imagewin resources are Gterm widget resources.

       Description of selected resources:

       *cmapName             Name used for private colormap.  The default for all IRAF imaging applications is "image".  Gterm widget based imaging applications which have the same value of cmapName will
                             share the same colormap, minimizing colormap flashing and allowing multiple applications to be run at the same time.

                             Deiconify image window if necessary when initiating a cursor read.

       *imagewin.ginmodeCursor
                             Type  of  cursor  when a cursor read is in progress.  The default is a circle.  Any selection from the X cursor font can be used.  A special case is "full_crosshair" which is
                             the full crosshair cursor of the Gterm widget.

       *imagewin.ginmodeBlinkInterval
                             Determines whether the cursor blinks when a cursor read is in progress.  The value is given in milliseconds.

DESCRIPTION
       As a display server, XImtool is started as a separate process from client software such as IRAF. Once it is running it will accept client connections simultaneously  on  fifo  pipes,  unix  domain
       sockets, or inet sockets. A display client like the IRAF DISPLAY task makes a connection and sends the image across using a modified IIS Model 70 protocol.  Once the image is loaded in the display
       buffer  it  may be enhanced, saved to a disk file in a number of different formats, or printed as Encapsulated Postscript to a printer or disk file.  Up to sixteen frame buffers are allowed, these
       may be displayed simultaneously in a tiled mode, or blinked frame-to-frame.  Each frame may have its own colormap or brightness/contrast enhancement.  Pan/Zoom and cursor readout are permitted us‐
       ing markers, on-line help is also available.

       When run in standalone mode, images (currently IRAF OIF, GIF, Sun Rasterfiles or simple FITS (i.e. excluding MEF files) formats are permitted) may be loaded on the command line  or  by  using  the
       Load Panel. This allows you to browse images and perform the same manipulations as if they had been displayed by a client.

   MOUSE OPERATIONS
       Clicking  and  dragging  MB1  (mouse  button  1)  in the main image window creates a rectangular region marker, used to select a region of the image. If you do this accidentally and don't want the
       marker, put the pointer in the marker and type DELETE or BACKSPACE to delete the marker. With the pointer in the marker, MB3 will call up a marker menu listing some things  you  can  do  with  the
       marker, like zoom the outlined region. MB1 can be used to drag or resize the marker. See below for more information on markers.

       Clicking on MB2 in the main image window pans (one click) or zooms (two clicks) the image. Further clicks cycle through the builtin zoom factors.  Moving the pointer to a new location and clicking
       moves the feature under the pointer to the center of the display window.   Holding down the Shift key while clicking MB2 will cause a full-screen crosshair cursor to appear until the button is re‐
       leased, this can be useful for fine positioning of the cursor.

       MB3  is  used  to adjust the contrast and brightness of the displayed image.  The position of the pointer within the display window determines the contrast and brightness values. Click once to set
       the values corresponding to the pointer location, or click and drag to continuously adjust the display.

       NOTE: These keystrokes only work with the cursor in the main image window, only a few of the commands are implemented to work within subwindows or markers to avoid conflicts with translations  for
       those objects.  If a command does not work, check the cursor location and try it again in the main display window.

FRAME BUFFER CONFIGURATIONS
       XImtool  starts up using default frame buffer size of 512x512 pixels, two (of 16 possible) frames will be created. When loading disk images (i.e.  run in standalone mode) the frame buffer configu‐
       ration file will be searched for a defined frame buffer that is the same size or larger than the current image, if no suitable buffer can be found a custom frame buffer the same size as the  image
       will  be  created  in an unused portion of the configuration table.  When used as a display server the frame buffer configuration number is passed in by the client and loaded explicitly even if it
       means clipping the image.  If a new frame buffer is a different size than previously defined frames, all available frames will be initialized and cleared prior to the display.  The  default  frame
       buffer  configuration  file is /usr/local/lib/imtoolrc, this can be overridden by defining a IMTOOLRC environment variable naming the file to be used, by creating a .imtoolrc file in your home di‐
       rectory, or a new file may be specified using the -imtoolrc command line flag or imtoolrc application resource.

       The format of the frame buffer configuration file is

            configno nframes width height [extra fields]
        e.g.
                 1  2  512  512
                 2  2  800  800
                 3  1 1024 1024          # comment
                 :  :   :    :

       At most 128 frame buffer sizes may be defined, each configuration may define up to 16 frames, configuration numbers need not be sequential.

       NOTE:  When defining a new frame buffer for use with client software such as IRAF the user must also remember to define those frame buffers in the IRAF dev$graphcap file.

   SUPPORT FOR 16 DISPLAY FRAMES
       As part of the extensive GUI changes with the V1.3 release, support for the full 16 frames allowed by the IIS protocol is now available.  IRAF V2.11.4 or later client tasks (and CDL  library)  are
       required  to  take advantage of this frames.  All changes are backwards compatible, older versions of IRAF will continue to work but cannot access more than the original four frames.  The new DIS‐
       PLAY task will automatically sense whether the display server being used supports 16 frames or the original 4 and adjust the 'frame' parameter maximum accordingly.  The changes are fully backwards
       compatible for other servers.

       More frames are possible if needed but will require further changes to the client IRAF code to be effective.  Allowing creation of more than 16 frames by the Load panel can be  done  independently
       but would also require numerous code change to XImtool.  Please contact site support if there is a need for this, or for workaround suggestions depending on your application.

MARKERS
       Although  ximtool doesn't do much with markers currently, they are a general feature of the Gterm widget and are used more extensively in other programs (e.g. the prototype IRAF science GUI appli‐
       cations). XImtool uses markers for the marker zoom feature discussed above, and also for the panner and the coords box. All markers share some of the same  characteristics,  so  it  is  worthwhile
       learning basic marker manipulation keystrokes.

       o  MB1 anywhere inside a marker may be used to drag the marker.

       o  MB1 near a marker corner or edge, depending on the type of marker, resizes the marker.

       o  Shift-MB1 on the corner of most markers will rotate the marker.

       o  Markers stack, if you have several markers and you put one on top of the other. The active marker is highlighted to tell you which of the stacked markers is active. If the markers overlap, this
          will be marker "on top" in the stacking order.

       o  MB2 in the body of a marker "lowers" the marker, i.e. moves it to the bottom of the stacking order.

       o  Delete or backspace in a marker deletes it.

       o  Markers have their own translation resources and so the default keystroke commands will not be recognized when the cursor is in a marker.

          For example, try placing the pointer anywhere in the coords box, then press MB1 and hold it down, and drag the coords box marker somewhere else on the screen. You can also resize the coords box
          by  dragging  a  corner, or delete it with the delete or backspace key. (The Initialize button will get the original coords box back if you delete it, or you can reset the toggle in the control
          panel).

   PANNER MARKER
       The panner window always displays the full frame buffer. Try setting the frame buffer configuration to a nonsquare frame buffer (e.g. imtcryo) and then displaying a square image (e.g. dev$pix) and
       the panner will show you exactly where the image has been loaded into the frame.

       The panner window uses two markers, one for the window border and one to mark the displayed region of the frame. Most of the usual marker keystrokes mentioned below apply to these markers as well,
       e.g. you can use MB1 to reposition on the panner window within the main image display window, or to drag the region marker within the panner (pan the image). Resizing the region marker  zooms  the
       image; this is a non-aspect constrained zoom. The panner window itself can be resized by dragging a corner with MB1. Typing delete or backspace anywhere in the panner window deletes the panner.

       A special case is MB2. Hitting MB2 anywhere in the panner window pans the image to that point. This is analogous to hitting MB2 in the main display window to pan the image.

       The panner marker can be disabled by defining the displayPanner GUI resource, its size and location can be controlled using the pannerArea and pannerGeom GUI resources respectively.

   MAGNIFIER MARKER
       The magnifier marker can be used to zoom in on a small area around the cursor.  It will be updated as the cursor moves but only for small motions (either mouse movement or with the cursor movement
       keystrokes)  to  minimize  the  impact on the system.  The zoom factor is expressed as some fraction of the size of the magnifier marker itself.  The default zoom is 4, i.e. the area in the marker
       represents and area in the image that's one-fourth the size of the marker.  Other zoom factors may be selected using the popup menu created by hitting MB1 in the marker.

       By default the magnifier marker is not visible, to toggle it select the Magnifier option from the Options menubar button.  Alternatively, for just a quick look holding down the Shift and MB2  but‐
       tons will display the marker until the button is released.

       The magnifier marker can be disabled by defining the displayMagnifier GUI resource, its size and location can be controlled using the magnifierArea and magnifierGeom GUI resources respectively.

   COORDS BOX MARKER
       XImtool  provides a limited notion of world coordinates, allowing frame buffer pixel coordinates and pixel values to be converted to some arbitrary linear client-defined coordinate system. The co‐
       ords box feature is used to display these world coordinates as the pointer is moved about in the image window.

       The quantities displayed in the coords box are X, Y, and Z: the X,Y world coordinates of the pointer, and Z, the world equivalent of the pixel value under the pointer. All coordinate  systems  are
       linear.  The  precision of a displayed quantity is limited by the range of values of the associated raw frame buffer value. For example, if the display window is 512x512 only 512 coordinate values
       are possible in either axis (the positional precision can be increased however by zooming the image). More seriously, at most about 200 pixel values can be displayed since this is the limit on the
       range of pixel values loaded into the frame buffer. If a display pixel is saturated a "+" will be displayed after the intensity value.

       The coords box is a text marker, it can be moved and resized with the pointer like any other marker.  The coords box marker can be disabled by defining the displayCoords GUI resource, its location
       can be controlled by the wcsboxGeom GUI resource.

   MARKER MENU OPTIONS
       Except for the panner and WCS markers, MB3 (mouse button 3) calls up the marker menu providing a limited set of functions common to all markers:

       o  Zoom does an equal aspect zoom of the region outlined by the marker. In this way you can mark a region of the image and zoom it up.

       o  Fill exactly zooms the area outlined by the marker, making it fill the display window. Since the marker is not likely to be exactly square, the aspect ratio of the resultant image will  not  be
          unitary.

       o  Print prints the region outlined by the marker to the printer or file currently configured by the Print Panel.

       o  Save saves the region outlined by the marker to the file currently configured by the Save Panel.

       o  Info prints a description of the marked region. The text is printed in the Info Panel.

       o  Unrotate unrotates a rotated marker.

       o  Color is a menu of possible marker colors.

       o  Type is a menu of possible marker types. This is still a little buggy and it isn't very useful, but you can use it to play with different types of markers.

       o  Destroy destroys the marker. You can also hit the delete or backspace key in a marker to destroy the marker.

   RULER MARKERS
       Holding  down  the  Ctrl key and the Left-Mouse-Button while moving the mouse will drag out a "ruler marker" measuring the distance from the initial point to the current mouse position.  Releasing
       the Ctrl key before lifting the mouse button will leave the marker on the display, otherwise it will be erased automatically once the mouse button is released.  Any number of ruler markers can  be
       created in the frame.

       Distances are measured by default in image logical pixels however the Right-Mouse-Button can be used inside the marker to popup a menu of options:

       Sticky              By default rulers are destroyed whenever the display changes due to a pan, zoom, flip, or frame change.  This option will make the ruler "sticky" so it will not be erased, sub‐
                           sequent use of the menu to shows this option to be "UnSticky" to remove this feature.

       Units               Sub-menu to select the units of the display.  If the ISM is enabled and a WCS is present in the image and selected as one of the readout options, distances may also be read out
                           in units of arcseconds, arcminutes, or degrees instead of the default logical pixels. All markers created after the unit change will readout in the new units as their default.

       Color               Select the color of the marker.

       Draw into Frame     (Not Yet Implemented)  Draw the marker as overlay graphics in the frame.  Doing so will retain the marker when printing a hardcopy of the display.

       Destroy             Destroy the marker.

                           The  marker  can  also be destroyed by hitting the Delete or Backspace key while the cursor is in the marker.  There is presently no way to move the marker to a new position in
                           the frame.

REAL-TIME WCS/PIXEL-VALUE READOUT
       XImtool now has the ability to display the actual pixel value of an image (as well as the scaled value previously shown) and the cursor position in image WCS values (e.g. RA/DEC, GLAT/GLONG, etc).
       This is done using an external task (the 'ism_wcspix.e' binary in the new distribution) to access the image and pass the coordinate/pixel information to the GUI.

       WCS readout is enabled by default but can be toggled or reset using the WCS/Pix button on the Coords tab in the control panel or the ISM toggle on the alt-gui menubar.  When enabled,  images  cur‐
       rently in the server or subsequently displayed will be passed to the external process where they are cached for access.  Cursor movements generate an event that maps the current frame buffer posi‐
       tion  to a position in the cached image.  The ISM (ISM is Image Support Module) task then reads the image to determine the pixel value (or a small table of values around the current position), and
       computes one or more coordinates from the image position.  The ISM task also has access to the associated BPM images and can optionally return bad pixel information during the cursor readout.

       By default, the logical and world image coordinates are displayed to both the Coords panel readout as well as the main display window wcsbox text marker.  Alternate coordinate systems (e.g. trans‐
       formation of equatorial to galactic coordinates or some other sky system, physical coords, amplifier coords, etc) can be selected for display by hitting the Options toggle  on  the  Coords  panel.
       Available  coordinate  systems are chosen using the Type menu on the panel, the readout format (sexigesimal, degrees, etc) using the Format menu, and the display to the current panel or main image
       window using the remaining toggles for each WCS.  Up to four systems may be displayed at one time, the coordinate panel and wcsbox marker will adjust size automatically depending on the display.

       By selecting the BPM Data toggle from the Coords.Options panel ximtool is able to flag pixels in images with an associated bad pixel mask.  This bad pixel mask is currently assumed to be named  in
       the  image  header  "BPM" keyword by convention.  If the cursor passes over a bad pixel in the mask, the Coords bpm display as well as the main window wcsbox will change to a red background color.
       Only the Coords display will show the value, any non-zero value will be flagged with the color change.

       With the ISM enabled the Compass indicator will display a set of arrows showing North-East if a WCS is available, otherwise just the current X-Y axes are shown.  The pixel table will  display  ac‐
       tual pixel values from the image, with the ISM off the pixel table displays the scaled image values from the frame buffer.

FREEZING CURSOR READOUT
       Holding  down the Alt key will now freeze the cursor display readout and draw crosshairs on the screen at the last position.  This can be used for example to position the cursor but then allow the
       cursor to be moved to another window (to enter text, start a program, whatever) without losing the position information displayed on the screen.

CUT-GRAPHS
       XImtool now has the ability to display horizontal and vertical cut-graphs of the display, these appear as "flip-out" panels that appear on the bottom and right side of the main display window  and
       are  controlled  by  the small "H" and "V" buttons in the lower right corner of the window.  When both panels are enabled the corner area of the display also shows an options panel for the graphs.
       Current options are:

       Better Speed        Draw the graphics so they update at the fastest possible rate.  This is done by subsampling pixels to produce a smoother graph but without sacrificing too much accuracy.

       Better Accuracy     Draw the graphics using all screen pixels to produce the most accurate display.  On fast modern machines this can be enabled with no apparent loss of speed, however  older  ma‐
                           chines may wish to use this only occasionally to limit any lag in the cursor tracking.

       Image Pixels        (Not Yet Implemented)

       Jump Cursor         If enabled, large jumps of the cursor do not update the graphics display, small movements around an object of interest will update the display continuously.

       Smooth Cursor       If enabled, all cursor movements cause the display to be updated.  This is another option that can be set safely on faster machines but will cause a delay on slower ones.

       Graphics Cursors    If  enabled, the graphics cursors in either of the plots are active and can be used to update the cursor readout on the main image window and the complementary cut-graph.  This
                           can be used for example to freeze the cursor in the main display using the Alt key (see above), then moving to one of the graphics windows to perform cut  graphs  in  only  one
                           axis.

                           Graphs  are  (currently)  drawn  using  only the scaled display values to avoid complications of accessing multiple images in a mosaic display. Both plots are labeled using the
                           frame z1/z2 values and contain cursor indicators which update contuously.

PEAK-UP CURSOR CENTROID POSITIONING
       Several new keystroke commands are available to reposition the cursor to a centroid or min/max pixel value within a bounding box of the cursor position,  allowing you to approximate  the  position
       with the mouse and fine tune it quickly before typing the application keystroke command.  The initial box size is controlled with a centerBoxSize GUI resource (defaults to 5 pixels) but can be ad‐
       justed interactively using the Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-] commands to descrease/increase the box size respectively.  A marker will flash briefly to indicate the box size.

       The Ctrl-0 (zero) key finds either a centroid or the local maximum pixel value within this box region, Alt-Ctrl-0 (zero) will find the local minimum value.  In either case the cursor is reposition
       to  the  computed value.  The default peak-up action is to find the centroid position in the box however this can be changed to find the max pixel by selection the "Centroid Peaks" option from the
       main Display control panel or by resetting the peakCentroid GUI resource (defaults to True).

       Centroiding is done using only the scaled screen pixel values and only pixels above the mean value within the box are used.  It works best if the box size is set appropriately, the centroid  posi‐
       tion may appear to drift if the box is too large and includes too many background pixels.

   Command Summary
       Ctrl-0 (zero)       Reposition to centroid/max-pixel

       Alt-Ctrl-0 (zero)   Reposition to min-pixel

       Ctrl-[              Decrease centering box size (min of 5)

       Ctrl-]              Increase centering box size

   Resource Summary
       peakCentroid = True Compute the box centroid position, a 'False' value force the max value to be used

       centerBoxSize = 5   Size of the centroid box, used as cursor position +/- this value

AUTO-REGISTRATION OF IMAGES
       The  auto-register  feature  allows you specify a registration of two or more display frames with an offset.  When enabled, this registration is maintained for all frames in the list if any one of
       them is panned or zoomed to a new location in the frame buffer.

       For example, to use this feature do the following:

              1)   Enable Auto-Register (either on the Control Panel or the toolbar on the alt-gui) and pan/zoom to some star of interest.

              2)   Use Mouse-Button-2 to center the star in the frame.

              3)   Cycle through the frames and you may see a small shift of the star.  For each frame,  position the cursor on the star and type Ctrl-o to offset it to the center.  Repeat as  necessary.
                   Small corrections will be cumulatively added so you can use the Ctrl-0 (Ctrl-zero) peak-up command to centroid each object in the frame before the Ctrl-o offset.

              4)   Pan around the image in one display frame, then switch frames and the new frame should also be panned to the new image with the proper offset.

              5)   A Ctrl-a command will toggle the feature, offsets are only allowed when autoreg is enabled.

       Hitting Register will zero the offsets, as will toggling the auto-register function.  What you should see is the object centered in the frame and as you blink through it remains registered but the
       panner box marker is moving around.  Drag the panner around and all frames still remain registered with the given offset.  The control/info panels now display what the offset is for each frame.

       The  register  display list is shared with the blink list and can be set using the Display control panel.  By default all frames are included in the list.  For accessing more than four frames, use
       the box icon in the Blink/Register box of the Display control panel to bring up a new window with access to all 16 available frames.

   Command Summary
       Ctrl-o              Set the registration offset from center

       Ctrl-a              Toggle the Auto-Register feature

CONTROL PANEL
       XImtool has a control panel which can be used to exercise most of the capabilities the program has for image display.  The control panel can be accessed either via the Options menu from  the  main
       window  menubar, or by pressing the leftmost button in the row of buttons at the upper right side of the display in the standard GUI (in the alternate GUI the Control Bar accessed by the rightmost
       button on the menubar provides widgets for selecting the desired control panel).

       The separate windows previously used for Control/Print/Load/Save/etc have now been integrated into a single window with the appropriate control panel selectable with a Tab widget.  There are  also
       new Tab panels for setting the frame tile configuration (see below), more detailed information on the server status, and selecting the WCS readout options (see below).

   VIEW CONTROLS
       The  Frame box will list only the frame buffers you currently have defined.  Currently, the only way to destroy a frame buffer is to change the frame buffer configuration, new frame buffers (up to
       16) will be created automatically if requested by the client.  The number of frame buffers created at startup can be controlled using the -nframes command-line switch or the defNFrames resource.

       The text display window gives the field X,Y center, X,Y scale factors, the X,Y zoom factors, and the frame offset used in Auto-Registration. The scale factor and the zoom factor will be  the  same
       unless autoscale is enabled. The scale is in units of display pixels per frame buffer pixel, and is an absolute measure (it doesn't matter whether or not autoscale is enabled). Zoom is relative to
       the autoscale factor, which is 1.0 if autoscaling is disabled. This information is also presented in the Info panel.

       The  numbers  in  the  Zoom box are zoom factors. Blue numbers zoom, red numbers dezoom. Zoom In and Zoom Out may be used to go to larger or smaller zoom factors, e.g. Ctrl-5 followed by "Zoom In"
       will get you to zoom factor 10.  Specific zoom factors may also be accessed directly as Control keystrokes, e.g. Ctrl-5 will set zoom factor 5. Center centers the field.  Toggle Zoom  toggles  be‐
       tween the current zoom/center values, and the unzoomed image.

       Aspect recomputes the view so that the aspect ratio is 1.0. Aspect also integerizes the zoom factor (use the version in the View menu if you don't want integerization).

       Fit Frame makes the display window the same size as the frame buffer. Note that autoscale has much the same effect, and allows you to resize the display window to any size you want, or view images
       too large to fit on the screen.

   ENHANCEMENT CONTROLS
       At  the  top  is a scrolled list of all the available colormaps. Click on the one you want to load. You can add your own colormaps to this list by defining the cmap[12] or cmapDir[12] command line
       flags or application resources.

       The two sliders adjust the contrast (upper slider) and brightness (lower slider) of the display. The Invert button inverts the colormap (multiples the contrast by -1.0). Note that due to  the  use
       of the private colormap the sliders are a bit sluggish when dragged to window the display. If this is annoying, using MB3 in the display window is faster.

       The  Normalize  button  (on the bottom of the control panel) will normalize the enhancement, i.e. set the contrast and brightness to the default one-to-one values (1.0, 0.5). This is the preferred
       setting for many of the pseudocolor colortables and for private colormaps loaded from disk images. The Initialize button does a reset of the server.

   BLINK CONTROLS
       Blink frames is the list of frames to be blinked. When blink mode is in effect ximtool just cycles through these frames endlessly, pausing "blink rate" seconds between each frame. The  same  frame
       can  be  entered  in  the list more than once.  To program an arbitrary list of blink frames, hit the Reset button and click on each blink frame button until it is set to the desired frame number.
       The main control panel allows only the original four frames to be specified in the blink list, however access to the full list of 16 frames now supported is gained using the box icon  button  next
       the the Reset button to bring up a new control panel.

       The Blink Rate can be adjusted as slow or as fast as you want using the arrow buttons. If you set the blink rate small enough it will go to zero, enabling single step mode (see below).

       The Register button registers all the blink frames with the current display frame. Frames not in the blink list are not affected.

       The Match LUTs button sets the enhancement of all blink frames to the same values as the display frame. Frames not in the blink list are not affected.

       The Blink button turns blink on and off. When the blink rate is set to zero the Blink button will single step through the blink frames, one frame per button press.

       NOTE: You can blink no matter what ximtool options are in effect, but many of these will slow blink down. To get the fastest blink you may want to turn off the panner and coords box, and match the
       LUTs of all the blink frames.  All the ximtool controls are fully active during blink mode, plus you can load frames etc.

   OPTIONS:
       Panner
            Toggles whether to display the Panner marker.

       Magnifier
            Toggles whether to display the Magnifier marker.

       Coords Box
            Toggles whether to display the coordinate box marker.

       Autoscale
            If  autoscale  is  enabled  then at zoom=1, the frame buffer will be automatically scaled to fit within the display window. With autoscale disabled (the default), the image scale is more pre‐
            dictable, but the image may be clipped by the display window, or may not fill the display window.

       Antialias
            When dezooming an image, i.e., displaying a large image in a smaller display window, antialiasing causes all the data to be used to compute the displayed image. If  antialiasing  is  disabled
            then  image  is subsampled to compute the displayed image. Antialiasing can prevent subsampling from omitting image features that don't fall in the sample grid, but it is significantly slower
            than dezooming via subsampling.  The default is no antialising.

       Tile Frames
            The default display mode is to view one frame at a time. In tile frames mode, 2 or 4 frames may be viewed simultaneously in the display window.  All the usual operations (zoom and  pan,  col‐
            ortable enhancement, cursor readback, etc.) still work for each frame even when in tile frames mode.

       Warnings
            The warnings options toggles whether you see warning dialog boxes in situations like overwriting an existing file, clearing the frame buffer, etc.

       Centroid Peaks
            If enabled, the Ctrl-0 keystroke will reposition the cursor to the computed centroid of the centroiding box, otherwise the cursor is repositioned to the local maximum value within the box.

LOAD PANEL
       The Load Panel allows you load images from disk directly to the frame buffer, this is analogous to loading an image on the command line except that browsing is possible. At present recognized for‐
       mats  include  IRAF OIF format (i.e. .imh extension), simple FITS files, GIF, and Sun rasterfiles.  The task will automatically sense the format of the image and load it appropriately. Images with
       private colormaps (such as GIF) will be loaded using the private colormap (meaning that changing the brightness/contrast enhancements will render an apparently random-colored  image),  all  others
       will be loaded with a grayscale colormap.

       When  loading  new images the frame buffer configuration table will be searched for a frame buffer that is the same size or larger than the new image size, if no frame buffer can be found a custom
       buffer exactly the size of the image will be created. This means that the image may not fill the display window when loaded, or you may see a subsection of the image in the  main  display  window.
       Setting the autoscale option on the main Display panel will scale the entire image to fit the main display window, the full frame buffer will always be visible in the Panner marker window.

       Images  with more colors than can be displayed will automatically be quantized to the number of available colors before display.  If the Auto Grayscale button is enabled any image colormap will be
       converted to grayscale and loaded as the standard grayscale colormap.

       Formats which permit pixels larger than 8-bits/pixel will be sampled on a grid to determine an optimal range in the data to be used to compute a linear transformation to the number of display col‐
       ors. This is the same z-scale sampling and transformation used by the IRAF DISPLAY task when computing the z1/z2 values and provides a much better initial display than simple truncation to 8-bits.
       This scaling will be done automatically using a grid of Nsample points if the Zscale option is enabled.  Otherwise, if the Zrange option is set the full data range will be used to scale the image.
       Lastly, is neither Zscale nor Zrange are enabled, the z1/z2 values may be set explicitly using the options box.

       Directory Browsing
            The load panel contains a list of files in the current directory that may be selected for loading by selecting with left mouse button. If the file is a directory the contents of the  new  di‐
            rectory  will  be loaded, if it's a plain file an attempt will be made to load it as an image otherwise an error popup will appear.  Directories in the list are identified with a trailing '/'
            character, you will always see any subdirectories listed even if a filter is specified.

            The Root button will reset the current directory to the system root directory. The Home button will reset the current directory to the user's login directory, the Up button moves up  one  di‐
            rectory level, and Rescan reloads the file list by rescanning the directory. The current working directory is given below the file selection window.

            Selecting  the  List  Image Headers option will change the display text to list all images in the current directory which match the filename filter.  Directory browsing is disabled while this
            option is in effect.

       File Patterns
            By default all files and directories will be listed. You may specify a filter to select only those files with a given extension such as "*.fits" using the Filter text box.   Directories  will
            always  be  seen in the list and are identified with a trailing '/' character. Any valid unix pattern matching string will be recognized, multiple templates may be specified in a comma-delim‐
            ited list such as "*.imh,*.fits" to list both OIF and FITS images.

       Direct File Load
            If you know exactly which file you wish to load, you may enter its name in the Load File text box and either hit <cr> or the Load button to load it.  An absolute or relative path name may  be
            given, if a simple filename is specified it will be searched for in the current working directory.

       Frame Selections
            By default images will be loaded into the current frame, you may choose a different frame using the Frame menu button to select from the available frames.

SAVE PANEL
       The  Save  Panel lets you save the current contents of the main display window to a disk file (including the Panner/Coords markers, or overlay graphics displayed by the client program). Presently,
       only the contents of the main display window may be saved, there is no facility for saving the undisplayed contents of the entire frame buffer other than to enable the autoscale  feature  or  zoom
       out so the whole buffer is in the display window.  A limited number of formats are currently available, others will be added in future versions.

       File Name      The  File  Name  text box allows you to enter the file name of the saved file. A "%d" anywhere in the name will be replaced by a sequence number allowing multiple frames to be saved
                      with unique names.

       Format         The Format box allows you to choose the format of the image to be created however not all formats are currently implemented.  The EPS format is similar to the Print  option  however
                      there is no annotation.

       Color          The  Color  box lets you choose the color type of the image to be created. The options will change depending on the format, e.g. FITS doesn't allow color so no color options will be
                      enabled.  Formats which allow 24-bit images will be written using the current colormap after converting to a 24-bit image, pseudocolor images will be written with the  current  col‐
                      ormap.

PRINT PANEL
       The Print Panel allows you dump the contents of the main display window as Encapsulated Postscript to either a named printer device or to a disk file.  The Print To selects the type of output, the
       Print  Command box will adjust accordingly, either as a Unix printer command or as a file name.  A "%d" anywhere in the name for disk output will be replaced by a sequence number allowing multiple
       frames to be saved with unique names. Selecting printers from the installed list will automatically change the command to be used to generate the output. This command does not necessarily need  to
       be a printer command, the printer configuration file lets you define any command string to process the image.

   COLOR OPTIONS
       The Color box lets you choose the color type of the image to be created.  PseudoColor or 24-bit postscript will be created using the current colormap and enhancements.

   POSTSCRIPT OPTIONS
       Orientation    Set the page orientation.

       Paper Size     Select the paper size to be used.

       Image Scale    Set the scale factor used to compute the final image size.  No checking is done to make sure the image will fit correctly on the page.

   PROCESSING OPTIONS
       Auto Scale
            Toggles  whether or not the image is automatically scaled to fit the page.  If not enabled, the image scale will be used to determine the output image size, otherwise the image will be scaled
            down (if necessary) to fit on the page.

       Auto Rotate
            Determines whether or not the image will be rotated to fit on the page. When set, an image larger than the current orientation will be rotated and possibly scaled to fit the  page,  otherwise
            the image may be scaled so that it fits in the current orientation.

       Max Aspect
            Automatically increases the scale so the image fills the page in the current orientation.

       Annotate
            The annotate option toggles whether or not the final file includes annotation such as the image title, a colorbar, and axis labels.  There is currently no option for partial annotation.

   ANNOTATION OPTIONS
       Annotate
            Selects whether Postscript image is to be annotated.  Title Annotate with a title on the top of the image.  Borders Annotate with borders surrounding the image giving image coordinates.  Col‐
            orbar  Annotate with colorbar at the bottom of the image Title String Title string to use when title is selected.  The special value imtitle will force the title to be the currently displayed
            image title, otherwise it will be this user-selected field.

   PRINTER SELECTION
       The printer selection list lets choose the printer to be used. The printer configuration file is /usr/local/lib/ximprint.cfg by default or may be reset using the -printConfig command  line  switch
       or printConfig resource. The format of the file is simply

                              name\tcommand

       The  name  value  is what appears in the selection list and may be more than a single word, the command can be any command that accepts EPS input from a pipe, the two fields must be separated by a
       tab character.  Normally the command will be a simple lpr -Pfoo or some such, but can also include converters or previewers. At most 128 printer commands may be used.

INFO PANEL
       The Info panel was revised to provide a greater variety of status information.  The type of output is controlled by the toggle buttons on the bottom of the frame, however all output is  kept  cur‐
       rent as the program runs.  Current info options include:

              Frame          Info about the current display frame.

              Server         Info about various server options, e.g. colormaps, memory model, antialias type, etc.

              Clients        Show currently connected clients.  Lists available connection channels and active ISM clients.

              WCS            List all WCS and mappings for the current frame.

              ISM            Log of various ISM status messages.

              Imtoolrc       Show current frame buffer configuration table.

TILE PANEL (NEW)
       With  the  additional  frames,  the default tiling scheme proved inadequate.  A new control panel Tile frame now allows you to select from a number of tile configurations, the list of frames to be
       tiled, a fill style (left-to-right or top-to-bottom), as well as optional labels for each of the tiles (frame number, image title or image name).

       Tile configuration will make use of all frames currently selected in the Tile Frame group in the following manner:

              Disabled       Do not tile the display.

              Manual         Tile according to Manual Configuration settings.

              Best           Optimize layout for frame buffer aspect.

              Square         Always force a square layout (2x2, 3x3, etc).

              Horizontal     Preferentially tile horizontally (6 frames ==> 3x2).

              Vertical       Preferentially tile vertically (6 frames ==> 2x3).

              One Row        Tile all in one row (Nx1).

              One Column     Tile all in one column (1xN).

COORDS PANEL (NEW)
       The Coords Panel is meant to provide a full-featured readout as well as serve as a control panel for the various options.  The display window contains the image name/title and frame  buffer  info,
       and  a selection of coordinate and image pixel readouts.  The intent is provide more infor- mation than can fit comfortably on the main image window while still taking up as little screen space as
       possible.  To this end the "Options" button is used to hide most of the feature controls when not in use (see below).  Other options on the main panel include:

              WCS/Pix        Toggle the real-time WCS/pixel readout capability (i.e. the ISM used to access the disk image).  This must be enabled for certain other options to work.

              Pix Table      Open a panel showing an image pixel table.  The panel shows an array of pixels surrounding the cursor position, either the actual pixel values  if  the  ISM  is  enabled,  or
                             scaled display values otherwise.  The size of the table may be selected from the menubar.

              Header         Display the current image header in a new panel.  Both the entire image header as well as WCS-specific parts of the header are available under different tabs.  This option is
                             only active when the ISM is enabled.

              Compass        Draw  an  orientation  compass on the display panner.  If the ISM is enabled and a WCS is present in the header, the compass will indicate N/E according to the WCS, otherwise
                             the X/Y axes of the image are drawn.

              Options        Pop-up/down the option control portion of the panel. When enabled, the Coords Panel will change size to reveal the options which can be changed (explained below).

       The "Readout Values" group controls the selection of WCS type, location and format to be displayed.  The "Type" menu always provides a selection of the image Logical, Physical  or  World  systems,
       which  may  be identical depending on the image header.  If a World system is supplied in the image addition entries for transformations to other sky systems, (e.g.  FK5 to ICRS or galactic/eclip‐
       tic) will also be available.  The selection is dependent on whether the ISM is running as well as WCS information present in the image.  The "Format" menu allows the use to  select  a  sexigesimal
       display,  conversion  to  degrees  or radians, or whichever format is most natural for the coordinate being display.  The two toggle to the right control whether this WCS is to be displayed on the
       Panel (i.e. the Coords Panel window) or the ImgWin (i.e.  the text marker on the main image window).

       Other options below this group control whether or not to display the WCS labels, the image name/title, and frame buffer information in the main Coords Panel display.  The "BPM  Data"  option  con‐
       trols  whether  or  not the ISM will try to map any bad-pixel mask associated with the image.  If enabled, a bad-pixel mask specified by the image header BPM keyword (currently fixed by convention
       but this may be selectable later) will be mapped along with the image.  Aside from wcs/pixel readouts at each cursor position, any BPM data values found will also be displayed.  A  non-zero  value
       will cause the BPM field of the Coords Panel readout as well as the main image window marker to switch to a red background color to flag the value.

       The  last box allows the user to specify a different ISM task to be executed or to reinitialize the current one.  In most cases this won't need to be changed, however a custom ISM could be started
       when using special data formats.  This command string can also be controlled by the application "ism_task" resource.

TCLSHELL
       The TclShell allows the user to type commands directly to the TCL interpreter, letting you send messages to the object manager or execute specific procedures in the TCL code that makes up the GUI.
       It is used as a development or debugging tool for the GUI, but for an example of what it does, bring it up and type a command such as

                 send fileButton set background red

COLORMAP SELECTION
       By default XImtool will display images using either a grayscale colormap (e.g.  if loaded by a client), or a private colormap when loading an image from disk that contains a colormap.  Each  frame
       defines its own colormap so you can define different colormaps or enhancements for each frame, they will change automatically as you cycle through the frames.

   BUILTIN COLORMAPS
       Once loaded, the colormap may either be changed using the builtin colormap menu under the View menu button on the main window, or from the Enhancement box on the control panel. XImtool has about a
       dozen colormap options builtin, other user-defined colormaps may optionally be loaded.  It is not presently possible to save colormaps for later use.

   USER-DEFINED COLORMAPS
       The  cmap[12]  and cmapDir[12] resources (or command line arguments) are used to tell which specific colormaps to make available or where to look for colortables respectively.  The colortables are
       loaded when ximtool starts up, or when it is reinitialized (e.g. by pressing the Initialize button in the control panel).  XImtool will ignore any files in the colormap directory which do not look
       like colortables.  New colortables will also be added automatically for each image loaded from disk.

       The format of a user lookup table is very simple: each row defines one colortable entry, and consists of three columns defining the red, green, and blue values scaled to the range 0.0 (off) to 1.0
       (full intensity).

               R G B
               R G B
               (etc.)

       Blank and comment lines (lines beginning with a '#') are ignored.

       Usually 256 rows are provided, but the number may actually be anything in the range 1 to 256. XImtool will interpolate the table as necessary to compute the colortable values used in XImtool. XIm‐
       tool uses at most 201 colors to render pixel data, so it is usually necessary to interpolate the table when it is loaded.

       The name of the colortable as it will appear in the XImtool control panel is the root name of the file, e.g., if the file is "rainbow.lut" the colortable name will be "rainbow". Lower  case  names
       are suggested to avoid name collisions with the builtin colortables. Private colormaps for disk images will be have the same name as the image loaded. If the same colortable file appears in multi‐
       ple user colortable directories, the first one found will be used.

   MINIMIZING COLORMAP CONFLICTS
       The  Gterm  widget used by XImtool (i.e. the main display window) uses a private global colormap for display, this allows it to have greater control over color cell allocation but can occasionally
       also cause "colormap flashing" as the mouse is moved in and out of the application.  The problem here is that in a system with only an 8-bit colormap (256 colors) all applications must compete for
       colors, programs such as XV or Netscape allocate colors from the default colormap leaving only a few free cells for XImtool.  Since XImtool defines a private global colormap it is  still  able  to
       allocate  the  needed  cells  rather than failing, but it's allocating cells already used by other applications.  As the mouse moves out of the ximtool window those cells are once again defined in
       terms of the default colormap, so the ximtool window is then using a different colormap.  It is this switching of the colormap context that causes the flashing to occur, but there are a few things
       that can be done to help minimize this.

       XImtool logically defines 200 colors which the client image display program can use to render pixels.  However, ximtool may or may not actually allocate all of those colors.  By  default  it  cur‐
       rently allocates only about 192 colors, to reserve 64 colors for the other windows on the screen.  You don't normally notice this as 1) usually the default screen colormap has enough free cells to
       allow ximtool to match the colors, and 2) the extra unallocated cells correspond to the brightest pixels in the rendered image, and these colors may not be used or usually only correspond to a few
       small regions near the saturated cores of bright objects.

       You can eliminate this problem by setting the basePixel resource to e.g.  48 instead of 64, which will let the gterm widget allocate all 200 colors.  However, this isn't recommended for normal use
       as  it  will  increase  the  likelihood  of colormap flashing.  If you change basePixel, either restart the X server or set the resource cmapInitialize=True to force the gterm widget to update its
       global colormap resource in the X server.  The colormap resource may also be deleted by using the command

                 xprop -root -remove GT_image

       These options may also be set on the command line when first starting up.

       In general one can set the Gterm widget resources basePixel and maxColors to specify the region of colormap space to be used for image display.  If you set maxColors to a small value, the 200 log‐
       ical colors defined by the widget will be mapped by the imtool color model into whatever number of colors are actually available to the widget.  For example, in the default setup, 200 color values
       are really being mapped into 192 color cells used for display, the remaining colors are used for buttons, menus etc and are allocated from the default colormap by the X toolkit when  the  applica‐
       tion starts up.

       Even though the Gterm widget uses a private colormap, it is a private global colormap meaning that all Gterm widgets share the same colormap.  An example of colormap sharing in ximtool is the main
       image  window and the colorbar window.  These are two separate gterm widgets that share the same colormap.  They have to share the same colormap, as otherwise when you windowed the main image win‐
       dow the colorbar window would not accurately reflect the modified colormap.  By default two separate ximtools would also share the same colormap meaning contrast enhancements in one  window  would
       affect  the  other.   By  resetting the cmapName command line option or resource you can change the name of the private colormap used causing separate ximtools to use different colormaps, but note
       this also creates colormap flashing between the two windows that cannot easily be avoided.  By setting the cmapName to "default" the widget will allocate colors from the default colormap, but this
       is of little use at the moment.

       There are a number of other resources that can be used to modify the behavior of the Gterm widget color management scheme, but these are the most useful ones.

       XImtool allows display clients to connect in any of the following ways:

       fifo pipes
            The traditional approach. The default global /dev/imt1[io] pipes may be used, or a private set of fifos can be specified using the -fifo command  line  argument  or  *fifo  resource.   Values
            should be specified as the root pathname to a pair of fifo pipes whose last character is 'i' or 'o',  these characters will be added automatically when opening the pipes.  For example, to use
            the default pipes the path would be specified as simply "/dev/imt1". A value of "none" disables this connection.

       tcp/ip sockets
            Clients connect via a tcp/ip socket. The default port is 5137, or a custom port may be specified using the -port command line switch or a *port resource. This permits connecting to the server
            over a remote network connection anywhere on the Internet.  A port number of 0 (zero) disables this connection.

       unix domain sockets
            Like  a  tcp/ip socket, but limited to a single host system. Usually faster than a tcp/ip socket, and comparable to a fifo. By default each user gets their own unix domain socket, so this op‐
            tion allows multiple users to run ximtools on the same host without having to customize things.  The default value is "/tmp/.IMT%d", other sockets may be defined using the -unix command  line
            switch  or  the  *unixaddr  resource.  Legal values should be specified as a filename to be used for the socket, up to two "%d" fields are allowed and will be replaced by the userid. An empty
            string value disables this connection.

            By default ximtool listens simultaneously for client connections on all three types of ports.   Clients may connect simultaneously by different means allowing up to three  different  displays
            to be loading at the same time into different frames.

   COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL
       The communications protocol used is a slightly modified version of that used by the IIS Model 70; other more modern protocols will likely be supported in the future.  The IIS protocol is basically
       a command packet stream with a header describing the operation to be performed (select frame, load display, read cursor, etc), and an optional data packet containing e.g. pixels.

       Beginning  with  XImtool  V1.3 the protocol was modified even more to allow extra text at the end of the WCS string to define image mappings and to better support multiple world coordinate systems
       within a frame.   For backwards compatibility none of the existing IIS protocols were modified completely, however we take advantage of unused registers to flag the new features in existing  func‐
       tions  (like  read/write  WCS).  The  WCS mapping changes required only that the unused 'x' register be set to indicate the new behavior was desired, e.g. the wcs text containing the extra mapping
       data.

       We also added two new WCS calls that allow us to query the WCS version, or query a WCS by a specific number corresponding to a mapping.  The WCS version query will return a string  such  as  "ver‐
       sion=10" which can be parsed by the client to get a version number '10' (corresponding to version 1.0).

       Because of the added mapping text the WCS string length was increased from 320 to 1024 bytes, the string length used internally depends on whether the 'x' register has been set.

       Support  for  the  full 16 frames allowed by the bit-flag 'z' register in the IIS header packet required the masking values be changed at various places in the code.  This was more a limitation of
       the initial implementation than a required change to the protocol.

       A complete summary of the XImtool IIS protocol implementation follows.

   IIS PROTOCOL SUMMARY
       All operations are initiated by sending a header packet containing a thing id (tid) and subunit selecting the function to be performed, optionally followed by data up to 32Kb long.  The IIS header
       packet used is defined as
                 struct  iism70 {
                         short   tid;
                         short   thingct;
                         short   subunit;
                         short   checksum;
                         short   x, y, z;
                         short   t;
                 };

       The thing count field contains the negative number of bytes of data that will be sent following the header packet.  The IIS header checksum is computed as
           checksum = 0177777 - (tid + subunit + thingct + x + y + z + t);
       The four IIS registers are set differently depending on the operation, a summary of the header packets for each operation is summarized below.

                                                                                            IIS Header Packet Summary

       TID fields can be logically OR'd with the PACKED flag indicating the number of data bytes is exactly thingct bytes long, otherwise thingct must be specified as half the number of data bytes.  In a
       cursor read, if the IIS_READ flag is OR'd with IMC_SAMPLE the logical cursor position (i.e.  the last value read or set) is returned immediately, otherwise the server will wait for a keystroke  to
       be hit before returning a string containing the (x,y) position, wcs of the read, and the keystroke.  When setting the frame you must send a short integer in the data containing the frame selected.

ISM COMMUNICATIONS
       The  ISM  (Image  Support Module) can be any external task which connects to XImtool over a socket.  Communications are limited to simple null-terminated text strings.  In most cases these strings
       are just the standard OBM messages sent to XImtool objects but can also include Tcl callback code (either ISM-specific callbacks, procedures which can be added to the callback  list  for  existing
       XImtool objects, or even new GUI code to create panels and new objects).

   ISM SOCKET CONNECTION
       The ISM first requests a connection to XImtool on a dedicated socket whose default value is "/tmp/.ISM%d", where the '%d' is replaced by the userid allowing multiple users on a machine to have in‐
       dependent  sockets.  The XImtool 'ism_addr' resource or "-ismdev" command-line option can be used to change this address, a value of 'none' will disable ISM communications.  The socket may also be
       set with an ISMDEV environment variable which will override the resource or command-line options.

       Once a connection request is received,  XImtool replies with a message telling the ISM to reconnect on a different socket, it then frees the initial connection allowing multiple other ISMs to  re‐
       quest  their own connection.  The communications between XImtool and the ISM are carried out entirely over this second negotiated socket.  Once connected, the ISM appears as just another named ob‐
       ject which can receive OBM messages.

   COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL
       Messages from the ISM are written to the connection socket and must be preceded by one of the following keywords:

              callback       Negotiate a connection on another socket

              ready          Client is ready to begin processing

              quit           Client is shutting down and disconnecting

              send           Send a message to another object

       Where messages are of the form:

              connect <name>                Request a connection for the <name> ISM

              ready <name>                  Reconnection request for the <name> ISM on negotiated socket, ISM is ready to processing.

              send <obj> '{' <msg> '}'      Send <msg> to the named <obj>.  The message may be any valid string that will be understood by the recipient.  The object may be any object in the GUI  or  OBM
                                            (see below).

              quit                          ISM  is  shutting  down. The named is determined from the communications channel, ISM is responsible for any cleanup of it's callbacks before issuing the shut‐
                                            down.

       All messages must be null-terminated.  XImtool will buffer the text until a complete message is received.  Once an ISM client has delivered a QUIT message no further messages will be sent the that
       ISM.

       In OBM terminology the ISM is a named Client class object, where the name is set in the connection request.  Messages sent to the ISM should use this name, messages sent to "client" are still  in‐
       terpreted to mean the XImtool client.

       The content of messages delivered to the ISM are totally free-form and may contain any text the ISM is expected to understand.

   GUI OBJECTS
       While  the  ISM can send a message to any object in the task, there is a GUI Parameter object called 'ism_msg' designed especially to process messages from the ISM.  The callback in the GUI is ex‐
       pecting a message beginning with one of the following keywords:

              source         Source message text as Tcl code

              alert          Message contains error text to be displayed in the GUI 'alert' box

              deliver        Message text should be passed to a callback routine specific to that ISM.  This processing callback may have been previously uploaded.  The message text may be any  form  the
                             processing callback is expected to understand.

              info           Message text is status output intended for the XImtool 'info' panel (connect/disconnect requests, etc)

       In all cases the message is expected to be of the form

            <cmd> <ism_name> [ <arg1> <arg2> <...> ]

       where  <cmd>  is one of the above keywords, <ism_name> is the name of the ISM sending the message.  The remainder of the message is passed as an 'argv' list to the processing callback uploaded for
       the ISM.  The ISM is responsible for formatting these messages.
