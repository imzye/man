NAME
       ConfClerk - offline conference schedule application

SYNOPSIS
       confclerk

DESCRIPTION
       ConfClerk is an application written in Qt, which makes conference schedules available offline.  It displays the conference schedule from various views, supports searches on various items (speaker,
       speech topic, location, etc.) and enables you to select favorite events and create your own schedule.

       At the moment ConfClerk is able to import schedules in XML format created by the PentaBarf conference management system (or frab) used by e.g. FOSDEM, DebConf, FrOSCon, Grazer Linuxtage, and the
       CCC, or compatible systems like Summit, Wafer, or pretalx.

       ConfClerk was originally targeted at mobile devices like the Nokia N810 and N900 but works on any system running Qt.

OPTIONS
       None.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration can be done via the graphical interface.

       The configuration is saved in the default QSettings location, i.e.:

       Linux
           ~/.config/Toastfreeware/ConfClerk.conf

       Windows
           In the registry (search for the Toastfreeware key, should be at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Toastfreeware\ConfClerk).

       Other OS
           Cf. the QSettings documentation at <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html#platform-specific-notes>.

FILES
       ConfClerk keeps its database in the location proposed by the XDG Base Directory specification <https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>:

       So  the  configuration  (see  "CONFIGURATION")  is  stored  at ~/.config/Toastfreeware/ConfClerk.conf and the database is kept at ~/.local/share/data/Toastfreeware/ConfClerk/ConfClerk.sqlite (Qt4)
       ~/.local/share/Toastfreeware/ConfClerk/ConfClerk.sqlite (Qt5).
