NAME
       rootv - display TV using the Xvideo extension

SYNOPSIS
       rootv [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       rootv puts a video to some window.  By default it creates its own window, but you can also ask it to use the root window (thus the name) or any other window.  rootv needs the Xvideo extension.

       rootv itself provides no way to control video/audio/tuner.  You can use v4lctl to do this.

OPTIONS
       rootv knows a number of command line options to modify the behaviour.

       -help  Print a short description of all command line options.

       -verbose
              Be verbose.  That will dump some debug messages to stderr.

       -root  Put the video onto the root window instead of creating a new window.

       -id <win>
              Put the video into the window <win> instead of creating a new window.

       -station <st>
              Tune station <st>.  This just calls v4lctl, which in turn will look up the station in your ~/.xawtv config file.

       -no-mute
              Don't toggle mute.  By default rootv will unmute the TV card when it starts and mute it on exit.  It does this using the XV_MUTE attribute (if available).

       -port <n>
              Use Xvideo port <n>.  Try the -verbose switch if you want to know which ones are available.

       -bg    Fork into background.

       -wm    Print WindowMaker menu (set stations using v4lctl).
