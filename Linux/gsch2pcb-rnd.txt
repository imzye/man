NAME
       gsch2pcb-rnd - Update pcb-rnd layouts from gEDA/gaf schematics

SYNOPSIS
       gsch2pcb-rnd [OPTION ...] {PROJECT | FILE ...}

DESCRIPTION
       gsch2pcb-rnd is a frontend to gnetlist(1) which aids in creating and updating pcb-rnd(1) printed circuit board layouts based on a set of electronic schematics created with gschem(1).

       Instead of specifying all options and input gEDA schematic FILEs on the command line, gsch2pcb-rnd can use a PROJECT file instead.

       gsch2pcb-rnd first runs gnetlist(1) with the `PCB' backend to create a `<name>.net' file containing a pcb-rnd(1) formatted netlist for the design.

       The  second  step  is to run gnetlist(1) again with the `gsch2pcb-rnd' backend to find any M4(1) elements required by the schematics.  Any missing elements are found by searching a set of file element
       directories.  If no `<name>.pcb' file exists for the design yet, it is created with the required elements; otherwise, any new elements are output to a `<name>.new.pcb' file.

       If a `<name>.pcb' file exists, it is searched for elements with a non-empty element name with no matching schematic symbol.  These elements are removed from the `<name>.pcb' file, with a backup  in  a
       `<name>.pcb.bak' file.

       Finally, gnetlist(1) is run a third time with the `pcbpins' backend to create a `<name>.cmd' file.  This can be loaded into pcb-rnd(1) to rename all pin names in the PCB layout to match the schematic.

OPTIONS
       -o, --output-name=BASENAME
               Use output filenames `BASENAME.net', `BASENAME.pcb', and `BASENAME.new.pcb'.  By default, the basename of the first schematic file in the list of input files is used.

       -d, --elements-dir=DIRECTORY
               Add DIRECTORY to the list of directories to search for PCB file elements.

       -r, --remove-unfound
               Don't include references to unfound elements in the generated `.pcb' files.  Use if you want pcb-rnd(1) to be able to load the (incomplete) `.pcb' file.  This is enabled by default.

       -k, --keep-unfound
               Keep include references to unfound elements in the generated `.pcb' files.  Use if you want to hand edit or otherwise preprocess the generated `.pcb' file before running pcb(1).

       -p, --preserve
               Preserve elements in PCB files which are not found in the schematics.  Since elements with an empty element name (schematic "refdes") are never deleted, this option is rarely useful.

       --gnetlist BACKEND
               In addition to the default backends, run gnetlist(1) with `-g BACKEND', with output to `<name>.BACKEND'.

       --gnetlist-arg ARG
               Pass ARG as an additional argument to gnetlist(1).

       --empty-footprint NAME
               If  NAME  is  not `none', gsch2pcb-rnd will not add elements for components with that name to the PCB file.  Note that if the omitted components have net connections, they will still appear in
               the netlist and pcb-rnd(1) will warn that they are missing.

       --fix-elements
               If a schematic component's `footprint' attribute is not equal to the `Description' of the corresponding PCB element, update the `Description' instead of replacing the element.

       -q, --quiet
               Don't output information on steps to take after running gsch2pcb-rnd.

       -v, --verbose
               Output extra debugging information.  This option can be specified twice (`-v -v') to obtain additional debugging for file elements.

       -h, --help
               Print a help message.

       -V, --version
               Print gsch2pcb-rnd version information.

PROJECT FILES
       A gsch2pcb-rnd project file is a file (not ending in `.sch') containing a list of schematics to process and some options.  Any long-form command line option can appear in the  project  file  with  the
       leading `--' removed, with the exception of `--gnetlist-arg', `--fix-elements', `--verbose', and `--version'.  Schematics should be listed on a line beginning with `schematics'.

       An example project file might look like:

            schematics partA.sch partB.sch
            output-name design

ENVIRONMENT
       GNETLIST
               specifies the gnetlist(1) program to run.  The default is `gnetlist'.
