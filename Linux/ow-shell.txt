DESCRIPTION
   1-Wire
       1-wire is a wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector scheme where the data line can also provide
       power.

       Each  device  is  uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage, contact, current), switches,
       timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also 1-wire devices that have encryption included.

       The 1-wire scheme uses a single bus master and multiple slaves on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be individually discovered  and  addressed  using  their
       unique ID.

       Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB adapters.

   OWFS design
       OWFS  is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique ID being the direc‐
       tory, and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.

       Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or  control  ap‐
       plications.  There  are  some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundamental
       goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed.

   OWSHELL programs
       owdir owread owwrite and owget are collectively called the owshell programs. They allow lightweight access to an owserver (1) for use in command line scripts.

       Unlike owserver (1) owhttpd (1) owftpd (1) owhttpd (1) there is not persistent connection with the 1-wire bus, no caching and no  multithreading.  Instead,  each  program  connects  to  a  running
       owserver (1) and performs a quick set of queries.

       owserver (1) performs the actual 1-wire connection (to physical 1-wire buses or other owserver programs), performs concurrency locking, caching, and error collection.

       owshell programs are intended for use in command line scripts. An alternative approach is to mount an owfs (1) filesystem and perform direct file lists, reads and writes.

   owdir
       owdir  performs  a directory listing. With no argument, all the devices on the main 1-wire bus will be listed. Given the name of a 1-wire device, the available properties will be listed. It is the
       equivalent of

              ls directory

       in the owfs (1) filesystem.

   owread
       owread obtains for value of a 1-wire device property. e.g. 28.0080BE21AA00/temperature gives the DS18B20 temperature. It is the equivalent of

              cat filepath

       in the owfs (1) filesystem.

   owwrite
       owwrite performs a change of a property, changing a 1-wire device setting or writing to memory. It is the equivalent of

              echo value > filepath

       in the owfs (1) filesystem.

   owget
       owget (1) is a convenience program, combining the function of owdir (1) and owread (1) by first trying to read the argument as a directory, and if that fails as a 1-wire property.

STANDARD OPTIONS
   --autoserver
       Find an owserver using the Service Discovery protocol. Essentially Apple's Bonjour (aka zeroconf). Only the first owserver will be used, and that choice is probably arbitrary.

   -s [host:]port
       Connect via tcp (network) to an owserver process that is connected to a physical 1-wire bus. This allows multiple processes to share the same bus. The owserver process can be local or remote.

       If the server option is not specified, the default is the local machine and the IANA allocated default port of 4304. Thus "-s localhost:4304" is the equivalent.

DATA OPTIONS
--hex
       Hexadecimal mode. For reading data, each byte of character will be displayed as two characrters 0-9ABCDEF. Most useful for reading memory locations. No spaces between data.

       Writing data in hexadecimal mode just means that the data should be given as one long hexadecimal string.

--start=offset
       Read or write memory locations starting at the offset byte rather than the beginning. An offset of 0 means the beginning (and is the default).

--size=bytes
       Read up to the specified number of bytes of a memory location.

HELP OPTIONS
   -h --help
       Shows (this) basic summary of options.

   -V --version
       Version of this program.

DISPLAY OPTIONS
   --dir
       Modify the display of directories to indicate which entries are also directories. A directory member will have a trailing '/' if it is a directory itself. This aids recursive searches.

   -f --format f[.]i[[.]c]
       Display format for the 1-wire devices. Each device has a 8 byte address, consisting of:

       f      family code, 1 byte

       i      ID number, 6 bytes

       c      CRC checksum, 1 byte

       Possible formats are f.i (default, 01.A1B2C3D4E5F6), fi fic f.ic f.i.c and fi.c

       All formats are accepted as input, but the output will be in the specified format.

EXAMPLE
       owdir -s 3000 --format fic
              Get the device listing (full 16 hex digits, no dots) from the local owserver at port 3000

       owread -F --autoserver 51.125499A32000/typeK/temperature
              Read temperature from the DS2751-based thermocouple on an auto-discovered owserver Temperature in fahrenheit.

       owwrite -s 10.0.1.2:3001 32.000800AD23110/pages/page.1 "Passed"
              Connect to a OWFS server process ( owserver ) that was started on another machine at tcp port 3001 and write to the memory of a DS2780
