NAME
       python3-pymzml - mzML mass spectrometric data parsing

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the python3-pymzml package that packages the pymzML Python extension.

       pymzML is an extension to Python that offers:

       - easy access to mass spectrometry (MS) data that allows the rapid development of tools;

       - a very fast parser for mzML data, the standard in mass spectrometry data format;

       - a set of functions to compare or handle spectra.

       pymzML requires Python3.5+. The module is freely available on pymzml.github.com or pypi, published under the MIT license.

       The documentation of this Python extension is packaged in the python"-pymzml-doc package.

EXAMPLES
       A  number of useful examples are shipped within the python-pymzml-doc package and can be found at /usr/share/doc/python3-pymzml/example_scripts. A number of the examples make use of functions
       contained in get_example_file.py via an import of that file's contents. It is suggested to copy this directory to a temporary place and to run python from inside that new directory so  as  to
       gain access to the features contained in that get_example_file.py file through an import (which would not work otherwise).
