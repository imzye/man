SYNOPSIS
       kile [ generic-options ] [ --line line ] [ --new ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Kile (the KDE Integrated LaTeX Environment) is a user-friendly LaTeX source editor and TeX shell for KDE.

       The source editor is a multi-document editor designed for .tex and .bib files.  Menus, wizards and auto-completion are provided to assist with tag insertion and code generation.  A structural view
       of the document assists with navigation within source files.

       The  TeX shell integrates the various tools required for TeX processing.  It assists with LaTeX compilation, DVI and postscript document viewing, generation of bibliographies and indices and other
       common tasks.

       Kile can support large projects consisting of several smaller files.
