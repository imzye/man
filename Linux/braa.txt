NAME
       braa - Mass SNMP scanner

SYNOPSIS
       braa [-h] [-2] [-v] [-t <s>] [-f <file] [-a <time>] [-r <retries>] [-d <delay>] [querylist1] [querylist2] [...]

DESCRIPTION
         Braa  is  a  mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course making SNMP queries - but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able to query dozens or hundreds of hosts
       simultaneously, and in a single process.  Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.
         Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries like net-snmp. The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data types, and in any  case  cannot  be  stated
       'standard-conforming'! It was designed to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of my laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa - you HAVE to know the numerical val‐
       ues of OID's (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0).

OPTIONS
       -h     Show help.

       -2     Claim to be a SNMP2C agent.

       -v     Show short summary after doing all queries.

       -x     Hexdump octet-strings

       -t <s> Wait <s> seconds for responses.

       -d <s> Wait <s> microseconds after sending each packet.

       -p <s> Wait <s> milliseconds between subsequent passes.

       -f <file>
              Load queries from file <file> (one by line).

       -a <time>
              Quit after <time> seconds, independent on what happens.

       -r <rc>
              Retry count (default: 3).

QUERY FORMATS
       GET: [community@]iprange[:port]:oid[/id]

       WALK: [community@]iprange[:port]:oid.*[/id]

       SET: [community@]iprange[:port]:oid=value[/id]

EXAMPLES
       $ braa public@10.253.101.1:161:.1.3.6.*
              Walk the SNMP tree of host 10.253.101.1 with public string querying all OIDs under .1.3.6:

       $ braa 10.253.101.1-10.253.101.254:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0
              Query the whole subnet 10.53.101/24 of for system.sysLocation.0

       $ braa private@10.253.101.1:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0=sMy network
              Tries to set the value of system.sysLocation.0 to "My network" at host 10.253.101.1

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       *      The only supported datatypes are: integer (gauge, counter, timeticks, etc.) counter64, string, ipaddress, OID. Of course you are free to modify braaasn.c/braaasn.h to support more types...

       *      braa  will  never  send  more than 1500 bytes (or a single packet) to a host in a single try. Thus the number of queries that might be sent to a single host is limited. Additionally, if you
              reach the limit by specifying too many queries, braa will terminate the whole scanning process... I can't tell what the limit exactly is, it just depends on many factors (mainly, the length
              of OIDs), anyway, 15 queries per hosts sounds dangerous, and better try not to exceed this number.

       *      It is impossible to specify FQDN hostnames - you always have to give IP addresses of hosts... well, I think it'll be corrected in future versions, if there will be ones.

                                                                                                                                                                                                    BRAA(1)
