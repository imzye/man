NAME
       GNOME 2048 - Obtain the highest possible tile

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-2048 [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       2048 is a highly addictive single-player game. Gameplay consists of joining numbers in a grid for obtaining bigger values.

       Use  your keyboard’s arrow keys or gestures to slide all tiles in the desired direction. Be careful: all tiles slide to their farthest possible positions, you cannot slide just one tile or one row
       or column. Tiles with the same value are joined when slided one over the other. After your turn, one new tile is added to the game.

       Gnome 2048 only adds tiles of value 2, as opposed to the original 2048 game. Also, it allows you to play on grids of various size.

OPTIONS
       --cli=<command>
              Play in the terminal. See “--cli=help” for documentation.

       -s, --size=<size>
              Changes the size of the grid. Size must be between 2 and 9, or in the form 2x3.

       -v, --version
              Prints the program version and exits.

       This program also accepts the standard GTK+ options.
