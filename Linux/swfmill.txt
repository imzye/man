NAME
       swfmill - XML-based SWF (Shockwave Flash) processing tool

SYNOPSIS
       swfmill [options] <command>

DESCRIPTION
       swfmill is an xml2swf and swf2xml processor with import functionalities.

       It's most common use is the generation of asset libraries containing images (PNG and JPEG), fonts (TTF) or other SWF movies for use with MTASC- or haXe-compiled ActionScript, although swfmill
       can be used to produce both simple and complex SWF structures.

         * built around an XSLT/EXSLT processor (libxslt)
         * input and output of the XSLT transformation can be either XML or binary SWF
         * XSLT commands for importing PNG, JPEG, TTF and SWF, and for mapping SWF ID numbers
         * built-in "simple dialect" to support library creation and building simple SWFs

   <command> is one of:
              swf2xml <in> [<out>]

              convert from SWF to XML.  <in> is a single SWF file, or 'stdin' <out> is a single XML file, or (by default) 'stdout'

              xml2swf <in> [<out>]

              convert from XML to SWF.  <in> is a single XML file, or 'stdin' <out> is a single SWF file, or (by default) 'stdout'

              simple <in> [<out>]

              convert from a movie definition file to SWF.  <in> is a single XML file, or 'stdin' <out> is a single SWF file, or (by default) 'stdout' (for details, see README)

              xslt <xsl> <in> [<out>]

              transform <in> to <out> as described by <xsl>.  <xsl> is the XSLT stylesheet,

              and can use the swft: extension.

       <in>   must be some XML (depends on <xsl>)

              <out> is either SWF (when it ends in .swf)

              or XML, by default on 'stdout'

   <option>s are:

       -h print this help and quit

       --version print the version number and quit

       -v verbose output

       -V extra-verbose debugging output

       -d dump SWF data when loaded (for debugging)

       -e specify text encoding in SWF (for SWF 5 and earlier only;

              default: UTF-8).

       -n deactivate libxml network access
