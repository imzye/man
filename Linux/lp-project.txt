NAME
       lp-project - work with projects in Launchpad

SYNOPSIS
       lp-project <command>

DESCRIPTION
       lp-project allows you to quickly create a new project on Launchpad. It automates the creation of management/commiter teams, a -dev mailing list, the project itself, and a bzr branch for trunk.

OPTIONS
       Listed below are the possible commands that can be passed to lp-project:

       help commands
              List all supported commands

       create <projectname>
              Create  a project. This creates two teams - a management/committer team owner by you and a -dev mailing list owned by the mgmt team. It then creates the project, makes it owned by the committer
              team, creates a new empty bzr branch for trunk and then fires up a web browser pointing at the project for you to fine tune.  After running this command you need to set what LP features you are
              using  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/537269),  describe  your  project  (title,  summary,  description),  upload  your  code  to  lp:PROJECT,  and  turn on the mailing list by hand
              (https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/537258)
