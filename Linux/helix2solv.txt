NAME
       helix2solv - convert legacy helixcode format into a solv file

SYNOPSIS
       helix2solv

DESCRIPTION
       The helix format was a metadata format used in the RedCarpet package manager. It’s still used in libzypp testcases. The helix2solv tool reads data in helix format from standard input and writes it in
       solv file format to standard output.
