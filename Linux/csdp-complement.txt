NAME
       csdp-complement - Compute the complement of a graph

SYNOPSIS
       csdp-complement GRAPH_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The csdp-complement program computes the complement of a graph.

FILE FORMAT
       The input file should be in the following format:
              n
              m
              i1 j1
              …
              im jm
       where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges, and each i/j pair describes one edge.

       The output file has the the complement of the graph written to it in the same format.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is zero if the complement is computed successfully.  Otherwise, the exit status is one, and an error message indicating the problem is produced on standard out.
