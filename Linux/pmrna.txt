NAME
       pmrna - filter out all but the primary isoform from each gene of the input

SYNOPSIS
       pmrna [options] < annot.gff3 > new.gff3

DESCRIPTION
       Options:

       -h|--help
              print this help message and exit

       -i|--introns
              flag indicating that introns are declared explicitly and do not need to be inferred from exon features; default is to infer introns

       -l|--locus
              report a single representative mRNA for each locus instead of each gene

       -m|--map: FILE
              write each gene/mRNA mapping to the specified file

       -p|--pseudogenes
              disable pseudogene detection and correction
