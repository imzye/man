DESCRIPTION
       This  program  builds  a  shapefile with a record for each input raster
       file, an attribute containing the filename, and a polygon geometry out‐
       lining the raster.  This output is suitable for use with MapServer as a
       raster tileindex.

       -f <format>
              The OGR format of the output tile index file. Starting with GDAL
              2.3,  if not specified, the format is guessed from the extension
              (previously was ESRI Shapefile).

       -tileindex <field_name>
              The output field name to hold the file path/location to the  in‐
              dexed rasters. The default tile index field name is location.

       -write_absolute_path
              The  absolute path to the raster files is stored in the tile in‐
              dex file.  By default the raster filenames will be  put  in  the
              file exactly as they are specified on the command line.

       -skip_different_projection
              Only files with same projection as files already inserted in the
              tileindex will be inserted (unless -t_srs is specified). Default
              does not check projection and accepts all inputs.

       -t_srs <target_srs>:
              Geometries  of  input  files  will be transformed to the desired
              target coordinate reference system.  Default creates simple rec‐
              tangular polygons in the same coordinate reference system as the
              input rasters.

       -src_srs_name <field_name>
              The name of the field to store the SRS of each tile. This  field
              name  can  be  used  as  the  value  of  the  TILESRS keyword in
              MapServer

       -src_srs_format <type>
              The format in which the SRS of each tile must be written.  Types
              can be AUTO, WKT, EPSG, PROJ.

       -lyr_name <name>
              Layer name to create/append to in the output tile index file.

       index_file
              The  name  of  the  output file to create/append to. The default
              shapefile will be created if it doesn't already exist, otherwise
              it will append to the existing file.

       <gdal_file>
              The  input GDAL raster files, can be multiple files separated by
              spaces.  Wildcards my also be used. Stores the file locations in
              the  same  style  as specified here, unless -write_absolute_path
              option is also used.

EXAMPLES
       • Produce a shapefile (doq_index.shp) with a  record  for  every  image
         that  the utility found in the doq folder. Each record holds informa‐
         tion that points to the location of the image  and  also  a  bounding
         rectangle shape showing the bounds of the image:

          gdaltindex doq_index.shp doq/*.tif

       • The  -t_srs  option  can  also be used to transform all input rasters
         into the same output projection:

          gdaltindex -t_srs EPSG:4326 -src_srs_name src_srs tile_index_mixed_srs.shp *.tif

       • Make a tile index from files listed in a text file :

          gdaltindex doq_index.shp --optfile my_list.txt

SEE ALSO
       raster_common_options for other command-line options, and in particular
       the  --optfile  switch  that  can  be  used  to specify a list of input
       datasets.
