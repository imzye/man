NAME
       swath - General-purpose Thai word segmentation utility

SYNOPSIS
       swath [options] < infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       Thai script has no word delimitor.  Applications need to recognize word boundaries before they can do useful things with Thai text, such as line wrapping.

       Swath provides word analysis filter to insert word delimitors into a given text stream.  It reads text from standard input, analyzes it for word boundaries by consulting a Thai word list, and out‐
       puts to standard output the same text with the predefined word delimitors inserted.

       Currently,  it  can  read  plain text, HTML, RTF, LaTeX and Lambda (Unicode version of LaTeX with Omega typesetter kernel) documents and insert common word delimitors for each format (pipe `|' for
       plain text). But user can always override this with a preferred delimitor.

OPTIONS
       -b [delimitor]
              Define the string to be inserted as word delimitor in the output text.

       -d [dict-path]
              Specify alternative dictionary location.  dict-path must be either a directory containing the swath dictionary file `swathdic.tri', or a path to the dictionary file itself.  The  dictionary
              file must be a trie file prepared using trietool(1) utility from the libdatrie package.

              If this option is given, swath will override normal dictionary search and will exit if the given dictionary cannot be found.  Otherwise, if SWATHDICT environment is set, it will try to open
              dictionary from the location specified by its value.  Otherwise, it will try the current working directory, and finally the usual installed location.

       -f [format]
              Specify format of the input.  Possible formats are: html, rtf, latex, lambda.

       -m [scheme]
              Choose word matching scheme when analyzing word boundaries.  Possible schemes are `long' (for longest or greedy matching) and `max' (for maximal matching, with least words preferred).  Max‐
              imal matching is the default value.

       -u input-enc,output-enc
              Specify encodings of the input and the output.  input-enc and output-enc can be one of 'u' (for UTF-8 encoding) and 't' (for TIS-620 encoding).  Swath will convert the character encoding as
              necessary.  If this option is omitted, TIS-620 encodings on both input and output are assumed.

       -v, --verbose
              Turn on verbose mode.

       -help, --help
              Show help.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SWATHDICT
              If  specified, swath will search for dictionary from this location before the usual places (current working directory and usual installed directory, respectively).  This value is overridden
              by -d option.

EXAMPLES
       For LaTeX (to be used with babel-thai package):

       $ swath -f latex < thaifile.tex > thaifile.ttex
       $ latex thaifile.ttex

       For HTML (to provide web pages to web browsers that cannot wrap Thai lines properly, but support the <wbr> tag):

       $ swath -f html < myweb.html > myweb-wbr.html

       To preprocess a Thai UTF-8 encoded LaTeX file for babel-thai with tis620 inputenc:

       $ swath -f latex -u u,t < thaifile.tex > thaifile.ttex
       $ latex thaifile.ttex

       This is equivalent to filtering with iconv(1):

       $ iconv -f UTF-8 -t TIS-620 thaifile.tex | swath -f latex > thaifile.ttex
       $ latex thaifile.ttex

       To use longest matching scheme with LaTeX document:

       $ swath -f latex -m long < thaifile.tex > thaifile.ttex
       $ latex thaifile.ttex

       To use an alternative dictionary from libthai:

       $ swath -f latex -d /usr/share/libthai/thbrk.tri < thaifile.tex > thaifile.ttex
