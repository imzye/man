NAME
       Arch::LiteWeb - simple way to access web pages

SYNOPSIS
           my $web = Arch::LiteWeb->new;
           my $content = $web->get("http://some.domain:81/some/path");
           die $web->error . " while processing " . $web->request_url
               unless $content;
           my $content_type = $web->response_headers->{content_type};

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides a basic and easy to use support for the client-side HTTP.  It is supplied in order to avoid dependency on LWP. If such dependency is not
       a problem, consider to use LWP instead that provides much better support for HTTP and other protocols.

METHODS
       The following class methods are available:

       get, post, request_url, error, error_with_url, network_error, response_code, response_codestr, response_error, response_headers, response_content.

       get url [params ...]
           Execute HTTP get of the given url and return the html string or undef on network/response error. Use other methods to get the details about the error and
           the response.

           params is key-value hash, the following keys are supported:

               url_host            - only used if url is none
               url_port            - only used if url is none (80)
               url_path            - only used if url is none
               endl                - default is "\015\012"
               timeout             - default is 20 seconds
               user_agent          - default is "Arch::LiteWeb/0.1"
               nocache             - add a no-cache header
               noredirect          - don't follow redirect responses
               max_redirect_depth  - default is 5
               use_proxy           - default is false
               proxy_url           - proxy url ($http_proxy supported too)
               proxy_host          - only used if proxy_url is none
               proxy_port          - only used if proxy_url is none (80)

       post url input [params]
           Not implemented yet.

       request_url
           Actual url of the last issued request or undef. If partial redirect responses are enabled, then the result is the last (non-redirect) url.

       error
           If the last request resulted in error (i.e. get/post returned undef), then this method returns the error message, otherwise it returns undef.  This is
           just a shortcut for network_error || response_error.

       error_with_url
           Like error, but with "\nwhile fetching request_url\n" text appended if non undef.

       network_error
           The network error message for the last request or undef.

       response_error
           The response error message for the last request or undef.

       response_code
           The last response code (integer) or undef.

       response_codestr
           The last response code (string) or undef.

       response_headers
           The last response headers (hashref of HTTP headers) or undef.

       response_content
           The last response content or undef.  This is the same thing that the last get/post returns.

BUGS
       Not intended for use in mission-critical applications.
