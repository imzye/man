NAME
       lemon — The Lemon Parser Generator

SYNOPSIS
       lemon [-bcgmqsx] input

DESCRIPTION
       lemon  is an LALR(1) parser generator for C or C++.  It does the same job as bison and yacc.  But lemon is not another bison or yacc clone.  It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to
       reduce the number of coding errors.  lemon also uses a more sophisticated parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both reentrant and thread-safe.  Furthermore, lemon  imple‐
       ments features that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or embedded controllers.

       lemon will read the grammer from input and write out a parser for that grammar in the C language.

OPTIONS
       -b      Print only the basis in report.

       -c      Don't compress the action table.

       -g      Print grammar without actions.

       -m      Output a makeheaders compatible file.

       -q      (Quiet) Don't print the report file.

       -s      Print parser stats to standard output.

       -x      Print the version number.
