NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Redirect - Redirect for Catalyst used easily is offered.

SYNOPSIS
         use Catalyst 'Redirect';

         $c->get_baseurl;

         $c->redirect('redirect_url');
         $c->redirect('/redirect_url');
         $c->redirect('http://www.perl.org/');

DESCRIPTION
       Redirect for Catalyst used easily is offered.

METHODS
       get_baseurl
         Basic URL of your application is returned.  If your application is executed by "http://myhost/myapp/" it returns "/myapp/" .

       redirect
         $c->redirect('redirect_url'); $c->res->redirect('redirect_url') is executed.

         $c->redirect('/redirect_url'); $c->res->redirect($c->get_baseurl.'redirect_url') is executed.

         $c->redirect('http://www.perl.org/'); $c->res->redirect('http://www.perl.org/') is executed.

BUGS
       When Reverse Proxy is used, get_baseurl returns the backend server's base.  For example, "/" will be returned when http://www.mydomain.com/myapp/ is a proxy for http://appserver.local.server/.
