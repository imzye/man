NAME
       whiff - like which, but finds the first of all the given alternatives

VERSION
       version 0.008

DESCRIPTION
       which is a useful utility, found on most unix systems.  It gives you the absolute path for the first occurrence of a program in your path.  Unfortunately, it does two stupid things:  first, if it
       can't find one, it prints an error message to stdout; secondly, if you give it multiple arguments, it assumes you want one line per argument, each like calling which individually.

       whiff assumes that all the arguments form a best-first list of alternatives, and only prints the path to the first alternative found in the path.  If none is found, it prints an error (to stderr!)
       and exits with an error code.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

USAGE
        whiff <command ... >
