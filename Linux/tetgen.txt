NAME
       tetgen — A Quality Tetrahedral Mesh Generator

SYNOPSIS
       tetgen [-pq__a__AriYMS__T__dzjo_fengGOJBNEFICQVvh]  file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tetgen command. Full documentation is available online: http://tetgen.berlios.de/

       tetgen  generates the Delaunay tetrahedralization, Voronoi diagram, and convex hull for three-dimensional point sets, generates the constrained Delaunay tetrahedralizations and quality tetrahedral
       meshes for three-dimensional domains with piecewise linear boundary.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the online documentation.

       -p        Tetrahedralizes a picecwise linear complex (.poly or .smesh file).

       -q        Quality mesh generation. A minimum radius-edge ratio may be specifyed (default 2.0).

       -a        Applies a maximum tetrahedron volume constraint.

       -A        Assigns attributes to identify tetrahedra in certain regions.

       -r        Reconstructs/Refines a previously generated mesh.

       -Y        Suppresses boundary facets/segments splitting.

       -i        Inserts a list of additional points into mesh.

       -M        Does not merge coplanar facets.

       -T        Set a tolerance for coplanar test (default 1e-8).

       -d        Detect intersections of PLC facets.

       -z        Numbers all output items starting from zero.

       -j        Jettison unused vertices from output .node file.

       -o2       Generates second-order subparametric elements.

       -f        Outputs faces (including non-boundary faces) to .face file.

       -e        Outputs subsegments to .edge file.

       -n        Outputs tetrahedra neighbors to .neigh file.

       -g        Outputs mesh to .mesh file for viewing by Medit.

       -G        Outputs mesh to .msh file for viewing by Gid.

       -O        Outputs mesh to .off file for viewing by Geomview.

       -B        Suppresses output of boundary information.

       -N        Suppresses output of .node file.

       -E        Suppresses output of .ele file.

       -F        Suppresses output of .face file.

       -I        Suppresses mesh iteration numbers.

       -C        Checks the consistency of the final mesh.

       -Q        Quiet: No terminal output except errors.

       -V        Verbose: Detailed information on what I'm doing.

       -v        Prints the version information.

       -h        Help: A brief instruction for using TetGen.

EXAMPLES
       The wing is described in two files: wing.node and wing.poly.  The command line:

       tetgen -pq wing

       generates the quality mesh in three files: wing.1.node, wing.1.ele, and wing.1.face.

       Default, the radius-edge ratio of each tetrahedron is bounded below 2.0.  You can impose a tight bound by adding a number directly after the '-q' switch. Like this:

       tetgen -pq1.2 wing

       generates a quality mesh which have more points inserted than the mesh created in above.

       See http://tetgen.berlios.de/switches.examples.html for more examples.
