NAME
       ccecho - ccecho (conditional color echo) lets you use colored output for STDOUT while using regular output for log files, pipes and scripts

SYNOPSIS
       ccecho LEVEL MESSAGE

DESCRIPTION
       Prints a colored message string to STDOUT or STDERR using bash color codes. The color and the output channel depend on the LEVEL keyword. When the SHELL
       environment variable COLOR is set to either "0" or "no" no color output is generated.

       The main purpose of this script is to provide an easy method to generate colored output when the output should go to STDOUT, and regular output (using echo
       -e) for log files, pipes and scripts (by exporting COLOR=0).

PARAMETERS
       ccecho takes two parameters, both are mandatory:

   LEVEL
       Determines which color is used. Must be used as the first parameter. Is ignored, when the ebvironment variable COLOR is set to "0" or "no".

           error   ->  bold red, STDERR
           info    ->  purple, STDOUT
           normal  ->  no color, STDOUT
           result  ->  green, STDOUT
           warn    ->  red, STDERR

   MESSAGE
       The message to be printed. Needs to be quoted using double quotes. You may use sequences supported by echo (1) such as \n to insert a newline and \t to
       insert a tab.

ENVIRONMENT
       COLOR
           When set to "0" or "no", ccecho will act as plain echo -e doing no colored output.
