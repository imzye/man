NAME
       gen - program to generate test files of radio transmission modulation

SYNOPSIS
       gen [options] output_file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gen
       command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       multimon is a program that decodes radio transmissions, gen generates modulated files suitable for decoding with multimon.

OPTIONS
       -t <type>
              output file type (any other type than raw requires sox).
              allowed types: raw aiff au hcom sf voc cdr dat smp wav maud vwe

       -a <ampl>
              amplitude.

       -d <str>
              encode DTMF string.

       -z <str>
              encode ZVEI string.

       -s <freq>
              encode sine of given frequency.

       -p <text>
              encode hdlc packet using specified text.

EXAMPLE
       Create a file /tmp/message.wav containing sound samples of packet radio message:
       gen -p "This is a message." -t raw /tmp/message.wav

       To dial a number directly to the sound card output:
       gen -d 8675309
