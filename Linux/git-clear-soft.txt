NAME
       git-clear-soft - Soft clean up a repository

SYNOPSIS
       git-clear-soft

DESCRIPTION
       Clears  the  repository  to  a state that it looks as if it was freshly
       cloned with the current HEAD, however, preserving all changes that  are
       located  in  files  and  directories  listed  in  .gitignore.  It  is a
       git-reset --hard together with deletion of  all  untracked  files  that
       reside inside the working directory, excluding those in .gitignore.
