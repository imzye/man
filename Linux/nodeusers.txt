NAME
       nodeusers - URONode user information lookup program

SYNOPSIS
       nodeusers [-a] [-i] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
       Nodeusers displays information about current URONode users.

OPTIONS
       -a        Tells nodeusers to use a plain <CR> as end-of-line. This is useful if nodeusers is called from ax25d.

       -i        Tells  nodeusers  to  use a <CR><LF> pair as end-of-line sequence and also to wait for one line of input before sending the user data. This should be used if nodeusers is used in an internet
                 environment (eg. as a fingerd replacement).

       -l        Enables logging of errors to the system logging facility.

FILES
       /var/ax25/node/loggedin
            Database of current users.
