NAME
       aps2file — printing to a file via apsfilter

SYNOPSIS
       aps2file [-D] [-Pqueue] [-Zoptions] [-ooutput] [input]
       aps2file [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       With aps2file you can direct the printer data generated by apsfilter(1) into an arbitrary file without the use of a spooler.

OPTIONS
       -h          show help screen
       -D          enable debug mode
       -Pqueue     select a printer queue (different from the default one)
       -Zoptions   use apsfilter command line options (comma-separated list)
       -ooutput    direct data stream to output (default: stdout)
       input       read data from input (default: stdin)

       Unlike printing with lpr(1), you can only use one input file at a time.

       Using  aps2file  is  also  the recommended way to create a debugging log of a failed printing attempt. If you include the -D flag, the apsfilter shell script will log every command and print it to
       stderr.  To save the output for inclusion into a bug report, you should therefore use a command of the sort
             aps2file -D -o /dev/null [-P...] [-Z...] [input] 2> log.txt

NOTES
       aps2file only works correctly with entries in /etc/printcap that have been created by /usr/share/apsfilter/SETUP.

FILES
       /etc/printcap                       printer capability data base
       /usr/share/apsfilter/bin/apsfilter  apsfilter script

BUGS
       See apsfilter software center - http://www.apsfilter.org/ - for new versions, bugfixes and known bugs.

       Please use the new tool apsfilter-bug(1) to release bug- or problem reports. It automatically presents you a form in an editor window which asks you some standard questions.  If you save and  quit
       the editor session, then this report is sent automatically via e-mail to the proper apsfilter mailinglist.

       If  apsfilter  fails to print something or prints it in a way you wouldn't expect and you want to report an apsfilter error then please save the debugging output of one print session using the new
       aps2file(1) utility by typing aps2file -D -Z options file > /dev/null 2> file.debug and including the debugging output in the file file.debug into the edit session of the apsfilter-bug utility, so
       that it is included into the mail to the apsfilter mailinglist.

       Please note that you need to run /bin/sh (Bourne Shell), bash or a compatible shell, so that the above mentioned output redirection works. Under C-shell (/bin/csh) or tcsh it would't work. If  you
       don't know, then simply make sure you use the Bournce shell by typing /bin/sh or bash, then you should have no problems with redirection of stdout and stderr (> /dev/null 2> file.debug).
