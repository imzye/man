NAME
       aevol - an in silico experimental evolution platform

SYNOPSIS
       aevol_misc_lineage -h | --help
       aevol_misc_lineage -V | --version
       aevol_misc_lineage [-i INDEX | -r RANK] [-b GENER1] -e GENER2

DESCRIPTION
       Aevol  is  a simulation platform that allows one to let populations of digital organisms evolve in different conditions and study experimentally the mechanisms responsible for the structuration of the
       genome and the transcriptome.

       aevol_misc_lineage
              allows for the reconstruction of the lineage of a given individual. Requires the tree to have been recorded during evolution.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              print help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -i, --index INDEX
              specify the index (ID in current generation) of the individual whose lineage is to be reconstructed

       -r, --rank RANK
              specify the rank of the individual whose lineage is to be reconstructed

       -b, --begin GENER
              specify the generation up to which the lineage is to be reconstructed

       -e, --end GENER
              specify the generation of the individual whose lineage is to be reconstructed
