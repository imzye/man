NAME
       kcapi_akcipher_stream_update - send more data for processing (stream)

SYNOPSIS

       ssize_t kcapi_akcipher_stream_update(struct kcapi_handle * handle, struct iovec * iov, size_t iovlen);

ARGUMENTS
       handle
           [in] cipher handle

       iov
           [in] scatter/gather list with data to be processed by the cipher operation.

       iovlen
           [in] number of scatter/gather list elements.

DESCRIPTION
       Using this function call, more data can be submitted to the kernel.

       This function may cause the caller to sleep if the kernel buffer holding the data is getting full. The process will be woken up once more buffer space becomes available by calling
       kcapi_akcipher_stream_op.

NOTE
       with the separate API calls of kcapi_akcipher_stream_update and kcapi_akcipher_stream_op a multi-threaded application can be implemented where one thread sends data to be processed and one thread
       picks up data processed by the cipher operation.

WARNING
       The memory referenced by iov is not accessed by the kernel during this call. The memory is first accessed when kcapi_cipher_stream_op is called. Thus, you MUST make sure that the referenced memory
       is still present at the time kcapi_cipher_stream_op is called.

       return number of bytes sent to the kernel upon success; a negative errno-style error code if an error occurred
