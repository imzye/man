NAME
       pvfs2-validate – recursively check a directory or file for problems

SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-validate [-Vvharsfc] -d pvfs2_directory

DESCRIPTION
       The pvfs2-validate utility checks for various problems in the file sys‐
       tem.

       The options are as follows:

       -h     Display synopsis.

       -d     Specifies the directory or file to check.

       -c     Check for stranded objects.  This requires that -d refers to the
              root directory.

       -s     Check for bad practice in symbolic links.

       -f     Check for bad practice in object names.

       -F     Stop after confirming consistent configuration.

       -V     Display verbose messages.

       -v     Print version number and exit.

       -a     (NOT IMPLEMENTED) Fix all problems found.

       -r     (NOT IMPLEMENTED) Run in interactive mode.

              pvfs2-set-debugmask(1).

EXIT STATUS
       The pvfs2-check-server utility exits 0 on success and with the  sum  of
       the following conditions on failure: 1 if file system errors corrected,
       2 if the system should be rebooted, and 4 if file  system  errors  were
       not corrected.
