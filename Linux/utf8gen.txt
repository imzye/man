UTF8GEN(1)                                                                                General Commands Manual                                                                                UTF8GEN(1)

NAME
       utf8gen - Generate UTF-8 output from hexadecimal input

SYNOPSIS
       utf8gen [ [-e format1] | [-E format2] ] [-r formatr]
               [ [-u utf8_format] | -n] [-c] [-s]
               [-i input_file] [-o output_file]

DESCRIPTION
       utf8gen reads a list of hexadecimal ASCII values in the range 0 through 10FFFF, one per line, and prints the UTF-8 encoding of that number as a Unicode code point.

       Each input line must begin with a hexadecimal number.  A string may follow after that, which can be echoed to the output as the "remainder" (see the -r option below).  The total input line length,
       including an ending newline, is limited to 4096 bytes.

OPTIONS
       -c    After the UTF-8 codes are printed, print a space followed by the character that the hexadecimal code point represents.

       -e    Echo the input code point in one format, using the printf(3) format string format1.

       -E    Echo the input code point in two formats, using the printf(3) format string format2.

       -n    Do not print the UTF-8 byte values.  This can be useful if only the printed character itself is desired; see the -c option.

       -r    Print the remainder of the input string after the initial hexadecimal digits, using the printf(3) format string formatr.

       -s    Swap the order of output: print the UTF-8 output portion first, then print the input string portion.  This can be useful for generating code containing a UTF-8 encoding followed by a comment
             that contains the input hexadecimal digits.

       -u    Print the UTF-8 encoded value of the input hexadecimal number, as numeric codes for each UTF-8 byte, using the printf(3) format string utf8_format.  If no string is specified, a default for‐
             mat of a backslash followed by three octal digits is printed for each byte.

EXAMPLES
                       utf8gen -e "0x%04X " -u "\%03o"

                       utf8gen -E "U+%04x = 0%02o = "

                       utf8gen -s -e "  /* U+%04X */" -u "\%03o"

FILES
       Files  contain lines that each begin with an ASCII hexadecimal code in the valid Unicode range 0 through 10FFFF, inclusive.  This hexadecimal code may optionally be followed by a space followed by
       an arbitrary string ending with a newline, up to the limit of 4096 bytes per input line.  An example line could be the following (with no indent):

              41 Letter 'A'
