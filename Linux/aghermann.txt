NAME
            edfhed -- EDF header dumper/editor.

SYNOPSIS
            edfhed [OPTIONS] FILE.edf ...

DESCRIPTION
       edfhed is a terminal program to view the header of EDF files (with option -b, or without any options), or modify fields in the header (see options -s, -T and -R).

       -b, --no-channels
              Only dump general header fields (no channel details).

       -a, --with-annotations
              List embedded annotations if any.

       -R, --from-tree
              Given file location ‘Subject/Session/Episode.edf’, set recording_id to ‘Session/Episode’ and patient_id to ‘Subject’.

       -T, --from-mtime
              Set recording_date and recording_time fields to file modification date/time.

       -t, --touch-mtime
              Set file mtime to timestamp assembled from recording_date and recording_time fields (assuming local timezone).

       -s, --set=[CH:]FIELD:VALUE
              Set FIELD to VALUE (in channel CH if specified, as a 1-based integer index).

              Possible  general  fields  are: version_number, patient_id, recording_id, recording_date, recording_time, reserved (remember that the contents of this field is significant wrt EDF/EDF+ dis‐
              tinction).

              The version_number field must match the string "0      " for the file to be recognised as a valid EDF by edfhed.

              Channel fields: label, transducer_type, physical_dim, physical_min, physical_max, digital_min, digital_max, filtering_info, reserved.

              Direct field assignment done via --set option(s) will override any assignments effected by options -T or -R.

       -?, --help
              Give a brief options summary.

       --usage
              Display usage information.

       -V, --version
              Display version.

USE WITH AGHERMANN
       For Aghermann to be able to manage an EDF file, all relevant fields in its header must be filled out correctly, as follows:

       •      patient_id uniquely identifies the subject;

       •      recording_id identifies the recording session (out of several other such sessions, each containing the same series of episodes) and the individual episode.  These two items must  appear  in
              one of the following combinations:

           •      "Session/Episode"

           •      "Session : Episode"

           •      "Episode (Session)"

       •      recording_date and recording_time must (obviously) be both correct.

       •      Channel  labels  must  be a valid System 10-20 channel designation, i.e., "Nz", "Fp1", "Fpz", "Fp2", "AF7", "AF3", "AFz", "AF4", "AF8", "F9", "F7", "F5", "F3", "F1", "Fz", "F2", "F4", "F6",
              "F8", "F10", "FT9", "FT7", "FC5", "FC3", "FC1", "FCz", "FC2", "FC4", "FC6", "FCT8", "FT10", "A1", "T9", "T7", "C5", "C3", "C1", "Cz", "C2", "C4", "C6",  "T8",  "T10",  "A2",  "TP9",  "TP7",
              "CP5", "CP3", "CP1", "CPz", "CP2", "CP4", "CP6", "TP8", "TP10", "P9", "P7", "P5", "P3", "P1", "Pz", "P2", "P4", "P6", "P8", "P10", "PO7", "PO3", "POz", "PO4", "PO8", "O1", "Oz", "O2", "Iz",
              plus a few channels of other signal types: "Left", "Right", "Chin",

              optionally prepended by signal type ("EEG", "EOG", "EMG", "ECG", "ERG", "NC", "MEG", "MCG", "EP", "Temp", "Resp", "SaO2", "Light", "Sound", "Event", "Freq") and a space.
