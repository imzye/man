NAME
       Plack::Session::Cleanup - Run code when the environment is destroyed

SYNOPSIS
         $env->{'run_at_cleanup'} = Plack::Session::Cleanup->new(
             sub {
                 # ...
             }
         );

DESCRIPTION
       This provides a way for Plack::Middleware::Session to run code when the environment is cleaned up.

METHODS
       new ( $coderef )
           Executes  the  given  code reference when the object is "DESTROY"'d.  Care should be taken that the given code reference does not close over $env, creating a cycle and preventing the $env from
           being destroyed.
