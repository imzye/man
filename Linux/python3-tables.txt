DESCRIPTION
       Copy any Leaf, Group or complete subtree from a PyTables file into another file.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -h     Prints a help text.

       -v     Show more information.

       -o     Overwrite destination file.

       -R RANGE
              Select a RANGE of rows in the form start,stop,step during the copy of all the leaves.

       --non-recursive
              Do not do a recursive copy. Default is to do it.

       --dest-title=title
              Title for the new file (if not specified, the source is copied).

       --dont-copy-userattrs
              Do not copy the user attrs (default is to do it).

       --overwrite-nodes
              Overwrite destination nodes if they exist. Default is not to overwrite them.

       --complevel=(0-9)
              Set a compression level (0 for no compression, which is the default).

       --complib=lib
              Set the compression library to be used during the copy. lib can be set to "zlib", "lzo", "ucl" or "bzip2". Defaults to "zlib".

       --shuffle=(0|1)
              Activate or not the shuffling filter (default is active if complevel>0).

       --fletcher32=(0|1)
              Whether to activate or not the fletcher32 filter (not active by default).

       --keep-source-filters
              Use the original filters in source files. The default is not doing that if any of --complevel, --complib, --shuffle or --fletcher32 option is specified.

       --upgrade-flavors
              When repacking PyTables 1.x files, the flavor of leaves will be unset. With this, such a leaves will be serialized as objects with the internal flavor ("numpy" for 2.x series).

       --dont-regenerate-old-indexes
              Disable regenerating old indexes. The default is to regenerate old indexes as they are found.
