NAME
       tpm_mkaik - make a TPM Attestation Identity Key

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_mkaik [-zuhv] BLOB-FILE PUBKEY-FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The program generates a TPM Attestation Identity Key and stores it in the file BLOB-FILE.  The public key is stored in the file PUBKEY-FILE.  The public key is DER encoded.

       -z     Use the well known secret used as the owner secret.

       -u     Use TSS UNICODE encoding for passwords.

       -h     Display command usage info.

       -v     Display command version info.

BUGS
       Sometimes,  when  tpm_mkaik is invoked without the -z option, no password prompt appears.  As a work around, use tpm_changeownerauth to set the secret to the well known one, generate the key, and then
       use tpm_changeownerauth to set the secret to its original value.
