NAME
       evolution - groupware suite for GNOME containing e-mail, calendar, addressbook, to-do list and memo tools

SYNOPSIS
       evolution [OPTIONS] [MAILTO]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly introduces the evolution command.  Evolution is a graphical groupware suite, a single application for reading and sending e-mail and for managing calendars, address books,
       notes, to-do lists and memos.  It is written for the GNOME graphical desktop.

       An optional MAILTO expression can be specified, typically invoked from another application. An example MAILTO expression is `mailto:username@example.com`. This will open a new composer window with
       an empty e-mail to `username@example.com`. More advanced expressions are also supported, but should conform to RFC 2368.

       For a more detailed explanation of Evolution, please see the Help menu.
