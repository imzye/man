NAME
       gleExtrusion - Extrude arbitrary 2D contour along arbitrary 3D path.

SYNTAX
       void gleExtrusion (int ncp,
                       gleDouble contour[][2],
                       gleDouble cont_normal[][2],
                       gleDouble up[3],
                       int npoints,
                       gleDouble point_array[][3],
                       float color_array[][3]);

ARGUMENTS
       ncp       number of contour points

       contour   2D contour

       cont_normal
                 2D contour normals

       up        up vector for contour

       npoints   numpoints in poly-line

       point_array
                 polyline vertices

       color_array
                 colors at polyline verts

DESCRIPTION
       Extrude  arbitrary  2D  contour along arbitrary 3D path. The argument "contour" specifies the 2D contour to be extruded, while the argument "point_array" specifies the path along which to extrude.
       The vector "up" defines the orientation of the contour y-axis in real 3D space.

       Note that neither the very first segment, nor the very last segment are drawn. The first and last segments serve only to define the angle of the join at the very ends of  the  polyline.  Thus,  to
       draw one segment, three must be specified. To draw two segments, four must be specified, etc.

       The normal array may be NULL. If it is, normal vectors will NOT be automatically generated, and the object will look terrible when lit.

       The  color  array may be NULL. If NULL, the current color is used. If not NULL, the glColor3f() routine is used to set the color; therefore, specifying the glColorMaterial() subroutine before this
       primitive can be used to set diffuse, specular, ambient, etc. colors.
