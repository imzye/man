NAME
       hmmalign - align sequences to a profile HMM

SYNOPSIS
       hmmalign [options] <hmmfile> <seqfile>

DESCRIPTION
       Perform a multiple sequence alignment of all the sequences in <seqfile> by aligning them individually to the profile HMM in <hmmfile>.  The new alignment is output to stdout in Stockholm format.

       The <hmmfile> should contain only a single profile. If it contains more, only the first profile in the file will be used.

       Either <hmmfile> or <seqfile> (but not both) may be '-' (dash), which means reading this input from stdin rather than a file.

       The sequences in <seqfile> are aligned in unihit local alignment mode.  Therefore they should already be known to contain only a single domain (or a fragment of one).  The optimal alignment may assign
       some residues as nonhomologous (N and C states), in which case these residues are still included in the resulting alignment, but shoved to the  outer  edges.  To  trim  these  unaligned  nonhomologous
       residues from the result, see the --trim option.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

       -o <f> Direct the output alignment to file <f>, rather than to stdout.

       --mapali <f>
              Merge  the  existing alignment in file <f> into the result, where <f> is exactly the same alignment that was used to build the model in <hmmfile>.  This is done using a map of alignment columns
              to consensus profile positions that is stored in the <hmmfile>.  The multiple alignment in <f> will be exactly reproduced in its consensus columns (as defined by the profile), but the displayed
              alignment in insert columns may be altered, because insertions relative to a profile are considered by convention to be unaligned data.

       --trim Trim nonhomologous residues (assigned to N and C states in the optimal alignments) from the resulting multiple alignment output.

       --amino
              Specify that all sequences in <seqfile> are proteins. By default, alphabet type is autodetected from looking at the residue composition.

       --dna  Specify that all sequences in <seqfile> are DNAs.

       --rna  Specify that all sequences in <seqfile> are RNAs.

       --informat <s>
              Declare  that the input <seqfile> is in format <s>.  Accepted sequence file formats include FASTA, EMBL, GenBank, DDBJ, UniProt, Stockholm, and SELEX. Default is to autodetect the format of the
              file.

       --outformat <s>
              Specify that the output multiple alignment is in format <s>.  Currently the accepted multiple alignment sequence file formats only include Stockholm and SELEX.
