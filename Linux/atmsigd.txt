NAME
       atmsigd - ATM signaling demon

SYNOPSIS
       atmsigd [-b] [-c config_file] [-d] [-D dump_dir] [-l logfile] [-m mode] [-n] [-q qos] [-t trace_length] [-u uni_version] [[itf.]vpi.vci [input output]]
       atmsigd -V

DESCRIPTION
       atmsigd  implements  the  ATM  UNI signaling protocol. Requests to establish, accept, or close ATM SVCs are sent from the kernel (using a comparably simple protocol) to the signaling demon, which then
       performs the dialog with the network.

       Note that atmsigd is not able to accept or establish connections until the local ATM address of the interface is configured by ilmid or manually using atmaddr.

       The default signaling VC (interface 0, VPI 0, VCI 5) can be overridden on the command line by specifying a different PVC address.

       When overriding the default VC, optionally a pair of named pipes to use for communicating with the user of signaling can be specified. Normally, the kernel is the user of signaling and atmsigd opens a
       special socket for communication with it.

       If atmsigd is killed, all system calls requiring interaction with it will return with an error and set errno to EUNATCH.

OPTIONS
       -b     Run in background (i.e. in a forked child process) after initializing.

       -c config_file
              Use the specified configuration file instead of /etc/atmsigd.conf If an option is specified in the configuration file and on the command line, the command line has priority.

       -d     Enables (lots of) debugging output. By default, atmsigd is comparably quiet.

       -D dump_dir
              Specifies the directory to which atmsigd will write status and trace dumps. If -D is not specified, dumps are written to /var/tmp.

       -l logfile
              Write diagnostic messages to the specified file. The special name syslog is used to send diagnostics to the system logger, stderr is used to send diagnostics to standard error. If -l is absent,
              the setting in atmsigd.conf is used. If atmsigd doesn't specify a destination either, messages are written to standard error.

       -m mode
              Set the mode of operation. The following modes are available: user for the user side (the default), network for the network side (useful if you have two PCs but no switch), and switch for oper‐
              ation with a signaling relay in a switch.

       -n     Prints addresses in numeric format only, i.e. no address to name translation is attempted.

       -q qos Configures the signaling VC to use the specified quality of service (see qos(7) for the syntax).  By default, UBR at link speed is used on the signaling VC.

       -t trace_length
              Sets the number of entries that should be kept in the trace buffer.  -t 0 disables tracing. If -t is not specified, atmsigd uses a default of 20 trace entries.

       -u uni_version
              Sets  the  signaling mode. The following modes are supported: uni30 for UNI 3.0, uni31 for UNI 3.1, uni31+uni30 for UNI 3.1 with 3.0 compatibility, uni40 for UNI 4.0, and uni40+q.2963.1 for UNI
              4.0 with Q.2963.1 peak cell rate renegotiation.

       -V     Prints the version number of atmsigd on standard output and exits.

FILES
       /etc/atmsigd.conf        default configuration file
       /var/tmp/atmsigd.pid.status.version
                                default location of status dumps
       /var/tmp/atmsigd.pid.trace.version
                                default location of signaling trace dumps

DEBUGGING
       When receiving a SIGUSR1 signal, atmsigd dumps the list of all internal socket descriptors. With SIGUSR2, it dumps the contents of the trace buffer. If a dump directory was set, dumps are  written  to
       files  called atmsigd.pid.status.number and atmsigd.pid.trace.number, respectively, with number starting at zero and being incremented for every dump. If no dump directory is set, dumps are written to
       standard error.

       Dumps are also generated whenever atmsigd detects a fatal error and terminates. No attempt is made to catch signals like SIGSEGV.

BUGS
       The generation of traces is a comparably slow process which may already take several seconds for only 100 trace entries.  To generate a trace dump, atmsigd therefore forks a child process that runs in
       parallel to the signaling demon.
