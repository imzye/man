NAME
       C++-Annotations - Extensive tutorial about the C++ programming language

DESCRIPTION
       The C++ Annotations offer an extensive tutorial about the C++ programming language. It can be used as a textbook for C/C++ programming courses.

       This  document  is intended for knowledgeable users of C (or any other language using a C-like grammar, like Perl or Java) who would like to know more about,
       or make the transition to, C++. This document is the main textbook for Frank’s C++ programming courses, which are  yearly  organized  at  the  University  of
       Groningen, the Netherlands.

       The  C++ Annotations do not cover all aspects of C++, though. In particular, C++’s basic grammar, which is, for all practical purposes, equal to C’s grammar,
       is not covered. For this part of the C++ language, the reader should consult other texts, like a book covering the C programming language.

       The package offers the C++ Annotations in the following document formats:

       o      text

       o      Plain ascii text (cplusplus.txt);

       o      LaTeX, including a .dvi file (in the subdirectory latex/);

       o      PostScript (in the subdirectory ps/);

       o      Pdf (in the subdirectory pdf/);

       o      html (in the subdirectory html/);

       The postscript, pdf and LaTeX formats were constructed for two different paper-sizes: A4 and legal.

       Depending on your installation type, the documents may also appear in compressed forms (e.g., cplusplus.txt.gz, cplusplus.html.zip).
