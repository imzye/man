NAME
       yacas - Yet Another Computer Algebra System

SYNOPSIS
       yacas [OPTION] [FILE]

       yacas -i COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       Yacas  is  an  easy  to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses its own programming language designed for symbolic as
       well as arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library of scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations; new algorithms can be easily added to  the  library.
       Yacas comes with extensive documentation covering the scripting language, the functionality that is already implemented in the system, and the algorithms we used.

OPTIONS
       -d     print default scripts path and exit

       -p     plain (dumb-terminal) mode

       -c     do not print prompt

       -b     do not print banner

       -i COMMAND
