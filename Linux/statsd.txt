NAME
       statsd - Simple daemon for easy stats aggregation

DESCRIPTION (the original node.js-based statsd)
       A network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services (e.g.,
       "Graphite").

DESCRIPTION
       This is the Perl port of the node.js statsd server.  Please consult statsd documentation available at:

         https://github.com/etsy/statsd
