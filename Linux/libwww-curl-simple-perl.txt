       The head of the response.

   request
       The HTTP::Request object used to create this response.

   simple_ua
       The WWW::Curl::Simple instance that generated this request.

   easy
       The WWW::Curl::Easy object which created this response.

METHODS
   perform
       Performs the actual request through WWW::Curl::Easy. Used mostly in single request land. Will croak on errors.

   response
       Returns a HTTP::Response that represents the response of this object.

       Also sets request on the response object to the original request object.
