NAME
       pfsretime - Retime an animation stream from one frame-rate to another

SYNOPSIS
       pfsretime [--in-fps <fps> | --out-fps <fps>] [--speedup <factor>]

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  frame-rate  of  the  animation stream from the input-frame rate to the output frame-rate. Currently this is done by skipping or replicating frames. The command can be useful for creating
       time-lapse animations with temporal tone-mapping operators.

OPTIONS
       --in-fps <fps>, -i <fps>
              The frame-rate of the input animation stream in frames per second. Fractional numbers are supported. By default, the FPS tag in the stream is used. If the tag cannot be  found,  30  frames  per
              second is assumed.

       --out-fps <fps>, -o <fps>
              The frame-rate of the output animation stream in frames per second. Fractional numbers are supported. The default value is 30 frames per second.

       --speedup <factor>, -s <factor>
              How much faster (factor > 1) or slower (factor < 1) the output animation should run as compared with the input animation. The output frame-rate is kept the same as the input frame-rate.

EXAMPLES
       pfsin frame%04d.hdr | pfsretime -v -i 1 -o 30 | pfstmo_mantiuk08 | pfsout res/frame%04d.jpg

              Read  the  sequence of animation frames at 1 frame per second and output the sequence at 30 frames per second. This will replicate each input frame 30 times. The frames are then tone-mapped and
              stored in the res folder.
