NAME
       natsort - Natural sorting for shell

DESCRIPTION
       usage: natsort [-h] [--version] [-p] [-f LOW HIGH] [-F LOW HIGH] [-e EXCLUDE]

              [-r] [-t {int,float,real,f,i,r}] [--nosign] [-s] [--noexp] [-l] [entries ...]

       Performs a natural sort on entries given on the command-line.

       Arguments are read from sys.argv.

   positional arguments:
       entries
              The entries to sort. Taken from stdin if nothing is given on the command line.

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -p, --paths
              Interpret  the input as file paths. This is not strictly necessary to sort all file paths, but in cases where there are OS-generated file paths like "Folder/" and "Folder (1)/", this option
              is needed to make the paths sorted in the order you expect ("Folder/" before "Folder (1)/").

       -f, --filter LOW HIGH
              Used for keeping only the entries that have a number falling in the given range.

       -F, --reverse-filter LOW HIGH
              Used for excluding the entries that have a number falling in the given range.

       -e, --exclude EXCLUDE
              Used to exclude an entry that contains a specific number.

       -r, --reverse
              Returns in reversed order.

       -t, --number-type, --number_type {int,float,real,f,i,r}
              Choose the type of number to search for. "float" will search for floating-point numbers. "int" will only search for integers. "real" is a shortcut for "float" with --sign. "i" is a  synonym
              for "int", "f" is a synonym for "float", and "r" is a synonym for "real".The default is int.

       --nosign
              Do not consider "+" or "-" as part of a number, i.e.  do not take sign into consideration. This is the default.

       -s, --sign
              Consider "+" or "-" as part of a number, i.e. take sign into consideration. The default is unsigned.

       --noexp
              Do not consider an exponential as part of a number, i.e. 1e4, would be considered as 1, "e", and 4, not as 10000. This only effects the --number-type=float.

       -l, --locale
              Causes natsort to use locale-aware sorting. You will get the best results if you install PyICU.
