NAME
       aevol - an in silico experimental evolution platform

SYNOPSIS
       aevol_misc_extract -h | --help
       aevol_misc_extract -V | --version
       aevol_misc_extract [-r GENER | -p POP_FILE] [-t PHEN_FILE] [-s SEQ_FILE] [-g NUM_GU] [-b]

DESCRIPTION
       Aevol  is  a simulation platform that allows one to let populations of digital organisms evolve in different conditions and study experimentally the mechanisms responsible for the structuration of the
       genome and the transcriptome.

       aevol_misc_extract
              extracts the genotype and/or data about the phenotype of individuals in the provided population and write them into text files easy to parse with e.g. matlab.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              print help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -r GENER
              read generation GENER from a full aevol backup

       -p POP_FILE
              read the population saved in population file POP_FILE

       -t PHEN_FILE
              extract and save some infos about the phenotypes of the individuals to file PHEN_FILE

       -s SEQ_FILE
              extract and save the sequences of the individuals to file SEQ_FILE

       -g num_gu
              only treat this genetic unit (by default: treat all genetic units)

       -b
              only treat the best individual
