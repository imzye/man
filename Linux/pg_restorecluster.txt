NAME
       pg_restorecluster - Restore from a pg_backupcluster backup

SYNOPSIS
       pg_restorecluster [options] version cluster backup

DESCRIPTION
       pg_restorecluster restores a PostgreSQL cluster from a backup created by pg_backupcluster. The cluster will be newly created in the system using the name
       provided on the command line; this allows renaming a cluster on restore.  The restored cluster configuration will be updated to reflect the new name and
       location.

       The backup name passed must end in either .basebackup or .dump; usually this will be the full path to a backup directory in
       /var/backups/postgresql/version-cluster/ as reported by pg_backupcluster ... list.

       Basebackups are restored as-is. For dumps, pg_createcluster is used to create a new cluster, and schema and data are restored via pg_restore.

OPTIONS
       -d --datadir DIR
           Use DIR as data directory for the restored cluster (default per createcluster.conf, by default /var/lib/postgresql/version/cluster).

       -p --port N
           Use port N for restored cluster (default is next free port).

       -s --start
           Start cluster after restoring (default for restore from dump; off for basebackup restores).

           After the cluster has been started, ANALYZE is run on all databases.

       --archive
           Configure cluster for recovery from WAL archive. This sets restore_command to retrieve WAL files from backup/../wal.

       --pitr TIMESTAMP
       --recovery-target-time TIMESTAMP
           Additionally to setting restore_command, set recovery_target_time to TIMESTAMP for point-in-time recovery. Also sets recovery_target_action='promote'.

       --wal-archive DIR
           For archive recovery, read WAL from archive DIR (default is backup/../wal).

FILES
       /var/backups
           Default root directory for cluster backup directories.

       See pg_backupcluster(1) for a description of files.
