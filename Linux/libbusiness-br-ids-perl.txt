NAME
       Business::BR - Root for namespace of Brazilian business-related modules

SYNOPSIS
         use Business::BR; # does nothing, it is just a placeholder

DESCRIPTION
       This module is meant to provide a root for the namespace "Business::BR".  It is meant as a placeholder to reserve and explain how the namespace can be used.

       To see actual code, take a look at "Business::BR::*" modules

SEE ALSO
       The namespace has been chosen based on similar modules for other countries, like Business::FR::SSN which tests the French "Numéro de Sécurité Sociale", the "Business::AU::*"
       <http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Business%3A%3AAU&mode=module> and "Business::CN::*" <http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Business%3A%3ACN&mode=module> modules.
