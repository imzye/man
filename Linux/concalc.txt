NAME
       concalc - console calculator

SYNOPSIS
       concalc [options] "expression"

       concalc -m script "path"

DESCRIPTION
       concalc calculates the given input term and returns the result as text.  Please use will have problems with the shell interpretor. If you give concalc more than one expression, all expression will
       be put together.

CALCULATION SYNTAX

       square root and cubic root
              sqrt12 curt8

       trigonometric functions and logarithms
              sin3.64+ln5

       other roots
              fourth root of nine: 4root9

       differential calculation
              differential calculation of 2x^2-3x+3 at x=9: d/dx(2x^2-3x+3,9)

       integration
              integration of sinx+cosx between -1 and 3.2: integ(sinx+cosx,-1,3.2)

       set variables
              save the result of a calculation in variable A: 12*45/2->A

       recall variables
              multiply the saved value with 2: A*2

       use last result
              The last result is saved in the answer memory: ans+1

CONSTANTS
       e      euler constant

       pi     pi; example: sin(pi/2)

NUMBERS
       standard
              12.34

       with exponent
              12.23e-5

       complex
              12i-5

OPTIONS
       -o, --output [output length]
              The argument is a number between 2 and the maximal possible output length (normally 18).

       -m, --mode [calculator mode]
              The  mode can be std (default, normal scientific calculatons), base (for logic functions and base-n calculatons) or script (for executing scripts). In scripting mode, the last argument must
              be the path to the script file.

       -c, --complex
              This option enables complex numbers for the calculation. They are switched off by default.

       -b, --base [calculator base]
              The argument must be one of hex (hexadecimal), dec (decimal, default), oct (octal) and bin (binary). This option can only be used when -m base is set.

       -a, --angle [angle type]
              The argument must be one of deg (degrees), rad (radiant), gra (grade).

       -v, --version
              Output the version of Concalc.

       -h, --help
              Outputs a short help.

SCRIPTING
       The script interpreter of calc uses a C-like programming syntax.  The following command are supported.

       if expression

              if(condition)

                command for condition true;

              else command for condition false;

       while loop

              while(condition)

                command that is run while condition is true;

       for loop

              for(initialisation; condition; count-command)
                command that is run while condition is true;

       print command

              print( output to print out );

       getline command

              getline; // read a text line from stdin and returns this text

       getkey command

              getkey; // return the key pressed by the user
                      // blocks until the user presses any key

       keystate command

              keystate; // returns the key pressed by the user or 0 if no key was pressed
                        // nonblocking

       sleep command

              sleep( time in microseconds ); //Script is stops for the given time

       compare operators

              ==, != equal, unequal

              >=, <=, >, < greather or equal, less or equal, greather, less

       set operators

              -> calculator set operator

              = C-like set operator

       type converting

              (float) floating point value

              (int) integer value

              (string) text value

              (bool) boolean value
