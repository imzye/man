NAME
     zck_delta_size — calculate the differences between two zchunk files

SYNOPSIS
     zck_delta_size [-v | --verbose] file1 file2
     zck_delta_size -? | --help | --usage | --version

DESCRIPTION
     The zck_delta_size utility examines two zchunk compressed files and determines how similar they are: how many chunks are the same between the files, so that tools like e.g.  rsync(1) or zckdl(1) could
     only transfer the small parts that differ instead of the full files.  This is especially useful for structured files that have been compressed using the zck(1) tool's -s (--split) option.

     The zck_delta_size utility accepts the following optional arguments:

     -v, --verbose
             Verbose operation; display some diagnostic output.

     -?, --help
             Display program usage information and exit.

     --usage
             Display brief program usage information and exit.

     --version
             Display program version information and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     The zck_delta_size utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Examine two zchunk files:

           zck_delta_size doc1.txt.zck doc2.txt.zck
