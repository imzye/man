NAME
       dh_acc - abi-compliance-checker dump generator and comparison

SYNOPSIS
       dh_acc [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_acc is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating abi-complinace-checker dumps and comparing them with a 'base' dump at build time.  This facilitates monitoring and early detection
       of API/ABI brekage.

FILES
       debian/package.acc
           Any  abi-compiance-checker  acceptable  library  and  header  descriptor.  To  generate a stub XML template, use abi-compliance-checker -d. Alternatively one can simply specify a list headers,
           libraries, or directories. Please note, these should be specified relative to source package root directory, e.g. ./debian/tmp/usr/lib/, ./build-2.7/ etc.

       debian/package.abi.tar.gz
           This is a base API/ABI one wishes to stay compatible with. The newly generated API/ABI dump will be compared with this one, if available.

SEE ALSO

       This program is a part of debhelper.
