NAME
       clipbrowse - Load a URL from the clipboard into your browser.

VERSION
       version 0.26

USAGE
       # ...copy something # (You might want to do a `clipjoin` if the URL
       text is messy) $ clipbrowse

       Remember that many browsers will usefully load things that don't look
       like URL's. For example Firefox does a Google "I'm feeling lucky" with
       non-URLs.  This means you can have any text in your clipboard and
       `clipbrowse`.

MOTIVATION
       It saves a couple of seconds every time you run it.  Chrome and
       Firefox, for examples, automatically create a new tab and loads the
       page when you invoke it from the command line.  Already we've saved a
       Ctrl+T and a Shift+Insert.  When you consider the parallelizing (that
       your browser will be actively loading the page while you're Alt+Tabbing
       to it), you've squeaked out a little more.

       Maybe I'm just a freak, but I like shaving out wasted time like that.

CONFIGURATION
       The environment variable $BROWSER will override the default launching
       command.  If you have a %s in the line, it will be replaced with the
       url.  if not, the url will be appended at the end.

       The default is `chromium-browser "%s"` (Debian's Google Chrome) If you
       still use Firefox, consider: `firefox -remote "openURL(%s,new-tab)"'`.
