NAME
       mimeexplode - explode one or more MIME messages

SYNOPSIS
           mimeexplode <mime-msg-file> <mime-msg-file> ...

           someprocess | mimeexplode -

DESCRIPTION
       Takes one or more files from the command line that contain MIME
       messages, and explodes their contents out into subdirectories of the
       current working directory.  The subdirectories are just called "msg0",
       "msg1", "msg2", etc.  Existing directories are skipped over.

       The message information is output to the stdout, like this:

           Message: msg3 (inputfile1.msg)
               Part: msg3/filename-1.dat (text/plain)
               Part: msg3/filename-2.dat (text/plain)
           Message: msg5 (input-file2.msg)
               Part: msg5/dir.gif (image/gif)
               Part: msg5/face.jpg (image/jpeg)
           Message: msg6 (infile3)
               Part: msg6/filename-1.dat (text/plain)

       This was written as an example of the MIME:: modules in the MIME-parser
       package I wrote.  It may prove useful as a quick-and-dirty way of
       splitting a MIME message if you need to decode something, and you don't
       have a MIME mail reader on hand.
