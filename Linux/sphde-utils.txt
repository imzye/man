NAME
       sasutil - control program for libsphde project

SYNOPSIS
       sasutil [-h] [-v] [-p path] <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       The sasutil utility is used to control de libsphde share memory segments, showing its internal details (memory state/dump, lock/semaphores details, etc.), memory maps and reseting its internal
       state.

OPTIONS
       -v
           Prints the sasutil version.

       -h
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the available commands.

       -p
           Path to wherever libsphde segment is located. This also can be
           controlled by setting SASSTOREPATH environment variable. If not path is
           given, will use the current path.

COMMANDS
       The available commands are: stat, detail, reset, dump, remove, list, path, and map.

       stat
           Shows the overall memory statistics: total in use, total free, total
           uncommited, total region free, total region used, and anchor free space.

       detail
           Shows detailed information, dividing each statistic from stat
           command in memory block information.

       reset
           Resets the anchor semaphore (used to access the control shared memory
           segment), the allocated segments and all internal locks. This command
           is useful to reset the SPHDE state after an process finished with
           unexpected error (like a SEGFAULT).

       dump <address\:size>
           Dumps a list of <memory:size> where <memory> is a memory address in
           hexadecimal and <size> is decimal. The output is similar to
           hexdump utility called with '-C' option.

       remove
           Removed the allocated segments, internal locks and anchor semaphores from
           control shared memory segment).

       list
           List and dump in use shared memory blocks.

       path
           Shows the store path used (as indicated by SASSTOREPATH).

       map <pid>
           Shows the memory map (/proc/<pid>/maps) for PIDs indicates as aguments.
           Default is current process.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The sasutil command accepts te following environment variables:

       SASSTOREPATH
           Defines the path to search for the store segment to attach and analyze.
