       RhumbSolve [ -i | -L lat1 lon1 azi12 ] [ -e a f ] [ -d | -: ] [ -w ] [
       -p prec ] [ -s ] [ --comment-delimiter commentdelim ] [ --version | -h

DESCRIPTION
       The path with constant heading between two points on the ellipsoid at
       (lat1, lon1) and (lat2, lon2) is called the rhumb line or loxodrome.
       Its length is s12 and the rhumb line has a forward azimuth azi12 along
       its length.  Also computed is S12 is the area between the rhumb line
       from point 1 to point 2 and the equator; i.e., it is the area, measured
       counter-clockwise, of the geodesic quadrilateral with corners
       (lat1,lon1), (0,lon1), (0,lon2), and (lat2,lon2).  A point at a pole is
       treated as a point a tiny distance away from the pole on the given line
       of longitude.  The longitude becomes indeterminate when a rhumb line
       passes through a pole, and RhumbSolve reports NaNs for the longitude
       and the area in this case.

       NOTE: the rhumb line is not the shortest path between two points; that
       is the geodesic and it is calculated by GeodSolve(1).

       RhumbSolve operates in one of three modes:

       1.  By default, RhumbSolve accepts lines on the standard input
           containing lat1 lon1 azi12 s12 and prints lat2 lon2 S12 on standard
           output.  This is the direct calculation.

       2.  With the -i command line argument, RhumbSolve performs the inverse
           calculation.  It reads lines containing lat1 lon1 lat2 lon2 and
           prints the values of azi12 s12 S12 for the corresponding shortest
           rhumb lines.  If the end points are on opposite meridians, there
           are two shortest rhumb lines and the east-going one is chosen.

       3.  Command line arguments -L lat1 lon1 azi12 specify a rhumb line.
           RhumbSolve then accepts a sequence of s12 values (one per line) on
           standard input and prints lat2 lon2 S12 for each.  This generates a
           sequence of points on a rhumb line.

OPTIONS
       -i  perform an inverse calculation (see 2 above).

       -L lat1 lon1 azi12
           line mode (see 3 above); generate a sequence of points along the
           rhumb line specified by lat1 lon1 azi12.  The -w flag can be used
           to swap the default order of the 2 geographic coordinates, provided
           that it appears before -L.  (-l is an alternative, deprecated,
           spelling of this flag.)

       -e a f
           specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, a and the
           flattening, f.  Setting f = 0 results in a sphere.  Specify f < 0
           for a prolate ellipsoid.  A simple fraction, e.g., 1/297, is
           allowed for f.  By default, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used, a =
           6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563.

       -d  output angles as degrees, minutes, seconds instead of decimal
           degrees.

       -:  like -d, except use : as a separator instead of the d, ', and "
           delimiters.

       -w  on input and output, longitude precedes latitude (except that on
           input this can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, N, S, E,
           W).

       -p prec
           set the output precision to prec (default 3); prec is the precision
           relative to 1 m.  See "PRECISION".

       -s  By default, the rhumb line calculations are carried out exactly in
           terms of elliptic integrals.  This includes the use of the addition
           theorem for elliptic integrals to compute the divided difference of
           the isometric and rectifying latitudes.  If -s is supplied this
           divided difference is computed using Krueger series for the
           transverse Mercator projection which is only accurate for |f| <
           0.01.  See "ACCURACY".

       --comment-delimiter commentdelim
           set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g., "#" or "//").  If
           set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if
           found, the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior
           to processing and subsequently appended to the output line
           (separated by a space).

       --version
           print version and exit.

       -h  print usage and exit.

       --help
           print full documentation and exit.

       --input-file infile
           read input from the file infile instead of from standard input; a
           file name of "-" stands for standard input.

       --input-string instring
           read input from the string instring instead of from standard input.
           All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a
           semicolon) in instring are converted to newlines before the reading
           begins.

       --line-separator linesep
           set the line separator character to linesep.  By default this is a
           semicolon.

       --output-file outfile
           write output to the file outfile instead of to standard output; a
           file name of "-" stands for standard output.

INPUT
       RhumbSolve measures all angles in degrees, all lengths (s12) in meters,
       and all areas (S12) in meters^2.  On input angles (latitude, longitude,
       azimuth, arc length) can be as decimal degrees or degrees, minutes,
       seconds.  For example, "40d30", "40d30'", "40:30", "40.5d", and 40.5
       are all equivalent.  By default, latitude precedes longitude for each
       point (the -w flag switches this convention); however on input either
       may be given first by appending (or prepending) N or S to the latitude
       and E or W to the longitude.  Azimuths are measured clockwise from
       north; however this may be overridden with E or W.

       For details on the allowed formats for angles, see the "GEOGRAPHIC
       COORDINATES" section of GeoConvert(1).

PRECISION
       prec gives precision of the output with prec = 0 giving 1 m precision,
       prec = 3 giving 1 mm precision, etc.  prec is the number of digits
       after the decimal point for lengths.  For decimal degrees, the number
       of digits after the decimal point is prec + 5.  For DMS (degree,
       minute, seconds) output, the number of digits after the decimal point
       in the seconds component is prec + 1.  The minimum value of prec is 0
       and the maximum is 10.

ERRORS
       An illegal line of input will print an error message to standard output
       beginning with "ERROR:" and causes RhumbSolve to return an exit code of
       1.  However, an error does not cause RhumbSolve to terminate; following
       lines will be converted.

ACCURACY
       The algorithm used by RhumbSolve uses exact formulas for converting
       between the latitude, rectifying latitude (mu), and isometric latitude
       (psi).  These formulas are accurate for any value of the flattening.
       The computation of rhumb lines involves the ratio (psi1 - psi2) / (mu1
       - mu2) and this is subject to large round-off errors if lat1 is close
       to lat2.  So this ratio is computed using divided differences using one
       of two methods: by default, this uses the addition theorem for elliptic
       integrals (accurate for all values of f); however, with the -s options,
       it is computed using the series expansions used by
       TransverseMercatorProj(1) for the conversions between rectifying and
       conformal latitudes (accurate for |f| < 0.01).  For the WGS84
       ellipsoid, the error is about 10 nanometers using either method.

EXAMPLES
       Route from JFK Airport to Singapore Changi Airport:

          echo 40:38:23N 073:46:44W 01:21:33N 103:59:22E |
          RhumbSolve -i -: -p 0

          103:34:58.2 18523563

       N.B. This is not the route typically taken by aircraft because it's
       considerably longer than the geodesic given by GeodSolve(1).

       Waypoints on the route at intervals of 2000km:

          for ((i = 0; i <= 20; i += 2)); do echo ${i}000000;done |
          RhumbSolve -L 40:38:23N 073:46:44W 103:34:58.2 -: -p 0
