NAME
       alevt-cap - simple capture of teletext pages

SYNOPSIS
       alevt-cap [options] ppp[.ss] ...

DESCRIPTION
       alevt-cap is a simple program to capture teletext pages and write them to disk.  You just give it a list of pages to fetch and it will save them.  Nothing fancy like time-outs, page ranges, or channel
       name detection is supported.  Though, it supports different file formats - at the moment ascii, ansi (ascii with color escape sequences), html, png, and ppm.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -name filename
              Gives the filename under which the pages should be saved.  It may contain a couple of %-sequences (see below).  (default: ttext-%s.%e)

       -format format-specifier
              Sets the file format used to save pages (see below).  (default: ascii)

       -format list|help
              Lists all known file formats and their options.

       -vbi device
              Use the given device name.  Default: /dev/vbi, /dev/vbi0, /dev/video0, /dev/dvb/adapter0/demux0 tried in this order.

       -finetune -4..4|auto
              Specify the fine tuning for the decoder.  For the right value play with alevt.  Default: 1.

       -timeout seconds
              If the pages cannot be captured in seconds, the program terminates with exit status 1 after saving the already captured pages.  The default is to wait forever.

       -charset latin-1|latin-2|koi8-r|iso8859-7
              Selects the character set to use.  Characters not present in the selected set are replaced by similar looking symbols.  (default: latin-1)

       -progname name
              Specifies the program name if using the DVB interface.

       -pid pid
              Specifies the teletext PID if using the DVB interface.

       --help Show summary of options.

       --version
              Show version of program.

       Every non-option argument is taken as a page number.  Subpages may be given in the form ppp.ss where ppp is the page number and ss is the subpage number.  If no subpage is specified, the first trans‐
       mitted subpage of that page is taken.  The page is saved with the prior given format and name.

   Filenames
       The filename may contain %-sequences.  The following sequences are defined:

              %%     a single % sign.

              %e     the default extension of the selected output format.

              %p     the page number and an optional subpage number.

              %P     the page number.

              %S     the subpage number.

              %s     the page number as given on the command line.

       Between the % sign and the letter you can give a field width to which the replacement string should be padded.

   Format specifiers
       The output format and associated options are given by the format specifier.  It is made up of one or more comma separated words.  The first word selects the output format and the others are options
       for that format.  There are common options valid for all output formats and format specific (private) ones.  Some options have the form of an assignment.  The order of the options is free.  Only the
       format name itself must be the first word.  An example:

       ansi,reveal,bg=none
              The ansi is the format and reveal, and bg=none are options.

       At the moment there are only two common options: reveal, and hide.  They control whether the hidden characters present in a page should be shown in the output or not.  The default is hide.

       The special format string list (or help) will give you a list of all supported output formats and their options.

       (The ansi format is an alias for ascii,color.)

       The -progname or -pid option specifies the program or teletext PID if using the DVB interface.

       If neither of these two options is used, alevt outputs informations about the currently accessible streams and uses the first of these PIDs as default. This output contains the PIDs and names that can
       be used as an input for the -progname or -pid option in the context of the currently chosen TV channel.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If the program timed out and some pages are missing the exit status is 1.  On fatal errors the exit status is 2.

NOTE
       Before starting this program, you have to set the TV channel with another program like xawtv of set-tv.

FILES

BUGS
       If you give a page number that is never transmitted the program will not terminate.
