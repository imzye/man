NAME
       pmsocks - shell wrapper for performance monitoring across firewalls

SYNOPSIS
       pmsocks path [args ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pmsocks  allows  Performance  Co-Pilot  (PCP)  clients running on hosts
       located on the internal side of a TCP/IP  firewall  to  monitor  remote
       hosts on the other side of the firewall.  This assumes the firewall has
       been configured with a compliant sockd daemon and the necessary  access
       controls are satisfied.

       pmsocks  is a thin shell wrapper around the tsocks(8) library using the
       tsocks(1) utility, which are not included with  PCP.   You  can  obtain
       tsocks from https://tsocks.sourceforge.net/.

FILES
       /etc/tsocks.conf
            configuration file for the tsocks(8) library.
