NAME
       sagan - Real-time System & Event Log Monitoring System

SYNOPSIS
       sagan [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the sagan command.

       sagan  is  a  multi-threaded,  real time system- and event-log monitoring system, but with a twist. Sagan uses a “Snort” like rule set for detecting malicious events happening on your network
       and/or computer systems.
       If Sagan detects a potentially bad event, that event can be stored to a Snort database (MySQL/PostgreSQL), send it to a SIEM tool like Prelude, or send an email.
       Sagan is meant to be used in a ‘centralized’ logging environment, but will work fine as part of a standalone Host IDS system for workstations.
