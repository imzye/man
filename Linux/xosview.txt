NAME
       xosview - X based system monitor

SYNOPSIS
       xosview [options]

DESCRIPTION
       xosview  is  a  monitor which displays the status of several system parameters.  These include CPU usage, load average, memory, swap space, network usage and more.  Each resource is displayed as a
       horizontal bar which is separated into color coded regions showing how much of the resource is being put to a particular use.

       xosview runs on several platforms (Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonflyBSD, some Solaris systems, IRIX 6.5, HPUX and GNU).  Not all of the meters described below are supported on  all  plat‐
       forms.   Some  of the meters may appear different depending upon the platform xosview is running on.  Note that *BSD is used as an abbreviation for all the supported BSD operating systems (NetBSD,
       FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonflyBSD).

OPTIONS
       Most of these command line options are just a convenient way to set one or more of xosview's resources.  Please see the RESOURCES section for more details on what the resource is for.

       -v
              Displays the version number.

       -name name
              Sets the Resource name xosview will use (same as the -name option for typical X applications like xterm).  When performing resource lookups, xosview will look under  name,  and  then  under
              ``xosview''.  For an example, perform the following (as documented in README.netbsd):
                       xrdb -merge Xdefaults.stipple

              prevent the shell from expanding ´*´ or from creating two separate arguments, ´xosview*memfreeColor:´ and ´purple´):
                     -xrm "xosview*memFreeColor: purple"

X RESOURCES
       The following is a list of X resources supported by xosview.  Each has a default value assigned to it.  These values can be found in the file Xdefaults which can be obtained in the source distrib‐
       ution of xosview.  They can be overridden in the usual places (/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XOsview, $HOME/.Xdefaults, etc.).

       It  should be noted that it is OK to have a resource defined for a port of xosview that does not support the feature the resource configures.  Xosview will simply ignore the resources that are set
       for it but not supported on a given platform.

       General Resources

       xosview*title: name
              The string that xosview will use for the X window title.  Normally xosview will use 'xosview@machine_name' for a title.  This resource overrides the default behavior.

       xosview*geometry: geometry_string
              This is a standard X geometry string that defines the size and location of the X window used by xosview.

       xosview*display: name
              The name of the display where xosview will contact the X server for drawing its window.

       xosview*pixmapName: name
              The filename of an X pixmap (xpm) file for use as a background image.

       xosview*captions: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display meter captions.

       xosview*labels: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display meter labels.

       xosview*meterLabelColor: color
              The color to use for the meter labels.

       xosview*usedlabels: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display labels that show the percentage of the resource (or absolute amount, depending on the meter) being used.  This option requires that the labels option  also
              be set to True.

       xosview*usedLabelColor: color
              The color to use for "used" labels.

       xosview*borderwidth: width
              The width of the border for the xosview window.

       xosview*font: font
              This is the font that xosview will use. This is a bitmap font rendered at the X server. To list the available fonts, use xlsfonts(1), and rehash the list with xset(1).

       xosview*background: color
              This is the color that will be used for the background.

       xosview*foreground: color
              This is the color that will be used for the foreground.

       xosview*enableStipple: (True or False)
              Change  to  true  to try stipple support.  This is primarily for users stuck with 1-bit monitors/display cards.  Try setting enableStipple true.  Please give us feedback on this, if you use
              it.  It needs some more work, but no one has given us any feedback so far.

       xosview*graphNumCols: number
              This defines the number of sample bars drawn when a meter is in scrolling graph mode. This also has the side-effect of defining the width of the graph columns. This is only used  by  meters
              which have graph mode enabled.

       Load Meter Resources

       xosview*load: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display a load meter.

       xosview*loadProcColor: color
              This is the color that the load meter will use to display the load average when it is below the warning threshold.

       xosview*loadWarnColor: color
              This is the color that the load meter will use once the load average is above the warning but below the critical load threshold.

       xosview*loadCritColor: color
              This is the color that the load meter will use once the load average is above critical load threshold.

       xosview*loadIdleColor: color
              The load meter will use this color to display the idle field.

       xosview*loadPriority: priority
              This  number  (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the load meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the meter 10 times per second
              (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       xosview*loadWarnThreshold: int
              This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the value at which the loadmeter changes its status and color from "normal" to "warning".  The default value is the number of processors.

       xosview*loadCritThreshold: int
              This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the value at which the loadmeter changes its status and color from "warning" to "critical".  The default value is  four  times  the  warning
              threshold.

       xosview*loadDecay: (True or False)
              You should probably leave this at the default value (False).  The load is already a time-averaged value!

       xosview*loadGraph: (True or False)
              If this is set to True then the load meter will be drawn as a horizontally scrolling bargraph showing the state value verses time.

       xosview*loadUsedFormat: (float, percent or autoscale)
              This resource tells xosview how to display "used" labels.  The formats work as follows:

              float:
                     Display the value as a floating point number.
              percent:
                     Display the value as a percentage of the total.
              autoscale:
                     Display the absolute value and automatically print the units (K, M, or G) as appropriate.

       xosview*loadCpuSpeed: (True or False)
              Display the current CPU speed in the load meter.

       CPU Meter Resources

       xosview*cpu: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display a cpu meter. On Linux, *BSD, Solaris and IRIX SMP machines, the resource cpuFormat defines how meters are created for multiple CPUs.

       xosview*cpuUserColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu user time field.

       xosview*cpuNiceColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu nice time field.

       xosview*cpuSystemColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu system time field.

       xosview*cpuInterruptColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu hard interrupt time field.

       xosview*cpuSInterruptColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu soft interrupt time field.

       xosview*cpuWaitColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu IO waiting time field.

       xosview*cpuGuestColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu virtualization guest time field.

       xosview*cpuNiceGuestColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu niced virtualization guest time field.

       xosview*cpuStolenColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu involuntary wait time field.

       xosview*cpuFreeColor: color
              The cpu meter will use this color to display the cpu idle time field.

       xosview*cpuPriority: priority
              This  number  (which  must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the cpu meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the meter 10 times per second
              (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       xosview*cpuDecay: (True or False)
              If True then the cpu meter will be split vertically in two.  The top half will show the instantaneous state, while the bottom half will display a decaying average of the state.

       xosview*cpuGraph: (True or False)
              If this is set to True then the cpu meter will be drawn as a horizontally scrolling bargraph showing the state value verses time.

       xosview*cpuUsedFormat: (float, percent or autoscale)
              This resource tells xosview how to display "used" labels.  The formats work as follows:

              float:
                     Display the value as a floating point number.
              percent:
                     Display the value as a percentage of the total.
              autoscale:
                     Display the absolute value and automatically print the units (K, M, or G) as appropriate.

       xosview*cpuFormat: (single, all, both or auto)
              If `single', only a cumulative meter for all CPU usage is created.  `all' creates a meter for each CPU, but no cumulative meter. `both' creates one cumulative meter and one  for  each  CPU.
              `auto' makes a choice based on the number of CPUs found.

       xosview*cpuFields: USED/USR/NIC/SYS/INT/SI/HI/WIO/GST/NGS/STL/IDLE
              The set of fields to show in Linux CPU meter instead of the default. Possible fields are:

              USED:
                     Combine  all used CPU time into one field. This is the sum of user, nice, system, soft and hard interrupts, guest, niced guest and stolen times.  None of these, except stolen, may be
                     defined together with `USED'.
              IDLE:
                     Time spent doing nothing. Includes I/O wait if it is not defined separately.
              USR:
                     Time spent in user mode processes. Includes nice, guest and niced guest if those are not defined separately.
              NIC:

              with the xosview distribution for details.

       xosview*netBandwidth: maxBytes
              This number is used to specify the expected maximum bandwidth (in bytes / sec) for the meter.  When the expected maximum bandwidth (maxBytes) is exceeded then the network meter will display
              the relative percentage of network usage (25% incoming, 75% outgoing).

       xosview*netIface: interface
              If False, xosview will display the data received/transmitted by any of the network interfaces. Otherwise, xosview will only display the data received/transmitted by  the  specified  network
              interface. If the name is prepended with '-' sign, the data in that interface is ignored.

              (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       xosview*netDecay: (True or False)
              If True then the net meter will be split vertically in two.  The top half will show the instantaneous state, while the bottom half will display a decaying average of the state.

       xosview*netGraph: (True or False)
              If this is set to True then the net meter will be drawn as a horizontally scrolling bargraph showing the state value verses time.

       xosview*netUsedFormat: (float, percent or autoscale)
              This resource tells xosview how to display "used" labels.  The formats work as follows:

       Serial Meter Resources

       xosview*serial(0-9): (True, False, or portBase)
              If True then xosview will display a serial meter for ttySx.  The portbase will be autodetected.  Because autodetection can fail, (if the port is locked by  ppp/slip  for  example)  you  can
              specify the portbase instead of "True".  If a portBase is used then xosview will use it instead of trying to autodetect.

              For this to work on Linux xosview needs to be suid root in order to have access to the ports.  See the file README.linux which comes with the xosview distribution for more details.

       xosview*serialOnColor: color
              This is the color the serial meter will use for bits that are set.

       xosview*serialOffColor: color
              This is the color the serial meter will use for bits that are not set.

       xosview*serialPriority: priority
              This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the serial meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the meter 10 times per second
              (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       Interrupt Meter Resources

       xosview*interrupts: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display an interrupt meter.

       xosview*intSeparate: (True of False)
              If True then xosview will display one interrupt meter per CPU on SMP machines. If False only one meter is displayed. Default: True.

              This is the color that will be used to show "active" interrupts.

       xosview*intOffColor: color
              This is the color that will be used to show "inactive" interrupts.

       xosview*intPriority: priority
              This  number  (which  must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the int meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the meter 10 times per second
              (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       Interrupt Rate Meter Resources

       xosview*irqrate: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display an interrupt rate meter.

              This is the color that will be used to show the interrupt rate.

       xosview*irqrateIdleColor: color
              The irqrate meter will use this color to display the idle field.

       xosview*irqratePriority: priority
              This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the irqrate meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the meter 10 times per  sec‐
              ond (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       xosview*irqrateDecay: (True or False)
              If True then the irqrate meter will be split vertically in two.  The top half will show the instantaneous state, while the bottom half will display a decaying average of the state.

       xosview*irqrateGraph: (True or False)
              If this is set to True then the irqrate meter will be drawn as a horizontally scrolling bargraph showing the state value verses time.

       xosview*irqrateUsedFormat: (float, percent or autoscale)

       Lm Sensors Resources

       xosview*lmstemp: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display a lmstemp meter.

       xosview*lmstempHighest: number
              Highest value displayed. If not given, or too small, the meter will adjust to fit actual and alarm values. Can be overridden for any meter with lmstempHighestN.

       xosview*lmstempActColor: color
              Color of actual value.

       xosview*lmstempHighColor: color
              Color above high alarm value, also used to indicate alarm.

       xosview*lmstempLowColor: color
              Color of actual value, when it is below low alarm value.

       xosview*lmstempIdleColor: color
              Color between actual and high alarm values.

              Name of input file from /proc/sys/dev/sensors/*/* or /sys/class/hwmon/*/{,device}/, N=1,2,3,... Can also be absolute path.  For example,
              xosview*lmstemp1: temp1
              xosview*lmstemp2: temp2_input

              Note:  Many sensors have the value and alarm threshold in files named "*_input" and "*_max"/"*_min", respectively. In such case, specifying the base name such as "temp1" here will be enough
              for having both files used.

              Note: If the same file name as lmstempN, lmshighN or lmslowN exists in other sensor directories, then lmsnameN needs to be specified, or absolute path used, to find the correct one.

       xosview*lmshighN: filename or number
              Optional high alarm value or name of file from /sys/class/hwmon/*/{,device}/, N=1,2,3,... Can also be absolute path. If not given, lmstempHighest is used as both maximum and high alarm. For
              example,
              xosview*lmshigh1: 70
              xosview*lmshigh2: temp1_crit_hyst

       xosview*lmslowN: filename or number
              Optional low alarm value or name of file from /sys/class/hwmon/*/{,device}/, N=1,2,3,... Can also be absolute path. Default is 0. For example,
              xosview*lmslow1: 1.5
              xosview*lmslow2: fan1_min

       xosview*lmsnameN: name
              Optional name of the sensor device to use when finding the filename(s) given in lmstempN, lmshighN and lmslowN. See /sys/class/hwmon/*/{,device}/name for the names of your sensors. This has
              no effect to files given as absolute paths. For example,
              xosview*lmsname1: nct6779

       xosview*coretempDisplayType: (separate, average or maximum)
              This resource tells xosview how to display the CPU temperature. The formats work as follows:

              separate:
                     Display one meter for each CPU core of a multi-core CPU. This is the default.
              average:

              maximum:
                     Display the highest core temperature of a multi-core CPU. On multi-socket machines, one meter per physical CPU is displayed.

       xosview*coretempPriority: priority
              This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the coretemp meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the meter 10 times per sec‐
              ond (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       xosview*coretempUsedFormat: (float, percent or autoscale)

       *BSD Sensor Resources

       xosview*bsdsensor: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display a bsdsensor meter.

       xosview*bsdsensorHighest: number
              Highest value displayed. If not given, or too small, the meter will adjust to fit actual and alarm values. Can be overridden for any meter with bsdsensorHighestN.

       xosview*bsdsensorActColor: color
              Color of actual value.

       xosview*bsdsensorHighColor: color
              Color above high alarm value, also used to indicate alarm.

       xosview*bsdsensorLowColor: color
              Color of actual value, when it is below low alarm value.

       xosview*bsdsensorIdleColor: color
              Color between actual and high alarm values.

       xosview*bsdsensorN:     name.type
       xosview*bsdsensorHighN: name.type
       xosview*bsdsensorLowN:  name.type
              These define where the actual value, high alarm value and low alarm value for meter N=1,2,3,... will be read from. The name is the sensor driver, and type is the wanted  value.  Both  alarm
              values are optional, and can also be given as static numerical values.

              You can find the correct pair for OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD with systat command, e.g.
              xosview*bsdsensor1:     it0.temp1
              xosview*bsdsensorHigh1: 100

              On  NetBSD, you can find the driver name with envstat command. Value name for the actual reading is typically 'cur-value' and for high alarm 'critical-max' and for low alarm 'critical-min',
              e.g.
              xosview*bsdsensor2:     coretemp0.cur-value
              xosview*bsdsensorHigh2: coretemp0.critical-max

              For all possible NetBSD value names, refer to envstat source code.

              FreeBSD has no usable sensor drivers as of version 9.0. However, ACPI thermal zones can be used by defining the sysctl node below hw.acpi.thermal, e.g.
              xosview*bsdsensor1:     tz0.temperature
              xosview*bsdsensorHigh1: tz0._CRT

              ACPI thermal zones can be used like this on DragonFly BSD as well.

       xosview*bsdsensorLabelN: string
              N-th label for above meters, default is SENN.

       xosview*bsdsensorHighestN: number
              Override default bsdsensorHighest for meter N.

       xosview*bsdsensorUsedFormatN: (float, percent or autoscale)
              Override default bsdsensorUsedFormat for meter N.

       xosview*bsdsensorPriority: priority
              This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the bsdsensor meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the  meter  10  times  per
              second (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       xosview*bsdsensorUsedFormat: (float, percent or autoscale)
              This resource tells xosview how to display "used" labels.  The formats work as follows:

       Battery Meter Resources

       xosview*battery: (True or False)
              If True then xosview will display a battery meter.  Linux users will need to have APM or ACPI support in their kernels for this to work.  For both APM and ACPI, xosview shows the status/sum
              of all batteries.  Additionally - the legend text gets changed/adjusted to reflect the current state (charging/low/critical/etc.) of the battery/batteries.

       xosview*batteryLeftColor: color
              This is the color that will be used to show the amount of battery power left.

       xosview*batteryUsedColor: color
              This is the color that will be used to show the amount of battery power used.

       xosview*batteryChargeColor: color
              This is the color that will be used as 'left' - if the batteries get charged.

       xosview*batteryFullColor: color
              This is the color that will be used as 'left' - if the batteries are fully charged.  APM and ACPI does provide this info, but not all machines actually do so.

       xosview*batteryLowColor: color
              APM only - the 'left' color that will indicate a low battery.  Depends on the machine - e.g. below 25% remaining capacity.

       xosview*batteryCritColor: color
              APM  case:  the 'left' color if APM indicates 'critical' state. (less than 5%) ACPI case: the 'left' color if the remaining capacity is below the alarm value.  (which can be set by the user
              in /proc/acpi/battery/BAT[01]/alarm )

       xosview*batteryNoneColor: color
              If no battery is present - or all batteries get removed (while on AC).

       xosview*batteryPriority: priority
              This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the battery meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the meter 10 times per  sec‐
              ond (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       xosview*batteryUsedFormat: (float, percent or autoscale)
              This resource tells xosview how to display "used" labels.  The formats work as follows:

              float:
                     Display the value as a floating point number.
              percent:
                     Display the value as a percentage of the total.
              autoscale:
                     Display the absolute value and automatically print the units (K, M, or G) as appropriate.

       Wireless Meter Resources

       xosview*wireless: (True or False)
              If  True then xosview will display the link quality of each wireless connection.  Note that the graph will *never* show up, if you don't have any wireless devices, or no wireless extensions

              This color will be used for the linux meter to show writes.

       xosview*diskReadColor: color
              This color will be used for the linux meter to show reads.

       xosview*diskPriority: priority
              This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of a second that the disk meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview update the meter 10 times  per  second
              (the fastest).  A value of 600 would cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.

       xosview*diskDecay: (True or False)
