NAME
       arcinfo - ARC Info

DESCRIPTION
       The arcinfo command is used for obtaining status and information of clusters on the grid.

SYNOPSIS
       arcinfo [options] [cluster ...]

OPTIONS
       -c, --cluster=name
              select one or more computing elements: name can be an alias for a single CE, a group of CEs or a URL

       -I, --infointerface=InterfaceName
              the computing element specified by URL at the command line should be queried using this information interface (possible options: org.nordugrid.ldapng, org.nordugrid.ldapglue2, org.nordugrid.ws‐
              rfglue2, org.ogf.glue.emies.resourceinfo)

       -g, --index=name
              select one or more registries: name can be an alias for a single registry, a group of registries or a URL

       -R, --rejectdiscovery=URL
              skip the service with the given URL during service discovery

       -S, --submissioninterface=InterfaceName
              only get information about executon targets which supports this job submission interface (e.g. org.nordugrid.gridftpjob, org.ogf.glue.emies.activitycreation, org.nordugrid.xbes)

       -l, --long
              long format (more information)

       -L, --list-configured-services
              print a list of services configured in the client.conf

       -P, --listplugins
              list the available plugins

       -t, --timeout=seconds
              timeout in seconds (default 20)

       -z, --conffile=filename
              configuration file (default ~/.arc/client.conf)

       -d, --debug=debuglevel
              FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE or DEBUG

       -v, --version
              print version information

       -?, --help
              print help

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The arcinfo command is used to get the status and information of clusters and queues available on the grid. You can specify the URLs of cluster with the --cluster option, or by just  listing  them  as
       arguments.   The  --index  flag can be used to specify an index server which should be queried for clusters. Both of these flags take a service endpoint as argument.  See arcsub(1) for a discussion of
       this format.

       Detailed information about queried computing services can be obtained by specifying the --long flag.

       When specifying the --index flag, the information about the computing services registered at the index server will be queried rather than the status of the index server itself.  Currently  no  command
       exists to query a index server.

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       X509_USER_PROXY
              The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard location. Note that this could also be set in the client configuration file, however the envi‐
              ronment variable overrides the settings in configuration.

       ARC_LOCATION
              The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not specified the install location will be determined from the path to the command being executed, and if this fails  a
              WARNING will be given stating the location which will be used.

       ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
              The  location  of  ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The default location is $ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc (\ in
              Windows).
