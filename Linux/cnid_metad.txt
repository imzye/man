CNID_METAD(8)                       3.1.12                       CNID_METAD(8)

NAME
       cnid_metad - start cnid_dbd daemons on request

SYNOPSIS
       cnid_metad [-d] [-F configuration file]

       cnid_metad -v | -V

DESCRIPTION
       cnid_metad waits for requests from afpd to start up instances of the
       cnid_dbd daemon. It keeps track of the status of a cnid_dbd instance
       once started and will restart it if necessary.  cnid_metad is normally
       started at boot time by netatalk(8) and runs until shutdown.

OPTIONS
       -d
           cnid_metad will remain in the foreground and will also leave the
           standard input, standard output and standard error file descriptors
           open. Useful for debugging.

       -F configuration file
           Use configuration file as the configuration file. The default is
           @pkgconfdir@/afp.conf.

       -v, -V
           Show version and exit.

CAVEATS
       cnid_metad does not block or catch any signals apart from SIGPIPE. It
       will therefore exit on most signals received. This will also cause all
       instances of cnid_dbd's started by that cnid_metad to exit gracefully.
       Since state about and IPC access to the subprocesses is only maintained
       in memory by cnid_metad this is desired behaviour. As soon as
       cnid_metad is restarted afpd processes will transparently reconnect.
