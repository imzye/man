NAME
       srf_index_hash - Adds a hash-table index to an SRF file.

SYNOPSIS
       srf_index_hash  [-c] srf_archive

DESCRIPTION
       srf_index_hash  adds and index to an SRF file or replaces an existing index with a new one. In the case of concatenated SRF files only the index at the end of a file will be replaced, but internal in‐
       dices will not be consulted by SRF tools.

       The index is a hash table indexing the sequence names only. The name itself does not appear in the index, rather the top 7-bits of a 64-bit hash key are held in the index along with N-bits used to de‐
       termine the hash bucket. This reduces the index size to around 10-15 bytes per sequence.

OPTIONS
       -c     Check only. This requests that the index is not produced, but the checks performed during the creation of an index (such as looking for duplicate sequence names) are still performed.
