NAME
       String::License::Naming - names of licenses and license naming schemes

VERSION
       Version v0.0.11

SYNOPSIS
           use String::License::Naming::Custom;

           my $obj = String::License::Naming::Custom->new( schemes => [qw(spdx internal)] );

           my $schemes = [ $obj->list_schemes ];  # => is_deeply [ 'spdx', 'internal' ]

           my $license = [ grep { /^(Expat|Perl)$/ } $obj->list_licenses ];  # => is_deeply ['Perl']

           # use and prefer Debian-specific identifiers
           $schemes = [ $obj->add_scheme('debian') ];  # => is_deeply [ 'debian', 'spdx', 'internal' ]

           $license = [ grep { /^(Expat|Perl)$/ } $obj->list_licenses ];  # => is_deeply [ 'Expat', 'Perl' ]

DESCRIPTION
       String::License::Naming enumerates supported licenses matching an ordered set of naming schemes, or enumerates the names of supported license naming schemes.

       Some licenses are known by different names.  E.g. the license "MIT" according to SPDX is named "Expat" in Debian.

       Some licenses are not always represented.  E.g. "Perl" is a (discouraged) license in Debian while it is a relationship of several licenses with SPDX (and that expression is recommended in Debian
       as well).

       By default, licenses are matched using naming schemes "[ 'spdx', 'internal' ]", which lists all supported licenses, preferrably by their SPDX name or as fallback by an internal name.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new
               my $names = String::License::Naming->new;

               my $spdx_names = String::License::Naming->new( schemes => ['spdx'] );

           Constructs and returns a String::License::Naming object.

           Takes an optional array as named argument schemes.  both ordering by which name licenses should be presented, and limiting which licenses to cover.

           When  omitted, the default schemes array "[ 'spdx', 'internal' ]" is used, which includes all supported licenses, and they are presented by their SPDX name when defined or otherwise by a semi-
           stable internal name.

           When passing an empty array reference, all supported licenses are included, presented by a semi-stable internal potentially multi-word description.

FUNCTIONS
       add_scheme
           Takes a string representing a license naming scheme to use, favored over existing schemes in use.

           Returns array of schemes in use after addition.

       list_schemes
           Returns a list of license naming schemes in use.

       list_available_schemes
           Returns a list of all license naming schemes available.

       list_licenses
           Returns a list of licensing patterns covered by this object instance, each labeled by shortname according to current set of schemes.
