NAME
       create_makefiles - Recreates all Makefiles beneath a directory

SYNOPSIS
       create_makefiles [dir]

DESCRIPTION
       create_makefiles recreates all Makefiles in dir and its (recursed) subdirectories from the corresponding Makefile.am templates.

       This script must be run from the toplevel directory (the one containing configure). This script saves time compared to re-running configure completely.

       If the source directory is different from the build directory (see the environment variables below), it will be assumed that each Makefile.am and Makefile.in belongs beneath the source directory and
       that each Makefile belongs beneath the build directory.

       This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.

ENVIRONMENT
       One of the following variables (but not both) should be set if the source directory is different from the build directory. If the build directory is simply a subdirectory of the source directory, the
       simpler variable OBJ_SUBDIR should be used.

       OBJ_SUBJDIR
           Indicates that the build directory is in the given subdirectory of the source directory. For instance, if the source directory is kdesdk and the build directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux, then
           OBJ_SUBDIR should be set to obj-i386-linux.

       OBJ_REPLACEMENT
           A sed expression that is used to transform the source directory into the build directory. For instance, if the source directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux, then OBJ_REPLACEMENT should be set to
           s#kdesdk#kdesdk-obj#.
