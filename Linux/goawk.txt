NAME
       goawk - POSIX-compliant AWK interpreter with CSV support

SYNOPSIS
       goawk [-F fs] [-v var=value] [-f progfile | 'prog'] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       goawk is a POSIX-compliant AWK interpreter written in Go. Additionally, it has some features not provided by POSIX AWK:

       •   Code coverage.
       •   Proper CSV and TSV support.
       •   Negative field indexes to access fields from the right.
       •   Single-quoted strings.

OPTIONS
       Standard AWK arguments:

       --csv
           Enable CSV input mode. Equivalent to -i csv.

       -F fs
           Use fs for the input field separator.

       -F progfile
           Read the AWK program source from progfile. Multiple -f options may be used.

       -v var=val
           Assign the value val to the variable var before the execution of the program begins.

       Additional GoAWK features:

       -c
           Use Unicode characters for index, length, match, substr, and %c.

       -E progfile
           Load program from progfile, disable var=val arguments, stop processing arguments, parse header row and enable @"field" in CSV input mode.

       -H
           Parse header row and enable @"field" in CSV input mode.

       -h,--help
           Show the help message and exit.

       -i mode
           Parse input into fields using CSV format, ignoring FS and RS.

       -o mode
           Use CSV output, ignoring OFS and ORS.

       -version
           Show GoAWK version and exit.

       GoAWK debugging arguments:

       -coverappend
           Append to coverage file instead of overwriting.

       -covermode mode
           Set coverage mode, where mode is set or count (default: set).

       -coverprofile file
           Write coverage profile to file.

       -cpuprofile file
           Write cpu profile to file.

       -d
           Print parsed syntax tree to stdout and exit.

       -da
           Print VM assembly instructions to stdout and exit.

       -dt
           Print variable type information to stdout and exit.

       -memprofile file
           Write memory profile to file.
