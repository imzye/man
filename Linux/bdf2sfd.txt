NAME
       bdf2sfd — BDF to SFD converter

SYNOPSIS
       bdf2sfd [-hv] [-f name] [-p name] font.bdf

DESCRIPTION
       bdf2sfd  is  a  BDF to SFD converter, allowing to vectorize bitmap fonts.  It works by converting each pixel of a glyph to a polygon, which produces large and unoptimized SFD files which should be
       post-processed using FontForge.

       If file is a single dash (`-'), bdf2sfd reads from the standard input.

       The options are as follows:

       -f name     Specify font name.

       -p name     Specify PostScript font name.

       -h          Display usage.

       -v          Display version.
