NAME

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the TeamGit commands.

       TeamGit is a visual tool for git.
        It provides a nice commit interface to git.

        TeamGit  aims to be easy to use and does not try to compete with more complete tools, like git-gui, which are often too complex. Its goal is simplicity, powerfulness and a same interface on all plat‐
       forms.

OPTIONS
       [Repository]
              Force TeamGit to use Repository as the starting path.
