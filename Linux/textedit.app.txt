NAME
       TextEdit - basic editor for GNUstep

SYNOPSIS
       TextEdit

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the TextEdit command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       TextEdit is a relatively basic text editor. It handles plain text or RTF, has a nice "Wrap to Page" mode, has search/replace functionality, and can display any file as text.

SEE ALSO
       open(1), GNUstep(7).
