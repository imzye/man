NAME
       apply-patch - apply a patch against the current directory, automatically detecting the patch strip level

SYNOPSIS
       apply-patch PATCHFILE|URL

DESCRIPTION
       apply-patch is a simply wrapper for the patch(1) utility.  It has two usability advantages over using patch(1) alone, in the simple case of applying a patch:

        1) it automatically detects the patch strip level (the -p parameter to patch(1))

        2) it takes the patch file in as a parameter, rather than as a stream on STDIN

       Note that PATCHFILE can also be an http or https URL, if you have the wget(1) utility installed.

SEE ALSO
       patch(1), wget(1)
