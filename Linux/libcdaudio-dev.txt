NAME
       libcdaudio-config - script to get information about the installed version of libcdaudio

SYNOPSIS
       libcdaudio-config [--prefix [=DIR] [--exec-prefix [=DIR] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       libcdaudio-config is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use libcdaudio. It is also used internally to
       the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf that are included with libcdaudio.

OPTIONS
       --version
              Print the currently installed version of libcdaudio on the standard output.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a libcdaudio program.

       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a libcdaudio program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
              If  specified,  use  PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that libcdaudio was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the
              exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that libcdaudio was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option must be  specified
              before any --libs or --cflags options.
