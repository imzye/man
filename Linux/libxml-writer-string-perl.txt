NAME
       XML::Writer::String - Capture output from XML::Writer.

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Writer;
         use XML::Writer::String;

         my $s = XML::Writer::String->new();
         my $writer = new XML::Writer( OUTPUT => $s );

         $writer->xmlDecl();
         $writer->startTag('root');
         $writer->endTag();
         $writer->end();

         print $s->value();

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a bare-bones class specifically for the purpose of capturing data from the XML::Writer module.  XML::Writer expects an IO::Handle object and writes XML data to the specified
       object (or STDOUT) via it's print() method.  This module simulates such an object for the specific purpose of providing the required print() method.

       It is recommended that $writer->end() is called prior to calling $s->value() to check for well-formedness.

METHODS
       XML::Writer::String provides three methods, "new()", "print()" and "value()":

       "$s = XML::Writer::String-"new([list]);>
           new() returns a new String handle.

       "$count = $s-"print([list]);>
           print() appends concatenated list data and returns number of items in list.

       "$val = $s-"value([list]);>
           value() returns the current content of the object as a scalar.  It can also be used to initialize/overwrite the current content with concatenated list data.

NOTES
       This  module  is designed for the specific purpose of capturing the output of XML::Writer objects, as described in this document.  It does not inherit form IO::Handle.  For an alternative solution
       look at IO::Scalar, IO::Lines, IO::String or Tie::Handle::Scalar.
