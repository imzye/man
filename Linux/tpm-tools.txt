NAME
       tpm_setclearable - disable TPM clear operations

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_setclearable [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm_setclearable reports the status of the TPM's flags regarding how the TPM can be cleared.  This is the default behavior and also accessible via the --status option. Requesting a report of this
       status prompts for the owner password.  The --owner option requests that the TPM disable clear operations (via the TPM_DisableOwnerClear API) disabling the owner from clearing out the ownership
       information.  This operation prompts for the owner password.  This operation is in effect until the current owner is cleared.  The --force option (via the TPM_DisableForceClear API) disables using
       Phyiscal Presence to authorize a clear operation.  This operation does not require authorization and will skip the owner password prompt.  This operation is only in effect until a reboot.

       -f, --force
              Disable use of Physical Presence for authorizating a clear operation until a reboot has occurred.
