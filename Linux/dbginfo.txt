NAME
       dbginfo.sh - collect runtime, configuration and trace information for debugging Linux on System z

SYNOPSIS
       dbginfo.sh [OPTIONS]
       dbginfo.sh {-h|-v}

DESCRIPTION
       This script collects runtime, configuration and trace information that can be used to debug a Linux on System z instance.  For Linux on z/VM, the script also
       traces information about the z/VM system.  The debug information is written to a file  /tmp/DBGINFO-<date>-<time>-<hostname>-<processorid>.tgz  where  [date]
       and [time] are the date and time when the debug data was collected. [hostname] indicates the hostname of the system the data was collected from. The [proces‐
       sorid] is taken from the processor 0 and indicates the processor identification.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print usage information, then exit.

       -v, --version
              Print version information, then exit.

       -d <DIRECTORY>, --directory <DIRECTORY>
              Specify the DIRECTORY where the data collection stores the temporary data and the final archive. The specified directory must already exist.  If  this
              parameter is not specified, /tmp is used by default.

FILES
       A .tgz file of the form

           DBGINFO-<year>-<month>-<day>-<hours>-<minutes>-<seconds>-<hostname>-<processorid>.tgz

       is generated and placed in the /tmp directory or in the directory specified by the -d option.

       Finalizing: Creating archive with collected data

       Collected data was saved to:
        >>  /data-collection/DBGINFO-2019-08-19-21-39-16-host-012345.tgz  <<
       Review the collected data before sending to your service organization.

HINTS
       Run the script with root authority.
       For Linux on z/VM, only z/VM guest virtual machines with class B privileges yield the complete debug information.
