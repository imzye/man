DESCRIPTION
       BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed  molecular
       clock  models.  It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC
       to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. Included is a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard analyses and a  suit
       of programs for analysing the results.

       This is no new upstream version of beast-mcmc (1.x) but rather a rewritten version.

OPTIONS

       -window Provide a console window

       -options Display an options dialog

       -working Change working directory to input file's directory

       -seed Specify a random number generator seed

       -prefix Specify a prefix for all output log filenames

       -statefile Specify the filename for storing/restoring the state

       -overwrite Allow overwriting of log files

       -resume Allow appending of log files

       -validate Parse the XML, but do not run -- useful for debugging XML

       -threads The number of computational threads to use (default 1), -1 for number of cores

       -java Use Java only, no native implementations

       -noerr Suppress all output to standard error

       -loglevel error,warning,info,debug,trace

       -instances divide site patterns amongst number of threads (use with -threads option)

       -beagle Use beagle library if available
