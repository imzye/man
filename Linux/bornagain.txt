NAME
       BornAgain - simulate and fit neutron and x-ray reflectometry and grazing-incidence small-angle scattering.

SYNOPSIS
       bornagain

DESCRIPTION
       BornAgain is an open-source research software to simulate and fit neutron and x-ray reflectometry and grazing-incidence small-angle scattering.

       Its name, BornAgain, alludes to the central role of the distorted-wave Born approximation in the physical description of the scattering process. The software provides a generic framework for
       modeling multilayer samples with smooth or rough interfaces and with various types of embedded nanoparticles.

       The command bornagain launches a graphical user interface that allows to create sample models and to run simulations.

       Alternatively, simulations, fits and visualizations can be steered through Python scripts, as described in the online documentation.
