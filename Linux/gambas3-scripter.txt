NAME
       gbs3 - GAMBAS Scripter.

SYNOPSIS
       gbs3 [options] [--] [<script file> | <project directory> | -]
       gbs3 --convert-project <source project directory> <destination script directory>
       gbs3 --convert-script <script file> [<Destination where project directory is created>]
       gbs3 [-p | --plugin] <script file> [<Destination directory where plugin is created>]

DESCRIPTION
       Gambas  is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions, a mix of Java(tm) and Visual Basic(tm).  With Gambas, you can quickly design your program GUI with Qt
       or GTK+, access database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQlite or ODBC databases, pilot applications with DBus, translate your program into many languages, create GStreamer, OpenGL or SDL  appli‐
       cations, and so on...

       gbs3 is the interpreter that allows you to compile and execute a Gambas script.
       gbs3 may also be used to convert a Gambas project to a script or a script back to a project.

OPTIONS
       -b, --buildonly
              process and compile the script without executing it

       -c, --nocache
              force the script compilation (do not check cache)

       --convert-project
              convert a Gambas project into an executable Gambas script file

       --convert-script
              convert a Gambas script file into a Gambas project

       -e     execute the source code provided by the command line ( ':' separator )

       -f, --fast
              use just-in-time compiler

       -g, --debug
              add debugging information to application

       -h, --help
              display help and exit

       -l, --list
              display a list of available Components or Libraries, '-l component' or '-l library'

       -L, --license
              display license

       -p, --plugin
              generate a plugin executable that can be loaded by other scripts

       -S --strict
              fail if 'Public' or 'Sub' are defined without a 'main' function otherwise create main()

       -t, --trace
              turn on tracing option during execution

       -T, --terse
              only print a very terse error report on compile errors

       -u, --use
              load component or libraries ('comp1,comp2,lib1...')

       -v, --verbose
              be verbose

       -V, --version
              display version

       -w, --warnings
              display warnings during compilation

PROJECT CONVERSION
       gbs3 can convert a Gambas project into an executable script file using the --convert-project option.  The input project directory is used to create the script which is written to the output script
       directory.  The script is created and named the same as the originating project.
       gbs3 MyProjectDirectory DestinationScriptDirectory

SCRIPT CONVERSION
       gbs3 can convert a script file to a full Gambas project using the --convert-script option.
       The  input  script is translated into a project by the same basename as the script and is created in the specified directory. In the case in which no output directory is specified, the environment
       variable PWD is used as the location to create the Gambas project.
       gbs3 MyScript.gbs ~/Projects
       This created the project 'MyScript' directory in the users 'Projects' directory.

PLUGINS
       gbs3 can create plugins that can be used by other scripts or Gambas applications after being built using the --plugin or -p option.  Plugins are created in a user-selected directory and  are  also
       executed  and  cached  in  this  directory,  unlike  a  normal script, in which executables are created in the temp directory and are executed from there.  This allows plugins to persist after the
       scripter exits.
       If no output destination is specified, then the plugin is created in the ~/.local/lib/gambas directory.  and may be loaded from there using the component.load() function.
       gbs3 MyPluginScript [Plugin Destination Directory]

EXAMPLE
       #!/usr/bin/env gbs3
       for i as integer = 0 to 10
         print i;;
       next
