NAME
       rstconv - The Free Pascal resource string converter tool.

SYNOPSIS
       rstconv [options] -o outfile

DESCRIPTION
       rstconv  reads  a  resource  string  file ( .rst ) that was produced by the Free Pascal compiler and outputs a file that can be used by an internationalization tool (currently only GNU gettext is sup‐
       ported) for internationalizing your application.

       -h (or --help)
              outputs a short help message.

       -i infile
              Specifies the input file name. If omitted, then standard input is assumed.
