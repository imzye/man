DESCRIPTION

OPTIONS
   pilot-install-netsync options
                               -e, --enable

       Enable the LanSync operation (Used for performing a "Network" HotSync (synchronize across the Internet for example) instead of "Local" HotSync).

                               -d, --disable

       Disable the LANSync setting on the Palm

                               -a,
                               --address=address

       Set the IP address of the remote machine you wish to connect to via "Network" HotSync. This is not the IP address of the Palm device itself. In most cases the Palm will be assigned an IP address auto‐
       matically by your desktop or server-side configuration.

                               -n,
                               --name hostname

       Sets the hostname of the remote machine you wish to connect to via "Network" HotSync. This is not the hostname of the Palm device itself.

                               -i,
                               --ip ip

       This option is no longer supported in 0.12 - see -a, --address.

                               -m,
                               --mask netmask

       Set the netmask of the remote machine you wish to connect to via "Network" HotSync. This is not the netmask address of the Palm device itself, it should be assigned a netmask value at connection time,
       based on your desktop or server-side configuration.

   Conduit Options
                               -p, --port lt;port>

       Use device file <port> to communicate with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-install-netsync will look for the  $PILOTPORT  environment variable. If neither are found or supplied, pi‐
       lot-install-netsync will print the usage information.

                               -q,
                               --quiet

       Suppress 'Hit HotSync button' message

                               -v, --version

       Display version of pilot-install-netsync and exit without connecting.

   Help Options
                               -h, --help
