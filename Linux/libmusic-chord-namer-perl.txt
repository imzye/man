NAME
       Music::Chord::Namer - You give it notes, it names the chord.

SYNOPSIS
               use Music::ChordName qw/chordname/;

               print chordname(qw/C E G/); # prints C
               print chordname(q/C E G/); # same (yes, array or string!)
               print chordname(qw/C Eb G Bb D/); # prints Cm9
               print chordname(qw/G C Eb Bb D/); # prints Cm9/G

DESCRIPTION
       Music::ChordName optionally exports one sub, chordname, which accepts some notes as either a string or a list and returns the best chord name it can think of.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

       $bestnamescalar|@namesarray = chordname($notesstring|@notesarray)
           chordname()  accepts  either  a string of notes such as "C Eb G A#" or a list of notes such as qw/Ab Bb F Bb D/.  In a scalar context it returns the best name it could think of to describe the
           chord made from the notes you gave it.  In an array context it returns all of the names it thought of, sorted from best to worst (shortest to longest!)

EXAMPLES
               # to print a bunch of guitar chord names with at lest 4 notes each,
               # all below 5th fret...

               foreach my $s1(qw/- E F Gb G Ab/){
                       foreach my $s2(qw/- A Bb B C Db/){
