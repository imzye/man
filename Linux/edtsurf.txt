NAME
       EDTSurf - quick and accurate construction of macromolecular surfaces

SYNOPSIS
       EDTSurf -i pdbname ...

DESCRIPTION
       EDTSurf is a open source program to construct triangulated surfaces for macromolecules. It generates three major macromolecular surfaces: van der Waals surface, solvent-accessible surface and mol‐
       ecular surface (solvent-excluded surface). EDTsurf also identifies cavities which are inside of macromolecules.
