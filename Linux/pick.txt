NAME
       pick — fuzzy select anything

SYNOPSIS
       pick [-hvKS] [-d [-o]] [-x | -X] [-q query]

DESCRIPTION
       The pick utility allows users to select from a set of choices using an curses(3) interface with fuzzy search functionality.

       The choices are read from stdin, and the selected choice written to stdout.

       The options are as follows:

       -d        Read and display descriptions.  Input lines will be split into two parts by the last occurrence of IFS.  Both parts will be displayed but only the first part will be used when searching.

       -h        Output a help message and exit.

       -K        Disable toggling of keypad transmit mode.  Useful when running pick from within another interactive program which already has set the correct transmit mode.

       -o        Output description of selected choice on exit.

       -q query  Supply an initial search query.

       -S        Disable sorting.  Only filter the choices instead of additionally sorting by score.  This option can be toggled from within the interface, see “COMMANDS”.

       -v        Output the version and exit.

       -x        Enable the use of the alternate screen terminal feature.  This is the default.

       -X        Disable the use of the alternate screen terminal feature.

COMMANDS

       Page-Down/Page-Up | Ctrl-V/Alt-V | Alt-Space

       Home/End | Alt-</Alt->
             Move the selection to the first/last choice matching the current search query.

       Enter
             Output the currently selected choice and exit.

             Output the current input query and exit.

       Ctrl-W | Alt-Backspace
