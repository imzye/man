NAME
       realcxxsh.c - A shell for running C++ code

SYNOPSIS
       realcxxsh.c [g++ options]

DESCRIPTION
       realcsh.c is an interactive shell that runs C++ source code.  A line of input is handled as a line in main() function, and the resulting C++ code is compiled, and executed.

       If a line starting with # such as #include <iostream> is entered, it is added to every code after that at the start of sourcecode.

       The list of such lines can be seen with ##

EXAMPLES
       The following is an example session

       $ ./realcxxsh.cc
       REAL c++sh: cout << "Hello world0;
       Hello world
       REAL c++sh: system ("pwd");
       /home/dancer
       REAL c++sh:

INTERNALS
       The following is how the C code looks like.

       /*BINFMTCXX:
       */
       #include <iostream>

       int main(int argc, char ** argv)
       {
       input-line
       return 0;
