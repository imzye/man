NAME
       libvdeplug_pcap - vdeplug module for vde_switch based networks

SYNOPSIS
       libvdeplug_pcap.so

DESCRIPTION
       This libvdeplug module interconnects a client to an interface using the packet capture library (pcap): all the data that is received by this plug is injected into interface and everything captured
       from that interface is sent to the client.

       Please notice that the pcap library captures and injects packets on the net, packets sent by the host are not captured, injected packets are not received by the host. So several clients using lib‐
       vdeplug_pcap on the same interface of the same host do not communicate among them (nor they communicate with the host).

       This module of libvdeplug4 can be used in any program supporting vde like vde_plug, vdens, kvm, qemu, user-mode-linux and virtualbox.

       The vde_plug_url syntax of this module is the following:
              pcap://interface_name

EXAMPLE
       vde_plug vde:// pcap://eth0

       connects the standard vde_switch to the interface eth0.
