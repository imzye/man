NAME
       Dansguardian - Simple module for administer dansguardian's control files.

SYNOPSIS
         use Dansguardian;

         # Make the objet $dg using the contructor new()

         my $dg = Dansguardian->new(dir => '/etc/dansguardian', group_dir => '/etc/dansguardian/lists');

         # Save IP's banned in array

         my @banned_ips = $dg->get('bannediplist');
         print "The IP address $_ is banned!!\n" foreach @banned_ips;

         # Add exception web site

         my $site = 'mogaal.com';

         # Remove banned IP

         my $ip_free = '192.168.0.2';
         $dg->remove(file => 'bannediplist', line => $ip_free);

         # list sites banned

         my @sites_banned = $dg->get('bannedsitelist');
         print "The site $_ is banned!!\n" foreach @sites_banned;

         # list dansguardian's config directory and the current group directory

         print "Dansguardian's config directory is " . $dg->group() . " and " . $dg->dir() . " is the current group directory\n";

         # Change group directory;

         $dg->group("/etc/dansguardian/chiefs");
         print "Dansguardian's config directory is " . $dg->dir() . " and " . $dg->group() . " is the current group directory\n";

DESCRIPTION
       "DansGuardian is an award winning Open Source web content filter which currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, HP-UX, and Solaris. It filters the actual content of pages based
       on many methods including phrase matching, PICS filtering and URL filtering. It does not purely filter based on a banned list of sites like lesser totally commercial filters."

       Dansguardian Perl module is small module for administer dansguardian's content control files. It let you add, remove and get information from files control across methods.

METHODS
       Dansguardian perl module provides some basic methods for administer control files, with it you can add, remove and get information about IP's blocked, sites denies, IP exception and other
       information.

   new (constructor)
         $dg = Dansguardian->new([%attributes])

       The constructor will create an object. It accepts a list of key => value pairs:

       dir => 'dansguardian/config/directory'
          If you don't set up a config directory for dansguardian the module will set up default value: /etc/dansguardian

       group_dir => 'path/to/group_dir/directory'
          Same that dir hash, and the default value is: /etc/dansguardian/lists

   $dg->group([$group_dir]);
       If group method don't have attribute: the function return array with dansguardian current group directory. Is possible change the group directory setting up $group_dir variable.

   $dg->dir([$config_dir]);
       If dir method don't have attribute: the function return array with dansguardian current config directory. Is possible change the group directory setting up $group_dir variable.

   $dg->set(%attributes);
       set method must have hash attributes. So, it accepts a list of key => value pairs:

       file => 'FILE'
          The FILE value is the file (locate inside current group dir) where you wish add information. For example: If you want add site to exception.

             $dg->set(file => 'exceptionsitelist', add => $site, comment => "Is not porn site");

          This line will add $site to /etc/dansguardian/lists/exceptioniplist assuming that /etc/dansguardian/lists is current group directory

       add => 'INFORMATION'
          The 'add' value is the information to add in dansguardian control file. For example: If you need add one IP for bannediplist control file, then assign 'IP' value for add hash key.

       comment => 'OPTIONAL COMMENT'

       This key is optional but very usefull for reading control files. It add comment at final line, after the 'add' value.

   $dg->remove($file)
       remove method must have one hash attribute with keys:

       file => 'FILE'
          The FILE value is the file (locate inside current group dir) where you wish remove information.

       line => 'LINE/IP/SITE/whatever'
          The  value  of  hash  key line is the information for remove in dansguardian control file. For example: For remove IP address from bannediplist control file you must add 'IP' like value of line
          hash key.

       Example

          $dg->remove(file => 'bannediplist', line => '192.168.24.76');

   $dg->get($file)
       Get method return an array data with information inside content control file. The incoming parameter is the control file name. Example:

         @ips_banned = $dg->get('bannediplist')
         print "The IP address $_ is banned!!\n" foreach @banned_ips;
