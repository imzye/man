NAME
       anytoucd  -  filter to convert a geomview data file into a data file in
       the so-called 'ucd' (Unstructured Cell Data) format.

SYNOPSIS
       anytoucd

DESCRIPTION
       Anytoucd reads a geom from standard in and outputs the  equivalent  ucd
       stream to standard out.

       Anytoucd calls anytopl(1) before converting to ucd.

       Full  documentation  for ucd format is available from AVS documentation
       in an appendix in the Developer's Guide.

BUGS
       Currently no support for vectors.

       4D OOGL objects are not treated correctly currently.
