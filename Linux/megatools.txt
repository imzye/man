NAME
       megarc - Configuration file for megatools

SYNOPSIS
              ~/.megarc
              ./.megarc

DESCRIPTION
       Megatools use INI configuration file to store commonly used login credentials.  This makes it less bothersome to use the tools, as you can simply write

       $ megatools df

       instead of

       $ megatools df --username my@email.com --password mypass

       when using the tools.

       Configuration file is read either from the current directory or user’s home directory. Exceptions are when --ignore-config-file was passed to the tool, or when explicit path to the config file was
       given via --config <path>.

CONFIG FILE SECTIONS
       All sections are optional. All names are case sensitive, thus you must write [Login], and not [login], and so on.

   LOGIN SECTION
       Username
              Your username.

       Password
              Your  password.  Be  aware that back slashes have special meaning. If you have back slash in your password, you must escape it with another backslash. For example: my\nice\password would be
              written as my\\nice\\password in the config file.

   CACHE SECTION
       Timeout
              Cache timeout in seconds (default is 10 minutes).

   NETWORK SECTION
       DownloadSpeedLimit
              Set maximum allowed download speed in KiB/s.  0 means no limit. Overrides SpeedLimit setting.

       UploadSpeedLimit
              Set maximum allowed upload speed in KiB/s.  0 means no limit. Overrides SpeedLimit setting.  When using ParallelTransfers > 1, upload speed limit is applied to each transfer individually.

       SpeedLimit
              Set maximum allowed upload and download speed in KiB/s.  0 means no limit.

       ParallelTransfers
              Set maximum allowed number of parallel connections when upload or downloading a file.  The file is split into chunks of a size between 128 kiB and 1 MiB, and these chunks  are  uploaded  in
              parallel.  The number must be between 1 and 16. Default is 5.

       Proxy  Use proxy server to connect to mega.nz.  More information can be found in libcurl documentation at ⟨https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html⟩.  Some acceptable values are:

              • socks5://localhost:9050 : Local SOCKSv5 proxy server

              • socks5h://localhost:9050 : Local SOCKSv5 proxy server with DNS handled by the proxy

   UPLOAD SECTION
       CreatePreviews
              Create Previews (see --enable-previews option).

   UI SECTION
       Colors Enable color output in the progress reporting. Colors are disabled by default to support all kinds of terminal configurations. Colors are not configurable, yet.

EXAMPLE
       Create ~/.megarc (on linux) or mega.ini file containing these 3 lines:

       [Login]
       Username = your@email
       Password = yourpassword

       [Network]
       # 1MiB/s
       SpeedLimit = 1024
       # Use over TOR
       Proxy = socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
       ParallelTransfers = 2

       [UI]
       Colors = true

       Run megatools-df(1) to check that megatools are able to login to your account.
