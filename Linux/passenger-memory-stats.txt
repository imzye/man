NAME
       passenger-memory-stats  -  reports a snapshot of the Apache and Phusion
       Passenger memory statistcs

SYNOPSIS
       passenger-memory-stats

DESCRIPTION
       passenger-memory-stats allows you to easily  analyze  the  real  memory
       usage of Phusion Passenger and Apache.

       Process inspection tools such as ps and top are useful, but they rarely
       show the correct memory usage. The real memory usage is  usually  lower
       than what ps and top report.

       There  are many technical reasons why this is so, but an explanation is
       beyond the scope of this page. We refer the interested reader to  oper‐
       ating systems literature about virtual memory and copy-on-write.

       When you run this tool the Private or private dirty RSS field shows the
       real memory usage of processes.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       HTTPD  The full filename to the Apache executable. By default,  Passen‐
              ger will attempt to autodetect the Apache executable. If autode‐
              tection fails for whatever reason, then  Apache  processes  will
              not  be  shown  in  the memory statistics. In that case, you may
              manually specify the location to  the  Apache  executable  using
              this environment variable.
