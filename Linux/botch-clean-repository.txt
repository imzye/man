NAME
       botch-clean-repository - clean errors in a repository by removing transitively uninstallable or compilable packages

SYNOPSIS
       botch-clean-repository [options] Packages Sources

DESCRIPTION
       given a repository of binary packages and source packages, clean up that repository by removing packages that can't be compiled or installed and packages which don't have an associated binary or
       source package and packages which do not match the specified architecture.

       This effectively creates a self contained repository of maximal size.

OPTIONS
       --version
           show program's version and exit

       -h, --help
           show this help message and exit

       -v, --verbose
           print additional information

       --quiet
           do no print any messages

       --reqsrcarchall
           require source packages for arch:all binary packages

       --addsrcarchall
           add source packages which only build arch:all binary packages

       --deb-drop-b-d-indep
           Drop Build-Depends-Indep dependencies

       --deb-drop-b-d-arch
           Drop Build-Depends-Arch dependencies

       --allowsrcmismatch
           If a binary package is without a source package but there is a source package of same name but different version, match this binary package to that source package.

       --progress
           print progress bars

       -o, --outfile=FILE
           Set the output file FILE

       --deb-native-arch=ARCH
           Native architecture ARCH

       --deb-host-arch=arch
           Host architecture arch. Defaults to native architecture.

       --deb-foreign-archs=archs
           Comma-separated foreign architectures in addition to native and host architectures.

       --deb-ignore-essential
           By default, installing any binary package requires the coinstallation set of all binary packages marked as Essential:yes to be installed as well. This option drops this requirement.

EXAMPLE
       Clean up a repository:

        botch-clean-repository --deb-native-arch=amd64 packages sources > packages-clean
        botch-bin2src --deb-native-arch=amd64 packages-clean sources > sources-clean
