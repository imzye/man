NAME
       sgmlsasp - translate output of sgmls using ASP replacement files

SYNOPSIS
       sgmls [-n] replacement_file...

DESCRIPTION
       sgmlsasp  translates  the  standard input using the specification in replacement_file...  and writes the result to the standard output.  The standard input must be in the format output by sgmls.  Each
       replacement file must be in the format of an Amsterdam SGML parser (ASP) replacement file; this format is described in the ASP documentation.  Duplicate replacements are silently ignored.  The -n  op‐
       tion  disables  upper-case  substitution (folding) for names in replacement files; this option should be used with concrete syntaxes that do not specify upper-case substitution for general names (that
       is, names that are not entity names).

BUGS
       References to external data entities are ignored.  (Support for external data entities is not implemented in ASP.)
