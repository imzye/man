NAME
       regina-gui - Regina's graphical user interface

SYNOPSIS
       regina-gui [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Regina  is  a software package for studying 3-manifold triangulations and normal surfaces.  Other key features include angle structures, census enumeration, combinatorial recognition of triangula‐
       tions, and high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition.  Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, and also offers Python bindings and  a  low-level  C++
       programming interface.

       This starts the full graphical user interface, and is the usual way of starting Regina.  Any files passed on the command-line will be opened on startup.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables influence the behaviour of this program.

       REGINA_PYLIBDIR
              The directory containing the Python module regina.

              If you have installed Regina's Python module in a standard Python location (i.e., Python can import it directly without extending sys.path), then REGINA_PYLIBDIR should be left empty or un‐
              defined.

              Normally  you  should not need to set this option yourself.  This program should know how to find Regina's Python module in standard situations, which include fixed filesystem installations
              (e.g., GNU/Linux and Windows), relocatable app bundles (e.g., macOS), and running directly from the source tree.

       REGINA_HOME
              The directory beneath which Regina's data files are installed.  These include (amongst other things) example files in $REGINA_HOME/examples/, API documentation in $REGINA_HOME/engine-docs/,
              and census databases in $REGINA_HOME/data/census/.

              Normally you should not need to set this option yourself.  This program should know how to find its data files in standard situations, which include fixed  filesystem  installations  (e.g.,
              GNU/Linux and Windows), relocatable app bundles (e.g., macOS), and running directly from the source tree.

MACOS USERS
       If you downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this is the program that runs when you open it.  The executable itself is simply called Regina, not regina-gui.
