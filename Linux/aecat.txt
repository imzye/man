NAME
       aecat - display an aewan document

SYNOPSIS
       aecat [-b] [-c] [-{n|N}] [{-p | -l <layer_num>}] [-f <format>] [-o <output_file>] inputfile

DESCRIPTION
       This  is an utility program that will convert an aewan document to ANSI escape sequences so that it can be rendered on a standard terminal. Alternatively, it can also generate HTML code for displaying
       the document in a web page. Any particular layer of the document may be converted, or you may request a composite of all layers.

OPTIONS
       -f     specifies output format - can "text", "html" or "comment". Default is "text".  The "comment" format extracts document metadata.

       -c     prepend a 'clear screen' escape sequence (only valid when outputting text).

       -o<file>
              writes output to specified file rather than stdout

       -b     disables output of color (only characters will be printed).

       -l<layer_no>
              specifies which layer of the document is to be used (must be an index, not a layer name). By default, layer 0 will be used.

       -L     displays the number of layers in the file.

       -p     exports a composite, that is, overlays all visible layers, paying attention to layer transparency, etc. The size of the composite will be the size of the first layer

       -n     suppress output of newlines

       -h     prints a short help text
