NAME
       llng-fastcgi-server - FastCGI server used for providing LemonLDAP::NG services.

SYNOPSIS
         # Start server listening to /run/llng.sock with 10 workers
         llng-fastcgi-server -u nobody -g nobody -s /run/llng.sock -n 10

DESCRIPTION
       llng-fastcgi-server has been designed to provide LemonLDAP::NG services to Nginx or DevOps Handler.  Portal, Manager and Handler will be compiled just-in-time. So this FastCGI server can be used
       on every LemonLDAP::NG server even if it needs only some parts (isolated handlers, portal,...).

PARAMETERS
       Each parameter can be set by using options or environment variables.

       --pid    -p ($ENV{PID}):
           pid file

       --user   -u ($ENV{USER}):
           user

       --group  -g ($ENV{GROUP}):
           group

       --proc   -n ($ENV{NPROC}):
           Number of processus for FCGI

       --socket -s ($ENV{SOCKET}):
           Unix socket

       --listen -l ($ENV{LISTEN}):
           Listening address (HOST:PORT, :PORT, or PATH)

       --customFunctionsFile -f ($ENV{CUSTOM_FUNCTIONS_FILE}):
           file to load for custom functions

       --engine -e ($ENV{ENGINE}):
           Plack::Handler engine, default to FCGI (see below)

       --plackOptions:
           To pass other options to the Plack handler. This multi-valued parameter must have "key=value" values.

           See Plack::Handler::FCGI to find out list of available options for default FCGI engine

ENGINES
       By default, llng-fastcgi-server uses FCGI (= Plack::Handler::FCGI).  Some other engines can be used:

   FCGI (default)
       It uses FCGI::ProcManager as manager. Other managers:

       FCGI::ProcManager::Dynamic
             llng-fastcgi-server -u nobody -g nobody -s /run/llng.sock -e FCGI -n 10 \
                                 --plackOptions manager=FCGI::ProcManager::Dynamic

   Other FCGI::ProcManager style engines
       FCGI::Engine

   Event engines
       AnyEvent::FCGI
       FCGI::Async
       FCGI::EV
