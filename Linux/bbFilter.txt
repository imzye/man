NAME
       bbFilter - this is a part of mauveAligner package

DESCRIPTION
       bbFilter <backbone file> <independent dist> <output file> <beast|gp> [<seq1> <seq2>...<seqN>]
       seq index starts at 0.

EXAMPLES
       Example:

              bbFilter my_alignment.backbone 50 my_feats.bin gp

       the  above  command  extracts  binary  features  from  "my_alignment.backbone"  which  are  separated by a minimum of 50nt sequence conserved among all taxa in the alignment.  The output is written to
       my_feats.bin in genoplast format

       Example 2:

              bbFilter aln.backbone 100 feats.xml beast 0 1 2 5 6

       the above command extracts binary features from "aln.backbone" which are separated by a minimum of 100nt sequence conserved among genomes 0,1,2,5, and 6 from the alignment.  The output is  written  to
       feats.xml in beast format
