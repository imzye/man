DESCRIPTION
       gimptool-2.0  is a tool that can, among other things, build plug-ins or
       scripts and install them if they are distributed in one source file.

       gimptool-2.0 can also be used  by  programs  that  need  to  know  what
       libraries  and  include-paths GIMP was compiled with. gimptool-2.0 uses
       pkg-config for this task. For use in Makefiles, it is recommended  that
       you use pkg-config directly instead of calling gimptool-2.0.

OPTIONS
       gimptool-2.0 accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print  the  currently installed version of GIMP on the standard
               output.

       --help  Print out the help blurb,  showing  commonly  used  commandline
               options.

       --quiet Run quietly without echoing any of the build commands.

       --silent
               Run silently without echoing any of the build commands. Same as
               --quiet.

       -n      Test mode. Print the commands but don't actually execute  them.
               Useful for making dry runs for testing.

       --just-print
               Test  mode. Print the commands but don't actually execute them.
               Same as -n.

       --dry-run
               Test mode. Print the commands but don't actually execute  them.
               Same as -n.

       --recon Test  mode. Print the commands but don't actually execute them.
               Same as -n.

       --msvc-syntax
               Useful on Windows. Outputs the compiler and linker flags in the
               syntax  used by Microsoft's toolchain. Passed to the pkg-config
               command that does most of gimptool-2.0's work.

       --bindir
               Outputs the bindir used to install the GIMP.

       --sbindir
               Outputs the sbindir used to install the GIMP.

               Outputs the libexecdir used to install the GIMP.

       --datadir
               Outputs the datadir used to install the GIMP.

       --sysconfdir
               Outputs the sysconfdir used to install the GIMP.

       --sharedstatedir
               Outputs the sharedstatedir used to install the GIMP.

       --localstatedir
               Outputs the localstatedir used to install the GIMP.

       --libdir
               Outputs the libdir used to install the GIMP.

       --infodir
               Outputs the infodir used to install the GIMP.

       --mandir
               Outputs the mandir used to install the GIMP.

       --includedir
               Outputs the includedir used to install the GIMP.

       --gimpdatadir
               Outputs the actual directory where the  GIMP  data  files  were
               installed.

       --gimpplugindir

               --cflags  and  --libs options. This option is also used for the

ENVIRONMENT
       CC      to get the name of the desired C compiler.

       CFLAGS  to get the preferred flags to pass to the C compiler for  plug-
               in building.

       LDFLAGS to get the preferred flags for passing to the linker.

       LIBS    for passing extra libs that may be needed in the build process.
               For example, LIBS=-lintl .

       PKG_CONFIG
               to get the location of the pkg-config program that is  used  to
               determine details about your glib, pango, gtk+ and gimp instal‐
               lation.
