DESCRIPTION
       dterc is the language used in dte(1) configuration files (~/.dte/rc) and also in the command mode of the editor (Alt+x). The syntax of the language is quite similar to shell, but much simpler.

       Commands are separated either by a newline or ; character. To make a command span multiple lines in an rc file, escape the newline (put \ at the end of the line).

       Rc files can contain comments at the start of a line. Comments begin with a # character and can be indented, but they can't be put on the same line as a command.

       Commands can contain environment variables. Variables always expand into a single argument even if they contain whitespace. Variables inside single or double quotes are NOT expanded. This makes it
       possible to bind keys to commands that contain variables (inside single or double quotes), which will be expanded just before the command is executed.

       Example:

              alias x "run chmod 755 $FILE"

       $FILE is expanded when the alias x is executed. The command works even if $FILE contains whitespace.

   Special variables
       These variables are always defined and override environment variables of the same name.

       $FILE
              The filename of the current buffer (or an empty string if unsaved).

       $FILETYPE
              The value of the filetype option for the current buffer.

       $LINENO
              The line number of the cursor in the current buffer.

       $WORD
              The selected text or the word under the cursor.

       $DTE_HOME
              The user configuration directory. This is either the value of $DTE_HOME when the editor first started, or the default value ($HOME/.dte).

   Single quoted strings
       Single quoted strings can't contain single quotes or escaped characters.

   Double quoted strings
       Double quoted strings may contain the following escapes:

       \a, \b, \t, \n, \v, \f, \r
              Control characters (same as in C)

       \e     Escape character

       \\     Backslash

       \"     Double quote

       \x0a   Hexadecimal byte value 0x0a. Note that \x00 is not supported because strings are NUL-terminated.

       \u20ac Four hex digit Unicode code point U+20AC.

       \U000020ac
              Eight hex digit Unicode code point U+20AC.

COMMANDS
   Configuration Commands
       Configuration commands are used to customize certain aspects of the editor, for example adding key bindings, setting options, etc. These are the only commands allowed in user config files.

       alias name command
              Create an alias name for command.

              Example:

                     alias read 'pipe-from cat'

              Now you can run read file.txt to insert file.txt into the current buffer.

       bind key [command]
              Bind command to key. If no command is given then any existing binding for key is removed.

              Special keys:

              • left
              • right
              • up
              • down
              • insert
              • delete
              • home
              • end
              • pgup
              • pgdown
              • begin (keypad "5" with Num Lock off)
              • enter
              • tab
              • space
              • F1..F12

              Modifiers:

              Ctrl:  C-X or ^X

              Alt:   M-X

              Shift: S-left

       set [-gl] option [value] ...
              Set value for option. Value can be omitted for boolean option to set it true. Multiple options can be set at once but then value must be given for every option.

              There are three kinds of options.

              1. Global options.

              2. Local options. These are file specific options. Each open file has its own copies of the option values.

              3.  Options  that  have both global and local values. The Global value is just a default local value for opened files and is never used for anything else. Changing the global value does not
              affect any already opened files.

              By default set changes both global and local values.

              -g     Change only global option value

              -l     Change only local option value of current file

              In configuration files only global options can be set (no need to specify the -g flag).

              See also: toggle and option commands.

       setenv name [value]
              Set (or unset) environment variable.

       hi [-c] name [fg-color [bg-color]] [attribute]...
              Set highlight color.

              The name argument can be a token name defined by a dte-syntax(5) file or one of the following, built-in highlight names:

              • default
              • nontext
              • noline
              • wserror
              • selection
              • currentline
              • linenumber
              • statusline
              • commandline
              • errormsg
              • infomsg
              • tabbar
              • activetab
              • inactivetab
              • dialog

              The fg-color and bg-color arguments can be one of the following:

              • No value (equivalent to default)
              • A numeric value between -2 and 255
              • A 256-color palette value in R/G/B notation (e.g. 0/3/5)
              • A true color value in CSS-style #RRGGBB notation (e.g. #ab90df)
              • keep (-2)
              • default (-1)
              • black (0)
              • red (1)
              • green (2)
              • yellow (3)
              • blue (4)
              • magenta (5)
              • cyan (6)
              • gray (7)
              • darkgray (8)
              • lightred (9)
              • lightgreen (10)
              • lightyellow (11)
              • lightblue (12)
              • lightmagenta (13)
              • lightcyan (14)
              • white (15)

              Colors 16 to 231 correspond to R/G/B colors. Colors 232 to 255 are grayscale values.

              If the terminal has limited support for rendering colors, the fg-color and bg-color arguments will fall back to the nearest supported color (unless the -c flag is used).

              The attribute argument(s) can be any combination of the following:

              • bold
              • dim
              • italic
              • underline
              • strikethrough
              • blink
              • reverse
              • invisible
              • keep

              The color and attribute value keep is useful in selected text to keep fg-color and attributes and change only bg-color.

              NOTE: Because keep is both a color and an attribute you need to specify both fg-color and bg-color if you want to set the keep attribute.

              Unset fg/bg colors are inherited from highlight color default.  If you don't set fg/bg for the highlight color default then terminal's default fg/bg is used.

              -c     Do nothing at all if the terminal can't display fg-color and/or bg-color with full precision

       ft [-b|-c|-f|-i] filetype string...
              Add a filetype association. Filetypes are used to determine which syntax highlighter and local options to use when opening files.

              By default string is interpreted as one or more filename extensions.

              -b     Interpret string as a file basename

              -c     Interpret string as a regex(7) pattern and match against the contents of the first line of the file

              -f     Interpret string as a regex(7) pattern and match against the full (absolute) filename

              -i     Interpret string as a command interpreter name and match against the Unix shebang line (after removing any path prefix and/or version suffix)

              Examples:

                     ft c c h
                     ft -b make Makefile GNUmakefile
                     ft -c xml '<\?xml'
                     ft -f mail '/tmpmsg-.*\.txt$'
                     ft -i lua lua luajit

              See also:

              • The option command (below)
              • The filetype option (below)
              • The dte-syntax(5) man page

       option [-r] filetype option value...
              Add automatic option for filetype (as previously registered with the ft command). Automatic options are set when files are are opened.

              -r     Interpret filetype argument as a regex(7) pattern instead of a filetype and match against full filenames

       include [-bq] file
              Read and execute commands from file.

              -b     Read built-in file instead of reading from the filesystem

              -q     Don't show an error message if file doesn't exist

              Note: "built-in files" are config files bundled into the program binary.  See the -B and -b flags in the dte(1) man page for more information.

       errorfmt [-i] compiler regexp [file|line|column|message|_]...
              Register a regex(7) pattern, for later use with the compile command.

              When the compile command is invoked with a specific compiler name, the regexp pattern(s) previously registered with that name are used to parse messages from it's program output.

              The regexp pattern should contain as many capture groups as there are extra arguments. These capture groups are used to parse the file, line, message, etc. from the output and, if possible,
              jump to the corresponding file position. To use parentheses in regexp but ignore the capture, use _ as the extra argument.

              Running errorfmt multiple times with the same compiler name appends each regexp to a list. When running compile, the entries in the specified list are checked for a match in the same  order
              they were added.

              For a basic example of usage, see the output of dte -b compiler/go.

              -i     Ignore this error

       load-syntax filename|filetype
              Load a dte-syntax(5) file into the editor. If the argument contains a / character it's considered a filename.

              Note:  this  command  only  loads  a  syntax file ready for later use. To actually apply a syntax highlighter to the current buffer, use the set command to change the filetype of the buffer
              instead, e.g.  set filetype html.

   Editor Commands
       quit [-f|-p] [exitcode]
              Quit the editor.

              The exit status of the process is set to exitcode, which can be in the range 0..125, or defaults to 0 if unspecified.

              -f     Force quit, even if there are unsaved files

              -p     Prompt for confirmation if there are unsaved files

       suspend
              Suspend the editor (run fg in the shell to resume).

       cd directory
              Change the working directory and update $PWD and $OLDPWD. Running cd - changes to the previous directory ($OLDPWD).

       command [text]
              Enter command mode. If text is given then it is written to the command line (see the default ^L key binding for why this is useful).

       search [-Hnprw] [pattern]
              If no flags or just -r and no pattern given then dte changes to search mode where you can type a regular expression to search.

              -H     Don't add pattern to search history

              -n     Search next

              -p     Search previous

              -r     Start searching backwards

              -w     Search word under cursor

       refresh
              Trigger a full redraw of the screen.

   Buffer Management Commands
       open [-g|-t] [-e encoding] [filename]...
              Open file. If filename is omitted, a new file is opened.

              -e encoding
                     Set file encoding. See iconv -l for list of supported encodings.

              -g     Perform glob(7) expansion on filename.

              -t     Mark buffer as "temporary" (always closeable, without warnings for "unsaved changes")

       save [-fp] [-d|-u] [-b|-B] [-e encoding] [filename]
              Save current buffer.

              -b     Write byte order mark (BOM)

              -B     Don't write byte order mark

              -d     Save with DOS/CRLF line-endings

              -f     Force saving read-only file

              -u     Save with Unix/LF line-endings

              -p     Open a command prompt if there's no specified or existing filename

              -e encoding
                     Set file encoding. See iconv -l for list of supported encodings.

              See also: newline and utf8-bom global options

       close [-qw] [-f|-p]
              Close file.

              -f     Force close file, even if it has unsaved changes

              -p     Prompt for confirmation if the file has unsaved changes

              -q     Quit if closing the last open file

              -w     Close parent window if closing its last contained file

       next
              Display next file.

       prev
              Display previous file.

       view N|last
              Display Nth or last open file.

       move-tab N|left|right
              Move current tab to position N or 1 position left or right.

   Window Management Commands
       wsplit [-bghnrt] [filename]...
              Split the current window.

              filename arguments will be opened in a manner similar to the open command. If there are no arguments, the contents of the new window will be an additional view of the current buffer.

              -b     Add new window before current instead of after.

              -g     Perform glob(7) expansion on filename.

              -h     Split horizontally instead of vertically.

              -n     Create a new, empty buffer.

              -r     Split root instead of current window.

              -t     Mark buffer as "temporary" (always closeable, without warnings for "unsaved changes")

       wclose [-f|-p]
              Close window.

              -f     Force close window, even if it contains unsaved files

              -p     Prompt for confirmation if there are unsaved files in the window

       wnext
              Next window.

       wprev
              Previous window.

       wresize [-h|-v] [N|+N|-- -N]
              If no parameter given, equalize window sizes in current frame.

              -h     Resize horizontally

              -v     Resize vertically

              N      Set size of current window to N characters.

              +N     Increase size of current window by N characters.

              -N     Decrease size of current window by N characters. Use -- to prevent the minus symbol being parsed as an option flag, e.g.  wresize -- -5.

       wflip
              Change from vertical layout to horizontal and vice versa.

       wswap
              Swap positions of this and next frame.

   Movement Commands
       Movement commands are used to move the cursor position.

       Several of these commands also have -c and -l flags to allow creating character/line selections. These 2 flags are noted in the command summaries below, but are only described once, as follows:

       -c     Select characters

       -l     Select whole lines

       left [-c]
              Move one column left.

       right [-c]
              Move one column right.

       up [-c|-l]
              Move one line up.

       down [-c|-l]
              Move one line down.

              This command requires a tags file generated by ctags(1). tags files are searched for in the current working directory and its parent directories.

              -r     jump back to the previous location

              See also: msg command.

       msg [-n|-p]
              Show latest, next (-n) or previous (-p) message. If its location is known (compile error or tag message) then the file will be opened and cursor moved to the location.

              -n     Next message

              -p     Previous message

              See also: compile and tag commands.

       cut
              Cut current line or selection.

       copy [-k]
              Copy current line or selection.

              -k     Keep selection (by default, selections are lost after copying)

       paste [-c]
              Paste text previously copied by the copy or cut commands.

              -c     Paste at the cursor position, even when the text was copied as a whole-line selection (where the usual default is to paste at the start of the next line)

       undo
              Undo latest change.

       redo [choice]
              Redo changes done by the undo command. If there are multiple possibilities a message is displayed:

                     Redoing newest (2) of 2 possible changes.

              If the change was not the one you wanted, just run undo and then, for example, redo 1.

       clear
              Clear current line.

       delete-eol [-n]
              Delete to end of line.

              -n     Delete newline if cursor is at end of line

       erase-bol
              Erase to beginning of line.

       delete-word [-s]

              -s     Be more "aggressive"

       erase-word [-s]
              Erase word before cursor.

              -s     Be more "aggressive"

       delete-line
              Delete current line.

       case [-l|-u]
              Change text case. The default is to change lower case to upper case and vice versa.

              -l     Lower case

              -u     Upper case

       insert [-km] text
              Insert text into the buffer.

              -k     Insert one character at a time, as if manually typed. Normally text is inserted exactly as specified, but this option allows  it  to  be  affected  by  special  input  handling  like
                     auto-indents, whitespace trimming, line-by-line undo, etc.

              -m     Move after inserted text

       replace [-bcgi] pattern replacement
              Replace all instances of text matching pattern with the replacement text.

              The pattern argument is a POSIX extended regex(7).

              The replacement argument is treated like a template and may contain several, special substitutions:

              • Backslash sequences \1 through \9 are replaced by sub-strings that were "captured" (via parentheses) in the pattern.
              • The special character & is replaced by the full string that was matched by pattern.
              • Literal \ and & characters can be inserted in replacement by escaping them (as \\ and \&).
              • All other characters in replacement represent themselves.

              Note: extra care must be taken when using double quotes for the pattern argument, since double quoted arguments have their own (higher precedence) backslash sequences.

              -b     Use basic instead of extended regex syntax

              -c     Ask for confirmation before each replacement

              -g     Replace all matches for each line (instead of just the first)

              -i     Ignore case

              Examples:

                     replace 'Hello World' '& (Hallo Welt)'
                     replace "[ \t]+$" ''
                     replace -cg '([^ ]+) +([^ ]+)' '\2 \1'

       shift count
              Shift current or selected lines by count indentation levels.  Count is usually -1 (decrease indent) or 1 (increase indent).

              To specify a negative number, it's necessary to first disable option parsing with --, e.g. shift -- -1.

       wrap-paragraph [width]
              Format the current selection or paragraph under the cursor. If paragraph width is not given then the text-width option is used.

              This command merges the selection into one paragraph. To format multiple paragraphs use the external fmt(1) program with the filter command, e.g. filter fmt -w 60.

       select [-bkl]
              Enter selection mode. All movement commands while in this mode extend the selected area.

              Note: A better way to create selections is to hold the Shift key whilst moving the cursor. The select command exists mostly as a fallback, for terminals with limited key binding support.

              -b     Select block between opening { and closing } curly braces

              -k     Keep existing selections

              -l     Select whole lines

       unselect
              Unselect.

   External Commands
       filter [-l] command [parameter]...
              Filter selected text or whole file through external command.

              Example:

                     filter sort -r

              Note that command is executed directly using execvp(3). To use shell features like pipes or redirection, use a shell interpreter as the command. For example:

                     filter sh -c 'tr a-z A-Z | sed s/foo/bar/'

              -l     Operate on current line instead of whole file, if there's no selection

       pipe-from [-ms] command [parameter]...
              Run external command and insert its standard output.

              -m     Move after the inserted text

              -s     Strip newline from end of output

       pipe-to [-l] command [parameter]...
              Run external command and pipe the selected text (or whole file) to its standard input.

              Can be used to e.g. write text to the system clipboard:

                     pipe-to xsel -b

              -l     Operate on current line instead of whole file, if there's no selection

       run [-ps] command [parameters]...
              Run external command.

              -p     Display "Press any key to continue" prompt

              -s     Silent -- both stderr(3) and stdout(3) are redirected to /dev/null

       compile [-1ps] errorfmt command [parameters]...
              Run external command and collect output messages. This can be used to run e.g. compilers, build systems, code search utilities, etc. and then jump to a file/line position for each message.

              The  errorfmt  argument corresponds to a regex capture pattern previously specified by the errorfmt command. After command exits successfully, parsed messages can be navigated using the msg
              command.

              -1     Read error messages from stdout instead of stderr

              -p     Display "Press any key to continue" prompt

              -s     Silent. Both stderr(3) and stdout(3) are redirected to /dev/null

              See also: errorfmt and msg commands.

       eval command [parameter]...
              Run external command and execute its standard output text as dterc commands.

       exec-open [-s] command [parameter]...
              Run external command and open all filenames listed on its standard output.

              -s     Don't yield terminal control to the child process

              Example uses:

                     exec-open -s find . -type f -name *.h
                     exec-open -s git ls-files --modified
                     exec-open fzf -m --reverse

       exec-tag [-s] command [parameter]...
              Run external command and then execute the tag command with its first line of standard output as the argument.

              -s     Don't yield terminal control to the child process

              Example uses:

                     exec-tag -s echo main
                     exec-tag sh -c 'readtags -l | cut -f1 | sort | uniq | fzf --reverse'

   Other Commands
       repeat count command [parameters]...
              Run command count times.

       toggle [-gv] option [values]...
              Toggle option. If list of values is not given then the option must be either boolean or enum.

              -g     toggle global option instead of local

              -v     display new value

              If option has both local and global values then local is toggled unless -g is used.

       show [-c] type [key]
              Display current values for various configurable types.

              The type argument can be one of:

              The key argument is the name of the entry to look up (e.g. the alias name). If this argument is omitted, the full list of entries of the specified type will be displayed in a new buffer.

              -c     write value to command line (if possible)

       macro action
              Record and replay command macros.

              The action argument can be one of:

              toggle Toggle recording on/off

              cancel Stop recording, without overwriting the previous macro

              play   Replay the previously recorded macro

              Once a macro has been recorded, it can be viewed in text form by running show macro.

OPTIONS
       Options can be changed using the set command. Enumerated options can also be toggled. To see which options are enumerated, type "toggle " in command mode and press the tab key. You  can  also  use
       the option command to set default options for specific file types.

   Global options
       case-sensitive-search [true]

              false  Search is case-insensitive.

              true   Search is case-sensitive.

       esc-timeout [100] 0...2000
              When single escape is read from the terminal dte waits some time before treating the escape as a single keypress. The timeout value is in milliseconds.

              Too long timeout makes escape key feel slow and too small timeout can cause escape sequences of for example arrow keys to be split and treated as multiple key presses.

       filesize-limit [250]
              Refuse to open any file with a size larger than this value (in mebibytes). Useful to prevent accidentally opening very large files, which can take a long time on some systems.

       lock-files [true]
              Keep a record of open files, so that a warning can be shown if the same file is accidentally opened in multiple dte processes.

              See also: the FILES section in the dte(1) man page.

       newline [unix]
              Whether to use LF (unix) or CRLF (dos) line-endings in newly created files.

       select-cursor-char [true]
              Whether to include the character under the cursor in selections.

       scroll-margin [0]
              Minimum number of lines to keep visible before and after cursor.

              %y     Cursor row.

              %Y     Total rows in file.

              %x     Cursor display column.

              %s     Separator (a single space, unless the preceding format character expanded to an empty string).

              %S     Like %s, but 3 spaces instead of 1.

              %t     File type.

              %u     Hexadecimal Unicode value value of character under cursor.

              %%     Literal %.

       statusline-right [" %y,%X %u %E%s%b%s%n %t %p "]
              Format string for the right aligned part of status line.

              Whether to write a byte order mark (BOM) in newly created UTF-8 files.

              Note: buffers opened from existing UTF-8 files will have their BOM (or lack thereof) preserved as it was, unless overridden by the save command.

   Local options

   Local and global options
       The global values for these options serve as the default values for local (per-file) options.

       auto-indent [true]
              Automatically  insert  indentation  when  pressing enter.  Indentation is copied from previous non-empty line. If also the indent-regex local option is set then indentation is automatically
              increased if the regular expression matches current line.

       detect-indent [""]
              Comma-separated list of indent widths (1-8) to detect automatically when a file is opened. Set to "" to disable. Tab indentation is detected if the value is not "".  Adjusts  the  following

              Size of indentation in spaces.

       syntax [true]
              Use syntax highlighting.

       tab-width [8]
              Width of tab. Recommended value is 8. If you use other indentation size than 8 you should use spaces to indent.

       text-width [72]
              Preferred width of text. Used as the default argument for the wrap-paragraph command.

       ws-error [special]
              Comma-separated list of flags that describe which whitespace errors should be highlighted. Set to "" to disable.

              auto-indent
                     If the expand-tab option is enabled then this is the same as tab-after-indent,tab-indent. Otherwise it's the same as space-indent.

              space-align
                     Highlight spaces used for alignment after tab indents as errors.

              space-indent
                     Highlight space indents as errors. Note that this still allows using less than tab-width spaces at the end of indentation for alignment.

              tab-after-indent
                     Highlight tabs used anywhere other than indentation as errors.

              tab-indent
                     Highlight tabs in indentation as errors. If you set this you most likely want to set "tab-after-indent" too.

              special
                     Display  all  characters  that look like regular space as errors.  One of these characters is no-break space (U+00A0), which is often accidentally typed (AltGr+space in some keyboard
                     layouts).

              trailing
                     Highlight trailing whitespace characters at the end of lines as errors.
