NAME
       Geo::METAR - Process aviation weather reports in the METAR format.

SYNOPSIS
         use Geo::METAR;
         use strict;

         my $m = new Geo::METAR;
         $m->metar("KFDY 251450Z 21012G21KT 8SM OVC065 04/M01 A3010 RMK 57014");
         print $m->dump;

         exit;

DESCRIPTION
       METAR reports are available on-line, thanks to the National Weather Service.  Since reading the METAR format isn't easy for non-pilots, these reports are relatively useles to the common man who
       just wants a quick glace at the weather. This module tries to parse the METAR reports so the data can be used to create readable weather reports and/or process the data in applications.

USAGE
   How you might use this
       Here is how you might use the Geo::METAR module.

       One use that I have had for this module is to query the NWS METAR page (using the LWP modules) at:

       http://weather.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/mgetmetar.pl?cccc=EHSB

       to get an up-to-date METAR. Then, I scan thru the output, looking for what looks like a METAR string (that's not hard in Perl). Oh, EHSB can be any site location code where there is a reporting
       station.

       I then pass the METAR into this module and get the info I want. I can then update my webcam page with the current temperature, sky conditions, or whatnot. See for yourself at
       http://webcam.idefix.net/

       See the BUGS section for a remark about multiple passes with the same Geo::METAR object.

   Functions
       The following functions are defined in the METAR module. Most of them are public, meaning that you're supposed to use them. Some are private, meaning that you're not supposed to use them -- but I
       won't stop you. Assume that functions are public unless otherwise documented.

       metar()
           metar() is the function to whwich you should pass a METAR string.  It will take care of decomposing it into its component parts converting the units and so on.

           Example: "$m->metar("KFDY 251450Z 21012G21KT 8SM OVC065 04/M01 A3010 RMK 57014");"

       debug()
           debug() toggles debugging messages. By default, debugging is turned off. Turn it on if you are developing METAR or having trouble with it.

           debug() understands all of the following:

                   Enable       Disable
                   ------       -------
                     1             0
                   'yes'         'no'
                   'on'          'off'

           If you contact me for help, I'll likely ask you for some debugging output.

           Example: "$m->debug(1);"

       dump()
           dump() will dump the internal data structure for the METAR in a semi-human readable format.

           Example: "$m->dump;"

       version()
           version() will print out the current version.

           Example: "print $m->version;"

       _tokenize()
           PRIVATE

           Called internally to break the METAR into its component tokens.

       _process()
           PRIVATE

           Used to make sense of the tokens found in _tokenize().

   Variables
       After  you've  called  metar(),  you'd  probably like to get at the individual values for things like temperature, dew point, and so on. You do that by accessing individual variables via the METAR
       object.

       This section lists those variables and what they represent.

       If you call dump(), you'll find that it spits all of these out.

NOTES
       Test suite is small and incomplete. Needs work yet.

       Older versions of this module were installed as "METAR" instaed of "Geo::METAR"

BUGS
       The Geo::METAR is only initialized once, which means you'll get left-over crud in variables when you call the metar() function twice.

       What is an invalid METAR in one country is a standard one in the next.  The standard is interpreted and used by meteorologists all over the world, with local  variations.  This  means  there  will
       always be METARs that will trip the parser.

TODO
       There  is  a  TODO  file included in the Geo::METAR distribution listing the outstanding tasks that I or others have devised. Please check that list before you submit a bug report or request a new
       feture. It might already be on the TODO list.
