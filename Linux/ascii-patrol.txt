NAME
       asciipat - A retro ASCII art game inspired by Moon Patrol.

SYNOPSIS
       asciipat [option] [.rec file]

DESCRIPTION
       asciipat  is  a  command-line  game  that  brings back the nostalgia of retro ASCII art games.  It is inspired by the classic Moon Patrol game.  Guide your character through a treacherous terrain,
       avoiding obstacles and shooting down enemies.  Survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.

       After finishing game you may notice there is “asciipat.rec” file in your home directory.  It can be used to replay game or to validate your score.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU info(1) format; see below.
