NAME
       nauty-listg - display graphs in a variety of forms

SYNOPSIS
       listg [-fp#:#l#o#Ftq] [-a|-A|-c|-d|-e|-H|-M|-W|-L|-s|-b|-G|-y|-Yxxx] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Write graphs in human-readable format.

       -f     : assume inputs have same size (only used from a file

              and only if -p is given)

       -p#, -p#:#, -p#-# : only display one graph or a sequence of

       graphs.
              The first graph is number 1.  A second number

              which is empty or zero means infinity.  This option won't work for incremental input.

       -a     : write as adjacency matrix, not as list of adjacencies

       -A     : same as -a with a space between entries

       -l# : specify screen width limit (default 78, 0 means no limit)

              This is not currently implemented with -a or -A.

       -o# : specify number of first vertex (default is 0).

       -d     : write output to satisfy dreadnaut

       -c     : write ascii form with minimal line-breaks

       -e     : write a list of edges, preceded by the order and the

              number of edges

       -H     : write in HCP operations research format

       -M     : write in Magma format

       -W     : write matrix in Maple format

       -L     : (only with -M or -W) write Laplacian rather than adjacency matrix

       -b     : write in Bliss format

       -G     : write in GRAPE format

       -y     : write in dot file format

       -Yxxx : extra dotty commands for dot files (arg continues to end of param)

       -t     : write upper triangle only (affects -a, -A, -d and default)

       -s     : write only the numbers of vertices and edges

       -F     : write a form-feed after each graph except the last

       -q     : suppress auxiliary output

       -a, -A, -c, -d, -M, -W, -H and -e are incompatible.
