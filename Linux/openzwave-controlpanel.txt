NAME
       ozwcp - OpenZWave Control Panel

SYNOPSIS
       ozwcp [-d] [-p port]

DESCRIPTION
       OpenZWave  Control  Panel  (ozwcp)  permits  users  to query, manage, and monitor Z-Wave nodes and networks. It provides a web-based user interface.  Some example uses include adding/removing
       nodes, testing commands, and viewing/changing node configuration parameters.

       Once started, use a web browser to connect to the host:port that ozwcp is listening on. By default this is <http://localhost:8090/>.  Enter the device  path,  for  example  /dev/ttyACM0,  and
       press "Initialize". Note that many Z-Wave USB sticks act as serial devices, and if so, the USB box should not be checked.

       ozwcp  must  be  able  to  exclusively  read/write to the controller.  Typically this means running under a user that is a member of the device group, for example dialout for serial ports, or
       changing the permissions of the device file.  Running as root should also work but is not recommended.  Stop other programs that may be using the device before initializing.

OPTIONS
       -d     Enable debugging.

       -p port
              Listen on the specified port instead of 8090.

FILES
       /etc/openzwave
              OpenZWave configuration files.

       /usr/share/openzwave-controlpanel
              Static files for the web server.

       ozwcache_*.xml
              Cache of the current network configuration, formerly zwcfg_*.xml.

       OZW_Log.txt
              OpenZWave log file, useful for debugging.
