NAME
       Text::Greeking - generate meaningless text (eg to fill a page when designing)

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Greeking;

        my $g = Text::Greeking->new;
        $g->paragraphs(1,2)    # min of 1 paragraph and a max of 2
        $g->sentences(2,5)     # min of 2 sentences per paragraph and a max of 5
        $g->words(8,16)        # min of 8 words per sentence and a max of 16
        print $g->generate;    # use default Lorem Ipsum source

DESCRIPTION
       Greeking is the use of random letters or marks to show the overall appearance of a printed page without showing the actual text. Greeking is used to make it easy to judge the overall appearance of
       a document without being distracted by the meaning of the text.

       This is a module is for quickly generating varying meaningless text from any source to create this illusion of the content in systems.

       This module was created to quickly give developers simulated content to fill systems with simulated content. Instead of static Lorem Ipsum text, by using randomly generated text and optionally
       varying word sources, repetitive and monotonous patterns that do not represent real system usage is avoided.

METHODS
       Text::Greeking->new
           Constructor method. Returns a new instance of the class.

       $g->init
           Initializes object with defaults. Called by the constructor.  Broken out for easy overloading to enable customized defaults and other behaviour.

       $g->sources([\@ARRAY])
           Gets/sets the table of source word collections current in memory as an ARRAY reference

       $g->add_source($text)
           The class takes a body of text passed as a SCALAR and processes it into a list of word tokens for use in generating random filler text later.

       $g->generate
           Returns a body of random text generated from a randomly selected source using the minimum and maximum values set by paragraphs, sentences, and words minimum and maximum values.  If generate is
           called without any sources a standard Lorem Ipsum block is used added to the sources and then used for processing the random text.

       $g->paragraphs($min,$max)
           Sets the minimum and maximum number of paragraphs to generate. Default is a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8.

       $g->sentences($min,$max)
           Sets the minimum and maximum number of sentences to generate per paragraph. Default is a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8.

       $g->words($min,$max)
           Sets the minimum and maximum number of words to generate per sentence. Default is a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 15.
