NAME
       erect2planet - Extract a stereographic 'little planet' from an equirectangular image

Synopsis
         erect2planet equirectangular.tif

DESCRIPTION
       Generates a suitably sized stereographic .pto project from a 360 degree equirectangular image.  Input is in any image format understood by hugin, output is in square TIFF format with a field of view
       of 253.7398 degrees (this places the horizon halfway between the centre and the edge).

       The output filename is derived automatically from the input filename with '-sgraphic.pto' appended.  Existing .pto files will not be clobbered but will be updated when input images change size.
