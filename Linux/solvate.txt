NAME
       solvate - surround protein with water molecules

SYNOPSIS
       solvate [-tthick][-rradius][-nngauss][-ug][-ub]
                      [-s] [-v] [-bulk] [-w] [-ion] [-psf] [infile] outfile

DESCRIPTION
       SOLVATE prepares of a water shell around solutes.

       solvate command.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -t thick
              minimum water shell thickness in Angstrom (default: 10.0)

       -r radius
              maximum boundary curvature radius in Angstrom (default: 100000.0)

       -n ngauss
              use ngauss gaussians to define solvant boundary (default: 1)

       -s     write surface statistics to file surface_stat.

       -v     write volume statistics to file volume_stat.

       -ug    use gaussians from file gaussians (skip gaussian learning phase).

       -ub    use boundary definition from file boundary (skip gaussian learning phase and boundary adjustment).

       -bulk  output only bulk water (i.e., no buried water molecules)

       -w     output only water molecules (i.e., not the solute)

       -ion   add ions (na+/cl-) in isotonic/Debye-Hueckel concentration

       -psf   output XPLOR-script mkpsf.inp for generating a psf-file

       infile pdb-file (no extension) of solute (if omitted, a water droplet is created)

       outfile
              pdb-file (no extension) of water shell
