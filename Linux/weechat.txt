DESCRIPTION
       WeeChat (Wee Enhanced Environment for Chat) is a free chat client, fast and light, designed for many operating systems. It is highly customizable and extensible with scripts.

OPTIONS
       -a, --no-connect
           Disable auto-connect to servers when WeeChat is starting.

       -c, --colors
           Display default colors in terminal.

       --daemon
           Run WeeChat in background, as a daemon (works only with the command weechat-headless).

       --stdout
           Display log messages on standard output instead of writing them in log file (works only with the command weechat-headless, not compatible with option "--daemon").

       -d, --dir <path>
           Set path as home for WeeChat (used for configuration files, logs, user plugins and scripts), default value is "~/.weechat" (note: directory is created if not found by WeeChat). If this option is
           not given, the environment variable WEECHAT_HOME is used (if not empty).

       -t, --temp-dir
           Create a temporary WeeChat home directory and delete it on exit (incompatible with option "-d").
           The name of the directory is automatically built by WeeChat, with this template: "weechat_temp_XXXXXX" (where "XXXXXX" is random). It it created in the first available directory in this list:
           environment variable "TMPDIR", "/tmp" (may be different according to the operating system), environment variable "HOME", current directory.
           The temporary home directory has permissions 0700 (only owner can read, write and execute).

       -h, --help
           Display help.

       -l, --license
           Display WeeChat license.

       -p, --no-plugin
           Disable plugins auto-load.

       -P, --plugins <plugins>
           Load only these plugins at startup (see /help weechat.plugin.autoload). If this option is given, the option weechat.plugin.autoload is not used.

       -r, --run-command <command>
           Run command(s) after startup; many commands can be separated by semicolons, this option can be given multiple times.

       -s, --no-script
           Disable scripts auto-load.

       --upgrade
           Upgrade WeeChat using session files generated with command /upgrade -quit.

       -v, --version
           Display WeeChat version.

       plugin:option
           Option for a plugin.

DEBUG OPTIONS
       WARNING: these options are for debug purposes only, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

       --no-dlclose
           Do not call the function dlclose after plugins are unloaded. This is useful with tools like Valgrind to display stack for unloaded plugins.

       --no-gnutls
           Do not call the init and deinit functions of GnuTLS library. This is useful with tools like Valgrind and electric-fence, to prevent GnuTLS memory errors.

       --no-gcrypt
           Do not call the init and deinit functions of Gcrypt library. This is useful with tools like Valgrind, to prevent Gcrypt memory errors.
