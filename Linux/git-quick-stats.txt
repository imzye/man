ADDITIONAL USAGE
       You can set _GIT_SINCE and _GIT_UNTIL to limit the git time log, example:

       export _GIT_SINCE="2017-01-20"

       You can set _GIT_LIMIT for limited output log, example:

       export _GIT_LIMIT=20

       You can set _GIT_LOG_OPTIONS for git log options, example:

       export _GIT_LOG_OPTIONS="--ignore-all-space --ignore-blank-lines"

       You can exclude directories or files from the stats by using pathspec, example:

       export _GIT_PATHSPEC=':!pattern'

       You can set _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to show merge commits with normal commits, example:

       export _GIT_MERGE_VIEW="enable"

       You can also set _GIT_MERGE_VIEW to only show merge commits, example:

       export _GIT_MERGE_VIEW="exclusive"

       You can sort contribution stats by field "name", "commits", "insertions", "deletions", or "lines" (total lines changed) and order ("asc", "desc"). e.g.: "commits-desc"

       export _GIT_SORT_BY="name-asc"

       You can change to the legacy color scheme by toggling the variable "_MENU_THEME" between "default" and "legacy". You can completely disable the color theme by setting the "_MENU_THEME" variable to
       "none", example:

       export _MENU_THEME=legacy

       or export _MENU_THEME=none

       You can set _GIT_BRANCH to set the branch of the stats, example:

       export _GIT_BRANCH="master"

       You can set _GIT_IGNORE_AUTHORS to filter out specific authors, example:

       export _GIT_IGNORE_AUTHORS="(author@examle.com|username)"

       You can set _GIT_DAYS to set the number of days for the heatmap, example:

       export _GIT_DAYS=30"
