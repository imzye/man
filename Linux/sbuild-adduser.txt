NAME
       sbuild-adduser - add an sbuild user

SYNOPSIS
       sbuild-adduser [-h|--help | -V|--version] USER1 [USER2 [USERn...]]

DESCRIPTION
       sbuild-adduser adds the specified users to the sbuild group, granting them the privilege to build packages with sbuild(1).  The schroot(1) configuration must permit the user to obtain root permissions
       in the chroot via the root-users and root-groups options in schroot.conf, because this is required to install and remove build-dependencies inside the chroot.  This is normally done using  the  sbuild
       group, but additional users or groups may be added in order to grant finer-grained permissions, for example to restrict individual users to particular chroots.
