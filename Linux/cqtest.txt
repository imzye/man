NAME
       cqtest - HylaFAX copy quality checking test program

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/cqtest [ options ] input.tif

DESCRIPTION
       cqtest  is  a  program  for testing the copy quality checking support in the HylaFAX software (specifically, in the faxgetty(8) program).  cqtest takes a TIFF/F (TIFF Class F) file and generates a new
       TIFF/F file that is a copy of the input file, but with any erroneous scanlines replaced/regenerated.  In addition, cqtest prints diagnostic messages describing its actions and  indicates  whether  the
       input data has acceptable copy quality according to the copy quality checking threshold parameters.  Options are provided for specifying copy quality checking threshold parameters

OPTIONS
       -m badlines   Set  the maximum consecutive bad lines of data that may appear in each acceptable page of input data.  This is equivalent to the MaxConsecutiveBadLines configuration parameter; c.f.  hy‐
                     lafax-config(5).  By default cqtest accepts no more than 5 consecutive bad lines in a page.

       -o file       Write output to file.  By default output is written to the file cq.tif.

       -p %goodlines Set the minimum percentage of ``good lines'' of data that may appear in acceptable page of input data.  A line is good if it decodes without error to a row of pixels that is the expected
                     width.  This is equivalent to the PercentGoodLines configuration parameter; c.f.  hylafax-config(5).  By default cqtest requires that 95% of the rows of each page be good.

EXAMPLES
       The following shows a multi-page, high-resolution document with a single error on each page.  Each page has acceptable copy quality using the default threshold parameters.
