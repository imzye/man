NAME
       emp_hub - Empire multiplexer

SYNOPSIS
       emp_hub [-persistent] [-debug] [-help] [-mirror] host port localport

DESCRIPTION
       emp_hub  allows  multiple clients to simultaneously connect to a single Empire country.  This allows you to use both a fast and a smart client simultaneously.  It also permits multiple corulers to
       log in at once.

   Parameters
       host        Hostname of the upstream server.

       port        TCP/IP port number the empire server is running on.

       localport   TCP/IP port number the emp_hub should listen to for incoming client connections.

       -mirror     Copy commands and replies to all clients using new protocols.  Currently only the lafe client is aware of these protocols, though most clients will ignore them.

       -persistent Normally emp_hub exits after the last client disconnects.  With this option emp_hub does not exit, and will wait for new clients to connect.  emp_hub must be killed by the  user  using
                   the kill command.

       -help       Brief usage information.

       -debug      Print lots of messages, including everything sent and received by a client.  Useful when debugging either emp_hub , a client, or the server.

BUGS
       Due  to  the nature of the empire protocol, only one client may have input focus at one time.  If a client pauses at a context sensitive prompt from the server, all other clients will be unable to
       send data.
