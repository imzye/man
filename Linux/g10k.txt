G10K(1)                                                                                        User Commands                                                                                        G10K(1)

NAME
       g10k - Puppet environment and module deployment

SYNOPSIS
       g10k [OPTIONS]

       g10k –version

DESCRIPTION
       g10k  is  a  tool for deploying Puppet environments and modules, much like r10k.  Its an almost drop-in replacement for r10k with additional features such as caching, version pre-checking and dis‐
       tinct SSH keys for each source.  In general it also a lot faster than the original r10k.

OPTIONS
       -branch string
              which git branch of the Puppet environment to update, e.g. core_foobar

       -cachedir string
              allows overriding of the g10k configuration file cachedir setting, the folder in which g10k will download git repositories and Forge modules

       -check4update
              only check if the is newer version of the Puppet module available.  Does implicitly set dryrun to true

       -checksum
              get the MD5 check sum for each Puppetlabs Forge module and verify the integrity of the downloaded archive.  Increases g10k run time!

       -config string
              which configuration file to use

       -debug log debug output, defaults to false

       -dryrun
              do not modify anything, just print what would be changed

       -force purge the Puppet environment directory and do a full sync

       -gitobjectsyntaxnotsupported
              if your git version is too old to support reference syntax like master^{object} use this setting to revert to the older syntax

       -info  log info output, defaults to false

       -maxextractworker int
              how many Goroutines are allowed to run in parallel for local Git and Forge module extracting processes (git clone, untar and gunzip) (default 20)

       -maxworker int
              how many Goroutines are allowed to run in parallel for Git and Forge module resolving (default 50)

       -module string
              which module of the Puppet environment to update, e.g. stdlib

       -moduledir string
              allows overriding of Puppetfile specific moduledir setting, the folder in which Puppet modules will be extracted

       -outputname string
              overwrite the environment name if -branch is specified

       -puppetfile
              install all modules from Puppetfile in CWD

       -puppetfilelocation string
              which Puppetfile to use in -puppetfile mode (default “./Puppetfile”)

       -quiet no output, defaults to false

       -retrygitcommands
              if g10k should purge the local repository and retry a failed git command (clone or remote update) instead of failing

       -tags  to pull tags as well as branches

       -usecachefallback
              if g10k should try to use its cache for sources and modules instead of failing

       -usemove
              do not use hardlinks to populate your Puppet environments with Puppetlabs Forge modules.  Instead uses simple move commands and purges the Forge cache directory after each run!  (Useful for
              g10k runs inside Docker container)

       -verbose
              log verbose output, defaults to false

       -version
              show build time and version number

NOTES
       • Before using g10k with a large Puppet setup with many modules, be sure to increase the amount of open file handles (nfiles) and number of child processes (nproc), see limits.conf(5) for details.

       • If you are using a private Git or Forge server think about adjusting the -maxworker parameter before DOSing your own infrastructure (default 50)

       • To protect your local machine use -maxextractworker parameter with which you can limit the number of Goroutines that are allowed to run in parallel for local  Git  and  Forge  module  extracting
         processes (git clone, untar and gunzip) (default 20)

       • To    use    g10k    behind    a   proxy,   set   the   environment   variables   http_proxy   or   https_proxy.    E.g.    http_proxy=http://proxy.domain.tld:8080   ./g10k   -puppetfile.    See
         https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment for details.

ADDITIONAL PUPPETFILE FEATURES
       • link Git module branch to the current environment branch:

         mod 'awesomemodule',
             :git => 'http://github.com/foo/bar.git',
             :link => 'true'

       If you are in environment branch dev then g10k would try to check out this module with branch dev.  This helps to be able to use the same Puppetfile over multiple environment  branches  and  makes
       merges easier.  See https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k/issues/6 for details.

       Now also supports the r10k setting name :branch => :control_branch See https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k/issues/73

       • only clone if branch/tag/commit exists

         mod 'awesomemodule',
             :git => 'http://github.com/foo/bar.git',
             :ignore-unreachable => 'true'

       In combination with the previous link feature you don’t need to keep all environment branches also available for your modules.  See https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k/issues/9 for details.

       • use different Forge base URL for your modules in your Puppetfile

         forge.baseUrl http://foobar.domain.tld/

       • skip version checks for latest Forge modules for a certain time to speed up the sync

         forge.cacheTtl 4h

       You need to specify the TTL value in the form of golang Duration (https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration)

       • try multiple Git branches for a Puppet module until one can be used

         mod 'stdlib',
             :git => 'https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib.git',
             :fallback => '4.889.x|foobar|master'

       In this example g10k tries to use the branches:

       4.889.x -> foobar -> master

       Because there are no branches 4.889.x or foobar.

       All without failing or error messages.

       Tip: You can see which branch was used, when using the -verbose parameter:

              ./g10k -puppetfile -verbose
              2016/11/08 14:16:40 Executing git --git-dir ./tmp/https-__github.com_puppetlabs_puppetlabs-stdlib.git remote update --prune took 1.05001s
              2016/11/08 14:16:40 Executing git --git-dir ./tmp/https-__github.com_puppetlabs_puppetlabs-stdlib.git log -n1 --pretty=format:%H master took 0.00299s
              Synced ./Puppetfile with 4 git repositories and 0 Forge modules in 1.1s with git (1.1s sync, I/O 0.0s) and Forge (0.0s query+download, I/O 0.0s)

       Now also supports the r10k setting name :default_branch => 'master' See https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k/issues/73

       • additional Forge attribute :sha256sum:

       For (some) increased security you can add a SHA256 sum for each Forge module, which g10k will verify after downloading the respective .tar.gz file:

              mod 'puppetlabs/ntp', '6.0.0', :sha256sum => 'a988a172a3edde6ac2a26d0e893faa88d37bc47465afc50d55225a036906c944'

       This does provide a very crude way to detect manipulated Forge modules and MITM attacks until the Puppetlabs Forge does support some sort of signing of Forge module releases.

       If the SHA256 sum does not match the expected hash sum, g10k will warn the user and retry a download until giving up:

              Resolving Forge modules (0/1)   --- [--------------------------------------------------------------------]   0%
              WARNING: calculated sha256sum a988a172a3edde6ac2a26d0e893faa88d37bc47465afc50d55225a036906c944 for ./tmp/puppetlabs-ntp-6.0.0.tar.gz does not match expected sha256sum a988a172a3edde6ac2a26d0e893faa88d37bc47465afc50d55225a036906c94

              2016/12/08 18:05:11 downloadForgeModule(): giving up for Puppet module puppetlabs-ntp version: 6.0.0

       (The Forge module retry count in case the Puppetlabs Forge provided MD5 sum, file archive size or SHA256 sum doesn’t match defaults to 1, but will be user configurable later.)

       • override g10k cache directory with environment variable

       You can use the following environment variable to make g10k use a different cache directory:

              g10k_cachedir=/var/tmp g10k ...

       This will also override the -cachedir parameter.

ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION
       • you can enforce version numbers of Forge modules in your Puppetfiles instead of :latest or :present by adding force_forge_versions: true to the g10k config in the specific resource

         ---
         :cachedir: '/tmp/g10k'

         sources:
           example:
             remote: 'https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment.git'
             basedir: '/tmp/example/'
             force_forge_versions: true

       If g10k then encounters :latest or :present for a Forge module it errors out with:

              2016/11/15 18:45:38 Error: Found present setting for forge module in /tmp/example/example_benchmark/Puppetfile for module puppetlabs/concat line: mod 'puppetlabs/concat' and force_forge_versions is set to true! Please specify a version (e.g. '2.3.0')

       • g10k can let you know if your source does not contain the branch you specified with the -branch parameter:

         ---
         :cachedir: '/tmp/g10k'

         sources:
           example:
             remote: 'https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment.git'
             basedir: '/tmp/example/'
             warn_if_branch_is_missing: true

       If you then call g10k with this configuration file and the following parameter -branch nonExistingBranch.  You should get:

              WARNING: Couldn't find specified branch 'nonExistingBranch' anywhere in source 'example' (https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment.git)

       This can be helpful if you use a dedicated Hiera repository/g10k source and you want to ensure that you always have a matching branch, see https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k/issues/45

       • By default g10k fails if one of your Puppet environments could not be completely populated (e.g. if one of your Puppet Git module branches doesn’t exist anymore).  You can change this by setting
         ignore_unreachable_modules to true in your g10k configuration:

         ---
         :cachedir: '/tmp/g10k'
         ignore_unreachable_modules: true

         sources:
           example:
             remote: 'https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-failing-env.git'
             basedir: '/tmp/failing/'

       If you then call g10k with this configuration file and debug verbosity level, you should get:

              DEBUG: Failed to populate module /tmp/failing/master/modules//sensu/ but ignore-unreachable is set. Continuing...

       See https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k/issues/57 for details.

       • abort g10k run if source repository is unreachable

         ---
         :cachedir: '/tmp/g10k'

         sources:
           example:
             remote: 'git://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment-unavailable.git'
             basedir: '/tmp/example/'
             exit_if_unreachable: true

       If you then call g10k with this configuration file.  You should get:

              WARN: git repository git://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment-unavailable.git does not exist or is unreachable at this moment!
              WARNING: Could not resolve git repository in source 'example' (git://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment-unavailable.git)

       with an exit code 1

       • g10k can use the cached version of Forge and git modules if their sources are currently not available:

         ---
         :cachedir: '/tmp/g10k'
         use_cache_fallback: true

         sources:
           example:
             remote: 'git://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment-unavailable.git'
             basedir: '/tmp/example/'

       If you then call g10k with this configuration file and your github.com repository is unavailable your g10k run tries to find a suitable cached version of your modules:

              WARN: git repository https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall.git does not exist or is unreachable at this moment!
              WARN: Trying to use cache for https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall.git git repository

       if your g10k did manage to at least once cache this git repository.

       If there is no usable cache available your g10k run still fails.

       • You can let g10k retry to git clone or update the local repository if it failed before and was left in a corrupted state:

         ---
         :cachedir: '/tmp/g10k'
         retry_git_commands: true

         sources:
           example:
             remote: 'https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment.git'
             basedir: '/tmp/example/'

       If you then call g10k with this configuration file and have a corrupted local Git repository, g10k deletes the local cache and retries the Git clone command once:

              WARN: git command failed: git --git-dir /tmp/g10k/modules/https-__github.com_puppetlabs_puppetlabs-firewall.git remote update --prune deleting local cached repository and retrying...

       See https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k/issues/76 for details.

       • Autocorrecting Puppet environment names

       Like  in  r10k  (https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k/blob/master/doc/dynamic-environments/git-environments.mkd#invalid_branches) for each source in your g10k configuration you can set the attribute
       invalid_branches with the following values:

       • correct_and_warn: Non-word characters will be replaced with underscores and a warning will be emitted.

       • correct: Non-word characters will silently be replaced with underscores.

       • error: Branches with non-word characters will be ignored and an error will be emitted.

       The default value is to leave the environment unchanged, which differs from the r10k default!

       Example:

              ---
              :cachedir: '/tmp/g10k'

              sources:
                example:
                  remote: 'https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k-environment.git'
                  basedir: '/tmp/example/'
                  invalid_branches: 'correct'

       If you then call g10k with this configuration file and have a branch named something like single_autocorrect-%-fooo it will be renamed to single_autocorrect___fooo

       See https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k/issues/81 for details.
