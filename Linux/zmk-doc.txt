NAME
       Silent — module for supporting silent rules

SYNOPSIS
       include z.mk
       $(eval $(call ZMK.Import,Silent))

DESCRIPTION
       The  Silent module, once imported, provides functions and variables for supporting silent rules.  Silent rules are a configuration option, trading precision of the exact commands used by the build
       system, for better visibility of warnings and other output. When enabled, actual commands executed by Make are hidden and a symbolic representation replaced with a symbolic  representation  devoid
       of details.

       Silent rules are usually a configuration option of a specific build workspace.  To enable, execute the configure script with the option --enable-silent-rules.

TARGETS
       This module does not provide any targets.

VARIABLES
       This module provides the following variables.

   Silent.Active
       The global silent mode toggle. Any non-empty value enables silent rules.  This is automatically configured by the Configure module.

   Silent.Command
       Expands  to @ when silent rules are active. Can be placed in front of commands of a make rule to cause make not to echo the command itself. It should be paired with Silent.Say for the complete ex‐
       perience.

   Silent.Say
       Function expanding to a shell command printing the 1st and 2nd argument.  The first argument should be the symbolic name of the tool, such as CC or LD. The second argument should be the  resulting
       file, i.e. $@.

EXAMPLES
       A hypothetical rule for compiling .foo files to .fooobj files, supporting silent rules, might look like this.

             include z.mk
             $(eval $(call ZMK.Import,Silent))

             %.fooobj: %.foo
                 $(eval $(call Silent.Say,FOOCC,$@))
                 $(Silent.Command)foocc -c $^ -o $@

HISTORY
       The Silent module first appeared in zmk 0.4
