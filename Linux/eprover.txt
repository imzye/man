NAME
       epclextract - manual page for epclextract 3.2.5

SYNOPSIS
       epclextract [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       epclextract 3.2.5

       Read an PCL2 protocol and print the steps necessary for proving the clauses in "proof", "final", or "extract" steps.

       Options

       -h

       --help

              Print a short description of program usage and options.

       -V

       --version

              Print the version number of the program.

       -v

       --verbose[=<arg>]

              Verbose comments on the progress of the program. The short form or the long form without the optional argument is equivalent to --verbose=1.

       -f

       --fast-extract

              Do a fast extract. With this option the program understands only a subset of PCL and assumes that all "proof" and "final" steps are at the end of the protocoll.

       -C

       --forward-comments

              Pass comments found in the input through to the output while reading input.

       -c

       --competition-framing

              Print special "begin" and "end"comments around the proof object, as required by the CASC MIX* class.

       -n

       --no-extract

              Don't extract, print back all steps (actually, it treats all steps as proof steps). Useful as a syntax checker, or if you want to convert PCL to TSTP with the next option.

       --tstp-out

              Print proof protocol in TSTP syntax (default is PCL).

       --tptp3-out

              Synonymous with --tstp-out.

       -o <arg>

       --output-file=<arg>

              Redirect output into the named file.

       -s

       --silent

              Equivalent to --output-level=0.
