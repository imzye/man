AX25IPD(8)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                AX25IPD(8)

NAME
       ax25ipd - AX.25 into IP Encapsulator

SYNOPSIS
       ax25ipd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ax25ipd  is an RFC1226 compliant daemon capable of providing the encap‐
       sualtion neccessary to send and receive  AX.25  traffic  across  an  IP
       transport.

       Normally  invoked  as  part  of  the boot order network initialisation,
       ax25ipd is capable of talking directly to a serial port connected  tnc,
       or  over  a  pipe  to a linux AX.25 port. KAM DE Dual Port Kiss is also
       supported.

       ax25ipd can be run as a pure encapsulator, or  as  a  digital  repeater
       with  a  functional  callsign.  Destination IP addresses are determined
       from a hardcoded map of callsign/IP Address pairs.

       ax25ipd defaults to using /etc/ax25/ax25ipd.conf as its config file.

OPTIONS
       -v,--version
                 Display the version.

       -h,--help Display a summary of the command line options.

       -l,--loglevelNUM
                 Set the logging level to NUM.

       -c,--configfileFILE
                 Use the configuration file named by FILE instead of  the  de‐
                 fault.

       -d,--ttydeviceTTYDEV
                 Use  ttydevice  instead of the configured. This is useful be‐
                 cause on systems with unix98 PTYs the device is allocated dy‐
                 namicaly and thus the name is not predictable.

       -f,--nofork
                 Do not become a daemon. Run in foreground.

FILES
       /etc/ax25/ax25ipd.conf

BUGS
       Routing  needs  to  be  looked at seriously, the method of routing is a
       real hack, and improvements to it have only added to the hack.

       Logging needs to be properly implemented.

       Command line parsing needs to be properly implemented.

       ax25ipd should be part of the Linux AX.25 kernel support probably :-)
