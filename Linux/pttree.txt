NAME
       pttree - prints a quick overview of the contents of PyTables HDF5 files.

SYNOPSIS
       pttree [ OPTIONS ] filename[:nodepath]

DESCRIPTION
       pttree  is  designed to give a quick overview of the contents of a PyTables HDF5 file by printing a depth-indented list of nodes, similar to the output of the Unix `tree` function. It can also display
       the size, shape and compression states of individual nodes, as well as summary information for the whole file.  For a more verbose output (including metadata), see `ptdump`.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -L MAX_DEPTH, --max-level MAX_DEPTH
              maximum branch depth of tree to display (-1 == no limit)

       -S SORT_BY, --sort-by SORT_BY
              artificially order nodes, can be either "size", "name" or "none"

       --print-size
              print size of each node/branch

       --no-print-size

       --print-shape
              print shape of each node

       --no-print-shape

       --print-compression
              print compression library(level) for each compressed node

       --no-print-compression

       --print-percent
              print size of each node as a % of the total tree size on disk

       --no-print-percent

       --use-si-units
              report sizes in SI units (1 MB == 10^6 B)

       --use-binary-units
              report sizes in binary units (1 MiB == 2^20 B)

       -h     Print help on usage.
