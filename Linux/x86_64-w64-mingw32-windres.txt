NAME
       windres - manipulate Windows resources

SYNOPSIS
       windres [options] [input-file] [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       windres reads resources from an input file and copies them into an output file.  Either file may be in one of three formats:

       "rc"
           A text format read by the Resource Compiler.

       "res"
           A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.

       "coff"
           A COFF object or executable.

       The exact description of these different formats is available in documentation from Microsoft.

       When windres converts from the "rc" format to the "res" format, it is acting like the Windows Resource Compiler.  When windres converts from the "res" format
       to the "coff" format, it is acting like the Windows "CVTRES" program.

       When windres generates an "rc" file, the output is similar but not identical to the format expected for the input.  When an input "rc" file refers to an
       external filename, an output "rc" file will instead include the file contents.

       If the input or output format is not specified, windres will guess based on the file name, or, for the input file, the file contents.  A file with an
       extension of .rc will be treated as an "rc" file, a file with an extension of .res will be treated as a "res" file, and a file with an extension of .o or
       .exe will be treated as a "coff" file.

       If no output file is specified, windres will print the resources in "rc" format to standard output.

       The normal use is for you to write an "rc" file, use windres to convert it to a COFF object file, and then link the COFF file into your application.  This
       will make the resources described in the "rc" file available to Windows.

OPTIONS
       -i filename
       --input filename
           The name of the input file.  If this option is not used, then windres will use the first non-option argument as the input file name.  If there are no
           non-option arguments, then windres will read from standard input.  windres can not read a COFF file from standard input.

       -o filename
       --output filename
           The name of the output file.  If this option is not used, then windres will use the first non-option argument, after any used for the input file name, as
           the output file name.  If there is no non-option argument, then windres will write to standard output.  windres can not write a COFF file to standard
           output.  Note, for compatibility with rc the option -fo is also accepted, but its use is not recommended.

       -J format
       --input-format format
           The input format to read.  format may be res, rc, or coff.  If no input format is specified, windres will guess, as described above.

       -O format
       --output-format format
           The output format to generate.  format may be res, rc, or coff.  If no output format is specified, windres will guess, as described above.

       -F target
       --target target
           Specify the BFD format to use for a COFF file as input or output.  This is a BFD target name; you can use the --help option to see a list of supported
           targets.  Normally windres will use the default format, which is the first one listed by the --help option.

       --preprocessor program
           When windres reads an "rc" file, it runs it through the C preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify the preprocessor to use.  The default
           preprocessor is "gcc".

       --preprocessor-arg option
           When windres reads an "rc" file, it runs it through the C preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify additional text to be passed to
           preprocessor on its command line.  This option can be used multiple times to add multiple options to the preprocessor command line.  If the
           --preprocessor option has not been specified then a default set of preprocessor arguments will be used, with any --preprocessor-arg options being placed
           after them on the command line.  These default arguments are "-E", "-xc-header" and "-DRC_INVOKED".

       -I directory
       --include-dir directory
           Specify an include directory to use when reading an "rc" file.  windres will pass this to the preprocessor as an -I option.  windres will also search
           this directory when looking for files named in the "rc" file.  If the argument passed to this command matches any of the supported formats (as described
           in the -J option), it will issue a deprecation warning, and behave just like the -J option.  New programs should not use this behaviour.  If a directory
           happens to match a format, simple prefix it with ./ to disable the backward compatibility.

       -D target
       --define sym[=val]
           Specify a -D option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an "rc" file.

       -U target
       --undefine sym
           Specify a -U option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an "rc" file.

       -r  Ignored for compatibility with rc.

       -v  Enable verbose mode.  This tells you what the preprocessor is if you didn't specify one.

       -c val
       --codepage val
           Specify the default codepage to use when reading an "rc" file.  val should be a hexadecimal prefixed by 0x or decimal codepage code. The valid range is
           from zero up to 0xffff, but the validity of the codepage is host and configuration dependent.

       -l val
       --language val
           Specify the default language to use when reading an "rc" file.  val should be a hexadecimal language code.  The low eight bits are the language, and the
           high eight bits are the sublanguage.

       --use-temp-file
           Use a temporary file to instead of using popen to read the output of the preprocessor. Use this option if the popen implementation is buggy on the host
           (eg., certain non-English language versions of Windows 95 and Windows 98 are known to have buggy popen where the output will instead go the console).

       --no-use-temp-file
           Use popen, not a temporary file, to read the output of the preprocessor.  This is the default behaviour.

       -h
       --help
           Prints a usage summary.

       -V
       --version
           Prints the version number for windres.

       --yydebug
           If windres is compiled with "YYDEBUG" defined as 1, this will turn on parser debugging.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read,
           then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself
           contain additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
