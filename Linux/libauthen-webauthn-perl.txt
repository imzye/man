NAME
       Authen::WebAuthn - A library to add Web Authentication support to server applications

VERSION
       version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
       This module lets you validate Web Authentication <https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/> registration and authentication responses.

       Currently, it does not handle the generation of registration and authentication requests.

       The transmission of requests and responses from the application server to the user's browser, and interaction with the WebAuthn browser API is also out of scope and could be handled by a dedicated
       JS library.

       To register a new device:

           # Obtain registration response from web browser
           # Then,
           my $webauthn_rp = Authen::WebAuthn->new(
               rp_id  => "app.example.com",
               origin => "https://app.example.com"
           );

           my $registration_result = eval {
               $webauthn_rp->validate_registration(
                   challenge_b64          => ... ,
                   requested_uv           => ... ,
                   client_data_json_b64   => ... ,
                   attestation_object_b64 => ... ,
                   token_binding_id_b64   => ... ,
               )
           };
           if ($@) {
               die "Error validating registration: $@";
           }

       To authenticate a user:

           # Obtain authentication response from web browser
           # Then,
           my $webauthn_rp = Authen::WebAuthn->new(
               rp_id  => "app.example.com",
               origin => "https://app.example.com"
           );

           my $validation_result = eval {
               $webauthn_rp->validate_assertion(
                   challenge_b64          => ...,
                   credential_pubkey_b64  => ...,
                   stored_sign_count      => ...,
                   requested_uv           => ...,
                   client_data_json_b64   => ...,
                   authenticator_data_b64 => ...,
                   signature_b64          => ...,
                   extension_results      => ...,
                   token_binding_id_b64   => ...,
                   trust_anchors          => ...,
               )
           };
           if ($@) {
               die "Error validating authentication: $@";
           }

ATTRIBUTES
   rp_id
       The identifier of your Relying Party. Usually, this is set to the domain name over which your application is accessed (app.example.com).

   origin
       The origin, as defined by the HTML standard, that your Relying Party is expecting to find in registration or authentication responses. This must contain the scheme and port of your application,
       but no path (http://app.example.com:8080 or https://app.example.com)

METHODS
   validate_registration
       This method validates the registration response emitted by the authenticator.

       It takes the following named arguments

       challenge_b64
           The base64url-encoded challenge that was submitted to the authenticator

       requested_uv
           Whether or not the Relying Party required user verification for this operation.  Possible values are "required", "preferred", "discouraged".

       client_data_json_b64
           The base64url-encoded client data received from the authenticator

       attestation_object_b64
           The base64url-encoded attestation object received from the authenticator

       token_binding_id_b64
           The  base64url-encoded Token Binding ID for the current connection. Usually this comes from a "Sec-Provided-Token-Binding-ID" HTTP header. If you are not using Token Binding, you can omit this
           parameter.

       trust_anchors
           If the authenticator response contains an attestation, "validate_registration" will attempt to chain it to a trusted root certificate.  You need to explicitly  specify  which  certificates  to
           trust if your authenticator provides an attestation.

           If you requested "none" as an attestation format while initiating the registration flow, there is no need to provide any trust anchors.

           This optional parameter can either be an arrayref of strings representing PEM-encoded certificates, or a subref which returns a arrayref of PEM-encoded certificates:

               sub {
                   my (%params) = @_;
                   my $aaguid = $params{'aaguid'};
                   my $attestation_type = $params{'attestation_type'};
                   my $attestation_format = $params{'attestation_format'};
                   ...
                   return [ $pem1, $pem2, ...];
               }

       allowed_attestation_types
           If you want to restrict the allowed attestation types, you can pass an arrayref of strings as the "allowed_attestation_types" parameter.

           Currently supported values are "None","Self","Basic"

           By default, all attestation types are allowed

       allow_untrusted_attestation
           By  default,  if  an  attestation  type  such  as  "Basic"  is  used  by  the  authenticator and a correct trust_anchor could not be found, the validation will fail as mandated by the WebAuthn
           specification. However, in some cases it is permitted to allow the registration to proceed, but treat it as "Self" attestation.

           This setting allows you to successfully validate registration, but change the type to "Self" if a trusted certificate was not provided in the "trust_anchors" parameter.

       allow_unknown_attestation_format
           By default, if an unimplemented attestation format is encountered, registration validation will fail.

           This setting allows you to successfully validate registration, but change the attestation type to "None" if an unimplemented attestation format is encountered.

       This method croaks on errors. If the registration was successful, it returns a hashref with the following subkeys:

       credential_id
           The base64url-encoded credential ID for this authenticator

       credential_pubkey
           The base64url-encoded public key for this authenticator, in COSE format

       signature_count
           The initial signature count of this authenticator

       This information is supposed to be persisted in the Relying Party, usually in some sort of database

       The following keys are also returned:

       attestation_result
           Contains information about the result of the attestation validation

           type
               The type of attestation used by the authenticator: "None", "Self", "Basic", ...

           trust_path
               An arrayref of DER-encoded certificates provided by the authenticator

           aaguid
               The verified AAGUID of the authenticator, this is only provided if the attestation was verified successfully and chained up to a trusted root certificate.

   validate_assertion
       This method validates the registration response emitted by the authenticator.

       It takes the following named arguments

       challenge_b64
           The base64url-encoded challenge that was submitted to the authenticator

       credential_pubkey_b64
           The base64url-encoded credential public key corresponding to the received Credential ID

       stored_sign_count
           The current signature count in the Relying Party's database. Set it to 0 to disable verification of the signature count

       requested_uv
           Whether or not the Relying Party required user verification for this operation.  Possible values are "required", "preferred", "discouraged".

       client_data_json_b64
           The base64url-encoded client data received from the authenticator

       authenticator_data_b64
           The base64url-encoded authenticator data received from the authenticator

       signature_b64
           The base64url-encoded signature received from the authenticator

       extension_results
           A hashref containing extension results received from the authenticator

       token_binding_id_b64
           The base64url-encoded Token Binding ID for the current connection. Usually this comes from a "Sec-Provided-Token-Binding-ID" HTTP header. If you are not using Token Binding, you can omit  this
           parameter.

       This method croaks on errors. If the registration was successful, it returns a hashref with the following subkeys:

       signature_count
           The new signature count, to be updated in the Relying Party's database

   convert_raw_ecc_to_cose
           my $cose_b64 = Authen::WebAuthn::convert_raw_ecc_to_cose($u2f_b64);

       This  method  takes  the  base64url-encoded raw ECC key (U2F format) and converts it to a base64url-encoded COSE representation. It can be useful for converting existing U2F device registration to
       WebAuthen device registrations in your Relying Party.

CAVEAT
       This module only supports the "None" attestation type at the moment, which means Relying Parties cannot have a strong guarantee of the authenticator's security properties. This makes  it  possible
       for users to register weak authenticators.

       Because of that, is it not recommended to use this module in passwordless authentication scenarios. However, it should be good enough for using security keys as a second factor.

       This limitation may be addressed in a future version.
