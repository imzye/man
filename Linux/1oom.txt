NAME

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the 1oom_classic_sdl2 command.

       1oom  is  a re-implementation of the game engine from the classic Master of Orion game, developed by Simtex Software and published by Microprose in 1993.  1oom_classic_sdl2 is the SDL2 frontend to
       that engine.

FILES
       1oom requires a copy of the Master of Orion (v1.3) LBX files. See /usr/share/doc/1oom/lbxmd5.txt for the expected MD5sums.

       According to the XDG standard, 1oom will check the following directories for the LBX files (in order):

       1. $XDG_DATA_HOME/1oom

       2. $XDG_DATA_DIRS/1oom

       3. ~/.local/share/1oom

       4. /usr/share/games/master-of-orion

       5. /usr/share/1oom

       6. /usr/local/share/1oom

       You can also override this and specify your own path to look for the LBX files by passing the command-line argument -data <path> when running 1oom.  The given path is saved  to  the  configuration
       file.
