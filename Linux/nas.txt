NAME
       nasd.conf - Configuration file for NAS servers.

DESCRIPTION
       nasd.conf  Is  a file that can be used to configure the behaiviour of the NAS server, including what devices it will attempt to use, the minimum & maximum frequencies used, if the device should be
       used in 8bit or 16bit mode, what fragment size and number of fragments should be used (useful for tuning the server's latency) and if the server should be verbose when starting or output debugging
       information. Not all options are supported for all servers, see the /etc/nas/nasd.conf.eg file for information on what options are supported for which servers.

THE CONFIG FILE SYNTAX
       There are up to three section in the config file. The first section deals with global options, some of which just turn on verbose messages when parsing the config file, and setting debug  messages
       on. The remaining two sections will, if present, adjust various parameters of the input and output devices, for those servers that understand them.

       verbose Sets a flag telling the server to report what it's trying to do with each setting in the config file. This option is off by default.

       debug  <number>  Sets the debug flag, which will provide a trace of the server's activities on stderr. Set <number> to 0 to disable debug messages, 99 for *alot* of debug messages. This option de‐
       faults to 0.

       ReleaseDevice YES | NO Set to YES or NO. Defines whether the server should release the audio device when finished playing or recording a sound. This option defaults to YES. (voxware, hpux, sun)

       KeepMixer YES | NO Set to YES or NO.  Defines whether the server should keep the mixer open when releasing the audio device. Without an open mixer device the server will always report the  default
       gain and line mode and cannot change them either. This option defaults to YES. (voxware)

       MixerInit  YES  | NO Set to YES or NO. Defines whether the server will init the mixer device on startup. Later changes of gain or input mode will change the mixer settings. This option defaults to
       NO. (voxware)

       ReInitMixer YES | NO Set to YES or NO. Defines whether the server will re-init the mixer device on every audio device open. The mixer is re-initialized only if it is initialized  at  startup  (see
       MixerInit option). This option defaults to NO. (voxware)

       OutDevType EXT | INT For HPUX servers, define to EXT to use the external output device (headphone/speakers) or INT for the internal output device (internal speaker). Defaults to EXT.

       outputsection Marks the beginning of the output section, which allows various parameters of the output device to be set up.

       inputsection Marks the beginning of the input section, which allows various parameters of the input device to be set up.

       end Marks the end of the input section or output section.

       device <devname> Specifies what device is used. An example is device "/dev/dsp".  With the voxware server you can use the empty string "" to disable the device.

       mixer <mixername> Specifies what mixer device is used. An example is mixer "/dev/mixer".  If <mixername> is set to the empty string "" no mixer is used in this section.

       gain <number> Specifies the default volume (0-100). The default is 50.

       gainscale <number> This factor (expressed as a percentage) is applied to all volume-setting requests. This lets the server transparently limit the actual maximum volume that can be set by clients.
       The default is 100.

       maxrate <number> The maximum number of samples per second that we'll drive the card at.

       minrate <number> The minimum number of samples per second that the card will be driven at.

       maxfrags <number> The maximum number of of kernel buffers that will be used for the device.  the number is dynamically adjusted as the sampling frequency varies.

       minfrags <number> The minimum number of kernel buffers that will be used.

       fragsize <number> The size of each buffer - note that the size must be a power of 2.

       wordsize <number> The number of bits per sample. Allowable values are 8 and 16.

       numchans <number> Used to decide if the card is run in stereo or mono mode. Allowable values are 1 or 2.

       forcerate no | yes Forces the output rate to the current rate. The default is no.

       autoOpen no | yes Whether to open the device at init time (if ReleaseDevice = no).  The default is yes.

       readwrite no | yes Whether or not to open the device read-write. The default is no.  If set to yes, then the device will be opened read-write. There should be no need to set this to yes, but...
