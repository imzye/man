NAME
       mdsum - compute file digests using any supported algorithms.

SYNOPSIS
       mdsum [options] [paths...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command computes a message digest for one or more specified files.  If no files are specified, then stdin can be used.  Any digest algorithm available in libusecure may be selected and used.
       Entire directory trees may also be examined and computed using the -R (--recursive) option.

OPTIONS
       --digest=name
              Specify name of digest algorithm.  By default md5 will be used, unless the command is executed through a symlink which happens to match an algorithm name.

       --follow
              Dereference and follow symlinks.  Otherwise they are ignored.

       --recursive
              If argument is a directory, recursively scan directory and any subdirectory contents as arguments.

       --help Outputs help screen for the user.
