NAME
       Test::AutoLoader - a testing utility for autosplit/autoloaded modules.

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::AutoLoader;
         use Test::More tests => 3;

         use_ok("My::Module"); # from Test::More
         autoload_ok("My::Module","mysub","sub_two); # test only the listed subs
         autoload_ok("My::Module"); # tests all '.al' files found for the module

DESCRIPTION
       This single-purpose module attempts to eliminate uncaught syntax errors or other obvious goofs in subroutines that are autosplit, and hence not looked at by "perl -c Module.pm".  Ideally, this
       module will become unnecessary as you reach full coverage of those subroutines in your unit tests.  Until that happy day, however, this should provide a quick and dirty backstop for embarrassing
       typos.

       Test::AutoLoader is built on Test::Builder, and should interoperate smoothly with other such modules (e.g. Test::Simple, Test::More).

EXPORT
   autoload_ok
       Very much like the 'use_ok' subroutine (see Test::More).  If passed only a module name, it will find all subroutine definitions in the "auto" directory and attempt to compile them.  If passed a
       list of subroutine names, it will look for and attempt to compile those (and only those).  Any files that cannot be found (if specified directly), read, and compiled will be listed in the
       diagnostic output for the failed test.
