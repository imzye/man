NAME
       bluraybackup - Tool to backup Blu-ray Disc Movies (BDMV)

SYNOPSIS
       bluraybackup [-d device] [-k keyfile] [FILE] [DEST]

       bluraybackup [-d device] [-k keyfile] -m [DEST]

       bluraybackup [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       bluraybackup backups Blu-ray Disc Movies (BDMV), inspired by dvdbackup, developed in ANSI C (C89) following the suckless philosophy.

       It makes a decrypted copy of the whole Blu-ray Disc Movie or it extracts a decrypted version of a specific BDMV stream.

       This program may not work with all Blu-rays.  It both depends on your KEYDB.cfg file and on the BD+ generation (version).

       To successfully decrypt a Blu-ray Disc Movie you both need libaacs installed and a KEYDB.cfg file, containing your disc keys.

       Moreover,  if  your disc is plagued by BD+ as well, you need to install libbdplus.  BD+ is a form of copy obstruction, which consists in writing video streams to disc with small errors.  These er‐
       rors get fixed during playback by a virtual machine embedded in official players, only if the player keys are verified by the same virtual machine.  libbdplus is an implementation of the BD+  vir‐
       tual machine features.  However it doesn't support all the BD+ generations.  Since libbdplus 0.2.0, it's possible to bypass BD+ emulation, using cached tables to fix the broken streams.

OPTIONS
       -d, --device device
              defines Blu-ray disc device (default /dev/sr0)

       -h, --help
              print usage message

       -k, --keydb keyfile
              defines keys database file path (default $HOME/.config/aacs/KEYDB.cfg)

       -m, --main
              copy main Blu-ray disc title (see USAGE)

       -v, --version
              print version and license information

USAGE
       bluraybackup [-d device] [-k keyfile] [FILE] [DEST]

       Without FILE, the whole disc will be copied to the current directory.  FILE must be a file path relative to the disc root.

       Without DEST, the decrypted FILE will be sent to standard output.  DEST path must include file name.

       bluraybackup [-d device] [-k keyfile] -m [DEST]

       Without DEST, the main disc title will be sent to standard output.  DEST path must include file name.

EXIT VALUES
       0 - Successful copy

       1 - Everything else
