NAME
       yforth - a small, free Forth implementation

SYNOPSIS
       yforth

DESCRIPTION
       This is a small implementation of the Forth programming language, somewhat easier to read than larger Forth implementations like Gforth.

       It is not being actively developed or maintained.  If you find it useful, great.  If not, don't expect much help.  The www.forth.org site is a good place to get more general information on Forth.

       Serious Forth authors would be advised to use Gforth instead of this package.
