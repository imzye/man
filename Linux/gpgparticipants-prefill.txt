NAME
       gpgparticipants-prefill - insert checksum-digits in a gpgparticicpants' form

SYNOPSIS
       gpgparticipants-prefill [OPTIONS] EMPTYLIST FILLEDLIST

DESCRIPTION
       gpgparticipants-prefill  takes  a  file  produced by gpgparticipants (EMPTYLIST) and tries to fill in some digits into the SHA256 field such that the resulting list actually has a SHA256 checksum that
       starts with those digits.  In other words, it tries to produce a file that hashes to a checksum that is partially written down in the file.  Whenever a match is found, a file with the digits filled in
       is written to FILLEDLIST.DIGITS.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help

       --fastforward
               If a match is found of some length, immediately jump to the next length.
