NAME
       sdate - never ending September date

SYNOPSIS
       sdate [-e|--epoch yyyy-mm] [-c|--covid vv] [-l|--lib library] [--] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       sdate  runs  a  command in an environment wherein it wraps the libc localtime() and gmtime() calls such that the program will use the eternal September date.  The wrapper functions are in a shared
       library /usr/lib/libsdate/libsdate.so* which is loaded through the LD_PRELOAD mechanism of the dynamic loader. (See ld.so(8))

OPTIONS
       -e yyyy-mm, --epoch yyyy-mm
              Specify an alternative epoch, default is 1993-09.

       -c vv, --covid vv
              Enable COVID mode, for the specified variant. Sets epoch to an appropriate value for the variant.

       -l library, --lib library
              Specify an alternative wrapper library.

       [--] command
              Any command you want to be ran. Use ‘--’ if in the command you have other options that may confuse sdate's option parsing.

       -h     Display help.

       -v     Display version.

FILES
       /usr/lib/libsdate/* The shared library containing the wrapper functions.

ENVIRONMENT
       LD_PRELOAD

LIMITATIONS
       Library versions
              Every command executed within sdate needs to be linked to the same version of the C library as sdate itself.
