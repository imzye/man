NAME
       WWW::IndexParser - Fetch and parse the directory index from a web server

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::IndexParser;
        my @files = WWW::IndexParser->new(url => 'http://www.example.com/dir/');
        foreach my $entry (@files) {
          printf "%s %s\n", $entry->filename,
               scalar(localtime($entry->time)||'');
        }

DESCRIPTION
       WWW::IndexParser is a module that uses LWP to fetch a URL from a web server. It then atempts to parse this page as if it were an auto generated index page.  It returns an array of
       WWW::IndexParser::Entry objects, one per entry in the directory index that it has found. Each Entry has a set of methods: filename(), time(), size(), and others if supported by the autoindex
       generated: type() and size_units().

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( url => $url, timeout => $seconds, proxy => $proxy_url, debug => 1  )
           When called with a URL to examine, this method does not return an object, but an array of WWW::IndexParser::Entry obects, one per entry in the directory listing that was accessed.

           The options to this are:

           url The complete URL of the index to fetch.

           timeout
               The timeout for the request to fetch data, default 10 seconds.

           proxy
               A proxy server URL, eg, 'http://proxy:3128/'.

           debug
               Decide if to print parsing debug information. Set to 0 (the default) to disable, or anything non-false to print. Recommended you use a digit (ie, 1) as this may become a numeric 'level' of
               debug in the future.

METHODS
       All methods are private in this module. Pass only a URL to the constructor, and it does everything for you itself.

PREREQUISUTES
       This modile depends upon "LWP", "HTML::Parser", "Time::Local".

OSNAMES
       any

BUGS
       Currently only supports Apache, IIS and Tomcat style auto indexes. Send suggestions for new Auto-Indexes to support to the author (along with sample HTML)!
