SHELL COMPLETION
   ZSH
       There are no shell completions yet (contributions welcome) but for zsh it is possible to automatically create completions from --help which might work good enough.

       Just place the following in your ~/.zshrc or ~/.zshrc.local:

           compdef _gnu_generic xmpp-dns

   FISH
       There are no shell completions yet, but FISH can generate them from the man page with following command:

           fish_update_completions
