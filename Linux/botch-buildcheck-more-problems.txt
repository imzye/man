NAME
       botch-buildcheck-more-problems - a tool like dose-builddebcheck but return more than the first reason

SYNOPSIS
       botch-buildcheck-more-problems [-h] [-v] Packages Sources

DESCRIPTION
       This is a wrapper around dose-builddebcheck. It accepts the exact same commandline arguments and it outputs the same yaml format. The only difference is, that instead of only giving on reason for why
       a source package cannot be compiled, it gives multiple reasons.
