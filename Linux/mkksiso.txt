       mkksiso - Make Kickstart ISO Utility Documentation

       mkksiso  is  a  tool for creating kickstart boot isos. In it's simplest
       form you can add a kickstart to a boot.iso and the  kickstart  will  be
       executed  when  the iso is booted. If the original iso was created with
       EFI and Mac support the kickstart boot.iso will include this support as
       well.

       mkksiso  needs  to  be run as root, it depends on mounting the original
       iso and you need to be root to be able to do that.

MKKSISO CMDLINE ARGUMENTS
       Add a kickstart and files to an iso
          usage:  mkksiso  [-h]  [-a  ADD_PATHS]  [-c  CMDLINE]  [--debug]  ks
          input_iso output_iso

   Optional arguments
          -h, --help
                 show this help message and exit

          -a ADD_PATHS, --add ADD_PATHS
                 File or directory to add to ISO (may be used multiple times)

          -c CMDLINE, --cmdline CMDLINE
                 Arguments to add to kernel cmdline

          --debug
                 print debugging info

          -V VOLID, --volid VOLID
                 Set the ISO volume id, defaults to input's

   Positional arguments
          ks     Kickstart to add to the ISO

          input_iso
                 ISO to modify

          output_iso
                 Full pathname of iso to be created

CREATE A KICKSTART BOOT.ISO OR DVD
       Create a kickstart like you normally would, kickstart documentation can
       be found here, including the url and repo commands.  If you are  creat‐
       ing  a  DVD  and only need the content on the DVD you can use the cdrom
       command to install without a network connection. Then run mkksiso  like
       this:

          mkksiso /PATH/TO/KICKSTART /PATH/TO/ISO /PATH/TO/NEW-ISO

       This  will  create  a new iso with the kickstart in the root directory,
       and the kernel cmdline will have inst.ks=... added to  it  so  that  it
       will  be  executed  when the iso is booted (be careful not to boot on a
       system you don't want to wipe out! There will be no prompting).

       By default the volume id of the iso is preserved. You can set a  custom
       volid  by  passing -V and the string to set. The kernel cmdline will be
       changes, and the iso will have th custom volume id.  eg.:

          mkksiso -V "Test Only" /PATH/TO/KICKSTART /PATH/TO/ISO /PATH/TO/NEW-ISO

ADDING PACKAGE REPOS TO A BOOT.ISO
       You can add repo directories to the  iso  using  --add  /PATH/TO/REPO/,
       make sure it contains the repodata directory by running createrepo_c on
       it first. In the kickstart you can refer to the directories (and files)
       on  the iso using file:///run/install/repo/DIRECTORY/. You can then use
       these repos in the kickstart like this:

          repo --name=extra-repo --baseurl=file:///run/install/repo/extra-repo/

       Run mkksiso like so:

          mkksiso --add /PATH/TO/REPO/ /PATH/TO/KICKSTART /PATH/TO/ISO /PATH/TO/NEW-ISO

CREATE A LIVEIMG BOOT.ISO
       You can use the kickstart liveimg command, to install  a  pre-generated
       disk image or tar to the system the iso is booting on.

       Create  a disk image or tar with osbuild-composer or livemedia-creator,
       make sure the image includes tools expected by anaconda, as well as the
       kernel  and  bootloader support.  In osbuild-composer use the tar image
       type and make sure to include the kernel, grub2, and grub2-tools  pack‐
       ages.  If you plan to install it to a UEFI machine make sure to include
       grub2-efi and efibootmgr in the blueprint.

       Add the root.tar.xz file to the iso using  --add  /PATH/TO/ROOT.TAR.XZ,
       and in the kickstart reference it with the liveimg command like this:

          liveimg --url=file:///run/install/repo/root.tar.xz

       It is also a good idea to use the --checksum argument to liveimg  to be
       sure the file hasn't been corrupted:

          mkksiso --add /PATH/TO/root.tar.xz /PATH/TO/KICKSTART /PATH/TO/ISO /PATH/TO/NEW-ISO

       When this iso is booted it will execute the kickstart and  install  the
       liveimg contents to the system without any prompting.

HOW IT WORKS
       mkksiso  first  examines the system to make sure the tools it needs are
       installed, it will work with xorrisofs or mkisofs installed. It  mounts
       the  source iso, and copies the directories that need to be modified to
       a temporary directory.

       It then modifies the boot configuration files to  include  the  inst.ks
       command, and checks to see if the original iso supports EFI. If it does
       it regenerates the EFI boot images with the new configuration, and then
       runs  the available iso creation tool to add the new files and directo‐
       ries to the new iso. If the architecture is x86_64 it  will  also  make
       sure the iso can be booted as an iso or from a USB stick (hybridiso).

       The  last step is to update the iso checksums so that booting with test
       enabled will pass.
