NAME
       rgxg_utils_alternation - create regex that matches any of the given patterns

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rgxg/utils.h>

       int rgxg_utils_alternation (const char **patterns, size_t size,
            char *regex, rgxg_options_t options);

DESCRIPTION
       rgxg_utils_alternation()  generates  the  (extended) regular expression that matches any of the given patterns, an array of constant character strings.  size specifies the number of entries of the
       array to use for the regular expression. Both patterns and its entries must be valid and not NULL for size>0.

       Note that callers of rgxg_utils_alternation() which pass a non-constant 'char **' value as patterns need to use an explicit cast (i.e. '(const char**)') to avoid an incompatible pointer type warn‐
       ing.

       The generated regular expression is written to the character string regex, including the terminating null byte ('\0'), unless RGXG_NONULLBYTE is set. If regex is NULL the return value is the  num‐
       ber  of  characters  (excluding the terminating null byte) that would have been written in case regex has been initialized. Note that the functions assume an arbitrarily long regex string, callers
       must ensure that the given string is large enough to not overflow the actual space.

       options is either zero, or the bitwise-or of one or more of the following macros:

       RGXG_NOOUTERPARENS
              Omit the outer parenthesis, if any, of the regular expression.

       RGXG_NONULLBYTE
              Do not add the terminating null byte ('\0') to the regex string.

RETURN VALUE
       rgxg_utils_alternation() returns the number of characters (excluding the terminating null byte) written to regex.

AVAILABILITY
       This function is available since rgxg 0.1.
