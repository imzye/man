NAME
       ajdoc — generate HTML API documentation, including crosscutting structure

SYNOPSIS
       ajdoc  [         -bootclasspath  classpathlist        ]   [         -classpath  classpathlist        ]  [-d path]  [-help]  [-package]  [-protected]  [-private]  [-public]  [-overview overviewFile]  [
       -sourcepath sourcepathlist       ]  [-verbose]  [-version]  [sourcefiles...  | packages...  | @file...  | -argfile file... ]  [        ajc options       ]

Description
       ajdoc renders HTML documentation for AspectJ constructs as well as the Java constructs that javadoc renders.  In addition ajdoc displays the crosscutting nature in the form of links. That  means,  for
       example, that you can see everything affecting a method when reading the documentation for the method.

       To  run  ajdoc,  use  one of the scripts in the AspectJ bin directory.  The ajdoc implementation builds on Sun's javadoc command line tool, and you use it in the same way with many of the same options
       (javadoc options are not documented here; for more information on javadoc usage, see the Javadoc homepage http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/) .

       As with ajc (but unlike javadoc), you pass ajdoc all your aspect source files and any files containing types affected by the aspects; it's often easiest to just pass all the .java  and  .aj  files  in
       your system.  Unlike ajc, ajdoc will try to find package sources using the specified sourcepath if you list packages on the command line.

       To  provide an argfile listing the source files, you can use use the same argfile (@filename) conventions as with ajc.  For example, the following documents all the source files listed in argfile.lst,
       sending the output to the docDir output directory.

       ajdoc -d docDir @argfile.lst

       See the ajc documentation for details on the text file format.

       ajdoc honours ajc options. See the ajc documentation for details on these options.

       ajdoc currently requires the tools.jar from J2SE 1.3 to be on the classpath.  Normally the scripts set this up, assuming that your JAVA_HOME       variable points to  an  appropriate  installation  of
       Java.  You may need to provide this jar when using a different version of Java or a JRE.

Examples
       Documenting Spacewar

          •  Change into the examples directory.

          •  Type mkdir doc destination directory for the documentation.

          •  Type ajdoc -private -d doc spacewar coordination

                •  (Use -private to get all members, since may of the interesting ones in spacewar are not public.)

          •  Type ajdoc -private -d doc @spacewar/demo.lst to use the argfile associated with Spacewar.

          •  To view the documentation, open the file index.html in the doc directory using a web browser.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       ajdoc(1)
