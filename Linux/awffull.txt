awffull.conf(5)                                                                                                                                                                             awffull.conf(5)

NAME
       AWFFull - A Webalizer Fork, Full o' features

DESCRIPTION
       awffull.conf is the configuration file for awffull(1). awffull.conf is a standard ASCII(7) text files that may be created or edited using any standard editor.

       Blank lines and lines that begin with a pound sign ('#') are ignored.

       Any  other lines are considered to be configuration lines, and have the form ‘Keyword Value’, where the ‘Keyword’ is one of the currently available configuration keywords, and ‘Value’ is the value
       to assign to that particular option.

       Any text found after the keyword up to the end of the line is considered the keyword's value, so you should not include anything after the actual value on the line that is not actually part of the
       value being assigned. The file sample.conf provided with the distribution contains lots of useful documentation and examples as well.

       Some ‘Keywords’ will accept a 2^nd value. In those situations, the first value may be enclosed in double quotes (") to allow for whitespace.

       Keywords are Case Insensitive. Values are Case Sensitive, with some gotchas: See Ignore* for details.

WILDCARDS
       Wildcards within AWFFull are a little non standard and may cause some confusion.

       Wildcards are only valid within the Value of certain keywords

       A Value can have either a leading or trailing '*' to signify a wildcard character. If no wildcard is found, a match can occur anywhere in the string. Given a string ‘www.yourmama.com’, the  values
       ‘your’, ‘*mama.com’ and ‘www.your*’ will all match.

       Thus the use of the wildcard signifies that the other end of the Value is anchored at the Beginning or End of a field to be searched against.

       eg. A Value of ‘Bot*’ implies that the field (probably UserAgent in this case) MUST start with the letters Bot. Or in the case of a Hostname ‘*.gov.au’ implies a match ONLY against Australian Gov‐
       ernment hostnames.

RUN OPTIONS
       The Run Options are the generic ones that tell AWFFull where stuff is and how to generally operate. Some of these can modify the results that AWFFull will produce.

       OutputDir
              OutputDir  is  where you want to put the output files. This should should be a full path name, however relative ones might work as well. If no output directory is specified, the current di‐
              rectory will be used.

       LogFile
              LogFile defines the web server log file to use. If not specified here or on on the command line, input will default to STDIN. If the log filename ends in '.gz' (ie: a gzip compressed file),
              it will be decompressed on the fly as it is being read.

       LogType
              LogType defines the log type being processed. Normally, AWFFull expects a CLF or Combined web server log as input. Using this option, you can process ftp logs as well (xferlog  as  produced
              by  wu-ftpd  and others), or Squid native logs. Values can be 'auto' 'clf', 'combined', 'ftp', 'domino' or 'squid', with 'auto' the default. The 'auto' value means that AWFFull will try and
              work out what log format you are sending to it. If no joy, AWFFull will immediately exit.

       GeoIP  GeoIP enables or disables the use of the GeoIP capability for more accurate detection of countries. Default is ‘no’. NOTE! Do not enable GeoIP if you analyse files that have had the IP  Ad‐
              dress translated to a Fully Qualified Host Name. Use either raw IP Addresses and GeoIP, or Names and disable GeoIP. ie. Don't use GeoIP AND DNShistory.

       GeoIPDatabase
              GeoIPDatabase  is  the  location  of  the  GeoIP  database file. Default is /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat, which is where a default GeoIP install will put it. Note that the database is updated
              monthly. For the details see: ⟨http://www.maxmind.com/app/geoip_country⟩

       Incremental
              Incremental processing allows multiple partial log files to be used instead of one huge one. Useful for large sites that have to rotate their log files more than once a month. AWFFull  will
              save  its  internal state before exiting, and restore it the next time run, in order to continue processing where it left off. This mode also causes AWFFull to scan for and ignore duplicate
              records (records already processed by a previous run). See the README file for additional information. The value may be 'yes' or 'no', with a default of 'no'. The  file  awffull.current  is
              used  to  store the current state data, and is located in the output directory of the program (unless changed with the IncrementalName option below). Please read at least the section on In‐
              cremental processing in the README file before you enable this option.

       TimeMe TimeMe allows you to force the display of timing information at the end of processing. A value of 'yes' will force the timing information to be displayed. A value of 'no' has no effect.

       IgnoreHist
              IgnoreHist should not be used in a standard configuration, but it is here because it is useful in certain analysis situations. If the history file is ignored,  the  main  ‘index.html’  file
              will  only report on the current log files contents. Incremental data (if present) is still processed. Useful when you want to reproduce the reports from scratch, for example. USE WITH CAU‐
              TION! Valid values are ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Default is ‘no’.

       IncrementalName
              IncrementalName allows you to specify the filename for saving the incremental data in. It is similar to the HistoryName option where the name is relative to the specified output  directory,
              unless  an  absolute filename is specified. The default is a file named ‘awffull.current’ kept in the normal output directory. If you don't specify Incremental as 'yes' then this option has
              no meaning.

       HistoryName
              HistoryName allows you to specify the name of the history file produced by AWFFull. The history file keeps the data for up to 12 months worth of logs, used for generating the main HTML page
              (index.html). The default is a file named awffull.hist, stored in the specified output directory. If you specify just the filename (without a path), it will be kept in the specified  output
              directory. Otherwise, the path is relative to the output directory, unless absolute (leading /).

ANALYSIS OPTIONS
       These are the basic analysis options that one can and should modify to start fine tuning AWFFull against a given website.

       PageType
              PageType  lets you tell AWFFull what types of URL's you consider a 'page'. Most people consider html and cgi documents as pages, while not images and audio files. If no types are specified,
              defaults will be used ('htm', 'html', 'cgi' and HTMLExtension if different for web logs, 'txt' for ftp logs). Putting the more likely page types first in the list should increase the  speed
              of a run.

              Do Not Use Wildcards Here. It will not work.

       NotPageType
              NotPageType is the direct and incompatible opposite of PageType. You can use one set or the other, but not both. PageType specifies what *is* a Page, NotPageType specifies what *isn't*, and
              hence  by  implication,  everything  else  is a page. Neither method is more or lessor correct than the other. It's more what is more accurate for *your* site. Do not add the "." or use any
              wildcards.  As a general rule. There are some assumed internal optimisations that may otherwise break. Those who understand pcre's would do well to examine the source of  parser.c  if  they
              wish to extract greater flexibility from the below.

       FoldSeqErr
              FoldSeqErr  forces  AWFFull  to  ignore  sequence  errors.  This is useful for Netscape and other web servers that cache the writing of log records and do not guarantee that they will be in
              chronological order. The use of the FoldSeqErr option will cause out of sequence log records to be treated as if they had the same time stamp as the last valid record. The default action is
              to ignore out of sequence log records.

       SearchEngine
              The SearchEngine keywords allow specification of search engines and their query strings on the URL. These are used to locate and report what search strings are used to find your  site.  The
              first word is a substring to match in the referrer field that identifies the search engine, and the second is the URL variable used by that search engine to define it's search terms.

       VisitTimeout
              VisitTimeout allows you to set the default timeout for a visit (sometimes called a 'session'). The default is 30 minutes, which should be fine for most sites. Visits are determined by look‐
              ing  at  the  time  of  the current request, and the time of the last request from the site. If the time difference is greater than the VisitTimeout value, it is considered a new visit, and
              visit totals are incremented. Value is the number of seconds to timeout (default=1800=30min)

       TrackPartialRequests
              TrackPartialRequests is used to track 206 codes. This gives two additional columns in the Top URLs tables. The first to "Hits" counts the number of partial requests The second  to  "Volume"
              counts the volume in partial requests This option is more of use to those with lots of PDF's.

       MangleAgents
              The  MangleAgents  allows  you to specify how much, if any, AWFFull should mangle user agent names. This allows several levels of detail to be produced when reporting user agent statistics.
              There are six levels that can be specified, which define different levels of detail suppression. Level 5 shows only the browser name (MSIE or Mozilla) and the major version number. Level  4
              adds  the minor version number (single decimal place). Level 3 displays the minor version to two decimal places. Level 2 will add any sub-level designation (such as Mozilla/3.01Gold or MSIE
              3.0b). Level 1 will attempt to also add the system type if it is specified. The default Level 0 displays the full user agent field without modification and produces the greatest  amount  of
              detail. User agent names that can't be mangled will be left unmodified.

       AssignToCountry
              AssignToCountry  allows a form of override to force given domains to a specified country. Use the standard 2 letter country codes. Can also use org, com, net and so on, if more appropriate.
              With judicious use of AllSites, GroupSite and 'whois', this can cover the majority of your users without too much effort.

       IndexAlias
              AWFFull normally strips the string 'index.' off the end of URL's in order to consolidate URL totals. For example, the URL /somedir/index.html is turned into /somedir/ which  is  really  the
              same  URL.  This  option allows you to specify additional strings to treat in the same way. You don't need to specify 'index.' as it is always scanned for by AWFFull, this option is just to
              specify _additional_ strings if needed. If you don't need any, don't specify any as each string will be scanned for in EVERY log record... A bunch of them will  degrade  performance.  Also,
              the string is scanned for anywhere in the URL, so a string of 'home' would turn the URL /somedir/homepages/brad/home.html into just /somedir/ which is probably not what was intended.

       IgnoreIndexAlias
              The opposite (in a way) of IndexAlias is IgnoreIndexAlias.  This will STOP any URL variable stripping, as well as ignoring the default "index." setting, or any that you set above.

IGNORE* OPTIONS
       The  Ignore*  keywords  allow  you to completely ignore, or filter away, log records based on hostname, URL, user agent, referrer or user name. Use the same syntax as the Hide* keywords, where the
       value can have a leading or trailing wildcard '*'.

       IgnoreURL
              Filters out traffic accessing certain URLs. eg You may wish to avoid seeing traffic that accesses administration functions, thus "IgnoreURL /admin*". URLs are case sensitive.

       IgnoreSite
              Ignore sites that visit this website. Ignore by what is presented to awffull - name or IP Address. Sites are lowercased prior to filtering, so if Ignore'ing by name,  do  use  a  lowercased
              Value.

       IgnoreReferrer
              Ignore specified referrers. Very useful for filtering away SPAM Referrers. Referrers are partially case sensitive. \o/ The host portion is lowercased; the URI is case sensitive.

       IgnoreUser
              Ignore specified users. User names are lowercased prior to filtering.

       IgnoreAgent
              Agents are case sensitive.

INCLUDE* OPTIONS
       The Include* keywords allow you to force the inclusion of log records based on hostname, URL, user agent, referrer or user name. The Include* keywords take precedence over the Ignore* keywords.

       Note:  Using  Ignore/Include combinations to selectively process parts of a web site is _extremely inefficient_!!! Avoid doing so if possible ie: grep or gawk the records to a separate file if you
       really want that kind of report.

       IncludeURL

       IncludeSite

       IncludeReferrer

       IncludeUser

       IncludeAgent

SEGMENTING OPTIONS
       Segmenting is a bit like the Ignore* and Include* keywords. Where it differs is in "remembering". Such that, as a ‘session’ (or ‘visit’) moves away from the original entry condition, that  session
       is still tracked. So if you segment on a referal from Google, only sessions that were referred to the analysed website, from Google, will be tracked. Even as that same session accesses other pages
       within the website.

       eg. Google -> Site Page 1 -> Site Page 2 -> Site Page 3

       Whereas Ignore/Include would only filter the first interaction. eg.  Google -> Site Page 1

       By  "session"  (or ‘visit’) it is meant that the time limitation of a session (typically 30 minutes timeout) will impact. So in the above example from Google, if the last step (from Page 2 to Page
       3) occurred 31+ minutes after the Page 1 to Page 2 transition, then this final step would NOT be included. The trail would be:

       Google -> Site Page 1 -> Site Page 2

       Please do be aware that currently AWFFull uses IP Addresses to determine the continuation of a given session. This will be most flawed if you have a user  population  that  sits  behind  corporate
       firewalls, or ISP Proxies. To mention two major problem areas.

       Why do Segmenting?

       ⟨http://judah.webanalyticsdemystified.com/2007/11/a-few-tips-on-web-analytics-segmentation.html⟩

       ‘Segment analysis will tell you different things about your audience than you will realize from studying overall population metrics.’

       ‘The goal of segmentation is to maximize future value of that segment by optimizing your marketing mix.’

       With apologies to Judah for mixing his phrase order around.  :-)

       SegCountry
              Segment by Country: Only track sessions that come from the following countries. This will be determined by:

              1.  Use of AssignToCountry overrides

              2.  GeoIP lookups if so configured and enabled

              3.  Hostname TLD. eg .au

       The third option is generally going to be the worst for accuracy. eg. We have plenty of Australian IP addresses that otherwise resolve to .com or .net etc.

       It is strongly advised to enable GeoIP if you wish to use this option.

       SegReferer
              Segment by Referer: Only track sessions that originated from the following referers. NOTE!!!! SegReferer only works against the HOST name. Not the full URL.

DISPLAY OPTIONS
       The  Display  Options  modify the resulting output that AWFFull produces. Things like HTML Headers and Footers to add on every page. These options don't change the numbers that AWFFull will calcu‐
       late, but may change which ones appear, giving the illusion of a numerical change.

       ReportTitle
              ReportTitle is the text to display as the title. The hostname (unless blank) is appended to the end of this string (separated with a space) to generate the final full title string.  Default
              is (for English) ‘Usage Statistics for’.

       HostName
              HostName defines the hostname for the report. This is used in the title, and is prepended to the URL table items. This allows clicking on URL's in the report to go to the proper location in
              the event you are running the report on a 'virtual' web server, or for a server different than the one the report resides on. If not specified here, or on the command line, AWFFull will try
              to get the hostname via a uname system call. If that fails, it will default to ‘localhost’.

       IndexMonths
              This option controls how many years worth of data to display on the front summary page. In months. eg: Display the last 5 years: 5 x 12 = 60

       DailyStats
              DailyStats allows the daily statistics table to be disabled - not displayed. Values may be ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Default is ‘yes’ - do display the Daily Statistics table.

       HourlyStats
              HourlyGraph and HourlyStats allows the hourly statistics graph and statistics table to be disabled (not displayed). Values may be "yes" or "no". Default is "yes".

       CSSFilename
              CSSFilename  is  used to set the name of the CSS file to use in conjunction with the generated html. An existing file is not overwritten, so feel free to make you own changes to the default
              file. The default is awffull.css.

       FlagsLocation
              FlagsLocation will enable the display of country flag pictures in the country table. The path is that for a webserver, not file system. Can be relative or complete. The  trailing  slash  is
              not necessary. The default location is not set and hence will not be used.

       YearlySubtotals
              YearlySubtotals will display the subtotal for a given year in the main page. This is in addition to the Grand Total of all years.

       GroupShading
              The  GroupShading  allows grouped rows to be shaded in the report. Useful if you have lots of groups and individual records that intermingle in the report, and you want to differentiate the
              group records a little more. Value can be ‘yes’ or ‘no’, with ‘yes’ being the default.

       GroupHighlight
              GroupHighlight allows the group record to be displayed in BOLD. Can be either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ with the default being ‘yes’.

       HTMLExtension
              HTMLExtension allows you to specify the filename extension to use for generated HTML pages. Normally, this defaults to "html", but can be changed for sites who need it (like for PHP  embed‐
              ded pages).

       UseHTTPS
              UseHTTPS should be used if the analysis is being run on a secure server, and links to urls should use ‘https://’ instead of the default ‘http://’. If you need this, set it to ‘yes’. Default
              is ‘no’. This only changes the behaviour of the ‘Top URLs’ table.

       Top*   The various ‘Top’ options below define the number of entries for each table. Tables may be disabled by using zero (0) for the value.

       TopURLs
              The most accessed URLs or Resources by number of requests (hits). Includes both Pages and Images, for example. Defaults to 30 URLs.

       TopKURLs
              The greatest volume generating URLs. Defaults to 10 URL's.

       TopEntry
              The most accessed initial URLs within a complete Visit. Will also display Single Access counts, Stickiness ration and Popularity ratio. Defaults to 10 URLs.

       TopExit
              The most accessed last URLs within a complete Visit. ie: The last page recorded of a Visit. Also displays the Popularity ratio.  Defaults to 10 URLs.

       Top404Errors
              The most seen error requests and a corresponding referring URL. Defaults to 0, ie not shown.

       TopSites
              Those Sites that have accessed the most Pages. Default is 30 Sites.

       TopKSites
              Those Sites that have downloaded the greatest Volume. Default is 10 Sites.

       TopReferrers
              Those local and remote URLs that refer the most requests.  Default is 30 Referrers.

       TopSearch
              Those words and phrases used at remote Search Engines to direct traffic here. Default is 20 Phrases.

       TopUsers
              Those logged in users who most use the site. Default is 20 Users.

       TopAgents
              The Browser Agents that are busiest against this site. Default is 15 Agents.

       TopCountries
              A view of all traffic against this site via country.

       All*   The  All*  keywords  allow  the  display of all the below measures.  If enabled, a separate HTML page will be created, and a link will be added to the bottom of the appropriate "Top" table.
              There are a couple of conditions for this to occur. First, there must be more items than will fit in the "Top" table (otherwise it would just be duplicating what is already displayed). Sec‐
              ond, the listing will only show those items that are normally visible, which means it will not show any hidden items. Grouped entries will be listed first, followed by individual items. The
              value for these keywords can be either 'yes' or 'no', with the default being 'no'. Please be aware that these pages can be quite large in size, particularly the  sites  page,  and  separate
              pages are generated for each month, which can consume quite a lot of disk space depending on the traffic to your site.

       AllURLs
              All accessed URLs

       AllEntryPages
              All Pages that initialised a Visit

       AllExitPages
              All the last or exit pages in all Visits.

       All404Errors
              All ErrorRequests and the corresponding referral URLs.

       AllSites
              All remote sites that accessed this website.

       AllReferrers
              All local and remote referring URLs

       AllSearchStr
              All Remote Search Engine words and Phrases used to refer traffic here.

       AllUsers
              All users who logged into this website.

       AllAgents
              All Browser Agents used to access this site. Useful for identifying robots.

       GMTTime
              GMTTime  allows  reports to show GMT (UTC) time instead of local time. Default is to display the time the report was generated in the timezone of the local machine, such as EDT or PST. This
              keyword allows you to have times displayed in UTC instead. Use only if you really have a good reason, since it will probably screw up the reporting periods by however many hours your  local
              time zone is off of GMT.

       HTMLPre
              HTMLPre  defines  HTML code to insert at the very beginning of the file. Default is the DOCTYPE line shown below. Max line length is 80 characters, so use multiple HTMLPre lines if you need
              more.

       HTMLHead
              HTMLHead defines HTML code to insert within the <HEAD></HEAD> block, immediately after the <TITLE> line. Maximum line length is 80 characters, so use multiple lines if needed.

       HTMLBody
              HTMLBody defined the HTML code to be inserted, starting with the <BODY> tag. If not specified, the default is shown below.  If used, you MUST include your own <BODY> tag as the first  line.
              Maximum line length is 80 char, use multiple lines if needed.

       HTMLPost
              HTMLPost  defines  the  HTML  code  to  insert immediately before the first <HR> on the document, which is just after the title and "summary period"-"Generated on:" lines. If anything, this
              should be used to clean up in case an image was inserted with HTMLBody. As with HTMLHead, you can define as many of these as you want and they will be inserted in the output stream in order
              of appearance. Max string size is 80 characters. Use multiple lines if you need to.

       HTMLTail
              HTMLTail defines the HTML code to insert at the bottom of each HTML document, usually to include a link back to your home page or insert a small graphic. It is inserted as a table data ele‐
              ment (ie: <TD> your code here </TD>) and is right aligned with the page. The maximum string size is 80 characters.

       HTMLEnd
              HTMLEnd defines the HTML code to add at the very end of the generated files. It defaults to what is shown below. If used, you MUST specify the </BODY> and </HTML> closing tags as  the  last
              lines. The maximum string length is 80 characters.

GRAPHING OPTIONS
       As distinct from the general Display Options, the Graphing Options focus on manipulating the various graphs produced.

       CountryGraph
              CountryGraph allows the usage by country graph to be disabled.  Values can be 'yes' or 'no', default is 'yes'.

       DailyGraph
              DailyGraph determines if the daily statistics graph will be displayed or not. Values may be "yes" or "no". Default is "yes" - do display the daily graph.

       HourlyGraph
              HourlyGraph determines if the daily statistics graph will be displayed or not. Values may be "yes" or "no". Default is "yes" - do display the hourly graph.

       TopURLsbyHitsGraph
              Display a pie chart of the top URLs by HITS

       TopURLsbyVolGraph
              Display a pie chart of the top URLs by HITS

       TopExitPagesGraph
              Display Top Exit Pages Pie Chart. Values may be ‘hits’ or ‘visits’ or "no". Default is "no"

              ‘hits’ means order the graph by hits

              ‘visits’ means order the graph by visits

       TopEntryPagesGraph
              Display Top Entry Pages Pie Chart. Values may be ‘hits’ or ‘visits’ or "no". Default is "no"

              ‘hits’ means order the graph by hits

              ‘visits’ means order the graph by visits

       TopSitesbyPagesGraph
              Display a pie chart of the Top Sites by Page Impressions

       TopSitesbyVolGraph
              Display a pie chart of the Top Sites by Page Impressions

       TopAgentsGraph
              Display a pie chart of the Top User Agents (by pages)

       GraphLegend
              GraphLegend  allows  the  color coded legends to be turned on or off in the graphs. The default is for them to be displayed. This only toggles the color coded legends, the other legends are
              not changed. If you think they are hideous and ugly, say 'no' here :)

       GraphLines
              GraphLines allows you to have index lines drawn behind the graphs. Anything other than "no" will enable the lines.

       Graph*X and Graph*Y
              The following Graph*X and Graph*Y options are used to modify the sizes of the created charts. The default settings are shown. The defaults are also the minimum settings.  #define  GRAPH_IN‐
              DEX_X  512  /*  px.  Default X size (512) */ #define GRAPH_INDEX_Y 256 /* px. Default Y size (256) */ #define GRAPH_DAILY_X 512 /* px. Daily X size (512) */ #define GRAPH_DAILY_Y 400 /* px.
              Daily Y size (400) */ #define GRAPH_HOURLY_X 512 /* px. Daily X size (512) */ #define GRAPH_HOURLY_Y 400 /* px. Daily Y size (400) */ #define GRAPH_PIE_X 512 /* px. Pie X size (512) */ #de‐
              fine GRAPH_PIE_Y 300 /* px. Pie Y size (300) */

       GraphIndexX
              The main chart on the front page. Summary of all Months.  Default is 512 pixels.

       GraphIndexY
              Default is 256 pixels.

       GraphDailyX
              The Day by Day Summary graph at the start of each Months Summary. Default is 512 pixels.

       GraphDailyY
              Default is 400 pixels.

       GraphHourlyX
              The Hourly Average graph within each Months Summary. Default is 512 pixels.

       GraphHourlyY
              Default is 400 pixels.

       GraphPieX
              All pie charts are the same size. Default is 512 pixels.

       GraphPieY
              Default is 300 pixels.

       Graph and Table Colours
              The custom bar graph and pie Colours can be overridden with these options. Declare them in the standard hexadecimal way - as per HTML but without the '#'. If none are given,  you  will  get
              the default AWFFull colors.

       ColorHit
              Default value is ‘00805C’ (dark green)

       ColorFile
              Default value is ‘0000FF’ (blue)

       ColorSite
              Default value is ‘FF8000’ (orange)

       ColorKbyte
              Default value is ‘FF0000’ (red)

       PieColor4
              Default value is ‘FF0000’ (red)

GROUP* OPTIONS
       The Group* keywords permit the grouping of similar objects as if they were one. Grouped records are displayed in the ‘Top’ tables and can optionally be displayed in bold and/or shaded. Groups can‐
       not  be  hidden, and are not counted in the main totals. The Group* options do not hide the individual items that are members of the Group. If you wish to hide the records that match - so just the
       grouping record is displayed - follow with an identical Hide* keyword with the same value. Or use the single GroupAndHide* keyword that matches, instead of the Group* and Hide* combination.

       Group* keywords may have an optional label which will be displayed instead of the keywords value. The label should be separated from the value by at least one  white-space  character,  such  as  a
       space or tab.

       The Hide*, Group* and Ignore* and Include* keywords allow you to change the way Sites, URL's, Referrers, User Agents and User names are manipulated. The Ignore* keywords will cause AWFFull to com‐
       pletely  ignore  records  as if they didn't exist (and thus not counted in the main site totals). The Hide* keywords will prevent things from being displayed in the 'Top' tables, but will still be
       counted in the main totals. The Group* keywords allow grouping similar objects as if they were one. Grouped records are displayed in the 'Top' tables and can optionally be displayed in BOLD and/or
       shaded. Groups cannot be hidden, and are not counted in the main totals. The Group* options do not, by default, hide all the items that it matches. If you want to hide the records that  match  (so
       just  the  grouping record is displayed), follow with an identical Hide* keyword with the same value. (see example below) In addition, Group* keywords may have an optional label which will be dis‐
       played instead of the keywords value.  The label should be separated from the value by at least one 'white-space' character, such as a space or tab.

       The value can have either a leading or trailing '*' wildcard character. If no wildcard is found, a match can occur anywhere in the string. Given a string  ‘www.yourmama.com’,  the  values  ‘your’,
       ‘*mama.com’ and ‘www.your*’ will all match.

       GroupURL

       GroupSite

       GroupReferrer

       GroupUser

       GroupAgent

       GroupDomains
              The  GroupDomains keyword allows you to group individual host names into their respective domains. The value specifies the level of grouping to perform, and can be thought of as 'the number
              of dots' that will be displayed. For example, if a visiting host is named cust1.tnt.mia.uu.net, a domain grouping of 1 will result in just "uu.net" being displayed, while a 2 will result in
              "mia.uu.net". The default value of zero disable this feature.  Domains will only be grouped if they do not match any existing "GroupSite" records, which allows overriding this feature  with
              your own if desired.

HIDE* OPTIONS
       The Hide* keywords will prevent things from being displayed in the 'Top' tables. The hidden items will still be counted in the main totals.

       HideURL
              Hide URL matching name.

       HideSite
              Hide site matching name.

       HideReferrer
              Hide referrer matching name.

       HideUser

       HideAgent
              Hide user agents matching name.

       HideAllSites
              HideAllSites  allows  forcing  individual sites to be hidden in the report. This is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the "GroupDomain" feature, but could be useful in other
              situations as well, such as when you only want to display grouped sites (with the GroupSite keywords...). The value for this keyword can be either 'yes' or 'no', with 'no' the default,  al‐
              lowing individual sites to be displayed.

GROUPANDHIDE* OPTIONS
       All  the  Hide  and Group "name" options can be combined in a single config line. eg GroupAndHideURL. If you start using the Group* options you will find that you tend to match every Group* option
       with a corresponding Hide* option. The GroupAndHide* options simply short circuit this unnecessary duplication.

       GroupAndHideURL

       GroupAndHideSite

       GroupAndHideReferrer

       GroupAndHideUser

       GroupAndHideAgent

DATA DUMP OPTIONS
       The Dump* keywords allow the dumping of Sites, URL's, Referrers User Agents, User names and Search strings to separate tab delimited text files, suitable for import into most database  or  spread‐
       sheet programs.

       DumpPath
              DumpPath specifies the path to dump the files. If not specified, it will default to the current output directory. Do not use a trailing slash ('/').

       DumpHeader
              The DumpHeader keyword specifies if a header record should be written to the file. A header record is the first record of the file, and contains the labels for each field written. Normally,
              files that are intended to be imported into a database system will not need a header record, while spreadsheets usually do. Value can be either 'yes' or 'no', with 'no' being the default.

       DumpExtension
              DumpExtension  allow  you to specify the dump filename extension to use. The default is "tab", but some programs are picky about the filenames they use, so you may change it here (for exam‐
              ple, some people may prefer to use "csv").

       DumpURLs

       DumpEntryPages

       DumpExitPages

       DumpSites

       DumpReferrers

       DumpSearchStr

       DumpUsers

       DumpAgents

       DumpCountries

EXAMPLES
       Sample Extract of a configuration file:

       # The 'auto' value means that AWFFull will try and work out what log format
       # you are sending to it. If no joy, AWFFull will immediately exit.

       LogType        auto

       # OutputDir is where you want to put the output files.  This should
       # should be a full path name, however relative ones might work as well.
       # If no output directory is specified, the current directory will be used.

       OutputDir      .

       Minimal configuration file:

       # Sample *MINIMAL* AWFFull configuration file
       #
       # The below settings are the only ones you *really* need to worry about
       # when configuring AWFFull. See the sample.conf file for all options if
       # the below only serves to whet your appetite.
       #
       # See awfful(1) or sample.conf for full explanations.

       # We can do a little bit each day, or hour...
       Incremental             yes

       # Your server name to display
       HostName                www.my_example.site

NOTES
       In case it is not obvious: AWFFull is a play/pun on the word ‘awful’, and is pronounced the same way. Yes it was deliberate.
