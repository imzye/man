DESCRIPTION
       gophernicus  is a gopher server. It serves almost compliant RFC 1436, with small changes to make it more modern.  gophernicus supports userdirs, executable gophermaps, CGI, and virtual hosting (in
       the limits of the RFC).

       gophernicus can log to syslog(3) or per-server files in Apache format.

       The options are as follows:

       -h hostname     Changes the server hostname shown on the output menu.  The default is the fully qualified domain name of the machine.

       -p port         Changes the server port shown on the output menu.  The default is 70.

       -T port         Changes the SSL/TLS port.  The default is 0 (disabled).

       -r directory    Set the document root of the server.  The default is /var/gopher.

       -t type         Set the default gopher filetype.  The default is 0.

       -g mapfile      Set the gophermap file name.  The default is gophermap.

       -a tagfile      Set the gophertag file name.  The default is gophertag.

       -c directory    Set the CGI script directory, under the document root.  The default is /cgi-bin/.

       -u directory    Set the name of the personal gopherspace directory.  Each user can deploy a personal gopherspace by creating a  directory  directory  in  their  home  directory.   The  default  is
                       public_gopher.

       -l file         Log to file in Apache-compatible combined format. Disabled by default.

       -w width        Set default page width.  The default is 67.

       -o charset      Select the output charset. It can be UTF-8, US-ASCII, or ISO-9959-1.  The default is UTF-8.

       -s seconds      Session timeout in seconds.  The default is 1800.

       -i hits         Maximum hits until throttling.  The default is 4069.

       -k kilobytes    Maximum transfer size in KiB until throttling.  The default is 4194304 (4 GiB).

       -f directory    Set directory where output filters are found.  Disabled by default.

       -e ext=type     Map file extension ext to gopher filetype type.

       -R old=new      Rewrite the start of a selector.

       -D description  Set server description to appear in /caps.txt.  If description looks like a filename (starts with a /), use the contents of the file.

       -L location     Set server location to appear in /caps.txt.  If location looks like a filename (starts with a /), use the contents of the file.

       -A email        Set the email of the administrator to appear in /caps.txt.

       -U paths        Set a colon-separated list of extra unveil(2) paths (only for OpenBSD).

       -nv             Disable virtual hosting.

       -nl             Disable parent directory links.

       -nh             Disable menu header.

       -nf             Disable menu footer.

       -nd             Don't show date and size of files in menu.

       -nc             Disable file content detection (similar to magic(5)).

       -no             Disable output charset conversion.

       -nq             Disable HTTP-style query strings ‘?foo=bar&baz=quux’.

       -ns             Disable logging to syslog(3).

       -na             Disable autogenerated /caps.txt.

       -nt             Disable /server-status.

       -nm             Disable shared memory use (for debugging purposes).

       -nr             Disable root user check (for debugging purposes).  By default, gophernicus will refuse to run as root.

       -np             Disable HAProxy proxy protocol.

       -nx             Disable execution of gophermaps and scripts.

       -nH             Disable HTTP response to HTTP GET and POST requests.

       -d              Print debug output in syslog(3) and /server-status.  When -ns (disable syslog(3)) is used this option has no effect.

       -v              Display version information and build date.

       -b              Display licensing information.

       -?              Display help.

       Default values may have been changed at compile time by gophernicus.env.
