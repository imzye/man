NAME
       Device::USB - Use libusb to access USB devices. (DEPRECATED)

VERSION
       Version 0.38

SYNOPSIS
       Device::USB has now been superceded by USB::LibUSB <https://metacpan.org/pod/USB::LibUSB>, which supports the v1.0 libusb API.

       Device::USB provides a Perl wrapper around the libusb library. This supports Perl code controlling and accessing USB devices.

           use Device::USB;

           my $usb = Device::USB->new();
           my $dev = $usb->find_device( $VENDOR, $PRODUCT );

           printf "Device: %04X:%04X\n", $dev->idVendor(), $dev->idProduct();
           $dev->open();
           print "Manufactured by ", $dev->manufacturer(), "\n",
                 " Product: ", $dev->product(), "\n";

           $dev->set_configuration( $CFG );
           $dev->control_msg( @params );
           ...

       See the libusb manual for more information about most of the methods. The functionality is generally the same as the libusb function whose name is the method name prepended with "usb_".

DESCRIPTION
       This module is deprecated as of version 0.38. I have not had the time or need to update the module, and no one has been willing to take it over.

       This module provides a Perl interface to the C library libusb. This library supports a relatively full set of functionality to access a USB device. In addition to the libusb functionality
       Device::USB provides a few convenience features that are intended to produce a more Perl-ish interface.

       These features include:

       •   Using the library initializes it, no need to call the underlying usb_init function.

       •   Object interface reduces namespace pollution and provides a better interface to the library.

       •   The find_device method finds the device associated with a vendor id and product id and creates an appropriate Device::USB::Device object to manipulate the USB device.

       •   Object interfaces to the bus and device data structures allowing read access to information about each.

Device::USB
       This  class  provides  an  interface  to  the  non-bus  and  non-device specific functions of the libusb library. In particular, it provides interfaces to find busses and devices. It also provides
       convenience methods that simplify some of the tasks above.

   CONSTANTS
       This class provides a set of constants for the defined device classes. The constants defined at this time are:

       •   CLASS_PER_INSTANCE

       •   CLASS_AUDIO

       •   CLASS_COMM

       •   CLASS_HID

       •   CLASS_PRINTER

       •   CLASS_MASS_STORAGE

       •   CLASS_HUB

       •   CLASS_DATA

       •   CLASS_VENDOR_SPEC

   FUNCTIONS
       new Create a new Device::USB object for accessing the library.

       debug_mode
           This class method enables low-level debugging messages from the library interface code.

           level
               0 disables debugging, 1 enables some debug messages, and 2 enables verbose debug messages

               Any other values are forced to the nearest endpoint.

       find_busses
           Returns the number of changes since previous call to the function: the number of busses added or removed.

       find_devices
           Returns the number of changes since previous call to the function: the number of devices added or removed. Should be called after find_busses.

       find_device
           Find a particular USB device based on the vendor and product ids. If more than one device has the same product id from the same vendor, the first one found is returned.

           vendor
               the vendor id

           product
               product id for that vendor

           returns a device reference or undef if none was found.

       find_device_if
           Find a particular USB device based on the supplied predicate coderef. If more than one device would satisfy the predicate, the first one found is returned.

           pred
               the predicate used to select a device

           returns a device reference or undef if none was found.

       list_devices
           Find all devices matching a vendor id and optional product id. If called with no parameters, returns a list of all devices. If no product id is  given,  returns  all  devices  found  with  the
           supplied vendor id. If a product id is given, returns all devices matching both the vendor id and product id.

           vendor
               the optional vendor id

           product
               optional product id for that vendor

           returns a list of devices matching the supplied criteria or a reference to that array in scalar context

       list_devices_if
           This  method  provides  a more flexible interface for finding devices. It takes a single coderef parameter that is used to test each discovered device. If the coderef returns a true value, the
           device is returned in the list of matching devices, otherwise it is not.

           pred
               coderef to test devices.

           For example,

               my @devices = $usb->list_devices_if(
                   sub { Device::USB::CLASS_HUB == $_->bDeviceClass() }
               );

           Returns all USB hubs found. The device to test is available to the coderef in the $_ variable for simplicity.

       list_busses
           Return the complete list of information after finding busses and devices.

           By using this function, you do not need to do the find_* calls yourself.

           returns a reference to an array of busses.

       get_busses
           Return the complete list of information after finding busses and devices.

           Before calling this function, remember to call find_busses and find_devices.

           returns a reference to an array of busses.

DIAGNOSTICS
       This is an explanation of the diagnostic and error messages this module can generate.

DEPENDENCIES
       This module depends on the Carp, Inline and Inline::C modules, as well as the strict and warnings pragmas. Obviously, libusb must be available since that is the  entire  reason  for  the  module's
       existence.

BUGS
       Please  report  any  bugs or feature requests to "bug-device-usb@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Device::USB>.  I will be notified, and then
       you'll automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

FOR MORE INFORMATION
       The project is hosted at github <https://github.com/gwadej/perl-device-usb/>.  More information on the project, including installation help is available on the Wiki.

LIMITATIONS
       So far, this module has only been tested on Linux. It should work on any OS that supports the libusb library. Several people have reported problems compiling the module on Windows. In  theory,  it
       should be possible to make the library work with LibUsb-Win32 <http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net/>.  Without access to a Windows development system, I can't make those changes.

       The Interfaces and Endpoints are not yet proper objects. The code to extract this information is not yet written.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Thanks go to various members of the Houston Perl Mongers group for input on the module. But thanks mostly go to Paul Archer who proposed the project and helped with the development.

       Thanks to Josep Monés Teixidor for fixing the "bInterfaceClass" bug.

       Thanks to Mike McCauley for support of "usb_get_driver_np" and "usb_detach_kernel_driver_np".

       Thanks to Vadim Mikhailov for fixing a compile problem with VC6 on Windows and then chipping in again for VS 2005 on Windows, and yet again to fix warnings on C99-compliant compilers.

       Thanks to John R. Hogheruis for information about modifying the Inline parameters for compiling with Strawberry Perl on Windows.

       Thanks to Tony Shadwick for helping me resolve a problem with bulk_read and interrupt_read.
