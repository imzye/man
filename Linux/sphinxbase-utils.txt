NAME
       sphinx_lm_sort - Order N-Grams in a language model for Sphinx

SYNOPSIS
       sphinx_lm_sort < input_lm > output_lm

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  arranges  the  N-Grams in an ARPA-format language model to be acceptable to Sphinx.  This is necessary if you created the language model with SRILM or any other tool which is not as
       strict about ordering N-Grams in its output.
