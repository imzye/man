NAME
       flickcurl-config  -  script to get information about the installed ver‐
       sion of flickcurl

SYNOPSIS
       flickcurl-config [ OPTION ]

DESCRIPTION
              This program is DEPRECATED and pkg-config(1) should be  used  to
              get  flickcurl library parameters and dependencies.  The compil‐
              ing and linking flags are likely to not work since they  do  not
              import dependendent libraries (such as Raptor).

       Known values for OPTION are:

       --prefix
              Get the flickcurl installation prefix.

       --libs Print library linking information.

       --private-libs
              Print library private/static linking information.

       --cflags
              Print pre-processor and compiler flags

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information

       --version-decimal
              Output version as a decimal integer.
