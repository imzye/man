       dotdee --undo /PATH/TO/FILE

DESCRIPTION
       dotdee is an administrative utility useful for converting a flatfile into a dynamically generated file, from a .d directory.

       The  original  path  at  /PATH/TO/FILE  will  be  replaced  with  a  symbolic  link  to  /etc/dotdee/PATH/TO/FILE,  which  is  dynamically  generated  by  concatenating  all  of  the files in
       /etc/dotdee/PATH/TO/FILE.d/*, per the order of the shell.

       The Linux kernel's inotify(7) mechanism is used by dotdee running iwatch(1) against the /etc/dotdee/ directory.  Any changes to the constituent files are automatically reflected in  the  con‐
       structed, dynamically generated file.  Therefore, as long as the iwatch(1) is running, you should never need to actually run "dotdee --update /PATH/TO/FILE" manually.

       There is at least 1 file always present in an /etc/dotdee/PATH/TO/FILE.d/ directory:
         - 50-original is the original file being managed;  note that write permissions are removed from this file, as we don't want to ever modify it

       Optionally, a 2nd file might be present in an /etc/dotdee/PATH/TO/FILE.d/ directory:
         - .comment is a text file that defines the "comment" string; if, for instance, the contents of .comment is the # character, the following will be printed to the head of the generated file:

         # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY!
         # Rather, add, remove, or modify file(s) in [/etc/dotdee/path/to/some.conf.d]
         # per the dotdee(8) manpage.

       Alternativately, .comment might contain "//", or ";", or anything else that denotes that the rest of the string will be a comment.

       As for the rest of the contents of /etc/dotdee/PATH/TO/FILE.d/ directory, all of them must begin with 2 or more digits, to ensure that they are processed in a specific order.

       there are 3 supported file types:
         - plain text files, which must not be executable;  these files are simply concatenated in order
         - executable files; these files are executed, with the current state of the managed file provided on STDIN, and the STDOUT is then written to the managed file
         - patch/diff files; these files end in either ".patch" or ".diff", and are applied using the patch(1) command to the current state of the managed file
