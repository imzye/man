NAME
       apt-file -- APT package searching utility -- command-line interface

SYNOPSIS
       apt-file [options] search pattern

       apt-file [options] show package

DESCRIPTION
       apt-file is a command line tool for searching files in packages for the APT package management system.

       Some actions are required to run the search:

       find
           Alias for search.

       list
           List the contents of a package. This action is very close to the dpkg -L command except the package does not need to be installed or fetched.

           By default, the list action interprets its pattern as if --fixed-string was specified.

       list-indices
           List  the  known  Content  indices  and  their status in a human readable format.  These indices can be searched via the -I option (when enabled and after fetching the indices).  The output is
           subject to change without notice and is therefore unsuited for script usage / automation.

           For a machine-readable formats (e.g. automation), please use apt-config dump (search for options starting with Acquire::IndexTargets) and apt-get indextargets for checking the cache (Look  for
           entries with an Identifier field starting with Contents-).

           Note that individual sources.list entries can override the global default.  Please consult sources.list(5) for more information on advanced configuration of the sources.list files.

       search
           Search in which package a file is included. A list of all packages containing the pattern pattern is returned.

           Since Contents files does not contain directories, the pattern must match (part of a) file name.

           By default, the search action interprets its pattern as if --substring-match was specified.

       show
           Alias for list.

       update
           This action that just calls apt update or apt-get update (depending on whether a tty is available).

           The only advantage using this over a regular apt update or apt-get update directly is for the case where you have configured an apt-file specific configuration (via the Dir::Etc::apt-file-main
           configuration option).  In that case, said configuration will be included automatically.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       -a, --architecture architecture[,...]
           This option is useful if you search a package for a different architecture from the one installed on your system.

           It can be a comma-separated list for searching on multiple architectures.

       -c, --config-file APT config-file
           Configuration  File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file and then this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before
           the default configuration files are parsed specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax information.

           The configuration file will be read relative to when it appears on the command line and can overwrite options that appear before it.

           Note that the config file will also be passed to all APT tools called by apt-file.

       -D, --from-deb
           Use contents of the given .deb archives(s) as patterns.  Useful for searching for file conflicts with other packages.  Implies -F.

       -f, --from-file
           Read patterns from the given file(s), one per line.  Use - as filename for stdin.  If no files are given, then the list will be read from stdin.  This is much  faster  than  invoking  apt-file
           many times.

       --filter-origins origin[,...]
           Only search indices from the listed origins (e.g. "Debian").

           This filter matches against the name listed in the Origin field from the Release file.

           If set to '*', this filter will be disabled (mostly useful for overriding the setting in a configuration file)

           Alias of the APT config option: apt-file::Search-Filter::Origin

       --filter-suites suite[,...]
           Only search indices from the listed suites or codenames (e.g. "unstable").

           This filter matches against the name listed in the Codename and Suite fields from the Release file.  This means that either "unstable" or "sid" will match Debian's unstable suite.

           If set to '*', this filter will be disabled (mostly useful for overriding the setting in a configuration file)

           Alias of the APT config option: apt-file::Search-Filter::Suite

       -F, --fixed-string
           Do not expand search pattern with generic characters at pattern's start and end.

           This is default for show and list actions.

       --index-names type[,...], -I type[,...]
           Only search indexes of the given name(s). If set to the special value ALL (case-sensitive), then all apt-file indices are searched.

           The name(s) must match one or more of the identifiers used in the APT configuration (minus leading "Contents-").  Example if the configuration has the following snippets:

            Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents-deb { ... };
            Acquire::IndexTargets::deb-src::Contents-dsc { ... };
            Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents-udeb { ... };
            Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents-deb-legacy {
               # Explicitly named to "Contents-deb"
               Identifier "Contents-deb";
               ...;
            };

           Then, apt-file will recognise "deb", "dsc" and "udeb" as index names.

           This option defaults to the value of the "apt-file::Index-Names" apt config option (or "deb" if omitted).

       -i, --ignore-case
           Ignore case when searching for pattern.

       -l, --package-only
           Only display package name; do not display file names.

       --stream-results
           This is a special-usage option useful for dealing with searches that produce a high number of matches (10 000+) or/and automated processing of results.

           Disable deduplication logic and immediately emit a result when a match is found.

           This  can greatly reduce the memory requirements for apt-file when processing searches with many matches.  It will also reduce the time until the first match is emitted, which can be useful if
           matches can be processed as they are discovered and the consumer can handle duplicated matches.

       -o, --option APT::Option=Value
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o APT::Option=Value.  -o and --option can be used multiple times to set different options.

           This option can be used to overwrite other command line options (e.g. "-o apt-file::Search-Filter::Origin=Debian" is effectively the same as "--filter-origins Debian").

           Note that the config options passed via this option will also be passed to all APT tools called by apt-file.

       --substring-match
           Match if the given search pattern is a substring of a path or package.

           This is default for search and find actions.

       -v, --verbose
           Run apt-file in verbose/debug mode.

       -x, --regexp
           Treat pattern as a (perl) regular expression. See perlreref(1) for details. Without this option, pattern is treated as a literal string to search for.

           Be advised that this option can be rather slow.  If performance is an issue, consider giving apt-file non-regex pattern matching too much and pipe the output to  perl  -ne  '/<pattern-here>/'.
           This enables apt-file to use more optimizations and leaves less work to the "slower" regex.

       -h, --help
           Display a short help screen.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       The apt-file command relies on the APT configuration.  Notably, the default configuration makes apt fetch Contents files by default during a call to apt update.

       For information on how to configure APT to fetch more or fewer Contents files, please refer to /usr/share/doc/apt-file/README.md.gz.

       The following files are notably interesting:

       /etc/apt/apt-file.conf
           Note this path is actually configurable by changing the value of the APT configuration called "Dir::Etc::apt-file-main".  The listed value is merely the default value of that option.

           If this file is present, apt-file will read this file after all default APT configuration files.  Any config file -c or option (-o) will be evaluated before this file (and can override options
           set in it).

           The file will also be passed on to all APT tools called by apt-file.

       /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50apt-file.conf
           Chooses which Contents files to download.  Note that apt-file recognises only "Acquire" targets that starts with "Contents-".

   Special configurations similar to apt-file 2
       Here are some apt-file 2 related work flows and how to (almost) emulate them with apt-file 3.  They are documented as a starting point for people, who are attached to these.

       The emulation may not be perfect for you out of the box.  Patches are welcome to keep the examples updated as long as the examples remain "trivial".

       •   Only make apt-file update fetch Contents files

           If  you  are  accustomed  to  apt  update  not  fetching  Contents  files,  then you can run /usr/share/doc/apt-file/examples/apt-file-2-update.sh.  This script will configure apt and apt-file
           accordingly after best effort.

           Please read the resulting /etc/apt/apt-file.conf.

       •   Creating/using "user" caches

           Previous versions of apt-file had a "--cache" option, which could be used to denote a directory to store the Contents files.  This can be emulated by doing:

             # Setup
             $ mkdir -p ~/.cache/apt-file ~/.config
             $ touch ~/.cache/apt-file/dpkg-status
             $ sed '/^Dir::State/ d; /^Dir::Cache/ d;' \
               /usr/share/doc/apt-file/examples/apt-file.conf \
               > ~/.config/apt-file.conf
             $ cat <<EOF >> ~/.config/apt-file.conf
           Dir::State "$HOME/.cache/apt-file";
           Dir::Cache "$HOME/.cache/apt-file";
           Dir::State::status "$HOME/.cache/apt-file/dpkg-status";
           EOF

             # Update the cache
             $ apt-file -c ~/.config/apt-file.conf update

             # Search using the cache
             $ apt-file -c ~/.config/apt-file.conf show apt-file

             # Removal of the cache + config
             $ rm -fr ~/.cache/apt-file ~/.config/apt-file.conf

           (You will probably want to add an alias apt-file in your ~/.bashrc)

           Please read the resulting ./apt-file-user-cache.conf.

BUGS, QUIRKS
       There are some known issues or "quirks" that are good to keep in mind.

       •   The Contents files do not include a leading slash on paths.  This means that /bin/ls is listed as bin/ls in the Contents file.  If you are looking for something in a top-level directory, it is
           often better to omit the leading slash.

           The search algorithm will attempt to work around the leading slash, but it will not work in all cases.  As a workaround, try to pull the leading slash to the beginning of regular  expressions.
           For example, use "/(?:usr/bin/vim|sbin/lvm)" instead of  "/usr/bin/vim|/sbin/lvm".

       •   When a new line has been added to the sources.list and apt update has not been run, apt-file does not print a warning message.

       •   By default, apt-file assumes that Contents files do not include a descriptive header (explaining what the file is and how to interpret it).  However, some tools have generated them with such a
           header (e.g. for old versions of Contents files for the Debian archive or Contents files generated by reprepro prior to version 5.2.0).

           If  you  search  such  files, you will want to set apt-file::Parser::Check-For-Description-Header to true (e.g. in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50apt-file.conf) to have apt-file properly filter out the
           headers to avoid false matches.

           The reason this is not the default is that it costs a factor 2 in overhead while most common Contents files no longer have the header.  (see #881405 for more details).

       •   Not all APT repositories have Contents files.  Notably common install media (CDs etc.) may omit them to conserve space.

           The default configuration by apt-file marks Contents files as optional and will just silently fail to search in Contents files in such repositories.

EXIT CODES
       apt-file has the following defined exit codes, which can be used for scripting purposes.

       0   apt-file returned successfully.  If the command was a search, there was at least one result.

       1   apt-file completed a search successfully, but it had no results.

       2   An error occurred (including invalid/conflicting user options).

       3   apt-file could not complete the command because the cache was empty.  Please ensure there are indices enabled in the APT config and run apt update to fetch them.

       4   apt-file could not complete the command because the cache does not have any files matching the restrictions.  Either change the restrictions (e.g. --index-names) or configure apt to fetch  the
           relevant files and run apt update.

       255 There was an internal errors / uncaught exception in apt-file.  Please file a bug against apt-file.

       Any other exit code is reserved for future use.
