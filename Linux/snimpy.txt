NAME
       snimpy - interactive SNMP tool with Python

SYNOPSIS
       snimpy [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the snimpy command.

       snimpy  is  a  Python-based tool providing a simple interface to build SNMP queries. This interface aims at being the most Pythonic possible: you grab scalars using attributes and columns are like
       dictionaries.

       snimpy can be used either interactively through its console (derived from Python own console or from IPython if available) or by writing snimpy scripts which are  just  Python  scripts  with  some
       global variables available.

OPTIONS
       snimpy does not take any option. If you launch it without any argument, you will get the interactive console. Otherwise, the first argument is the name of a script to be executed and the remaining
       arguments are the arguments for this script.
