NAME
       DateTime::Format::DB2 - Parse and format DB2 dates and times

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Format::DB2;

         my $dt = DateTime::Format::DB2->parse_timestamp( '2003-01-16-23.12.01.300000' );

         # 2003-01-16-23.12.01.300000
         DateTime::Format::DB2->format_timestamp($dt);

DESCRIPTION
       This module understands the formats used by DB2 for its DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP data types.  It can be used to parse these formats in order to create DateTime objects, and it can take a DateTime
       object and produce a string representing it in the DB2 format.

METHODS
       This class offers the following methods.  All of the parsing methods set the returned DateTime object's time zone to the floating time zone, because DB2 does not provide time zone information.

       •   parse_time($string)

       •   parse_date($string)

       •   parse_timestamp($string)

           Given  a  value  of the appropriate type, this method will return a new "DateTime" object.  The time zone for this object will always be the floating time zone, because by DB2 stores the local
           datetime, not UTC.

           If given an improperly formatted string, this method may die.

       •   format_date($datetime)

       •   format_time($datetime)

       •   format_timestamp($datetime)

           Given a "DateTime" object, this methods returns an appropriately formatted string.
