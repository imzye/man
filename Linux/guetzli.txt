NAME
       guetzli - perceptual JPEG encoder

SYNOPSYS
       guetzli [flags] input_filename output_filename

DESCRIPTION
       Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density at high visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30% smaller than images of equivalent quality generated by
       libjpeg. Guetzli generates only sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster decompression speeds they offer.

OPTIONS
       --verbose
           Print a verbose trace of all attempts to standard output.

       --quality Q
           Visual quality to aim for, expressed as a JPEG quality value.

       --memlimit M
           Memory limit in MB. Guetzli will fail if unable to stay under the limit. Default is 6000 MB

       --nomemlimit
           Do not limit memory usage.
