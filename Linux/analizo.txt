NAME
       Analizo::GlobalMetric::ChangeCost - Change Cost global metric

DESCRIPTION
       The metric calculation is based on the following article and calculates the degree to which a change to any file causes a (potential) change to other files in the system.

       Article: Exploring the Structure of Complex Software Designs: An Empirical Study of Open Source and Proprietary Code by Alan MacCormack, John Rusnak and Carliss Baldwin.

       See the paragraph about Change Cost in the article:

       "... characterize the structure of a design is by measuring the degree of 'coupling' it exhibits, as captured by the degree to which a change to any single element causes a (potential) change to
       other elements in the system, either directly or indirectly (i.e., through a chain of dependencies that exist across elements).

       ... measures the percentage of elements affected, on average, when a change is made to one element in the system."
