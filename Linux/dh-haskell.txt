NAME
       Debian::Debhelper::Buildsystem::haskell -- Debhelper build system for cabal-based Haskell packages

DESCRIPTION
       The dh-haskell package provides a build system for Debhelper which can be used this way:

        %:
               dh $@ --build-system=haskell

       Usually it is all you need to know, and maybe you may want to adjust DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS noopt and nocheck.  If you want to know precisely what and how is performed, read on implementation section.

IMPLEMENTATION
perl v5.40.1                                                                                     2025-09-18                                                    Debian::Debhelper::Buildsystem::haskell(3pm)
