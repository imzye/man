NAME
       bootmail - email a list of address a signed message of logs when this system (re)boots

DESCRIPTION
       bootmail is a program called at reboot by cron(8), perhaps useful for unattended, remote servers.

       It  will  read  a  list  of  one or more comma-separated email addresses from /etc/bootmail/recipients, and then loop over a list of white-space separated files in /etc/bootmail/logs, and construct an
       email.

       By default, the email will at least consist of the hostname of the system, the time and date of the boot, as well as the contents of /var/log/boot.log and /etc/motd.

       bootmail will also cryptographically sign the email message using rootsign(1) and gpg(1).  To verify the signature, you will need to gpg --import the public key stored in /etc/rootsign.pub.

       bootmail can optionally encrypt the email messages as well, by listing a comma-separated list of recipient gpg(1) key id's in the configuration file I/etc/bootmail/gpgkeys.

FILES
       I/etc/bootmail/gpg.conf, /etc/bootmail/logs, /etc/bootmail/recipients, I/etc/bootmail/gpgkeys

SEE ALSO
       cron(8), gpg(1), mail(1), rootsign(8)
