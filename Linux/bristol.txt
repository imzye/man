SYNOPSIS
       bristoljackstats

DESCRIPTION
       bristoljackstats  is  an ancillary program for the bristol emulator suite which requests the jack engine start itself and report its target sampling rate and period size. These are needed a priori
       by bristol so have to be evaluated in advance. The program is not intended for general use, it is called by the startBristol process as the emulator environment is created.
