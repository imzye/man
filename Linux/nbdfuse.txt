DESCRIPTION
       nbdfuse presents a Network Block Device as a local file inside a FUSE
       filesystem.

       The FUSE filesystem is mounted at MOUNTPOINT and contains a single
       virtual file called FILENAME (defaulting to nbd).  Reads and writes to
       the virtual file or device are turned into reads and writes to the NBD
       device.

       The NBD server itself can be local or remote.  The server can be
       specified as an NBD URI (like "nbd://localhost") or in various other
       ways (see "MODES").

       Use "fusermount -u MOUNTPOINT" to unmount the filesystem after you have
       used it.

EXAMPLES
   Present a remote NBD server as a local file
       If there is a remote NBD server running on "example.com" at the default
       NBD port number (10809) then you can turn it into a local file by
       doing:

        $ mkdir dir
        $ nbdfuse dir nbd://example.com &
        $ ls -l dir/
        total 0
        -rw-rw-rw-. 1 nbd nbd 1073741824 Jan  1 10:10 nbd

       The file is called dir/nbd and you can read and write to it as if it is
       a normal file.  Note that writes to the file will write to the remote
       NBD server.  After using it, unmount it:

        $ fusermount -u dir
        $ rmdir dir

   Use nbdkit to create a file backed by a temporary RAM disk
       nbdkit(1) has an -s option allowing it to serve over stdin/stdout.  You
       can combine this with nbdfuse as follows:

        $ mkdir dir
        $ nbdfuse dir/ramdisk --command nbdkit -s memory 1G &
        $ ls -l dir/
        total 0
        -rw-rw-rw-. 1 nbd nbd 1073741824 Jan  1 10:10 ramdisk
        $ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1M count=100 of=mp/ramdisk conv=notrunc,nocreat
        100+0 records in
        100+0 records out
        104857600 bytes (105 MB, 100 MiB) copied, 2.08319 s, 50.3 MB/s

       When you have finished with the RAM disk, you can unmount it as below
       which will cause nbdkit to exit and the RAM disk contents to be
       discarded:

        $ fusermount -u dir
        $ rmdir dir

   Use qemu-nbd to read and modify a qcow2 file
       qemu-nbd(8) cannot serve over stdin/stdout, but it can use systemd
       socket activation.  You can combine this with nbdfuse and use it to
       open any file format which qemu understands:

        $ mkdir dir
        $ nbdfuse dir/file.raw \
                  --socket-activation qemu-nbd -f qcow2 file.qcow2 &
        $ ls -l dir/
        total 0
        -rw-rw-rw-. 1 nbd nbd 1073741824 Jan  1 10:10 file.raw

       File dir/file.raw is in raw format, backed by file.qcow2.  Any changes
       made to dir/file.raw are reflected into the qcow2 file.  To unmount the
       file do:

        $ fusermount -u dir
        $ rmdir dir

   Use nbdkit to create a local file from a file on a web server
       nbdkit(1) is able to both access and transparently uncompress remote
       disk images on web servers, so you can convert them into virtual files:

        $ mkdir dir
        $ nbdfuse dir/disk.iso \
              --command nbdkit -s curl --filter=xz \
                               http://builder.libguestfs.org/fedora-30.xz &
        $ ls -l dir/
        total 0
        -rw-rw-rw-. 1 nbd nbd 6442450944 Jan  1 10:10 disk.iso
        $ file dir/disk.iso
        dir/disk.iso: DOS/MBR boot sector
        $ qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4G \
              -drive file=dir/disk.iso,format=raw,if=virtio,snapshot=on
        $ fusermount -u dir

       In this example we have used the virtual file to boot qemu, but qemu
       can much more efficiently access NBD servers directly so in the real
       world that would be the preferred method.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display brief command line help and exit.

       --fuse-help
           Display FUSE options and exit.  See -o below.

       -o FUSE-OPTION
           Pass extra options to FUSE.  To get a list of all the extra options
           supported by FUSE, use --fuse-help.

           Some potentially useful FUSE options:

           -o allow_other
               Allow other users to see the filesystem.  This option has no
               effect unless you enable it globally in /etc/fuse.conf.

           -o kernel_cache
               Allow the kernel to cache files (reduces the number of reads
               that have to go through the libnbd(3) API).  This is generally
               a good idea if you can afford the extra memory usage.

           -o uid=N
           -o gid=N
               Use these options to map UIDs and GIDs.

       -P PIDFILE
       --pidfile PIDFILE
           When nbdfuse is ready to serve, write the nbdfuse process ID (PID)
           to PIDFILE.  This can be used in scripts to wait until nbdfuse is
           ready.  Note you mustn't try to kill nbdfuse.  Use "fusermount -u"
           to unmount the mountpoint which will cause nbdfuse to exit cleanly.

       -r
       --readonly
           Access the network block device read-only.  The virtual file will
           have read-only permissions, and any writes will return errors.

       -V
       --version
           Display the package name and version and exit.

MODES
       Modes are used to select the NBD server.  The default mode uses an NBD
       URI (see nbd_connect_uri(3) and
       https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/uri.md).  For
       example this specifies a TLS-encrypted connection to "example.com" port
       10809, with export name "disk":

        nbdfuse dir nbds://example.com/disk

       Other modes are:

       --command CMD [ARGS ...]
           Select command mode.  In this mode an NBD server can be run
           directly from the command line with nbdfuse communicating with the
           server over the server’s stdin/stdout.  Normally you would use this
           with "nbdkit -s".  See "EXAMPLES" above and nbd_connect_command(3).

       --fd N
           Select file descriptor mode.  In this mode a connected socket is
           passed to nbdfuse.  nbdfuse connects to the socket on the numbered
           file descriptor.  See also nbd_connect_socket(3).

       --socket-activation CMD [ARGS ...]
           Select systemd socket activation mode.  This is similar to
           --command, but is used for servers like qemu-nbd(8) which support
           systemd socket activation.  See "EXAMPLES" above and
           nbd_connect_systemd_socket_activation(3).

       --tcp HOST PORT
           Select TCP mode.  Connect to an NBD server on a host and port over
           an unencrypted TCP socket.  See also nbd_connect_tcp(3).

       --unix SOCKET
           Select Unix mode.  Connect to an NBD server on a Unix domain
           socket.  See also nbd_connect_unix(3).

       --vsock CID PORT
           Select vsock mode.  Connect to an NBD server on a "AF_VSOCK"
           socket.  See also nbd_connect_vsock(3).

NOTES
   Loop mounting
       It is tempting (and possible) to loop mount the file.  However this
       will be very slow and may sometimes deadlock.  Better alternatives are
       to use nbd-client(8) or qemu-nbd(8), or more securely libguestfs(3),
       guestfish(1) or guestmount(1) which can all access NBD servers.

   As a way to access NBD servers
       You can use this to access NBD servers, but it is usually better (and
       definitely much faster) to use libnbd(3) directly instead.  To access
       NBD servers from the command line, look at nbdsh(1).

   Compared to "nbd-client"
       This program is similar in concept to nbd-client(8) (which turns NBD
       into /dev/nbdX device nodes), except:

       ·   nbd-client is faster because it uses a special kernel module

       ·   nbd-client requires root, but nbdfuse can be used by any user

       ·   nbdfuse virtual files can be mounted anywhere in the filesystem

       ·   nbdfuse uses libnbd to talk to the NBD server

       ·   nbdfuse requires FUSE support in the kernel

   Compared to "qemu-nbd"
       qemu-nbd(8) can also attach itself to /dev/nbdX device nodes.  The
       differences from nbdfuse are similar to the list above.
