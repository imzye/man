NAME
       quazip - C++/Qt wrapper for UNZIP/ZIP

SYNOPSIS
       quazip

DESCRIPTION
       QuaZIP  is  a simple C++ wrapper over Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP package that can be used to access ZIP archives. It uses Trolltech's Qt toolkit.  QuaZIP al‐
       lows you to access files inside ZIP archives using QIODevice API, and that means that you can also use QTextStream, QDataStream or whatever you would like to
       use on your zipped files.  QuaZIP provides complete abstraction of the ZIP/UNZIP API, for both reading from and writing to ZIP archives.
