NAME
       usbguard-notifier - provides user-friendly notifications for USBGuard

SYNOPSIS
       usbguard-notifier [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       USBGuard Notifier is a software framework mainly for detecting usbguard policy modifications as well as device presence changes. The purpose of this project is to create user-friendly
       notifications in form of quick pop-up messages.

OPTIONS
       -w, --wait
           Wait until an active IPC connection is estabilished.

       -d, --debug
           Enable debug mode.

       -h, --help
           Show help.

HOW TO START
       In order to make usbguard-notifier work properly, you will need to perform certain actions:

        1. Each user who wants to run usbguard-notifier service needs to have sufficient IPC privileges to connect to the usbguard IPC interface. To allow a specific user to listen to the device signals
           you can use the following command:

           $ sudo usbguard add-user USER -d listen

           Or you can allow a group of users:

           $ sudo usbguard add-user -g GROUP -d listen

        2. Now, you need a running usbguard-daemon instance to connect to. Start the usbguard service or restart it if it is already running.

        3. After configuring IPC privileges and starting up the usbguard-daemon, the user can now start the usbguard-notifier service:

           $ systemctl start --user usbguard-notifier.service

           Optionally, the user can enable the usbguard-notifier service to start automatically after the login:

           $ systemctl enable --user usbguard-notifier.service

       The usbguard-notifier should now be running. Anytime a USB device gets inserted/ejected or allowed/blocked a message will pop up in the user’s graphical interface.
