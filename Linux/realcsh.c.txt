NAME
       realcsh.c - A shell for running C code

SYNOPSIS
       realcsh.c [gcc options]

DESCRIPTION
       realcsh.c is an interactive shell that runs C source code.  A line of input is handled as a line in main() function, and the resulting C code is compiled, and executed.

       If a line starting with # such as #include <stdio.h> is entered, it is added to every code after that at the start of sourcecode.

       The list of such lines can be seen with ##

EXAMPLES
       The following is an example session

       $ realcsh.c
       REAL csh: printf("hello world\n");
       hello world
       REAL csh: system ("pwd");
       /home/dancer/

INTERNALS
       The following is how the C code looks like.

       /*BINFMTC:
       */
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <unistd.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       int main(int argc, char ** argv)
       {
       input-line
       return 0;
       }
