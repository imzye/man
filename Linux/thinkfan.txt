NAME
       thinkfan.conf - YAML-formatted config for thinkfan(1)

DESCRIPTION
       YAML  is a very powerful, yet concise notation for structured data.  Its full specification is available at https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html.  Thinkfan uses only a small subset of the full YAML
       syntax, so it may be helpful, but not strictly necessary for users to take a look at the spec.

       The most important thing to note is that indentation is syntactically relevant.  In particular, tabs should not be mixed with spaces.  We recommend using two spaces for  indentation,  like  it  is
       shown below.

       The thinkfan config has three main sections:

       sensors:
              Where  temperatures  should be read from. All hwmon-style drivers are supported, as well as /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal, and, depending on the compile-time options, libatasmart (to read tempera‐
              tures directly from hard disks) and NVML (via the proprietary nvidia driver).

       fans:  Which fans should be used (currently only one allowed).  Support for multiple fans is currently in development and  planned  for  a  future  release.   Both  hwmon-style  PWM  controls  and
              /proc/acpi/ibm/fan can be used.

       levels:
              Maps  temperatures  to  fan speeds.  A “simple mapping” just specifies one temperature as the lower and upper bound (respectively) for a given fan speed.  In a “detailed mapping”, the upper
              and lower bounds are specified for each driver/sensor configured under sensors:.  This mode should be used when thinkfan is monitoring multiple devices that can tolerate  different  amounts
              of heat.

       Under each of these sections, there must be a list of key-value maps, each of which configures a sensor driver, fan driver or fan speed mapping.

SENSOR & FAN DRIVERS
       For  thinkfan to work, it first needs to know which temperature sensor drivers and which fan drivers it should use.  The mapping between temperature readings and fan speeds is specified in a sepa‐
       rate config section (see the FAN SPEEDS section below).

   Sensor Syntax
       The entries under the sensors: section can specify sysfs/hwmon, lm_sensors, thinkpad_acpi, NVML or atasmart drivers.  Support for lm_sensors, NVML and atasmart requires the  appropriate  libraries
       and  must have been enabled at compile time.  There can be any number (greater than zero) and combination of hwmon, tpacpi, nvml and atasmart entries.  However there may be at most one instance of
       the tpacpi entry.

       The syntax for identifying each type of sensors looks as follows:

       ########
       sensors:
         - hwmon: hwmon-path          # A path to a sysfs/hwmon sensor
           name: hwmon-name           # Optional entry
           model: hwmon-model         # Optional entry for nvme
           indices: index-list        # Optional entry

         - chip: chip-name            # An lm_sensors/libsensors chip...
           ids: id-list               # ... with some feature IDs

         - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal  # Provided by the thinkpad_acpi kernel module
           indices: index-list        # Optional entry

         - nvml: nvml-bus-id          # Uses the proprietary nVidia driver

         - atasmart: disk-device-file # Requires libatasmart support

         - ...

       Additionally, each sensor entry can have a number of settings that modify its behavior:

       ########
       sensors:
         - ...: ... # A sensor specification as shown above
           correction: correction-list  # Optional entry
           optional: bool-ignore-errors # Optional entry
           max_errors: num-max-errors   # Optional entry

   Fan Syntax
       Since version 2.0, thinkfan can control multiple fans.  So any number of hwmon fan sections can be specified.  Note however that the thinkpad_acpi kernel module only supports one fan, so there can
       be at most one tpacpi section:

       # ...
       fans:
         - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

         - hwmon: hwmon-path
           name: hwmon-name
           indices: index-list

         - ...

       The behavior of any fan can optionally be controlled with the optional and max_errors keywords, and by specifying a local fan speed config under the levels: keyword:

       # ...
       fans:
         - ...:  ... # A fan specification as shown above
           optional: bool-ignore-errors # Optional entry
           max_errors: num-max-errors   # Optional entry
           levels: levels-section       # Optional entry

   Values
       hwmon-path
              There are three ways of specifying hwmon fans or sensors:

              1) A full path of a “temp*_input” or “pwm*” file, like “/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1” or “/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input”.  In this case, the “indices: index-list”  and  “name:  hwmon-
                 name” entries are unnecessary since the path uniquely identifies a specific fan or sensor.

                 Note  that  this method may lead to problems when the load order of the drivers changes across bootups, because in the “hwmonX” folder name, the X actually corresponds to the load order.
                 Use method 2) or 3) to avoid this problem.

              2) A directory that contains a specific hwmon driver, for example “/sys/devices/platform/nct6775.2592”.  Note that this path does not contain the load-order dependent “hwmonX”  folder.   As
                 long  as  it contains only a single hwmon driver/interface it is sufficient to specify the “indices: index-list” entry to tell thinkfan which specific sensors to use from that interface.
                 The “name: hwmon-name” entry is unnecessary.

              3) A directory that contains multiple or all of the hwmon drivers, for example “/sys/class/hwmon”.  Here, both the “name: hwmon-name” and “indices: index-list” entries are required to  tell
                 thinkfan which interface to select below that path, and which sensors or which fan to use from that interface.

       hwmon-name
              The name of a hwmon interface, typically found in a file called “name”.  This has to be specified if hwmon-path is a base path that contains multiple hwmons.  This method of specifying sen‐
              sors is particularly useful if the full path to a particular hwmon keeps changing between bootups, e.g. due to changing load order of the driver modules.

       hwmon-model
              The  model  of  a  device  in  a  hwmon  interface  usually found for NVME devices in a file under “device” called “model”.  For example, you might have an NVME “/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon3/de‐
              vice/model” and you might have an external NVME over USB or Thunderbolt that you don't want to monitor or you might have two NVME's.

       index-list
              A YAML list [ X1, X2, ... ] that specifies which sensors, resp. which fan to use from a given interface.  Both /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal and also many hwmon interfaces  contain  multiple  sen‐
              sors, and not all of them may be relevant for fan control.

              • For  hwmon  entries,  this  is required if hwmon-path does not refer directly to a single “tempXi_input” file, but to a folder that contains one or more of them.  In this case, index-list
                specifies the Xi for the “tempXi_input” files that should be used.  A hwmon interface may also contain multiple PWM controls for fans, so in that case, index-list must contain exactly one
                entry.

              • For tpacpi sensors, this entry is optional.  If it is omitted, all temperatures found in /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal will be used.

       chip-name
              The unique name of an lm-sensors hwmon chip. lm-sensors or libsensors is the official client library to access the sysfs hwmon subsystem, and as such it is the preferred way  of  specifying
              sensors.  Available chips can be listed by running the sensors command as root.  The header above each block will be the chip name.

       ids    A list of lm-sensors feature IDs, for example “[ SYSTIN, CPUTIN, "Sensor 2" ]”.  In the sensors command output, the name before the colon on each line will be the feature ID.

       nvml-bus-id
              NOTE: only available if thinkfan was compiled with USE_NVML enabled.

              The  PCI  bus  ID of an nVidia graphics card that is run with the proprietary nVidia driver. Can be obtained with e.g. “lspci | grep -i vga”.  Usually, nVidia cards will use the open source
              nouveau driver, which should support hwmon sensors instead.

       disk-device-file
              NOTE: only available if thinkfan was compiled with USE_ATASMART enabled.

              Full path to a device file for a hard disk that supports S.M.A.R.T.  See also the -d option in thinkfan(1) that prevents thinkfan from waking up sleeping (mechanical) disks  to  read  their
              temperature.

       correction-list (optional, zeroes by default)
              A  YAML  list that specifies temperature offsets for each sensor in use by the given driver. Use this if you want to use the “simple” level syntax, but need to compensate for devices with a
              lower heat tolerance.  Note however that the detailed level syntax is usually the better (i.e. more fine-grained) choice.

       bool-ignore-errors (optional, false by default)
              A truth value (yes/no/true/false) that specifies whether thinkfan should ignore all errors when using a given sensor or fan.  Normally, thinkfan will exit with an error message if it  fails
              reading temperatures from a sensor or writing to a fan.

              An  optional  device  will not delay startup.  Instead, thinkfan will commence normal operation with the remaining devices and re-try initializing unavailable optional devices in every loop
              until all are found.

              Marking a sensor/fan as optional may be useful for removable hardware or devices that may get switched off entirely to save power.

       num-max-errors (optional, 0 by default)
              A positive integer that specifies how often thinkfan is allowed to re-try if if fails to initialize, read from or write to a given sensor or fan.  On startup, thinkfan will attempt to  ini‐
              tialize the device num-max-errors times before commencing normal operation.  If the device cannot be initialized after the given number of attempts, thinkfan will fail.

              When a device with a positive num-max-errors fails during runtime, thinkfan will likewise attempt to re-initialize it the given number of times before failing.

       levels-section (optional, use global levels section by default)
              As  of thinkfan 2.0, multiple fans can be configured.  To this end, each fan can now have its own levels: section (cf. FAN SPEEDS below).  The syntax of the global vs. the fan-specific lev‐
              els: section are identical, the only difference being that in a fan-specific one, the speed value(s) refer only the fans configured in that particular fans: entry.

              NOTE: Global and fan-specific levels: are mutually exclusive, i.e.  there cannot be both a global one and fan-specific sections.

FAN SPEEDS
       The levels: section specifies a list of fan speeds with associated lower and upper temperature bounds.  If temperature(s) drop below the lower bound, thinkfan switches to the previous  level,  and
       if the upper bound is reached, thinkfan switches to the next level.

       Since thinkfan 2.0, this section can appear either under an individual fan (cf. levels: keyword under Fan Syntax), or globally.

   Simple Syntax
       In the simplified form, only one temperature is specified as an upper/lower limit for a given fan speed.  In that case, the lower-bound and upper-bound are compared only to the highest temperature
       found  among  all  configured  sensors.  All other temperatures are ignored.  This mode is suitable for small systems (like laptops) where there is only one device (e.g. the CPU) whose temperature
       needs to be controlled, or where the required fan behaviour is similar enough for all heat-generating devices.

       # ...
       levels:
         - [ fan-speed, lower-bound, upper-bound ]
         - ...

   Detailed Syntax
       This mode is suitable for more complex systems, with devices that have different temperature ratings.  For example, many modern CPUs and GPUs can deal with temperatures above 80°C on a  daily  ba‐
       sis, whereas a hard disk will die quickly if it reaches such temperatures.  In detailed mode, upper and lower temperature limits are specified for each sensor individually:

       # ...
       levels:
         - speed: [ fan1-speed, fan2-speed, ... ]
           lower_limit: [ l1, l2, ... ]
           upper_limit: [ u1, u2, ... ]
         - ...

   Values
       fan1-speed, fan2-speed, ...

       fan-speed
              When  multiple  fans  are specified under the fans: section, value of the speed: keyword must be a list of as many fanX-speed values.  They are applied to the fans by their order of appear‐
              ance, i.e. the first speed value applies to the fan that has been specified first, the second value to the second fan, and so on.  If there is just one fan, instead of a list with just  one
              element, the speed value can be given as a scalar.

              The possible speed values for fanX-speed are different depending on which fan driver is used:

              •  For a hwmon fan, fanX-speed is a numeric value ranging from 0 to 255, corresponding to the PWM values accepted by the various kernel drivers.

              •  For  a  tpacpi fan on Lenovo/IBM ThinkPads and some other Lenovo laptops (see SENSORS & FAN DRIVERS above), numeric values and strings can be used.  The numeric values range from 0 to 7.
                 The string values take the form "level lvl-id", where lvl-id may be a value from 0 to 7, auto, full-speed or disengaged.  The numeric values 0 to 7 correspond to the regular  fan  speeds
                 used by the firmware, although many firmwares don't even use level 7.  The value "level auto" gives control back to the firmware, which may be useful if the fan behavior only needs to be
                 changed for certain specific temperature ranges (usually at the high and low end of the range).  The values "level full-speed" and "level disengaged" take the fan speed control away from
                 the  firmware, causing the fan to slowly ramp up to an absolute maximum that can be achieved within electrical limits.  Note that this will run the fan out of specification and cause in‐
                 creased wear, though it may be helpful to combat thermal throttling.

       l1, l2, ...

       u1, u2, ...
              The lower and upper temperature limits refer to the sensors in the same order in which they were found when processing the sensors: section (see SENSOR & FAN DRIVERS above).  For the  first
              level  entry,  the  lower_limit  may be omitted, and for the last one, the upper_limit may be omitted.  For all levels in between, the lower limits must overlap with the upper limits of the
              previous level, to make sure the entire temperature range is covered and that there is some hysteresis between speed levels.

              Instead of a temperature, an underscore (_) can be given.  An underscore means that the temperature of that sensor should be ignored at the given speed level.
