NAME
       optirun - run programs on the discrete video card

SYNOPSIS
       optirun [OPTION]... command [command options...]

DESCRIPTION
       Run an application using the discrete video card.

       --failsafe
              run a program even if the nvidia card is unavailable

       --no-failsafe
              do not run a program if the nvidia card is unavailable

       --no-xorg
              do not start secondary X server (implies -b none)

       -b, --bridge METHOD
              acceleration/displaying  bridge to use. Valid values are auto, virtualgl and primus. The --vgl-* options only make sense when using the virtualgl bridge, while the --primus-* options apply only
              when using the primus bridge.  Additionally, value none is recognized, and its effect is to add paths to driver libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (useful for nvidia-settings and CUDA applications)

       -c, --vgl-compress METHOD
              image compression or transport to use with VirtualGL. Valid values for METHOD are proxy, jpeg, rgb, xv and yuv. Changing this setting may affect performance, CPU usage and image quality

       --vgl-options OPTS
              a space-separated list of command options to be passed to vglrun. Useful for debugging virtualgl by passing options to it like +tr. These OPTS override the settings from optirun so  be  careful
              with setting it

       --primus-ldpath PATH
              a colon-separated list of paths which are searched for the primus libGL.so.1

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              suppresses all logging messages

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity level of log messages. It can be specified up to two times (or five if --quiet is used)

       --debug
              show all logging messages by setting the verbosity level to the maximum

       -C, --config FILE
              retrieve settings for Bumblebee from FILE

       -d, --display VDISPLAY
              find the Bumblebee X server on VDISPLAY. Do not confuse this option with the DISPLAY environment variable. By default, PATH is queried from the daemon

       -l, --ldpath PATH
              libraries like libGL.so are searched in PATH (useful for the nvidia driver). By default, PATH is queried from the

       -s, --socket FILENAME
              use FILENAME for communication with the daemon

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       optirun glxspheres
              Runs the graphics demo supplied with Virtual GL.

       optirun -c yuv glxspheres
              Runs a program with the yuv transport method for better performance.

       optirun firefox http://example.com
              Run a program with arguments.
