NAME
       Ident - the AfterStep window identification module

SYNOPSIS
       Ident

DESCRIPTION
       The  Ident  module prompts the user to select a target window, if the module was not launched from within a window context in AfterStep.  After that, the Ident module pops up a window with information
       about the window which was selected.

       Although Ident can be run from the command line, it is normally spawned by afterstep from within an afterstep menu file by 'Modules->Ident'.

SEE ALSO
