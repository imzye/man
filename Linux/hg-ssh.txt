HG-SSH(8)                      Mercurial Manual                      HG-SSH(8)

NAME
       hg-ssh - restricted ssh login shell for Mercurial

SYNOPSIS
       hg-ssh repositories...

DESCRIPTION
       hg-ssh is a wrapper for ssh access to a limited set of mercurial repos.

       To  be  used  in  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with the "command" option, see
       sshd(8):   command="hg-ssh   path/to/repo1    /path/to/repo2    ~/repo3
       ~user/repo4"  ssh-dss  ...   (probably together with these other useful
       options: no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding)

       This allows pull/push over ssh from/to the repositories given as  argu‐
       ments.

       If  all your repositories are subdirectories of a common directory, you
       can allow shorter paths with:  command="cd  path/to/my/repositories  &&
       hg-ssh repo1 subdir/repo2"

       You  can  use  pattern matching of your normal shell, e.g.: command="cd
       repos && hg-ssh user/thomas/* projects/{mercurial,foo}"

       You can also add a --read-only flag to allow read-only access to a key,
       e.g.: command="hg-ssh --read-only repos/*"

BUGS
       Probably  lots,  please  post  them  to the mailing list (see Resources
       below) when you find them.
