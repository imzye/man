NAME
       Vnlog::Parser - Simple library to parse vnlog data

SYNOPSIS
        use Vnlog::Parser;

        my $parser = Vnlog::Parser->new();
        while (<DATA>)
        {
            if( !$parser->parse($_) )
            {
                die "Error parsing vnlog line '$_': " . $parser->error();
            }

            my $d = $parser->getValuesHash();
            next unless %$d;

            say "$d->{time}: $d->{height}";
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple perl script to parse vnlog input and make the incoming key/values available. The example above is representative of normal use. API functions are

       •   new()

           Creates new Vnlog::Parser object. Takes no arguments.

       •   parse(line)

           Method to call for each input line. On error, a false value is returned.

       •   error()

           If an error occurred, returns a string that describes the error.

       •   getKeys()

           Returns a list-ref containing the current column labels or undef if this hasn't been parsed yet.

       •   getValues()

           Returns a list-ref containing the values for the current line or undef if there aren't any. This isn't an error necessarily because this line could have been a comment. Empty fields are '-' in
           the vnlog and undef in the values returned here.

       •   getValuesHash()

           Returns  a hash-ref containing the key-value mapping for the current line or undef if there's no data in this line. This isn't an error necessarily because this line could have been a comment.
           Empty fields are '-' in the vnlog and undef in the values returned here.
