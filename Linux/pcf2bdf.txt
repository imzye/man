NAME
       pcf2bdf - convert X font from Portable Compiled Format to Bitmap Distribution Format

SYNOPSIS
       pcf2bdf [ -v ] [ -o outputfile ] [ fontfile.pcf[.gz] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Pcf2bdf  is  a  font  de-compiler.  It converts X font from Portable Compiled Format (PCF) to Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF).  It can also accept a compressed/gzipped PCF file as input, but gzip
       must be found in your PATH.

       FONTBOUNDINGBOX in a BDF file is not used by bdftopcf , so pcf2bdf generates irresponsible values.

OPTIONS
       -v      very verbose output.

       -o output-file-name
               By default pcf2bdf writes the bdf file to standard output; this option gives the name of a file to be used instead.
