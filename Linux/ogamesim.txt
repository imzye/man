NAME
       Console Ogame Simulator

SYNOPSYS
       ogamesim [ -i <task.txt> ] [ -o <result.txt> ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tasks for simulation are consist of text files.

       Example of task concluding all possible units is adduced bellow.

OPTIONS
       -i <input file>: task file (STDIN unless defined);

       -o <output file>: result file (STDOUT unless defined);

       -s <iterations count>: 1 <= value <= N (no limits);

       -t <max simulation time>: (seconds) 0 <= value <= N, 0=no limits;

       -f <forks count>: 0 <= value <= 100.

RETURN VALUES
       0: if success
