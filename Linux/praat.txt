NAME
       praat-launch - Wrapper for launching Praat with sound files or scripts as argument

SYNOPSIS
       praat-launch [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The  praat-launch  command  allows  one  to  open  sound files or scripts with praat from the command line.  The sound file can be of any format accepted by Praat (for instance WAV, FLAC, or MP3).
       Scripts are text files, usually with the .praat extension.

       If no argument is ginve, then a new instance of praat is started.

       A existent instance of the Praat program is used for opening the file.  It there is no instance running, a new one is created.

       This program is intended to be used with the desktop file present in the Debian distribution, but may be useful to regular users.
