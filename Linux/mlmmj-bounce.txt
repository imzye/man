DESCRIPTION
       mlmmj-bounce  is  used  to  handle mails that are bouncing. When a mail
       arrives  to  the  system,  mlmmj-bounce   will   register   in   <list‐
       dir>/bounce/<addrstring>  info  about which number that bounced at what
       time. An example of such a line could be:

       109:1094409801 # Sun Sep  5 20:43:21 2004

       The above shows that message  number  109  bounced  1094409801  seconds
       after  epoch  which  is  in  human  date stamps is Sunday September 5th
       20:43:21 2004.

       The last bounce mail  received  to  the  address  is  saved  in  <list‐
       dir>/bounce/<addrstring>.lastmsg.

       When  the  -p  option is used it sends out a probe email including info
       that it's a bounce probe and a list of the bounced message numbers. The
       existance  of a <listdir>/bounce/<addrstring>.probe file indicates that
       a probe have been sent out.
