NAME
       ReactiveNavigationDemo - GUI demo of robot reactive navigation

SYNOPSIS
       ReactiveNavigationDemo

DESCRIPTION
       A program to demonstrate the usage of the mrpt reactivenav library. It allow the user to set an arbitrary target and then simulate the robot actions to try to reach the target.

       The movements take into account the arbitrary shape of the robot, and a set of kinematically-constrained trajectories.
