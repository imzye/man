NAME
       adactl - Ada rules controller

SYNOPSIS
       adactl [options] unit [[+|-]unit | [@]file] ...  [-- ASIS options]

       adactl -h rule ... | all | commands | license | list | options | rules | version

DESCRIPTION
       AdaControl  is  an  Ada  rules controller. It is used to control that Ada software meets the requirements of a number of parameterizable rules. It is not in‐
       tended to supplement checks made by the compiler, but rather to search for particular violations of good-practice rules, or to  check  that  some  rules  are
       obeyed project-wide.

       Commercial  support is available for AdaControl, see file /usr/share/doc/adacontrol/support.txt. If you plan to use AdaControl for industrial projects, or if
       you want it to be customized or extended to match your own needs, please contact Adalog at info@adalog.fr.
