NAME
       KBtin - a MUD client and an environment for line-based programs

SYNOPSIS
       KBtin [ -v ] [ scriptfile [ scriptfile2 ... ]]

DESCRIPTION
       KBtin is a MUD client based on the venerable tintin++ ; however it has uses beyond playing MUDs.
       A few commands (try #help for the full list):

       #session sesname hostname port
              Starts a new session. The sesname is a nickname of the new session, and doesn't play any important role.  KBtin will open a telnet connection to the given hostname : port.

       #run sesname command
              Starts a new session by running a local command.  In particular, you can use it to start an encrypted connection by #run foo ssh foo.bar.baz.

       #help command
              Gives you the help on command.

       #verbatim
              Disables all input parsing, making all text pass as-is.  Features such as scrollback, highlights, logging, keybindings or actions continue to work.

       #end   Exits KBtin and returns you to your shell.

OPTIONS
       -v     Shows the processing done by all subsequent uses of #read.  Equivalent to #verbose 1.

       -q     Turns off the output from #read.  Equivalent to #verbose 0.

       scriptname
              Processes the commands in scriptname, using #read scriptname.

       -c command
              Executes a single command.  (Note: beware of the evil shell and escape
               '#'s!)

       -s host port
              Starts a new session by opening a TELNET connection to the given host on the given port.  KBtin will make up a session name for you.

       -S host port
              Same, except that SSL encryption will be used.

       -r shell_command
              Starts a new session by starting a local process.  The process will be opened in a pseudo-terminal, making it interactive.  The session name will be made up by KBtin.

       -p     Selects the "pipe" driver (default if stdin or stdout is not a terminal).

       -i     Selects the full interactive tty driver (usual default).

       --no-simd
              Disables accelerated pattern matching even if supported; you should never have a need to specify this option.
