NAME
       freeaptxdec - aptX decoder utility

SYNOPSIS
       freeaptxdec [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This utility decodes aptX or aptX HD audio stream from stdin to a raw 24 bit signed stereo on stdout

       When input is damaged it tries to synchronize and recover

       Non-zero return value indicates that input was damaged and some bytes from input aptX audio stream were dropped

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-’).  A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
