NAME
       pfsout - Read pfs frames from stdin and write them in the format determined by the extension of the file name

SYNOPSIS
       pfsout pfsout <file> [<file>...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command can be used to write pfs frames piped to standard input in one of the several recognized formats. The proper format is determined by the extension of the give file name. To get a list of
       recognized formats and extensions, execute:

         pfsin --help

       This command is a front-end for pfsout* programs for writing images: pfsoutrgbe, pfsoutexr, etc. Based on the file extension, appropriate program is executed. If two different file format are given as
       parameters,  two  different program for writing images are executed. Additional options starting with dash '-' can be passed to pfsout* programs. The following rules apply for passing the options: the
       options given before any image file name (or %d pattern) are passed to all pfsout* programs. Options given after image file name are only passed to the program executed for  that  file(s).  Note  also
       that all option that take an argument (except --frames) must given in the form --option=value, that is without a space between an option and its argument.
