Mono(cert-sync)                                                Mono(cert-sync)

NAME
       cert-sync - Mono Certificate Store Sync Tool

SYNOPSIS
       cert-sync [--quiet] [--user] filename

DESCRIPTION
       This tool allows you to populate a Mono certificate store, from a large
       concatenated list of certificates in PEM format (commonly  provided  on
       most Linux distributions).

       Its  use is intended to be automated at Mono install time, by distribu‐
       tion packagers, to seamlessly provide SSL support to Mono  applications
       without further user interaction.

OPTIONS
       --quiet
              Suppress verbose output

       --user Populate  the  per-user  store  in  the  user's  home directory,
              instead of the system-wide store.

       filename.crt
              Path to a certificate bundle. The Mono store will have any extra
              entries  removed, and new entries added, to reflect the provided
              file.

EXAMPLES
       cert-sync /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
              Synchronize the machine store, from the Debian cert store  loca‐
              tion

       cert-sync --user /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
              Synchronize the user store, from the Red Hat cert store location
