DESCRIPTION
       This program creates regular grid (raster) from the scattered data read
       from the OGR datasource. Input data will be interpolated to  fill  grid
       nodes with values, you can choose from various interpolation methods.

       It is possible to set the GDAL_NUM_THREADS configuration option to par‐
       allelize the processing. The value to specify is the number  of  worker
       threads, or ALL_CPUS to use all the cores/CPUs of the computer.

       -ot <type>
              Force  the  output image bands to have a specific data type sup‐
              ported by the driver, which may be one of the  following:  Byte,
              UInt16,  Int16, UInt32, Int32, Float32, Float64, CInt16, CInt32,
              CFloat32 or CFloat64.

       -of <format>
              Select the output format. Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not  speci‐
              fied,  the  format is guessed from the extension (previously was
              GTiff). Use the short format name.

       -txe <xmin> <xmax>
              Set georeferenced X extents of output file to be created.

       -tye <ymin> <ymax>
              Set georeferenced Y extents of output file to be created.

       -tr <xres> <yres>
              Set output file  resolution  (in  target  georeferenced  units).
              Note  that -tr just works in combination with a valid input from
              -txe and -tye

              New in version 3.2.

       -outsize <xsize ysize>
              Set the size of the output file in pixels and lines.  Note  that
              -outsize cannot be used with -tr

       -a_srs <srs_def>
              Override  the  projection  for the output file.  The <i>srs_def>
              may be any of the usual GDAL/OGR forms,  complete  WKT,  PROJ.4,
              EPSG:n or a file containing the WKT.  No reprojection is done.

       -zfield <field_name>
              Identifies  an attribute field on the features to be used to get
              a Z value from. This value overrides Z value read  from  feature
              geometry  record  (naturally, if you have a Z value in geometry,
              otherwise you have no choice and should  specify  a  field  name
              containing Z value).

       -z_increase <increase_value>
              Addition  to  the  attribute field on the features to be used to
              get a Z value from. The addition should be the same  unit  as  Z
              value.  The result value will be Z value + Z increase value. The
              default value is 0.

       -z_multiply <multiply_value>
              This is multiplication ratio for Z field. This can be  used  for
              shift  from  e.g.  foot to meters or from elevation to deep. The
              result value will be (Z value + Z increase value) *  Z  multiply
              value.  The default value is 1.

       -a <[algorithm[:parameter1=value1][:parameter2=value2]...]>
              Set the interpolation algorithm or data metric name and (option‐
              ally) its parameters. See Interpolation algorithms and Data met‐
              rics sections for further discussion of available options.

       -spat <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
              Adds  a  spatial filter to select only features contained within
              the bounding box described by (xmin, ymin) - (xmax, ymax).

       -clipsrc [xmin ymin xmax ymax]|WKT|datasource|spat_extent
              Adds a spatial filter to select only features  contained  within
              the specified bounding box (expressed in source SRS), WKT geome‐
              try (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON), from a datasource or to the  spa‐
              tial  extent of the -spat option if you use the spat_extent key‐
              word. When specifying a datasource, you will generally  want  to
              use  it  in  combination  of the -clipsrclayer, -clipsrcwhere or
              -clipsrcsql options.

       -clipsrcsql <sql_statement>
              Select desired geometries using an SQL query instead.

       -clipsrclayer <layername>
              Select the named layer from the source clip datasource.

       -clipsrcwhere <expression>
              Restrict desired geometries based on attribute query.

       -l <layername>
              Indicates the layer(s) from the datasource that will be used for
              input  features.   May be specified multiple times, but at least
              one layer name or a -sql option must be specified.

       -where <expression>
              An optional SQL WHERE style query expression to  be  applied  to
              select features to process from the input layer(s).

       -sql <select_statement>
              An  SQL statement to be evaluated against the datasource to pro‐
              duce a virtual layer of features to be processed.

       -co <NAME=VALUE>
              Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can
              be  used  to control particulars about the file created. For in‐
              stance, the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to  control
              compression, and whether the file should be tiled.

              The  creation  options available vary by format driver, and some
              simple formats have no creation options at all. A  list  of  op‐
              tions  supported  for  a format can be listed with the --formats
              command line option but the documentation for the format is  the
              definitive  source  of  information  on driver creation options.
              See raster_drivers format specific documentation for legal  cre‐
              ation options for each format.

       -q     Suppress progress monitor and other non-error output.

       <src_datasource>
              Any OGR supported readable datasource.

       <dst_filename>
              The GDAL supported output file.

INTERPOLATION ALGORITHMS
       There are number of interpolation algorithms to choose from.

       More details about them can also be found in gdal_grid_tut

   invdist
       Inverse  distance to a power. This is default algorithm. It has follow‐
       ing parameters:

       • power: Weighting power (default 2.0).

       • smoothing: Smoothing parameter (default 0.0).

       • radius1: The first radius (X axis if rotation angle is 0)  of  search
         ellipse.  Set  this  parameter to zero to use whole point array.  De‐
         fault is 0.0.

       • radius2: The second radius (Y axis if rotation angle is 0) of  search
         ellipse.  Set  this  parameter to zero to use whole point array.  De‐
         fault is 0.0.

       • angle: Angle of search ellipse rotation in  degrees  (counter  clock‐
         wise, default 0.0).

       • max_points:  Maximum  number of data points to use. Do not search for
         more points than this number. This is only used if search ellipse  is
         set  (both  radii  are  non-zero).  Zero  means that all found points
         should be used. Default is 0.

       • min_points: Minimum number of data points to use. If less  amount  of
         points  found  the grid node considered empty and will be filled with
         NODATA marker. This is only used if search ellipse is set (both radii
         are non-zero). Default is 0.

       • nodata: NODATA marker to fill empty points (default 0.0).

   invdistnn
       New in version 2.1.

       Inverse distance to a power with nearest neighbor searching, ideal when
       max_points is used. It has following parameters:

       • power: Weighting power (default 2.0).

       • smoothing: Smoothing parameter (default 0.0).

       • radius: The radius of the search circle, which  should  be  non-zero.
         Default is 1.0.

       • max_points:  Maximum  number of data points to use. Do not search for
         more points than this number. Found points will be ranked from  near‐
         est to furthest distance when weighting. Default is 12.

       • min_points:  Minimum  number of data points to use. If less amount of
         points found the grid node is considered empty  and  will  be  filled
         with NODATA marker. Default is 0.

       • nodata: NODATA marker to fill empty points (default 0.0).

   average
       Moving average algorithm. It has following parameters:

       • radius1:  The  first radius (X axis if rotation angle is 0) of search
         ellipse. Set this parameter to zero to use whole  point  array.   De‐
         fault is 0.0.

       • radius2:  The second radius (Y axis if rotation angle is 0) of search
         ellipse. Set this parameter to zero to use whole  point  array.   De‐
         fault is 0.0.

       • angle:  Angle  of  search ellipse rotation in degrees (counter clock‐
         wise, default 0.0).

       • min_points: Minimum number of data points to use. If less  amount  of
         points  found  the grid node considered empty and will be filled with
         NODATA marker. Default is 0.

       • nodata: NODATA marker to fill empty points (default 0.0).

       Note, that it is essential to set search  ellipse  for  moving  average
       method.  It is a window that will be averaged when computing grid nodes
       values.

   nearest
       Nearest neighbor algorithm. It has following parameters:

       • radius1: The first radius (X axis if rotation angle is 0)  of  search
         ellipse.  Set  this  parameter to zero to use whole point array.  De‐
         fault is 0.0.

       • radius2: The second radius (Y axis if rotation angle is 0) of  search
         ellipse.  Set  this  parameter to zero to use whole point array.  De‐
         fault is 0.0.

       • angle: Angle of search ellipse rotation in  degrees  (counter  clock‐
         wise, default 0.0).

       • nodata: NODATA marker to fill empty points (default 0.0).

   linear
       New in version 2.1.

       Linear interpolation algorithm.

       The Linear method performs linear interpolation by computing a Delaunay
       triangulation of the point cloud, finding in which triangle of the tri‐
       angulation  the  point  is,  and by doing linear interpolation from its
       barycentric coordinates within the triangle.  If the point  is  not  in
       any triangle, depending on the radius, the algorithm will use the value
       of the nearest point or the nodata value.

       It has following parameters:

       • radius: In case the point to be interpolated does not fit into a tri‐
         angle  of  the  Delaunay  triangulation, use that maximum distance to
         search a nearest neighbour, or use nodata otherwise. If  set  to  -1,
         the  search  distance is infinite.  If set to 0, nodata value will be
         always used. Default is -1.

       • nodata: NODATA marker to fill empty points (default 0.0).

DATA METRICS
       Besides the interpolation functionality ref gdal_grid can  be  used  to
       compute  some  data  metrics using the specified window and output grid
       geometry. These metrics are:

       • minimum: Minimum value found in grid node search ellipse.

       • maximum: Maximum value found in grid node search ellipse.

       • range: A difference between the minimum and maximum values  found  in
         grid node search ellipse.

       • count:  A number of data points found in grid node search ellipse.

       • average_distance:  An  average distance between the grid node (center
         of the search ellipse) and all of the data points found in grid  node
         search ellipse.

       • average_distance_pts:  An  average  distance  between the data points
         found in grid node search ellipse. The distance between each pair  of
         points  within  ellipse is calculated and average of all distances is
         set as a grid node value.

       All the metrics have the same set of options:

       • radius1: The first radius (X axis if rotation angle is 0)  of  search
         ellipse.  Set  this  parameter to zero to use whole point array.  De‐
         fault is 0.0.

       • radius2: The second radius (Y axis if rotation angle is 0) of  search
         ellipse.  Set  this  parameter to zero to use whole point array.  De‐
         fault is 0.0.

       • angle: Angle of search ellipse rotation in  degrees  (counter  clock‐
         wise, default 0.0).

       • min_points:  Minimum  number of data points to use. If less amount of
         points found the grid node considered empty and will be  filled  with
         NODATA marker. This is only used if search ellipse is set (both radii
         are non-zero). Default is 0.

       • nodata: NODATA marker to fill empty points (default 0.0).

READING COMMA SEPARATED VALUES
       Often you have a text file with a list of comma separated XYZ values to
       work  with  (so  called CSV file). You can easily use that kind of data
       source in ref gdal_grid. All you  need  is  create  a  virtual  dataset
       header  (VRT)  for  you CSV file and use it as input datasource for ref
       gdal_grid. You can find details on VRT format at vector.vrt description
       page.

       Here is a small example. Let we have a CSV file called <i>dem.csv> con‐
       taining

          Easting,Northing,Elevation
          86943.4,891957,139.13
          87124.3,892075,135.01
          86962.4,892321,182.04
          87077.6,891995,135.01
          ...

       For above data we will create <i>dem.vrt>  header  with  the  following
       content:

          <OGRVRTDataSource>
              <OGRVRTLayer name="dem">
                  <SrcDataSource>dem.csv</SrcDataSource>
                  <GeometryType>wkbPoint</GeometryType>
                  <GeometryField encoding="PointFromColumns" x="Easting" y="Northing" z="Elevation"/>
              </OGRVRTLayer>
          </OGRVRTDataSource>

       This  description  specifies so called 2.5D geometry with three coordi‐
       nates X, Y and Z. Z value will be used for interpolation. Now  you  can
       use  <i>dem.vrt>  with all OGR programs (start with ref ogrinfo to test
       that everything works fine). The datasource will contain  single  layer
       called  <i>"dem"> filled with point features constructed from values in
       CSV file. Using this technique you can handle CSV files with more  than
       three columns, switch columns, etc.

       If your CSV file does not contain column headers then it can be handled
       in the following way:

          <GeometryField encoding="PointFromColumns" x="field_1" y="field_2" z="field_3"/>

       The vector.csv description page contains details  on  CSV  format  sup‐
       ported by GDAL/OGR.

C API
       This utility is also callable from C with GDALGrid().

EXAMPLES
       The  following  would  create  raster TIFF file from VRT datasource de‐
       scribed in Reading comma separated values  section  using  the  inverse
       distance  to a power method.  Values to interpolate will be read from Z
       value of geometry record.

          gdal_grid -a invdist:power=2.0:smoothing=1.0 -txe 85000 89000 -tye 894000 890000 -outsize 400 400 -of GTiff -ot Float64 -l dem dem.vrt dem.tiff

       The next command does the same thing as the  previous  one,  but  reads
       values   to   interpolate  from  the  attribute  field  specified  with
       <b>-zfield</b> option instead of geometry record. So in this case X and
       Y  coordinates  are being taken from geometry and Z is being taken from
       the <i>"Elevation"> field.  The GDAL_NUM_THREADS is also set to  paral‐
       lelize the computation.

          gdal_grid -zfield "Elevation" -a invdist:power=2.0:smoothing=1.0 -txe 85000 89000 -tye 894000 890000 -outsize 400 400 -of GTiff -ot Float64 -l dem dem.vrt dem.tiff --config GDAL_NUM_THREADS ALL_CPUS
