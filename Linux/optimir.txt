NAME
       optimir - Integrating genetic variations in miRNA alignment

SYNOPSIS
       optimir [options]

DESCRIPTION
       OptimiR  is  a  miRSeq  data  alignment workflow. It integrates genetic information to assess the impact of variants on miRNA expression.  OptimiR: A bioinformatics pipeline designed to detect and
       quantify miRNAs, isomiRs and polymiRs from miRSeq data, and study the impact of genetic variations on polymiRs' expression.

OPTIONS
   Basic options
       -h, --help
              Produce help message

   Subcommands
       process
              Process a single fastq file with the OptimiR workflow

       summarize
              Summarize results of previously processed samples

       libprep
              Only prepare small RNA alignment library sequences that integrates genetic variants (required before processing multiple samples in parallel)
