NAME
       ethshowallports

       Displays basic port state and statistics for all host nodes.

       NOTE:  ethreport is more powerful Intel(R) Ethernet Fabric Suite FastFabric commands. For general fabric analysis, use ethreport with options such as -o errors and -o slowlinks to perform an efficient
       analysis of link speeds and errors.

Syntax
       ethshowallports [-f  hostfile] [-h 'hosts']
       [-S]

Options
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -f hostfile

                 Specifies the file containing the list of hosts in cluster. Default is /etc/eth-tools/hosts file.

       -h hosts

                 Specifies the list of hosts for which to show ports.

       -S

                 Securely prompts for password for admin on chassis.

Environment Variables
       The following environment variables are also used by this command:

       HOSTS

                 List of hosts, used if -h option not supplied.

       HOSTS_FILE

                 File containing list of hosts, used in absence of -f and -h.

Example
       ethshowallports

       ethshowallports -h 'elrond arwen'

       HOSTS='elrond arwen' ethshowallports

Notes
       When performing ethshowallports against hosts, internally SSH is used. The command ethshowallports requires that password-less SSH be set up between the host running the Intel(R) Ethernet Fabric Suite
       FastFabric Toolset and the hosts ethshowallports is operating against. The ethsetupssh FastFabric tool can aid in setting up password-less SSH.
