NAME
       Source-highlight-settings - utility that can be used to write a configuration file for GNU Source-highlight (and its library)

SYNOPSIS
       source-highlight-settings

DESCRIPTION
       Since version 3.0, GNU Source-highlight includes also the utility source-highlight-settings, which can be used to check whether source-highlight will be able to find its language definition files, and
       other configuration files, and in case, to store the correct settings in a configuration file, in the user home directory.

       In particular, the stored configuration file will be called source-highlight.conf and will be stored in $HOME/.source-highlight/.

       For the moment, this file only stores the default value for the --data-dir option.

       This utility is part of GNU Source-highlight, maintained by:
