NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Compile - Common tests to check syntax of your modules, using only core modules

VERSION
       version 2.058

SYNOPSIS
       In your dist.ini:

           [Test::Compile]
           skip      = Test$
           fake_home = 1
           needs_display = 1
           fail_on_warning = author
           bail_out_on_fail = 1
           switch = -M-warnings=numeric    ; like "no warnings 'numeric'

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Dist::Zilla plugin that runs at the gather files stage, providing a test file (configurable, defaulting to t/00-compile.t).

       This test will find all modules and scripts in your distribution, and try to compile them one by one. This means it's a bit slower than loading them all at once, but it will catch more errors.

       The generated test is guaranteed to only depend on modules that are available in core.  Most options only require perl 5.6.2; the "bail_out_on_fail" option requires the version of Test::More that
       shipped with perl 5.12 (but the test still runs on perl 5.6).

       This plugin accepts the following options:

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
   "filename"
       The name of the generated file. Defaults to t/00-compile.t

   "phase"
       The phase for which to register prerequisites. Defaults to "test".  Setting this to a false value will disable prerequisite registration.

   "skip"
       A regex to skip compile test for modules matching it. The match is done against the module name ("Foo::Bar"), not the file path (lib/Foo/Bar.pm).  This option can be repeated to specify multiple
       regexes.

   "file"
       A filename to also test, in addition to any files found earlier.  It will be tested as a module if it ends with ".pm" or ".PM", and as a script otherwise.  Module filenames should be relative to
       lib; others should be relative to the base of the repository.  This option can be repeated to specify multiple additional files.

   "fake_home"
       A boolean to indicate whether to fake $ENV{HOME}.  This may be needed if your module unilaterally creates stuff in the user's home directory: indeed, some cpantesters will smoke test your
       distribution with a read-only home directory. Defaults to false.

   "needs_display"
       A boolean to indicate whether to skip the compile test on non-Win32 systems when $ENV{DISPLAY} is not set. Defaults to false.

   "fail_on_warning"
       A string to indicate when to add a test for warnings during compilation checks. Possible values are:

       •   "none": do not test for warnings

       •   "author": test for warnings only when AUTHOR_TESTING is set (default, and recommended)

       •   "all": always test for warnings (not recommended, as this can prevent installation of modules when upstream dependencies exhibit warnings in a new Perl release)

   "bail_out_on_fail"
       A boolean to indicate whether the test will BAIL_OUT of all subsequent tests when compilation failures are encountered. Defaults to false.

   "module_finder"
       This is the name of a FileFinder for finding modules to check.  The default value is ":InstallModules"; this option can be used more than once.  .pod files are always skipped.

       Other predefined finders are listed in "default_finders" in Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser.  You can define your own with the [FileFinder::ByName] and [FileFinder::Filter] plugins.

   "script_finder"
       Just  like  "module_finder",  but  for finding scripts.  The default value is ":PerlExecFiles" (when available; otherwise ":ExecFiles") -- see also Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExecDir, to make sure these
       files are properly marked as executables for the installer.

   "xt_mode"
       When true, the default "filename" becomes xt/author/00-compile.t and the default "dependency" phase becomes "develop".

   "switch"
       Use this option to pass a command-line switch (e.g. "-d:Confess", "-M-warnings=numeric") to the command that tests the module or script. Can be used more  than  once.   See  perlrun  for  more  on
       constructing these switches.

RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS
       If the environment variable $PERL_COMPILE_TEST_DEBUG is set to a true option when the test is run, the command to test each file will be printed as a "diag".
