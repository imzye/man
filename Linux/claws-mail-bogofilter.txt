NAME
       claws-mail-bogofilter - scanning mails for spam with Bogofilter

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-bogofilter package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-bogofilter is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin allows scanning incoming mails using bogofilter to decide if they are spam or not.

       Bogofilter can also be taught to recognise spam or ham messages with the corresponding menu entries.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named bogofilter.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

SEE ALSO
       bogofilter(1), claws-mail(1), claws-mail-extra-plugins(7).
