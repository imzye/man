Config::MethodProxy(3pm)                                                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                         Config::MethodProxy(3pm)

NAME
       Config::MethodProxy - Integrate dynamic logic with static configuration.

SYNOPSIS
           use Config::MethodProxy;

           $config = get_your_config_somewhere();
           $config = apply_method_proxies( $config );

DESCRIPTION
       A method proxy is a particular data structure which, when found, is replaced by the value returned by calling that method.  In this way static configuration can be setup to call your code and
       return dynamic contents.  This makes static configuration much more powerful, and gives you the ability to be more declarative in how dynamic values make it into your configuration.

EXAMPLE
       Consider this static YAML configuration:

           ---
           db:
               dsn: DBI:mysql:database=foo
               username: bar
               password: abc123

       Putting your database password inside of a configuration file is usually considered a bad practice.  You can use a method proxy to get around this without jumping through a bunch of hoops:

           ---
           db:
               dsn: DBI:mysql:database=foo
               username: bar
               password:
                   - $proxy
                   - MyApp::Config
                   - get_db_password
                   - bar

       When "apply_method_proxies" is called on the above data structure it will see the method proxy and will replace the array ref with the return value of calling the method.

       A method proxy, in Perl syntax, looks like this:

           ['$proxy', $package, $method, @args]

       The $proxy string can also be written as &proxy.  The above is then converted to a method call and replaced by the return value of the method call:

           $package->$method( @args );

       In the above database password example the method call would be this:

           MyApp::Config->get_db_password( 'bar' );

       You would still need to create a "MyApp::Config" package, and add a "get_db_password" method to it.

FUNCTIONS
       Only the "apply_method_proxies" function is exported by default.

   apply_method_proxies
           $config = apply_method_proxies( $config );

       Traverses the supplied data looking for method proxies, calling them, and replacing them with the return value of the method.  Any value may be passed, such as a hash ref, an array ref, a
       method proxy, an object, a scalar, etc.  Array and hash refs will be recursively searched for method proxies.

       If a circular reference is detected an error will be thrown.

   is_method_proxy
           if (is_method_proxy( $some_data )) { ... }

       Returns true if the supplied data is an array ref where the first value is the string $proxy or &proxy.

   call_method_proxy
           call_method_proxy( ['$proxy', $package, $method, @args] );

       Calls a method proxy and returns the value.
