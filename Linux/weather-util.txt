NAME
       weatherrc - configuration file format for the weather(1) utility

DESCRIPTION
       The  weatherrc  file  format  is intended to specify a set of aliases by which to group URIs for METAR station conditions and alert/forecast zones, but other command-line options and flags for the
       weather utility can be specified as well.  The file is organized as an INI-format config, with the alias name in [] brackets and the associated parameter/value pairs on following  lines.   Parame‐
       ters and their values are separated by = or : characters.  Multi-word values do not need quoting.  These parameters are supported...

       alert  include local alert notices (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       atypes list of alert notification types to display (ex: tornado,urgent_weather_message)

       cache  control all caching (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       cache_data
              control retrieved data caching (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       cache_search
              control search result caching (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       cacheage
              duration in seconds to refresh cached data (ex: 900)

       cachedir
              directory for storing cached searches and data (ex: ~/.weather)

       conditions
              output current conditions (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       defargs
              list of default command-line arguments (ex: avl,rdu)

       forecast
              include a local forecast (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       headers
              list of conditions headers to display (ex: temperature,wind)

       imperial
              filter/convert conditions for US/UK units (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       metric filter/convert conditions for metric units (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       quiet  skip preambles and don't indent (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

       setpath
              directory search path for correlation sets (ex: .:~/.weather)

       verbose
              show full decoded feeds (possible values are False and True or 0 and 1)

EXAMPLES
       The following is an example ~/.weather/weatherrc defining a couple aliases named home and work to be displayed when running the utility with no aliases specified...

[default]
defargs = home,work

[home]
description = Conditions and Forecast at Home
forecast = True
metar = http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/decoded/KRDU.TXT
zone_forecast = http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/zone/nc/ncz041.txt

[work]
description = Conditions at Work
metar = http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/decoded/KGSO.TXT

       Now if weather is invoked by itself on the command line, it will output conditions for home and work, and also a forecast for home only.
