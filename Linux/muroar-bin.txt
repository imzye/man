SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       muroarstream is a simple client for the RoarAudio sound system.  It is based on muRoar (libmuroar).  It can only be used to send data to or get data from the
       server.  No control functionality is supported.

       -R --rate     RATE
              Sets the sample rate.  This defaults to 44100Hz.

       -C --channels CHANS
              Sets the number of channels.  this defaults to 2 channels (stereo).  Symbolic names "mono" and "stereo" as well as "default" can be used.

       -E --codec    CODEC
              Sets the codec to use.  The default depends on used subsystem.  For Waveform it uses Signed native PCM, for Light DMX512 and for MIDI MIDI.  The  fol‐
              lowing symbolic names can be used: default, pcm, pcm_s, pcm_u, ogg_vorbis, vorbis, alaw, mulaw, ulaw, dmx512, roardmx, midi.

       --light
              Use Light Control subsystem.

AUTO DETECTION
       The  server will be auto located if no server name is given.  First it will look for the environment variable $ROAR_SERVER.  If this variable is non existing
       libmuroar will do the auto location based on a list of possible server locations.  This list contains the user's private  socket  address,  the  global  UNIX
       socket address, an entry for localhost using TCP/IP, the local default DECnet object address as well as an entry for the abstract UNIX namespace (+abstract).
