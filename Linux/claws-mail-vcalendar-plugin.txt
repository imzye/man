NAME
       claws-mail-vcalendar-plugin - handle vCalendar attachments

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-vcalendar-plugin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-vcalendar-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       Allows displaying vCalendar messages ("text/calendar" MIME type, also known as iCalendar) in a similar way other well-known mailers do. Note that only the meeting subset of the vCalendar format is
       currently supported.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...” dialog, click on the “Load plugin...” button and select the plugin file, named vcalendar.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

       Once loaded, a new mailbox named “vCalendar” will appear on the folder list window. In this folder a “Meetings” inbox is shown, which is where your meetings can be created. Contextual menu of this
       folder is also useful for changing view mode or adding webCal subscriptions.
