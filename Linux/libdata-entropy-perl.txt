NAME
       Data::Entropy::RawSource::CryptCounter - counter mode of block cipher as I/O handle

SYNOPSIS
               use Data::Entropy::RawSource::CryptCounter;

               my $rawsrc = Data::Entropy::RawSource::CryptCounter
                               ->new(Crypt::Rijndael->new($key));

               $c = $rawsrc->getc;
               # and the rest of the I/O handle interface

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides an I/O handle connected to a virtual file which contains the output of a block cipher in counter mode.  This makes a good source of pseudorandom bits.  The handle implements a
       substantial subset of the interfaces described in IO::Handle and IO::Seekable.

       For use as a general entropy source, it is recommended to wrap an object of this class using "Data::Entropy::Source", which provides methods to extract entropy in more convenient forms than mere
       octets.

       The amount of entropy the virtual file actually contains is only the amount that is in the key, which is at most the length of the key.  It superficially appears to be much more than this, if (and
       to the extent that) the block cipher is secure.  This technique is not suitable for all problems, and requires a careful choice of block cipher and keying method.  Applications requiring true
       entropy should generate it (see Data::Entropy::RawSource::Local) or download it (see Data::Entropy::RawSource::RandomnumbersInfo and Data::Entropy::RawSource::RandomOrg).

CONSTRUCTOR
       Data::Entropy::RawSource::CryptCounter->new(KEYED_CIPHER)
           KEYED_CIPHER  must  be  a  cipher  object  supporting  the  standard  "blocksize"  and  "encrypt" methods.  For example, an instance of "Crypt::Rijndael" (with the default "MODE_ECB") would be
           appropriate.  A handle object is created and returned which refers to a virtual file containing the output of the cipher's counter mode.

METHODS
       A subset of the interfaces described in IO::Handle and IO::Seekable are provided:

       $rawsrc->read(BUFFER, LENGTH[, OFFSET])
       $rawsrc->getc
       $rawsrc->ungetc(ORD)
       $rawsrc->eof
           Buffered reading from the source, as in IO::Handle.

       $rawsrc->sysread(BUFFER, LENGTH[, OFFSET])
           Unbuffered reading from the source, as in IO::Handle.

       $rawsrc->close
           Does nothing.

       $rawsrc->opened
           Retruns true to indicate that the source is available for I/O.

       $rawsrc->clearerr
       $rawsrc->error
           Error handling, as in IO::Handle.

       $rawsrc->getpos
       $rawsrc->setpos(POS)
       $rawsrc->tell
       $rawsrc->seek(POS, WHENCE)
           Move around within the buffered source, as in IO::Seekable.

       $rawsrc->sysseek(POS, WHENCE)
           Move around within the unbuffered source, as in IO::Seekable.

       The buffered ("read" et al) and unbuffered ("sysread" et al) sets of methods are interchangeable, because no such distinction is made by this class.

       "tell", "seek", and "sysseek" only work within the first 4 GiB of the virtual file.  The file is actually much larger than that: for Rijndael (AES), or any other cipher with a 128-bit  block,  the
       file is 2^52 YiB (2^132 B).  "getpos" and "setpos" work throughout the file.

       Methods to write to the file are unimplemented because the virtual file is fundamentally read-only.
