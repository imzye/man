NAME
       geg - a GTK+ Equation Grapher

SYNOPSIS
       geg [options]

DESCRIPTION
       geg is a small tool which will draw 2-dimensional mathematical functions within a nice user interface. You can use the mouse to zoom into the graph and solve function or axis intersections.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the graphical user interface, the command line can be used as a basic calculator or equation solver (see inline help for details).  The following options are available:

       --help, --version
              Show version of program.

       --display display
              Specify the X display to open, for example noether.math:0. See X(1) for further info.
