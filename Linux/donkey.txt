DONKEY(1)                                                                                                                                                                                         DONKEY(1)

NAME
       donkey - alternative for S/KEY's "key" command.

SYNOPSIS
       donkey [options] sequence seed
       donkey -i

       key [option] sequence seed
       key -i

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the donkey, and key commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  In‐
       stead, it has documentation in /usr/share/doc/donkey

       donkey is an alternative for S/KEY's "key" command. The new feature that the original key doesn't have is print an entry for skeykeys as follows;

       This means that donkey is also an alternative for "keyinit". Since the entry is printed to stdout (not to /etc/skeykeys), you can easily sent it to a remote operator by e-mail (with a  PGP  signa‐
       ture or something).  So it is possible to initiate S/KEY without loginging onto the console of the host.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -n     num specify the number of keys to be calculated.

       -f     func choose a hash function - one of MD4 or MD5

EXAMPLES
   (1) Calculate an One-Time-Password.
       Execute Donkey with a sequence number and a seed, then input your passphrase.

              % donkey 80 is12345
              Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
              SOFT O SAW SWAB CON RODE

       You can choose the hash function.

              % donkey 80 is12345
              Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
              SOFT O SAW SWAB CON RODE

              %donkey -f md5 80 is12345
              Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
              LACK WIN ROSE ANNA STUN REEK

       The default hash function is MD4 due to historical reasons.

   (2) Calculate several One-Time-Passwords at once.
       Use the -n option.

              % donkey -n 10 80 is12345
              Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
              71: WORE HELL CUB FAR DORA MALE
              72: SAIL DAN DONE BEER DAYS MOS
              73: PAN TONE THAT TOUT BURY EST
              74: KEN ROAM HEAT NAN MEAN HEN
              75: MINI MARS HASH BOTH SITU SING
              76: TOW SHIN FLUE ARID AHOY NE
              77: SLID LEEK NO TREE STOW BEY
              78: RUDY WINE GIFT FUSS AGEE SUE
              79: GELD THIN MAID THIN BUD TURF
              80: SOFT O SAW SWAB CON RODE

       Note that though "Enter passphrase" is printed out to the standard error stream, the One-Time-Passwords are written to the standard output stream, so you can redirect the output safely.

   (3) Print an skeykeys entry.
       Use the -i option without arguments. Then, enter the login name, the sequence number and the seed. Input your passphrase twice to get the entry.

              % donkey -i
              Enter login name [default kazu]:
              Enter sequence 1 to 999 [default 99]:
              Enter new seed [default ur18122]:
              Please choose passphrase between 8 and 256 characters.
              Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
              Re-enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

BUGS
       Things to do:

       Support other one time passwords such as OTP.

       Support other secure hash functions.
