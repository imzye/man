NAME
       "Tickit::Console::Tab" - represent a single tab on a "Tickit::Console"

DESCRIPTION
       Objects in this class represent a single switchable tab within a Tickit::Console. They are not constructed directly, but instead are returned by the "add_tab" method of the underlying
       "Tickit::Console" object.

PARAMETERS
       The following extra parameters may be passed to the constructor, or via the "add_tab" method on the "Tickit::Console" object:

       timestamp_format => STRING or String::Tagged
               If  defined,  every  line  is  prefixed  with  a timestamp built by applying the "POSIX::strftime" function to this string. If a String::Tagged instance is applied it will preserve all the
               formatting from it.

       datestamp_format => STRING or String::Tagged
               If defined, every time a line is added to the buffer, if it starts a new day since the previous message (because the format yields a different string), this message is added as well to the
               scroller.

       localtime => CODE
               If defined, provides an alternative function to "CORE::localtime" for converting an epoch value into a timestamp. For example, this may be set to

                  sub { gmtime $_[0] }

               to generate timestamps in UTC instead of using the local timezone.

METHODS
   name
   set_name
          $name = $tab->name;

          $tab->set_name( $name );

       Returns or sets the tab name text

   append_line
          $tab->append_line( $string, %opts );

       Appends a line of text to the tab. $string may either be a plain perl string, or an instance of String::Tagged containing formatting tags, as specified by Tickit::Widget::Scroller. Options will be
       passed to the Tickit::Widget::Scroller::Item::Line used to contain the string.

       Also recognises the following options:

       time => NUM
               Overrides the epoch "time()" value used to generate a timestamp for this line

       timestamp_format => STRING or String::Tagged
               Overrides the stored format for generating a timestamp string.

       datestamp_format => STRING or String::Tagged
               Overrides the stored format for generating a datestamp string.

   prepend_line
          $tab->prepend_line( $string, %opts );

       As "append_line", but prepends it at the beginning of the scroller.

   bind_key
          $tab->bind_key( $key, $code );

       Installs a callback to invoke if the given key is pressed while this tab has focus, overwriting any previous callback for the same key. The code block is invoked as

          $result = $code->( $tab, $key );

       If $code is missing or "undef", any existing callback is removed.

       This callback will be invoked before one defined on the console object itself, if present. If it returns a false value, then the one on the console will be invoked instead.
