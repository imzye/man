NAME
       icecream - download icecast and shoutcast streams, redirecting all fetched content to stdout and/or to disk at the same time

SYNOPSIS
       icecream [OPTIONS] URL [URL..]

DESCRIPTION
       icecream  is a lightweight, non-interactive, stream download utility.  It connects to icecast and shoutcast servers or direct stream URLs, and redirects all fetched content to stdout and/or to me‐
       dia files on your disk.

       Listen to the stream piping the output to a stdin-capable media player.  Save the stream to a named file or split it into different tracks.  It is possible to redirect the stream and  save  it  to
       disk at the same time.

       icecream is able to parse pls and m3u playlists, and to download mp3 and ogg direct stream URLs. If the stream is anonymous it will be saved as 'stream-time.mp3', where time is actual timestamp.

       --stop=N[units]
               Stop downloading the stream after N kb/mb/min/songs
