NAME
       tvtime-scanner - an all-band scanner for tvtime to help users of European cable providers that do not use standard frequencies

SYNOPSIS
       tvtime-scanner [ OPTION ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       tvtime-scanner allows a user to scan all frequencies for stations.  This is useful for European cable provides such as UPC or Casema which do not use standard frequency tables for their channels.  tv‐
       time-scanner checks for frequencies across the full band and writes it to your stationlist.xml file in a table called "Custom".  This can be selected by running "tvtime --frequencies=custom" or by se‐
       lecting the Custom frequency table within the OSD menu inside tvtime.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show usage information.

       -i, --input=INPUTNUM
              video4linux input number (defaults to 0).  Cards commonly have a bunch of sources, for example, on my WinTV card, source 0 is my tuner and source 1 is the composite input.  The scanner requires
              using an input that has a tuner.

       -n, --norm=NORM
              The mode to set the tuner to (defaults to NTSC).  Valid modes are:
