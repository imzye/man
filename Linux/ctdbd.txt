CTDBD(1)                 CTDB - clustered TDB database                CTDBD(1)

NAME
       ctdbd - The CTDB cluster daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ctdbd [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       ctdbd is the main CTDB daemon.

       Note that ctdbd is not usually invoked directly. It is invoked via
       ctdbd_wrapper(1) or via the initscript.

       See ctdb(7) for an overview of CTDB.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -i, --interactive
           Enable interactive mode. This will make ctdbd run in the foreground
           and not detach from the terminal. In this mode ctdbd will log to
           stderr.

           By default ctdbd will detach itself and run in the background as a
           daemon, logging to the configured destination.

       -?, --help
           Display a summary of options.
