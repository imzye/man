NAME
       RDF::RDFa::Parser::OpenDocumentObjectModel - DOM representation of an OpenDocument Format 1.2 file

DESCRIPTION
       You should hopefully not need to use this module to be able to use RDF::RDFa::Parser. It's used internally by the parser to deal with OpenDocument Format input.

       This class provides a "new" constructor and "parse_file", "parse_fh" and "parse_string" methods offering rought compatibility with the parsing interface described in XML::LibXML::Parser.

       It represents an OpenDocument Format 1.2 file (internally a ZIP file containing various XML, RDF/XML and other files) into a single XML::LibXML::Document with a root element "od:Document". The
       root element has several child elements with tag names "od:Data" and "od:Meta" which each contain a single child corresponding to the root element of (respectively) an XML or RDF/XML file found
       inside the ZIP. ("od:Data" and "od:Meta" elements each have a "file" attribute indicating which file.) This representation is necessarily different to the "Flat XML" format offered by OpenOffice -
       trust me.

       The "od" namespace URI is <http://purl.org/NET/cpan-uri/dist/RDF-RDFa-Parser/opendocument-dom-wrapper>.
