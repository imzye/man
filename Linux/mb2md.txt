NAME
       mb2md — Converts Mbox mailboxes to Maildir format.

SYNOPSIS
       mb2md [-h]

       mb2md [-c]  [-m]  [-d destdir]

       mb2md [-c]  [-s sourcefile]  [-d destdir]

       mb2md [-c]  [-s sourcedir]  [-l wu-mailboxlist]  [-R|-f somefolder]  [-d destdir]  [-r strip_extension]

DESCRIPTION
       mb2md     Converts Mbox mailboxes to Maildir format.

OPTIONS
       -h        Show summary of options.

       -c        Use  the Content-Length: headers (if present) to find the beginning of the next message.  Use with caution! Results may be unreliable. I recommend to do a run without "-c" first and only
                 use it if you are certain, that the mbox in question really needs the "-c" option.

       -m        If this is used then the source will be the single mailbox at /var/spool/mail/blah for user blah and the destination mailbox will be the "destdir" mailbox itself.

       -s sourcedir
                 Directory, relative to the user's home directory, which is where the the "somefolders" directories are located.  Or if directory starts with a "/" or "." it is taken as a absolute  path,
                 e.g. /mnt/oldmail/user _OR_ A single mbox file which will be converted to the destdir.

       -R        If defined, do not skip directories found in a mailbox directory, but runs recursively into each of them, creating all wanted folders in Maildir.

                 Incompatible with '-f'

       -f somefolder
                 Directories,  relative  to "sourcedir" where the Mbox files are. All mailboxes in the "sourcedir" directory will be converted and placed in the "destdir" directory.  (Typically the Inbox
                 directory which in this instance is also functioning as a folder for other mailboxes.)

                 The "somefolder" directory name will be encoded into the new mailboxes' names.  See the example in the USAGE file (see below).

                 This does not save an UW IMAP dummy message file at the start of the Mbox file.  Small changes in the code could adapt it for looking for other distinctive  patterns  of  dummy  messages
                 too.

                 Don't let the source directory you give as "somefolders" contain any "."s in its name, unless you want to create subfolders from the IMAP user's point of view. See the example in the US‐
                 AGE file (see below).

                 Incompatible with '-R'

       -d destdir
                 Directory where the Maildir format directories will be created.  If not given, then the destination will be ~/Maildir .  Typically, this is what the IMAP server sees as the Inbox and the
                 folder for all user mailboxes.  If this begins with a '/' the path is considered to be absolute, otherwise it is relative to the users home directory.

       -r strip_extension
                 If  defined this extension will be stripped from the original mailbox file name before creating the corresponding maildir. The extension must be given without the leading dot (".").  See
                 the example in the USAGE file (see below).

       -l UW-file
                 File containing the list of subscribed folders.  If migrating from UW-IMAP the list of subscribed folders will be found in the file called .mailboxlist in the users home directory.  This
                 will convert all subscribed folders for a single user:

                 /bin/mb2md -s mail -l .mailboxlist -R -d Maildir

                 and for all users in a directory as root you can do the following:

                 for i in *; do echo $i;su - $i -c "/bin/mb2md -s mail -l .mailboxlist -R -d Maildir";done

USAGE
       Please read the USAGE documentation (zless /usr/share/doc/mb2md/USAGE.gz).
