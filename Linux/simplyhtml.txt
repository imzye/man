NAME
       simplyhtml — A Java editor based on HTML and CSS.

SYNOPSIS
       simplyhtml [no_options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the simplyhtml command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has online documentation (see Help menu in SimplyHTML).

   Project Description
       With project SimplyHTML an application is built for working with text documents. Text documents are stored in HTML and CSS format, but the application is meant as a word processor rather than
       a code editor or web site builder.

   Open to the maximum
       SimplyHTML is built with the aim to document as much of its functionality and usage as possible. The application is written in Java and distributed with full source codes.

       By using Java, HTML, CSS and PDF all parts of the project are 100% platform independent and can be used on almost any machine.

   Extensive documentation
       Source codes are commented in Javadoc format and additional inline comments. The sources are created with good legibility and structure in mind.

       In  addition,  an  extensive tutorial is delivered covering both usage of the application and its internals. The tutorial is available in JavaHelp format and can be used as online help out of
       SimplyHTML. Or it can be read with a plain web browser. A PDF version of the tutorial is available too.

   Why another HTML editor?
       SimplyHTML is not an HTML editor in first place. It is a text processing application being based on HTML and CSS files.

       Although it has a simple HTML editor built in as well, the application focuses on text processing rather than web page creation.

       SimplyHTML tries to distinguish from comparable applications by combining simplicity, ease of use and transparency for both users and developers.

OPTIONS
       This program does not have any option. Just start it!

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DEBUG     If  this environment variable is set, SimplyHTML gives more information on how it finds its different elements, as well as some other information.

       JAVACMD   Default value for the java virtual machine (the java command).

       JAVA_BINDIR
                 If $JAVACMD is not set, the java virtual machine is searched under $JAVA_BINDIR/java.

       JAVA_HOME If $JAVACMD and $JAVA_BINDIR are not set, the java virtual machine is searched under $JAVA_HOME/bin/java.

       PATH      If all $JAVA... environment variables fail, the java virtual machine command (java) is searched in the $PATH (with which).

       CLASSPATH        ADD_JARS
                 The $CLASSPATH variable also lets one specify additional jars, which is good, if you want to add a new Look&Feel jar (the motif one is so ugly...).  Alternatively,  the  content  of
                 $ADD_JARS will be prepended to $CLASSPATH.

FILES
       /usr/bin/java
                 If all searches through environment variables fail, the java virtual machine is expected to be /usr/bin/java; if not, simplyhtml exits with an error.
