NAME
       gtkguitune - KGuitune

SYNOPSIS
       gtkguitune

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the gtkguitune program.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program
       does not have a manual page.

       Guitune is a linux program for tuning guitars and other instruments by using the method of Schmitt-triggering, i.e. counting the number  of  triggerings  be‐
       tween two trigger levels in a certain amount of time.

       With  FFT  you  need many samples to archieve the accuracy needed for tuning instruments. You often get times of around 1 second between two measurements and
       the computer is quite busy in this second calculating the FFT. Using Schmitt-triggering you get a measurement every 10th of a second or even less  (depending
       on the sample frequency you use). Most of the time the computer only waits for the samples.

       The  Trigger  levels are adjustable. For a pure sine-wave the trigger levels could be zero. But for a wave wth overtones like the one in the figure above you
       need a non-zero triggerlevel. It is preadjusted to a level of 60% of the current maximum which should be able to deal with most instruments.
