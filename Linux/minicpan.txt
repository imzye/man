DESCRIPTION
       This simple shell script just updates (or creates) a miniature CPAN mirror as described in CPAN::Mini.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       By default, "minicpan" will read a configuration file to get configuration information.  The file is a simple set of names and values, as in the following example:

        local:  /home/rjbs/mirrors/minicpan/
        remote: http://your.favorite.cpan/cpan/
        exact_mirror: 1

       "minicpan" tries to find a configuration file through the following process.  It takes the first defined it finds:

       •   Use the value specified by "-C" on the command line

       •   Use the value in the "CPAN_MINI_CONFIG" environment variable

       •   Use ~/.minicpanrc

       •   Use CPAN/Mini/minicpan.conf

       If the selected file does not exist, "minicpan" does not keep looking.

       You can override this process with a "config_file" method in your subclass.

       See "CPAN::Mini" for a full listing of available options.

TO DO
       Improve command-line options.
