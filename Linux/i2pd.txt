NAME
       i2pd - Full-featured C++ implementation of I2P client.

SYNOPSIS
       i2pd [OPTION1] [OPTION2]...

DESCRIPTION
       i2pd  is  a C++ implementation of the router for the I2P anonymizing network, offering a simple layer that identity-sensitive applications can use to securely communicate. All data is wrapped with
       several layers of encryption, and the network is both distributed and dynamic, with no trusted parties.

       Any of the configuration options below can be used in the DAEMON_ARGS variable in /etc/default/i2pd.

OPTIONS
       --help Show available options.

       --conf=
              Config file (default: ~/.i2pd/i2pd.conf or /var/lib/i2pd/i2pd.conf) This parameter will be silently ignored if the specified config file does not exist.  Options specified  on  the  command
              line take precedence over those in the config file.

       --tunconf=
              Tunnels config file (default: ~/.i2pd/tunnels.conf or /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.conf)

       --pidfile=
              Where to write pidfile (don't write by default)

       --log= Logs destination: stdout, file, syslog (stdout if not set, file - otherwise, for compatibility)

       --logfile=
              Path to logfile (default - autodetect)

       --loglevel=
              Log messages above this level (debug, info, warn, error, none)

       --logclftime
              Log messages with full CLF-formatted date and time (disabled by default)

       --datadir=
              Path to storage of i2pd data (RI, keys, peer profiles, ...)

       --tunnelsdir=
              Path to tunnels configuration files (default: ~/.i2pd/tunnels.d or /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.d)

       --host=
              The external IP address

       --port=
              The port to listen on for incoming connections

       --ifname=
              The network interface to bind to

       --ifname4=
              The network interface to bind to for IPv4 connections

       --ifname6=
              The network interface to bind to for IPv6 connections

       --ipv4=
              Enable communication through ipv4 (enabled by default)

       --ipv6 Enable communication through ipv6 (disabled by default)

       --ntcp=
              Enable usage of NTCP transport (enabled by default)

       --ntcpproxy=
              Set proxy URL for NTCP transport

       --ssu= Enable usage of SSU transport (enabled by default)

       --notransit
              Router will not accept transit tunnels at startup (disabled by default)

       --floodfill
              Router will be floodfill (disabled by default)

       --bandwidth=
              Bandwidth limit: integer in KBps or letter aliases: L (32KBps), O (256), P (2048), X (>9000)

       --share=
              Limit of transit traffic from max bandwidth in percents. (default: 100)

       --daemon
              Router will go to background after start (disabled by default)

       --service
              Router will use system folders like /var/lib/i2pd (disabled by default)

       --family=
              Name of a family, router belongs to.

       Switches, which enabled by default (like --ssu, --ntcp, etc.), can be disabled in config file.
       See service-specific parameters in example config file /usr/share/doc/i2pd/i2pd.conf.gz

FILES
       /etc/i2pd/i2pd.conf, /etc/i2pd/tunnels.conf, /etc/default/i2pd
           i2pd configuration files (when running as a system service)
