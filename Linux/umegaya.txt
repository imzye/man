NAME
       umegaya-ddc-ping - Umegaya’s debian-devel-changes pinger

SYNOPSIS
       umegaya-ddc-ping < email.txt

DESCRIPTION
       Piped emails from http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes to this program trigger a ping for the corresponding package in an Umegaya instance.

       If emailaddress is subscribed to debian-devel-changes, the following entry in /etc/aliases will forward emails to umegaya-ddc-ping.

       emailaddress: |umegaya-ddc-ping

       The name of the package to ping is searched in the third field of the first line starting with Subject.  In case of failure, the script returns with an exit code of 1, unless the messages op‐
       tion is used.

OPTIONS
       umegaya-ddc-ping takes no option from the command line, but reads the following from /etc/umegaya/umegaya.conf.

   ping_url
       URL of an Umegaya instance.  http://localhost/umegaya by default.

   messages
       Log pings and failures to determine package name to syslog, and do not exit with error in case of failure.  Off by default.

SEE ALSO
