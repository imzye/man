DESCRIPTION
       From Shamus Young (http://code.google.com/p/pixelcity/): A screensaver for Windows which generates and performs a fly-through of a nighttime cityscape.

           * There are no art assets. All content is generated at runtime.
           * Aimed at older graphics hardware. The goal is for the program to perform acceptably on machines "five years old or less".
           * Written in C++ using OpenGL. No fragment or vertex shaders are used.

       Ported to Linux by Tugrul Galatali.
