NAME
       cpmcp - copy files from and to CP/M disks

SYNOPSIS
       cpmcp [-f format] [-p] [-t] image [-u] user:file file
       cpmcp [-f format] [-p] [-t] image [-u] user:file ... directory
       cpmcp [-f format] [-p] [-t] image [-u] file user:file
       cpmcp [-f format] [-p] [-t] image [-u] file ... user:

DESCRIPTION
       cpmcp  copies  one  or more files to or from a CP/M disk.  When copying
       multiple files, the last argument must be a drive  or  directory.   The
       drive letter does not matter because the device is specified by the im‐
       age, it is only used to specify which direction you want to copy.   The
       user  number  is specified after the drive letter, if omitted user 0 is
       used.

       You can use * and ? in CP/M file names, which have the same meaning  in
       sh(1) file name patterns.

OPTIONS
       -f format
              Use the given CP/M disk format instead of the default format.

       -T libdsk-type
              libdsk driver type, e.g. tele for Teledisk images or raw for raw
              images (requires building cpmtools with support for libdsk).

       -p     Preserve time stamps when copying files from CP/M to  UNIX  (not
              implemented for copying the other way so far).

       -t     Convert text files between CP/M and UNIX conventions.

       -u     Show all CP/M file names in upper case.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, exit code 0 is returned.

ERRORS
       Any errors are indicated by exit code 1.
