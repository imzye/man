NAME
       smuxi-message-buffer — converts and dumps Smuxi chat history

SYNOPSIS
       smuxi-message-buffer [-dh] convert [--source-format=format] [--destination-format=format] source-file(s)... destination-file
       smuxi-message-buffer [-dh] cat [--format=format] source-file(s)...

DESCRIPTION
       smuxi-message-buffer is a tool that manages the databases that Smuxi holds chat histories in. Currently, it can convert and dump databases.

       Similar  to  commands  like git(1) , smuxi-message-buffer takes a command as the first parameter. These commands can be cat (dumps a JSON representation of the database to standard output) or con‐
       vert. (changes the database from one format to another) Note that the destination file can be set to "-" or empty in the case of convert, in which case it will export to stdout.

       The following options can be used. Some options will depend on what command you're using.

       -d, --debug
               Turn on debugging. Debug logs are outputted on the console.

       -h, --help
               Show the arguments Smuxi takes.

       --source-format=format

       --format=format
               Manually specify a source format. Options include auto (figured out via filename), db4o, and sqlite.

       --destination-format=format
               Manually specify a source destination, if converting. Options include auto (figured out via filename), db4o, and sqlite.
