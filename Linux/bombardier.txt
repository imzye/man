DESCRIPTION

       This  was  one  of  my favourite games on Commodore Plus 4 when I was I child.  Your task is to bomb down cities. This can be done with a 3 character wide airplane, which can drop 3 character tall
       bombs to the ugly # based houses.  If you can bomb down all of the houses you can land with your plane, and in this case the challenge will continue on the next city.  Good luck!
