NAME
       bcrelay - a broadcast relay daemon

SYNOPSIS
       bcrelay [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       bcrelay simply plays as a broadcast repeater. When bcrelay receives packets from the incoming interface, it will then relay them to the outgoing interface.

OPTIONS
       -d,--daemon
              Run bcrelay as a daemon.

       -p,--pidfile pid-file
              specifies an alternate location to store the process ID file (default /var/run/bcrelay.pid).

       -h,--help
              Show help message.

       -i,--incoming interface-in
              Defines from which interface broadcasts will be read.

       -s,--outgoing interface-out
              Defines to which interface broadcasts will be relayed.

       -n,--nolog
              Disable any logging and tracing to /var/log/messages except fatal error messages.

       -s,--ipsec argument
              Defines  an ipsec tunnel to be relayed to. Since ipsec tunnels terminate on the same interface, we need to define the broadcast address of the other end-point of the tunnel. This is done as
              ipsec0:x.x.x.255.

       -v,--version
              Show the version of bcrelay.

       Log messages and debugging information go to syslog as daemon.

       Interfaces can be specified as regexpressions, ie. ppp[0-9]+.
