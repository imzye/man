SEE ALSO
       The full documentation for NCO is maintained as a Texinfo manual called the NCO Users Guide.  Because NCO is mathematical in nature, the documentation includes TeX-intensive portions not  viewable  on
       character-based  displays.   Hence  the  only  complete  and  authoritative  versions  of  the  NCO  Users Guide are the PDF (recommended), DVI, and Postscript versions at <http://nco.sf.net/nco.pdf>,
       <http://nco.sf.net/nco.dvi>, and <http://nco.sf.net/nco.ps>, respectively.  HTML and XML versions are available at <http://nco.sf.net/nco.html> and <http://nco.sf.net/nco.xml>, respectively.

       If the info and NCO programs are properly installed at your site, the command

              info nco

       should give you access to the complete manual, except for the TeX-intensive portions.
