NAME
       ifplugd.conf - ifplugd configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/default/ifplugd

DESCRIPTION
       ifplugd.conf is the configuration file for ifplugd. It is a shell script that is sourced by the init script starting the daemon. It shall be used to set environment variables which are inter‐
       preted by the init script:

OPTIONS
       INTERFACES
              Specifies  the ethernet interfaces to monitor. It has to contain a space seperated list of network interfaces names. Most users will probably use "eth0" here, however you may add addi‐
              tional interfaces for monitoring more than one device. A special value is supported as well: "auto" will enable a more or less working auto detection of available network devices. This
              won't make you happy when using network module auto loading, since it cannot detect currently unloaded network devices.

       HOTPLUG_INTERFACES
              Specifies the interfaces that can be hotplugged (like interfaces on PCMCIA, USB or WLAN adapters).  "all" can be used to make the udev script start an  ifplugd  process  for  any  hot‐
              plugged interfaces (except those already listed in INTERFACES).

       ARGS   Additional command line arguments for ifplugd invocation. See ifplugd(8) for further information.

       ARGS_iface
              If specified for an interface this variable takes precedence over ARGS. This may be useful if more than one network device is present.
