NAME
       cppo - lightweight cpp-like preprocessor for OCaml

SYNOPSIS
       cppo [Options...] files...

DESCRIPTION
       cppo  is  the equivalent of the C preprocessor for OCaml. It permits the definition and expansion of simple (in comparison with camlp4) macros and file inclusion.  cppo supports functional macros,
       conditionals, boolean and arithmetic expressions, stringification, and calling different, external preprocessors. For a precise description of the features, see /usr/share/doc/cppo/README.gz.

OPTIONS
       -D IDENT
              define IDENT

       -U IDENT
              undefine IDENT

       -I DIR add DIR to the search path for included files

       -o FILE
              write output to FILE

       -q     Identify and preserve camlp4 quotations

       -s     Output line directives pointing to the exact source location of each token, including those coming from the body of macro definitions. This behavior is off by default.

       -n     Do not output any line directive other than those found in the input (overrides -s).

       -version
              print version and exit

       -x NAME:CMD_TEMPLATE
              Define a custom preprocessor target section starting with:

                     #ext "NAME"

              and ending with:

                     #endext

              NAME must be a lowercase identifier of the form [a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*

              CMD_TEMPLATE is a command template supporting the following special sequences:

                     %F  file name (unescaped; beware of potential scripting attacks)

                     %B  number of the first line

                     %E  number of the last line

                     %%  a single percent sign

              The filename, the first line number and the last line number are available to the external preprocessor via the environment variables CPPO_FILE, CPPO_FIRST_LINE, CPPO_LAST_LINE.

              The command is expected to read from stdin and to write to stdout.

       -help | --help
              Display options and exit
