NAME
       kbdd - simple per-window keyboard layout switching daemon

SYNOPSIS
       kbdd [ -n | --nodaemon ]
       kbdd [ -h | --help ] [ -v | --version ]

DESCRIPTION
       kbdd is a simple keyboard layout daemon that switches and restores layouts on a per-window basis.

       -n, --nodaemon
              run in nodaemon (foreground) mode

       -h, --help
              print a short usage summary

       -v, --version
              print the program version

DBUS INTERFACE
       Kbdd  registers  a dbus interface in order to notify a window manager about layout change and listens on this interface for incoming requests.  This interface can be used in WM widgets to indicate
       the current layout.

       The dbus interface has the following methods:

       getLayoutName( uint32 )
              returns a string representing the layout group name

       set_layout( uint32 )
              sets current group

       getCurrentLayout
              returns current layout group id

       next_layout
              switches to the next keyboard layout

       prev_layout
              switches to the previous keyboard layout

       The following events (signals) are available:

       layoutChanged
              returns new group number

       layoutNameChanged
              returns name for the new group

       You can change the layout with the following dbus-send command:
       dbus-send --dest=ru.gentoo.KbddService /ru/gentoo/KbddService ru.gentoo.kbdd.set_layout uint32:1

BUGS
       Some users reported problems with sticking meta-keys (Alt or Meta4), however, at the moment there is not enough information collected to conclude if this is caused by kbdd or not.

       Newly found bugs may be reported on the project page at github.
