NAME
       subp2pgm - convert VobSub DVD subtitles into pgm files and xml description

SYNOPSIS
       subp2pgm [-hvf] [-o output] [-s sid] vobsub

DESCRIPTION
       subp2pgm converts DVD subtitles from the VobSub format into an intermediate form suitable for OCR extraction.

       subp2pgm takes two files as input, which should be named <vobsub>.idx and <vobsub>.sub, where vobsub is the basename of the files.

       subp2pgm  outputs  one  .pgm  graphics file for each subtitle image, and a .xml description file with correct timing annotation, where each subtitle entry is replaced by the corresponding graphics
       file.

       After OCR conversion, such a file can be transformed into a proper srt file by subptools(1).  The options are as follows:

       -h, --help
              Display usage and quit.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase verbosity level.

       -f, --forced
              Extract forced subtitles only.

       -n, --normalize
              Normalize the palette.

       -o, --output output
              Basename for all pgm output files and the xml description.

       -s, --sid sid
              Selects subtitle id from a vobsub file with several subtitle streams.  Defaults to 0.
