DESCRIPTION
       FLAM3 implements a visual language based on a recursive set equation.

       Flam3-genome creates and manipulates genomes (xml parameter sets) in this language.
       Flam3-render turns genomes into still images, and
       Flam3-animate renders motion-blurred frames of animation.

       Flam3-convert reads from stdin files in the old format used by the flame GIMP plugin, and writes the new format to stdout.
