NAME

NOTE
       This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       This driver has been tested with :

       ·   Solis 1000 VA

       ·   Solis 1500 VA

       ·   Solis 2000 VA

       ·   Solis 3000 VA

       In 2009, Schneider Electric acquired Microsol Technologies, and by
       2012, the entire Microsol line of equipment was being sold under the
       APC brand.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
       This driver support the following extra optional settings in the
       ups.conf(5).

       battext = n - (default = 0, no extra battery, where n = Ampere*hour )

       prgshut = 1 - (default = 0, no programable shutdown )

COMMANDS
       ·   shutdown.return - Shut down in .3 minutes and restart in .3 minutes

       ·   shutdown.stayoff - Shut down in .3 minutes and do not return

ISSUES
       The APC version of the Microsol protocol is slightly incompatible with
       the solis driver. As of version 0.62 of the solis driver, the driver
       will connect to the UPS, but some values are read incorrectly.
