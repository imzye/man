NAME
       procmeter3-log - A system monitoring / logging program.

SYNOPSIS
       procmeter3-log [-h|--help] [--rc=<filename>] [--...]  [...]

DESCRIPTION
       ProcMeter Displays one or more pieces of information about the operating system and other resources.  Most of the information that is displayed comes from the /proc filesystem.  The program is modular
       and very configurable.

OPTIONS
       The command line options are described below.

       -h     Provides a help message listing the available outputs.  This will be different for different computers depending on the Linux kernel version that is being used and the hardware/software that is
              configured.

       --rc=<filename>
              Load the specified .procmeterrc file in stead of the searching in the usual places.

       --...  A  list of configuration file options that will override the values in the .procmeterrc file.  The format of these options is (for example) --library.path=/usr/local/procmeter3 which is equiva‐
              lent to the entry in the .procmeterrc file of

               [library]
               path = /usr/local/procmeter3

              All spaces around the equal sign must be removed and if spaces are required in the value on the right hand side then quotes must be used around the entire command line option.

       ...    A list of names of outputs that are to be displayed.  This can include any of the outputs that are available (see the -h option).  For the CPU usage is in a module named Statistics with an out‐
              put named CPU and there are graph (-g), text (-t) and bar (-b) options.  Since this version of the program does not display anything, but logs the data to a file it does not matter which one is
              chosen.  To store the CPU usage data you would use the command line option Statistics.CPU-t

USAGE
       When started the program will log all of the requested information on the standard output (stdout).  The outputs that are displayed are those from the command line and those from the .procmeterrc con‐
       figuration file.

MODULES
       The modules that are available for procmeter3-log are described in the procmeter3_modules(1) manual page.
