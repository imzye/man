NAME
       pwsafe - commandline password database utility compatible with Counterpane's Passwordsafe

SYNOPSIS
       pwsafe [options] command [arg]

DESCRIPTION
       pwsafe manipulates Counterpane Passwordsafe username/password databases.

       It is compatible with Counterpane Passwordsafe 1.9.x and 2.0 databases.

COMMANDS
       pwsafe accepts the following commands:

       --createdb
              Create a new database.

       --exportdb
              Export database as text.

       --mergedb=DATABASE_FILE
              Merge DATABASE_FILE into database. Common entries are merged interactively.

       --passwd
              Change the database's passphrase.

       --list[=REGEX]
              List all [matching] entries in database.   If -u or -p is given then REGEX must match only one entry, and only the requested field(s) are emitted.

       -a, --add[=NAME]
              Add an entry to database.

       -e, --edit=REGEX
              Edit an entry.

       --delete=NAME
              Delete an entry from database.

       If no command is given, an interactive mode is entered.

OPTIONS
       pwsafe accepts the following options:

       -f, --file=DATABASE_FILE
              Specify the database to manipulate. Default is $HOME/.pwsafe.dat

       --dbversion=[1|2]
              Specify the database's version. Default is 2.

       -I, --case
              REGEX is case-sensative. Any uppercase character in REGEX implies --case.

       -l     Show login and notes in list output.

       -u, --username
              Show username of listed account(s).

       -p, --password
              Show password of listed accounts(s).

       -E, --echo
              Force echo'ing of entry to stdout. This is selected by default if $DISPLAY is not set.

       -o, --output=FILE
              Redirect username and password output to FILE. Implies --echo.

       -x, --xclip
              Force copying of username and password to X clipboard. This is selected by default if $DISPLAY is set.

       -d, --display=XDISPLAY
              Override $DISPLAY. Implies --xclip.

       -s, --selection={Primary,Secondary,Clipboard,Both}
              Select the X selection effected. Default is Both primary and clipboard. Implies --xclip.

       -G, --ignore=NAME@HOST
              Add NAME to windows or hosts that do not receive the selection. If just NAME is given it matches any host, and if just @HOST is given it matches any name.

       -v, --verbose
              Print more information.

       -q, --quiet
              Print less information. In fact, print only exactly what was requested.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Show version of program.

ENVIRONMENT
       PWSAFE_DATABASE
              Default database file. If this is a relative path it is assumed to be relative to $HOME. Defaults to ".pwsafe.dat". Overridden by -f.

       PWSAFE_DEFAULT_USER
              Default user. Defaults to $USER or $LOGNAME.

       PWSAFE_IGNORE
              Overrides built-in --ignore list. --ignore overrides. Format is a list of --ignore arguments, seperated by colons (':').

       HOME   Used to locate the default database "~/.pwsafe.dat" and default RANDFILE "~/.rnd".

       RANDFILE
              Used to locate the random number generator entropy pool file. Defaults to "$HOME/.rnd".

FILES
       ~/.pwsafe.dat
              The password database.

       ~/.pwsafe.dat~
              Backup of database.

       ~/.rnd Random number generator's entropy pool.

WARNINGS
       Use a good password for your database.

       Don't use pwsafe over telnet or from untrusted terminals.

       To seed RANDFILE decently, do something like
          md5sum /var/log/* >~/.rnd

EXAMPLES
       For those who can't read the rest of this file:

       Create $HOME/.pwsafe.dat.

              pwsafe --createdb

       Add an entry named 'test'.

              pwsafe -a test

       Copy username and password of 'test' to console or X clipboard & primary selection.

              pwsafe -up test

       Upgrade a version passwordsafe version 1.7 database to version 2.0 (we do this by merging it with itself, but specifying version 2 output)

              pwsafe --mergedb $HOME/.pwsafe.dat --dbversion 2
