NAME
       unigenwidth - Generate C code for POSIX wcwidth and wcswidth functions

SYNOPSIS
       unigenwidth unifont.hex combining.txt > wccode.c

DESCRIPTION
       unigenwidth  reads  a  collection  of glyphs in Unifont's .hex format, then reads a list of combining characters as a hexadecimal list.  From these two files, it produces C code to implement the POSIX
       wcwidth(3) and wcswidth(3) functions.  The format of these definitions is based upon POSIX 1003.1-2008 System Interfaces, pages 2251 and 2241, respectively.

EXAMPLE
       Sample usage:

              unigenwidth unifont.hex combining.txt > wccode.c

FILES
       *.hex files for Unifont glyph data; combining.txt for combining code points.
