NAME
       tvtk_doc - A GUI based TVTK documentation search browser.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tvtk_doc command.

       tvtk_doc provides a list of all the available TVTK classes along with the option to search for the documentation.

       The nice thing about the UI is that it performs some kind of completion on names typed by the user, plus it allows users to search through the TVTK class docs very easily.  Once a search string is
       typed the completion and available lists are modified so you can do completion of the searched class names.  If a unique enough string is typed the class docs are shown.
