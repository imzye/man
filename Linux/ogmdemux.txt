NAME
       ogmdemux - Extract streams from OGG/OGM files into separate files

SYNOPSIS
       ogmdemux [options] inname

DESCRIPTION
       This program extracts all or only some streams from an OGM and writes them to separate files.

       inname Use 'inname' as the source.

       -o, --output out
              Use 'out' as the base for destination file names.  '-v1', '-v2', '-a1', '-t1'... will be appended to this name. Default: use 'inname'.

       -a, --astream n
              Extract specified audio stream. Can be used more than once. Default: extract all streams.

       -d, --vstream n
              Extract specified video stream. Can be used more than once. Default: extract all streams.

       -t, --tstream n
              Extract specified text stream. Can be used more than once. Default: extract all streams.

       -na, --noaudio
              Don't extract any audio streams.

       -nv, --novideo
              Don't extract any video streams.

       -nt, --notext
              Don't extract any text streams.  Default: extract all streams.

       -r, --raw
              Extract the raw streams only.  Default: extract to useful formats (AVI, WAV, OGG, SRT...).

       -v, --verbose
              Increase verbosity.

       -h, --help
              Show this help.

       -V, --version
              Show version number.

NOTES
       What works:

       *      Extraction of the following formats is fully supported including writing the stream contents to useful container formats:
                video  -> AVI
                Vorbis -> OGG/Vorbis
                PCM    -> WAV
                text   -> text files (SRT subtitle format)

       *      All other audio streams (MP3, AC3) are just copied 1:1 into output files. MP3 and AC3 files should be usable. Others might not.

       What not works:

       *      Headers created by older OggDS (DirectShow) filter versions are not supported (and probably never will be).
