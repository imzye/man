NAME
       ppmtoarbtxt - generate image in arbitrary text format from PPM image

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoarbtxt bodytmpl [-hd headtmpl] [-tl tailtmpl] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtoarbtxt  generates simple text-based graphics formats based on for‐
       mat descriptions given as input.  A text-based graphics format  is  one
       in  which  an  image is represented by text (like PNM plain format, but
       unlike PNM raw format).

       ppmtoarbtxt reads a PPM image as input.  For each pixel in  the  image,
       ppmtoarbtxt  writes  the  contents  of the template file bodytmpl, with
       certain substitutions based on the value of the pixel, to Standard Out‐
       put.

       You  may  also  supply  a head template file, in which case ppmtoarbtxt
       generates text from the template file, based on the  image  dimensions,
       and includes it in the output before anything else.

       Likewise,  you  may  supply  a  tail  template file to cause text to be
       placed at the end of the output.

   Template Files
       The text that ppmtoarbtxt generates from a template file is the literal
       text  of the template file, except with substitution specifier replaced
       with something else.  The program recognizes a  substitution  specifier
       as text of the form #(...).

       ppmtoarbtxt  treats  white  space in the template files the same as any
       other characters, placing it in the output, with one exception: If  the
       template  file ends with a newline character, ppmtoarbtxt ignores it --
       it does not include it in the output.

       Many substitution specifiers use format strings (another form  of  tem‐
       plate)  to  specify  the  substitution.   You  should make these format
       strings as minimal as possible, placing literal text outside  the  sub‐
       stitution specifier instead of inside the format string.  For example,

       Wrong: #(flum %%%2.2f 0 1)

       Right: %#(flum %2.2f 0 1)

       The  valid  substitution  specifiers are as follows.  Text that has the
       form of a substitution  specifier  but  is  not  actually  valid  (e.g.
       #(random  junk)  usually just specifies its literal value, but if it is
       close enough to something valid, ppmtoarbtxt assumes you made a mistake
       and fails.

       Useful  in  a  body template, to do substitutions based on a particular
       pixel:

       #(ired format blackref whiteref)
              generates an integer in the range blackref to whiteref in a for‐
              mat  specified  by  format representing the red intensity of the
              pixel.  A red intensity of 0 becomes blackref; a  red  intensity
              of  maxval becomes whiteref, with the rest linearly interpolated
              in between.

              format is a printf-like format specifier like "%d".  ppmtoarbtxt
              uses as the entire format string to a fprintf POSIX library call
              whose only other argument is the red itensity as an integer data
              type.   ppmtoarbtxt does not necessarily verify that your format
              string makes sense; there are  values  you  could  specify  that
              could  even  crash  the  program.  To avoid unexpected behavior,
              keep format strings simple and hardcoded, and  never  include  a
              per cent sign or newline.

              #(ired) is equivalent to #(ired %d 0 255).

       #(igreen format blackref whiteref)
              Same as #(ired..., but for green.

       #(iblue format blackref whiteref)
              Same as #(ired..., but for blue.

       #(ilum format blackref whiteref)
              Same   as   #(ired...,  but  representing  the  luminance  value
              (0.299*red + 0.587*green + 0.114*blue) of the pixel.

       #(fred format blackref whiteref)
              Same as #(ired..., but generates a floating point number instead
              of an integer.

              In  this case, the second argument to the fprintf that uses for‐
              mat has a double precision floating point data type.

              #(fred) is equivalent to #(fred %f 0.0 1.0).

       #(fgreen format blackref whiteref)
              Same as #(fred..., but for green.

       #(fblue format blackref whiteref)
              Same as #(fred..., but for blue.

       #(flum format blackref whiteref)
              Same  as  #(fred...,  but  representing  the   luminance   value
              (0.299*red + 0.587*green + 0.114*blue) of the pixel.

       #(posx format)
              Generates  the  horizontal position of the pixel, in pixels from
              the left edge of the image.

              The second argument to the  fprintf  that  uses  format  has  an
              unsigned integer data type.

              format defaults to %u

       #(posy format)
              Same as #(width..., but for the vertical position.

       If  you  use any of the above substitution specifiers in a head or tail
       template, the result is undefined.

       Useful in a head or tail template, to do substitutions based on  whole-
       image attributes:

       #(width format)
              Generates the width in pixels of the image.

              The  second  argument  to  the  fprintf  that uses format has an
              unsigned integer data type.

              format defaults to %u

       #(height format)
              Same as #(width..., but for the height of the image.

OPTIONS
       -hd headtmpl
              This option specifies a head template (headtmpl is the  name  of
              the head template file); it causes ppmtoarbtxt to place the con‐
              tents of the file named headtmpl at the beginning of the output

       -tl tailtmpl
              This option specifies a tail template; it is analogous to -hd.

EXAMPLES
   gray inversion
       Here we generate a PGM plain-format image  with  gray  inversion  (like
       ppmtopgm | pnminvert).

       Contents of our head template file:

       P2
       #(width) #(height)
       255

       Contents of our body skeleton file:

       #(ilum %d 255 0)

   povray file
       Here  we  generate  a  povray file where each pixel is represented by a
       sphere at location (x,y,z) = (posx,height-posy,luminance).   The  color
       of the sphere is the color of the pixel.

       Contents of our head skeleton:

       #include "colors.inc"
       #include "textures.inc"
       camera {
          location  <#(width) * 0.6, #(height) * 0.7, 80>
          look_at   <#(width) * 0.5, #(height) * 0.5, 0>
       }

       light_source { <#(width) * 0.5, #(height) * 0.5, 25> color White
       }

       Contents of our body skeleton:

       sphere { <#(posx),#(height)-#(posy),#(ilum %d 0 10)>, 0.5
         texture {
           pigment {
             color rgb <#(fred),#(fgreen),#(fblue)>
           }
           finish {
             phong 1
           }
         }
       }
