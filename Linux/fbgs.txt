NAME
       fbgs  - Poor man's PostScript/pdf viewer for the linux framebuffer con‐
       sole.

SYNOPSIS
       fbgs  [-l|-xl|-xxl|-r  n]   [-c]   [-b]   [-p password]   [--fp number]
       [--lp number] [fbi options] file

DESCRIPTION
       Fbgs is a simple wrapper script which takes a PostScript (PS) or Porta‐
       ble Document Format (PDF) file as input, renders the pages using  gs(1)
       -  GhostScript - into a temporary directory and finally calls fbi(1) to
       display them.

OPTIONS
       Fbgs understands all fbi(1) options (they are passed through),  except:
       store, list, text, (no)comments, e, (no)edit, (no)backup, (no)preserve,
       (no)readahead, cachemem, blend.

       Additionally you can specify:

       -h, --help
              Print usage info (overwrites fbi option).

       -b, --bell
              Emit a beep when the document is ready.

       -c, --color
              To render the pages in color (default is N&B).

       -l     To get the pages rendered with 100 dpi (default is 75).

       -xl    To get the pages rendered with 120 dpi.

       -xxl   To get the pages rendered with 150 dpi.

       -r n, --resolution n
              To get the pages rendered with n dpi (overwrites fbi option).

       -fp number, --firstpage number
              Begins interpreting on the designated page of the document.

       -lp number, --lastpage number
              Stops interpreting after the designated page of the document.

       -p password, --password password
