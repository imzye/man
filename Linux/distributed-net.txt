DESCRIPTION
       dnetc  is  a  distributed  computing client that coordinates with servers operated by distributed.net to cooperate with other network-connected computers to work on a common task.  It communicates
       over public networks and processes work assigned by the distributed.net keyservers. It is designed to run in idle time so as to not impact the normal operation of the computer.

INSTALLATION
       Since you are already reading this, I assume you know how to unpack an archive into a directory of your choice. :)

       Now, simply fire up the client...

       If you have never run the client before, it will initiate the menu-driven configuration. Save and quit when done, the configuration file will be saved in the same directory  as  the  client.  Now,
       simply restart the client. From that point on it will use the saved configuration.

       The configuration options are fairly self-explanatory and can be run at any time by starting the client with the '-config' option. A list of command line options is listed below.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the conventional command line passed to the client from a shell, options may also be passed to the client using either or both of the following methods:
       -    using the dnetc_opt= environment variable.
            If set, this is parsed before the normal command line.
       -    using the //etc/distributed-net.conf
            command files. If found, these are parsed after the normal
            command line.
       "Mode  commands"  (see  below)  cannot  be executed using these methods, and there is no run-time display of modified settings (unless the settings are also modified using the conventional command
       line, in which case the last effective change is displayed).

   Mode commands: (the client will execute the option and then exit)
       -config     start the configuration menu
