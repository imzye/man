NAME
       pipewire-pulse - The PipeWire PulseAudio replacement

SYNOPSIS
       pipewire-pulse [options]

DESCRIPTION
       pipewire-pulse starts a PulseAudio-compatible daemon that integrates with the PipeWire media server, by running a pipewire process through a systemd service. This daemon is a drop-in replacement
       for the PulseAudio daemon.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
           Show help.

       -v | --verbose
           Increase the verbosity by one level. This option may be specified multiple times.

       --version
           Show version information.

       -c | --config=FILE
           Load the given config file (Default: pipewire-pulse.conf).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The generic pipewire(1) environment variables are supported.

       In addition:

       PULSE_RUNTIME_PATH

       XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
           Directory where to create the native protocol pulseaudio socket.

       PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC
           Extra buffering latency in milliseconds. This controls buffering logic in libpulse and may be set for PulseAudio client applications to adjust their buffering. (Setting it on the pipewire-
           pulse server has no effect.)
