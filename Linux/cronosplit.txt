NAME
       cronosplit - split log files into cronolog-compatible files

SYNOPSIS
       cronosplit  --template=TEMPLATE  [--print-invalid] [--help] [--version]
       file ...

DESCRIPTION
       cronosplit is a simple program that reads lines from a set of input log
       files,  which  must  be in Common Log Format and write each lines to an
       output files, the name of which is constructed using the template spec‐
       ified and timestamp from the the line.  The template uses the same for‐
       mat specifiers as the Unix date(1) command (which are the same  as  the
       standard C strftime library function).

Options
       accepts the following options and arguments:

       --template=TEMPLATE
              specifies  the template for the output log files (using the for‐
              mat specifiers described below).

       --verbose
              print additional status messages to the standard error stream.

       --debug
              print debug messages to the standard error stream.

       --help print a help message and then exit.

       --version
              print version information and exit.

Template format
       Each character in the template represents a character in  the  expanded
       filename,  except  for  date  and time format specifiers, which are re‐
       placed by their expansion.  Format specifiers consist of a `%' followed
       by one of the following characters:

       %      a literal % character

       n      a new-line character

       t      a horizontal tab character

       Time fields:

       H      hour (00..23)

       I      hour (01..12)

       p      the locale's AM or PM indicator

       M      minute (00..59)

       S      second (00..61, which allows for leap seconds)

       X      the locale's time representation (e.g.: "15:12:47")

       Z      time  zone (e.g. GMT), or nothing if the time zone cannot be de‐
              termined

       Date fields:

       a      the locale's abbreviated weekday name (e.g.: Sun..Sat)

       A      the locale's full weekday name (e.g.: Sunday .. Saturday)

       b      the locale's abbreviated month name (e.g.: Jan .. Dec)

       B      the locale's full month name, (e.g.: January .. December)

       c      the locale's date and time  (e.g.:  "Sun  Dec  15  14:12:47  GMT
              1996")

       d      day of month (01 .. 31)

       j      day of year (001 .. 366)

       m      month (01 .. 12)

       U      week of the year with Sunday as first day of week (00..53, where
              week 1 is the week containing the first Sunday of the year)

       W      week of the year with Monday as first day of week (00..53, where
              week 1 is the week containing the first Monday of the year)

       w      day of week (0 .. 6, where 0 corresponds to Sunday)

       x      locale's date representation (e.g. today in Britain: "12/04/96")

       y      year without the century (00 .. 99)

       Y      year with the century (1970 .. 2038)

       Other  specifiers  may be available depending on the C library's imple‐
       mentation of the strftime function.
