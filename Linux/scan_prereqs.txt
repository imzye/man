NAME
       Perl::PrereqScanner::App - scan your working dir for likely prereqs

VERSION
       version 1.024

SYNOPSIS
           scan_prereqs [--combine] [DIRS|FILES]

       Directories are traversed with File::Find to collect all ".pl", ".pm", ".psgi" and ".t" files. If no directories or files are specified, the current working directory is scanned.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that
       patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
