NAME
       showttf - decompose a font file into its various tables and display it

SYNOPSIS
       showttf [--verbose] [--headers] [--checkhead] fontfile

DESCRIPTION
       showttf  is a program which will decompose a truetype (or opentype) font file into its various tables and display the contents of those tables as best it can.  It will also point out the errors it
       finds in the file. This is similar to MicroSoft's ttfdump (except the showttf shows some of Apple's tables which ttfdump does not), and to Apple's ftxdumperfuser (except  the  showttf  shows  some
       OpenType tables which Apple's ignores). And, of course, showttf is open source and runs on most any system.

OPTIONS
       --verbose -v    Print additional information.

       --headers -h    Print headers only

       --checkhead -c  Check Head
