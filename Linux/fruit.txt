NAME
       fruit - Fruit is a UCI-only chess engine.

SYNOPSIS
       fruit

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the fruit program.

       Fruit is an UCI-only chess engine. This distribution comes up with an opening book.

       Fruit and other UCI engines can be used with XBoard or WinBoard (or other xboard-compatible interfaces) with the help of PolyGlot (UCI-to-xboard adapter). Another well known frontend is scid,
       which has a UCI capable interface.

OPTIONS
       These  program does NOT follow the usual GNU command line syntax, but can be fed with options with a personal config file which can be read by the polyglot helper software. The author himself
       says "You are advised to skip this section unless you are completely crazy about computer chess." For a complete description of these UCI commands, see the readme files.
