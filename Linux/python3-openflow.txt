       python-openflow is a low level library to parse and create OpenFlow messages.  If you want to read an OpenFlow packet from an open socket or send a message to an OpenFlow switch, this is your best
       friend. The main features are: high performance, short learning curve and free software license.

       This library is part of Kytos project, but feel free to use this simple and intuitive library in other projects.

       ATTENTION:
          python-openflow does not perform I/O operations. To communicate with a switch, you must write your own controller using this library or use our Kytos SDN Platform.

       A quick start follows for you to check whether this project fits your needs.  For a more detailed documentation, please check the python-openflow API Reference Manual.

QUICK START
   Installing
       We use python3.6. So in order to use this software please install python3.6 into your environment beforehand.

       We are doing a huge effort to make Kytos and its components available on all common distros. So, we recommend you to download it from your distro repository.

       But if you are trying to test, develop or just want a more recent version of our software no problem: Download now, the latest release (it still a beta software), from our repository:

       First you need to clone python-openflow repository:

          $ git clone https://github.com/kytos/python-openflow.git

       After cloning, the installation process is done by standard setuptools install procedure:

          $ cd python-openflow
          $ sudo python3.6 setup.py install

       Alternatively, if you are a developer and want to install in develop mode:

          $ cd python-openflow
          $ pip3.6 install -r requirements/dev.txt

   Basic Usage Example
       See how it is easy to create a feature request message with this library.  You can use ipython3 to get the advantages of autocompletion:

          >>> from pyof.v0x01.controller2switch.features_request import FeaturesRequest
          >>> request = FeaturesRequest()
          >>> print(request.header.message_type)
          Type.OFPT_FEATURES_REQUEST

       If you need to send this message via socket, call the pack() method to get its binary representation to be sent through the network:

          >>> binary_msg = request.pack()
          >>> print(binary_msg)
          b"\x01\x05\x00\x08\x14\xad'\x8d"
          >>> # Use a controller (e.g. Kytos SDN controller) to send "binary_msg"

       To parse a message, use unpack_message():

          >>> from pyof.v0x01.common.utils import unpack_message
          >>> binary_msg = b"\x01\x05\x00\x08\x14\xad'\x8d"
          >>> msg = unpack_message(binary_msg)
          >>> print(msg.header.message_type)
          Type.OFPT_FEATURES_REQUEST

       Please, note that this library do not send or receive messages via socket. You have to create your own server to receive messages from switches. This library only helps you to handle OpenFlow mes‐
       sages in a more pythonic way.

       Here  you  will  find  examples on how to use python-openflow for both unpack raw binary openflow messages and create new openflow messages and pack them as binary data to be sent throughtout your
       network.

PACKING EXAMPLES
TODO
       Write a full list of examples, with simples messages and also more complex ones

UNPACKING EXAMPLES
TODO
       Write unpacking examples, showing how the library behaves on simple and complex messages.
