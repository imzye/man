NAME
       geotranz - GEOgraphic coordinates TRANslator

SYNOPSIS
       geotranz

DESCRIPTION
       GEOTRANZ  (Geographic  Translator) is an application program which allows you to easily convert geographic coordinates among a wide variety of coordinate systems, map projections, and datums.
       Currently, twenty-five different coordinate systems, map projections, grids, and coding schemes, and over two hundred different datums, are supported.

       The user interface of GEOTRANZ is similar to that of a calculator, but can also be used to efficiently convert large numbers of coordinates contained in text files.
