NAME
       wmfsm — shows the amount of disk space available

SYNOPSIS
       wmfsm [--normal, -n  ]  [--fire, -f ]  [--blink, -b ]  [--noblink ]  [-display ]  [-d, --delay ]  [-h, --help ]

DESCRIPTION
       wmfsm is a WindowMaker dock application that shows the amount of disk space available on mounted file systems with colored bars.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
                 Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
                 Show version of program.

       -n, --normal
                 Show the entire bars in the same color.

       -f, --fire
                 Render the bars as gradients.  You may switch between the normal and fire modes by mouse clicks anywhere on wmfsm.

       -b, --blink
                 Blink the bars if the filesystem is 95% full.

       --noblink
                 Do not blink if the filesystem is 95% full.

       -display
                 Draw on the specified display.

       -d, --delay
                 Wait the specified number of milliseconds to redraw the window.

       -a, --appearance
                 Select an appearance file.  Note that these files may be found in the wmfsm data directory, likely /usr/local/share/wmfsm or /usr/share/wmfsm.

FILES
       You  may  exclude filesystems from being show by wmfsm by listing them in the ~/.wmfsmrc file.  It should have as its first line either [include] or [exclude].  The next lines are filesystems that
       are either explicitly included or excluded respectively.

       Note: the format of the  ~/.wmfsmrc file is very strict. Make sure there are no whitespaces at the beginning or at the end of lines.  No comments (#) are allowed. Here is an example:

       [exclude]
       /proc
       /dev/pts
       /floppy
       /cdrom
