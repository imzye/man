NAME
       lmms - software for easy music production

SYNOPSIS
       lmms [global options...] [action [action parameters...]]

DESCRIPTION
       LMMS is a free cross-platform alternative to commercial programs like FL Studio®, which allow you to produce music with your computer. This includes the creation of melodies and beats, the synthe‐
       sis and mixing of sounds, and arranging of samples. You can have fun with your MIDI-keyboard and much more; all in a user-friendly and modern interface.

       LMMS features components such as a Song Editor, a Beat+Bassline Editor, a Piano Roll, an FX Mixer as well as many powerful instruments and effects.

              Dump XML of compressed (MMPZ) file in.

       render project [options...]
              Render given project file.

       rendertracks project [options...]
              Render each track to a different file.

       upgrade in [out]
              Upgrade file in and save as out. Standard out is used if no output file is specified.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
           --allowroot
              Bypass root user startup check (use with caution).

       -c, --config configfile
              Get the configuration from configfile instead of ~/.lmmsrc.xml (default).

       -h, --help
              Show usage information and exit.

       -v, --version
              Show version information and exit.

OPTIONS IF NO ACTION IS GIVEN
           --geometry geometry
              Specify the preferred size and position of the main window.
              geometry syntax is xsizexysize+xoffset+yoffset.
              Default: full screen.

           --import in -e
              Import MIDI or Hydrogen file in.

OPTIONS FOR RENDER AND RENDERTRACKS
       -a, --float
              Use 32bit float bit depth.

       -b, --bitrate bitrate
              Specify output bitrate in KBit/s (for OGG encoding only), default is 160.

       -f, --format format
              Specify format of render-output where format is either 'wav', 'ogg' or 'mp3'.

       -i, --interpolation method
              Specify interpolation method - possible values are linear, sincfastest (default), sincmedium, sincbest.

              If -e is specified lmms exits after importing the file.

       -l, --loop
              Render the given file as a loop, i.e. stop rendering at exactly the end of the song. Additional silence or reverb tails at the end of the song are not rendered.

       -m, --mode stereomode
              Set the stereo mode used for the MP3 export. stereomode can be either 's' (stereo mode), 'j' (joint stereo) or 'm' (mono). If no mode is given 'j' is used as the default.

              For --render, this is interpreted as a file path.
              For --render-tracks, this is interpreted as a path to an existing directory.

       -p, --profile out
              Dump profiling information to file out.

       -s, --samplerate samplerate
              Specify output samplerate in Hz - range is 44100 (default) to 192000.

       -x, --oversampling value
              Specify oversampling, possible values: 1, 2 (default), 4, 8.
