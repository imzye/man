NAME
       pfsinexr - Load images or frames in OpenEXR format

SYNOPSIS
       pfsinexr [--keep-rgb] (<file> [--frames <range>] [--skip-missing])  [<file>...]

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this  command to read frames in OpenEXR format. The frames are converted to pfs stream and send to the standard output. This command can read arbitrary channels from OpenEXR files; color channels
       XYZ are however specially handled (see option keep-rgb).

       pfsinexr reads also all string attributes from OpenEXR file and write them as tags in pfs stream. Attributes of other types are ignored. If attribute name contains a colon (:), the part  before  colon
       is treated as a channel name and the attribute is assigned to that channel (similar notation as command line argument of pfstag program).

       pfsinexr  recognizes OpenEXR standard attribute WhiteLuminance and multiplies the data by that value to get absolute luminance values (see also --fix-halfmax switch in pfsoutexr). Additionally the tag
       LUMINANCE is set to ABSOLUTE unless OpenEXR files contains attribute LUMINANCE set to semething else. That is the channel Y is assumued to represent absolute luminance levels in cd/m^2.

       If an OpenEXR file contains 'Z' channel, it is renamed to 'DEPTH' to avoid conflict with the Z color channel for the XYZ color space.

       Details on the format of the pattern file names, which are used for reading multiple frames, can be found in the manual page of pfsinppm.

       To automatically recognize a file format from the extension, use pfsin command instead.

       --keep-rgb
              By default, color channels R, G and B from an OpenEXR file are converted to XYZ color space, which is suggested format for color data in pfs. When keep-rgb option is specified,  color  channels
              RGB are stored as they are without any conversion.

EXAMPLES
        pfsin memorial.exr | pfsout memorial.hdr

              Converts from one HDR format to another

BUGS
       pfsinexr and pfsoutexr can not take stdin / stdout as an input/output (dash '-' instead of file name).
