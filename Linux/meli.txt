INTRODUCTION
       To quit meli press ⟨q⟩  (shortcuts.general.quit) at any time.  When launched for the first time, meli will search for its configuration directory, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/.  If it doesn't exist, you
       will  be asked if you want to create one and presented with a sample configuration file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/config.toml) that includes the basic settings required for setting up accounts allow‐
       ing you to copy and edit right away.  See meli.conf(5) for the available configuration options.

       At any time, you may press ⟨?⟩  (shortcuts.general.toggle_help) for a searchable list of all available actions and shortcuts, along with every possible setting and command that your  version  sup‐
       ports.

       Each  time  a  shortcut is mentioned in this document, you will find a parenthesis next to it with the name of the shortcut setting along with its section in the configuration settings so that you
       can modify it if you wish.

       For example, to set the toggle_help shortcut mentioned in the previous paragraph, add the following to your configuration:

                                                        [shortcuts]
                                                        general.toggle_help = 'F1'

       Or alternatively:

                                                        [shortcuts.general]
                                                        toggle_help = 'F1'

       To go to the next tab on the right, press ⟨T⟩ (shortcuts.general.next_tab).

INTERACTING WITH meli
       You will be interacting with meli in four primary ways:
       1. keyboard shortcuts in NORMAL mode.
       2. commands with arguments in COMMAND mode.
       3. regular text input in text input widgets in INSERT mode.
       4. any kind of input that gets passed directly into an embedded terminal in EMBED mode.

MODES
       meli is a modal application, just like vi(1).  This means that pressing the same keys in different modes would yield different results.  This allows you to separate how the  input  is  interpreted
       without the need to focus your input with a mouse.

       NORMAL    This is the default mode of meli.  All keyboard shortcuts work in this mode.

       COMMAND   Commands are issued in COMMAND mode, by default started with ⟨:⟩  (shortcuts.general.enter_command_mode) and exited with ⟨Esc⟩ key.

       EMBED     This is the mode of the embed terminal emulator.  To exit an embedded application, issue ⟨Ctrl-C⟩ to kill it or ⟨Ctrl-Z⟩ to stop the program and follow the instructions on meli to exit.

       INSERT    This mode is entered when pressing ⟨Enter⟩ on a cursor selected text input field, and it captures all input as text input.  It is exited with the ⟨Esc⟩ key.

ACTIVE SHORTCUTS POPUP
       By pressing ⟨?⟩  (shortcuts.general.toggle_help) at any time, the shortcuts popup display status gets toggled.  You can find all valid shortcuts for the current UI state you are in.

       While focused in the sidebar, you can “collapse” a mailbox tree, if it has children, and you can open it with ⟨Space⟩ (shortcuts.listing.toggle_mailbox_collapse).  You can have mailbox trees  col‐

       You can increase the sidebar's width with ⟨Ctrl-p⟩  (shortcuts.listing.increase_sidebar) and decrease with ⟨Ctrl-o⟩ (shortcuts.listing.decrease_sidebar).

       Some  commands  may  accept  a number modifier.  For example, scroll down commands can receive a multiplier n to scroll down n entries.  Another use of the number buffer is opening URLs inside the
       pager.  See “PAGER” for an explanation of interacting with URLs in e-mails.

       Pressing numbers in NORMAL mode will populate this buffer.  To erase it, press the ⟨Esc⟩ key.

MAIL LIST
       There are four different list styles:
       -   "plain" which shows one line per e-mail.
       -   "threaded" which shows a threaded view with drawn tree structure.
       -   "compact" which shows one line per thread which can include multiple e-mails.
       -   "conversations" which shows more than one line per thread which can include multiple e-mails with more details about the thread.

       Plain view.

       Performing actions on entries and/or selections.

       Press ⟨V⟩  (shortcuts.listing.select_entry) to toggle the selection of a single entry.  ⟨v⟩  (shortcuts.listing.select_motion) can be prefixed by a number modifier and affixed by a  scrolling  mo‐
       tion (up or down) to select multiple entries.  Simple set operations can be performed on a selection with these shortcut modifiers:

       -   Union modifier: ⟨Ctrl-u⟩  (shortcuts.listing.union_modifier)
       -   Difference modifier: ⟨Ctrl-d⟩  (shortcuts.listing.diff_modifier)
       -   Intersection modifier: ⟨Ctrl-i⟩  (shortcuts.listing.intersection_modifier)

       To set an entry as "read" , use the ⟨n⟩  (shortcuts.listing.set_seen) shortcut.  To set an entry as "unread" , use the command

        set unseen

       which also has its complement

        set seen

       action.

       For e-mail backends that support flags you can use the following commands on entries and selections to modify them:

        flag set FLAG

        flag unset FLAG

       For e-mail backends that support tags (like "IMAP" or "notmuch") you can use the following commands on entries and selections to modify them:

        tag add TAG

        tag remove TAG

       (see meli.conf(5) TAGS, settings colors and ignore_tags for how to set tag colors and tag visibility) You can clear the selection with the ⟨Esc⟩ key.

PAGER
       You can open an e-mail entry by pressing ⟨Enter⟩ (shortcuts.listing.open_entry). This brings up the e-mail view with the e-mail content inside a pager.

          The pager displaying an e-mail.

       The pager is simple to use.  Scroll with the following:

       Go to next pager page        ⟨PageDown⟩  (shortcuts.pager.page_down)

       Go to previous pager page    ⟨PageUp⟩  (shortcuts.pager.page_up)

       Scroll down pager.           ⟨j⟩  (shortcuts.pager.scroll_down)

       Scroll up pager.             ⟨k⟩  (shortcuts.pager.scroll_up)

       All scrolling shortcuts can be prefixed with a number modifier which will act as a multiplier.

       The  pager  can  enter a special url mode which will prefix all detected hyperlinks and e-mail addresses with a number inside square brackets ⟨u⟩ (shortcuts.pager.toggle_url_mode).  Writing down a
       chosen number as a number modifier and pressing ⟨g⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.go_to_url) will attempt to open the link with the system's default open command (xdg-open(1) in  supported  OSes,  and
       open(1) on MacOS).  To override with a custom launcher, see "pager" configuration setting "url_launcher" (see meli.conf(5) PAGER for more details).

MAIL VIEW
       Other things you can do when viewing e-mail:
       -   Most importantly, you can exit the mail view with: ⟨i⟩  (shortcuts.listing.exit_entry)
       -   Add addresses from the e-mail headers to contacts: ⟨c⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.add_addresses_to_contacts)
       -   Open an attachment by entering its index as a number modifier and pressing: ⟨a⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.open_attachment)
       -   Open an attachment by its mailcap(4) entry by entering its index as a number modifier and pressing: ⟨m⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.open_mailcap)
       -   Reply to envelope: ⟨R⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.reply)
       -   Reply to author: ⟨Ctrl-r⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.reply_to_author)
       -   Reply to all/Reply to list/Follow up: ⟨Ctrl-g⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.reply_to_all)
       -   Forward e-mail: ⟨Ctrl-f⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.forward)
       -   Expand extra headers: (References and others) ⟨h⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.toggle_expand_headers)
       -   View envelope source in a pager: (toggles between raw and decoded source) ⟨M-r⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.view_raw_source)
       -   Return to envelope_view if viewing raw source or attachment: ⟨r⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.return_to_normal_view)

COMPOSING
       To compose an e-mail, you can either start with an empty draft by pressing ⟨m⟩  (shortcuts.listing.new_mail) which opens a composer view in a new tab.  To reply to a specific e-mail, when in enve‐
       lope view you can select the specific action you want to take:

       -   Reply to envelope.  ⟨R⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.reply)
       -   Reply to author.  ⟨Ctrl-r⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.reply_to_author)
       -   Reply to all.  ⟨Ctrl-g⟩  (shortcuts.envelope_view.reply_to_all)

       To launch your editor, press ⟨e⟩ (shortcuts.composing.edit).  To send your draft, press ⟨s⟩ (shortcuts.composing.send_mail).  To save the draft without submission, enter the command

        close

       and select "save as draft".  You can return to the draft by going to your "Drafts" mailbox and selecting ⟨e⟩ (shortcuts.envelope_view.edit).
