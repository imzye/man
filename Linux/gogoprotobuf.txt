NAME
       protoc-gen-gogo - Go compiler output filter for the protocol buffer compiler

SYNOPSIS
       protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-gogo=/usr/bin/protoc-gen-gogo --go_out=gocode input.proto

       protoc --go_out=gocode input.proto

DESCRIPTION
       protoc-gen-gogo is a filter for the protoc(1) protocol buffer compiler.  It takes the protocol buffer format from protoc(1) as input and produces Go code as output which can then be used to encode
       (marshal) and decode (unmarshal) data in the protocol buffer format specified in its input. The input is typically produced by protoc(1) by taking a .proto input file and converting it to a proto‐
       col buffer descriptor format which protoc-gen-gogo can then read.  If protoc-gen-gogo can be found in the regular search path, the --plugin flag can be omitted.

OPTIONS
       protoc-gen-gogo itself doesn't like options.  All input is taken from stdin.  If you use the protobuf compiler to invoke protoc-gen-gogo, see protoc(1) for a detailed list of all options.

SEE ALSO
       protoc(1).

       protoc-gen-gogo was mostly written by Rob Pike and David Symonds for The Go Authors.
