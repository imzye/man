LIVE-BOOT(7)                                                                                Debian Live Project                                                                                LIVE-BOOT(7)

NAME
       live-boot - System Boot Components

DESCRIPTION
       live-boot contains the components that configure a live system during the boot process (early userspace).

       live-boot  is  a hook for the initramfs-tools, used to generate a initramfs capable to boot live systems, such as those created by live-helper(7). This includes the Live systems ISOs, netboot tar‐
       balls, and usb stick images.

       At boot time it will look for a (read-only) medium containing a "/live" directory where a root filesystems (often a compressed filesystem image like squashfs) is stored. If found, it will create a
       writable environment, using aufs, to boot the system from.

CONFIGURATION
       live-boot can be configured through a boot parameter or a configuration file.

       To configure the live-boot parameters used by default in a live image, see the --bootappend-live option in the lb_config(1) manual page.

   Kernel Parameters
       live-boot is only activated if 'boot=live' was used as a kernel parameter.

       In addition, there are some more boot parameters to influence the behaviour, see below.

   Configuration Files
       live-boot can be configured (but not activated) through configuration files. Those files can be placed either in the root filesystem itself (/etc/live/boot.conf, /etc/live/boot/*), or on the  live
       media (live/boot.conf, live/boot/*).  These environment variables can only be set in the configuration files:

       DISABLE_CDROM=[true|false]
              Disable support for booting from CD-ROMs.  If set to 'true' mkinitramfs will build an initramfs without the kernel modules for reading CD-ROMs.

       DISABLE_DM_VERITY=[true|false]
              Disable  support for dm-verity. If set to true true' mkinitramfs will build an initramfs without the kernel module dm-verity and some other dm modules. Also the default mount binary is used
              instead of the util-linux one.

       DISABLE_FAT=[true|false]
              Disable support for booting from FAT file systems.  If set to 'true' mkinitramfs will build an initramfs without the kernel module vfat and some nls_* modules.

       DISABLE_EXFAT=[true|false]
              Disable support for booting from exFAT file systems.  If set to 'true' mkinitramfs will build an initramfs without the kernel module exfat.

       DISABLE_FUSE=[true|false]
              Disable support for booting from FUSE-based file systems.  If set to 'true' mkinitramfs will build an initramfs without the kernel module fuse and file  systems  that  depend  on  it  (like
              curlftpfs and httpfs2).

       DISABLE_NTFS=[true|false]
              Disable support for booting from NTFS file systems.  If set to 'true' mkinitramfs will build an initramfs without the kernel module ntfs.

       DISABLE_USB=[true|false]
              Disable support for booting from USB devices.  If set to 'true' mkinitramfs will build an initramfs without the kernel module sd_mod.

       MINIMAL=[true|false]
              Build a minimal initramfs.  If set to 'true' mkinitramfs will build an initramfs without some udev scripts and without rsync.

       PERSISTENCE_FSCK=[true|false]
              Run fsck on persistence filesystem on boot. Will attempt to repair errors. The execution log will be saved in /var/log/live/fsck.log.

       FSCKFIX=[true|false]
              If PERSISTENCE_FSCK or forcefsck are set, will pass -y to fsck to stop it from asking questions interactively and assume yes to all queries.

OPTIONS
       live-boot currently features the following parameters.

       access=ACCESS
           Set  the  accessibility  level for physically or visually impaired users. ACCESS must be one of v1, v2, v3, m1, or m2. v1=lesser visual impairment, v2=moderate visual impairment, v3=blindness,
           m1=minor motor difficulties, m2=moderate motor difficulties.

       console=TTY,SPEED
           Set the default console to be used with the "live-getty" option. Example: "console=ttyS0,115200"

       debug
           Makes initramfs boot process more verbose.
           Use: debug=1
           Without setting debug to a value the messages may not be shown.

       fetch=URL

       httpfs=URL
           Another form of netboot by downloading a squashfs image from a given URL.  The fetch method copies the image to RAM and the httpfs method uses FUSE and httpfs2 to mount  the  image  in  place.
           Copying  to  RAM requires more memory and might take a long time for large images. However, it is more likely to work correctly because it does not require networking afterwards and the system
           operates faster once booted because it does not require to contact the server anymore.
           Due to current limitations in busybox's wget and DNS resolution, an URL can not contain a hostname but an IP address only.
           Not working: http://example.com/path/to/your_filesystem.squashfs
           Working: http://1.2.3.4/path/to/your_filesystem.squashfs
           Also note that therefore it's currently not possible to fetch an image from a name-based virtualhost of an httpd if it is sharing the IP address with the main httpd instance.
           You may also use the live ISO image in place of the squashfs image.

       iscsi=server-ip[,server-port];target-name
           Boot from an iSCSI target that has an ISO or disk live image as one of its LUNs. The specified target is searched for a LUN which looks like a live medium. If you use the iscsitarget  software
           iSCSI target solution your ietd.conf might look like this:
           # The target-name you specify in the iscsi= parameter
           Target <target-name>
             Lun 0 Path=<path-to-your-live-image.iso>,Type=fileio,IOMode=ro
             # If you want to boot multiple machines you might want to look at tuning some parameters like
             # Wthreads or MaxConnections

       findiso=/PATH/TO/IMAGE
           Look for the specified ISO file on all disks where it usually looks for the .squashfs file (so you don't have to know the device name as in fromiso=....).

       forcefsck
           Run fsck on persistence filesystem on boot. Will attempt to repair errors. The execution log will be saved in /var/log/live/fsck.log.

       fromiso=/PATH/TO/IMAGE
           Use a filesystem from within an ISO image that's available on live-media. The first part of the argument should be the block device where the image is stored, followed by the path and filename
           (e.g. fromiso=/dev/sda1/live/image.iso).
           Alternatively, it can be used to boot from an ISO embedded into an initrd (e.g. fromiso=/live/image.iso).

       ignore_uuid
           Do not check that any UUID embedded in the initramfs matches the discovered medium. live-boot may be told to generate a UUID by setting LIVE_GENERATE_UUID=1 when building the initramfs.

       verify-checksums
           If specified, an MD5 sum is calculated on the live media during boot and compared to the value found in md5sum.txt found in the root directory of the live media.

       ip=[DEVICE]:[CLIENT_IP]:[NETMASK]:[GATEWAY_IP]:[NAMESERVER] [,[DEVICE]:[CLIENT_IP]:[NETMASK]:[GATEWAY_IP]:[NAMESERVER]]
           Let  you  specify  the name(s) and the options of the interface(s) that should be configured at boot time. Do not specify this if you want to use dhcp (default). It will be changed in a future
           release to mimic official kernel boot param specification (e.g. ip=10.0.0.1::10.0.0.254:255.255.255.0::eth0,:::::eth1:dhcp).

       ip=[frommedia]
           If this variable is set, dhcp and static configuration are just skipped and the system will use the (must be) media-preconfigured /etc/network/interfaces instead.

       {live-media|bootfrom}=DEVICE
           If you specify one of this two equivalent forms, live-boot will first try to find this device for the "/live" directory where the read-only root filesystem should reside. If it  did  not  find
           something usable, the normal scan for block devices is performed.
           Instead  of specifying an actual device name, the keyword 'removable' can be used to limit the search of acceptable live media to removable type only. Note that if you want to further restrict
           the media to usb mass storage only, you can use the 'removable-usb' keyword.

       live-media-offset=BYTES
           This way you could tell live-boot that your image starts at offset BYTES in the above specified or autodiscovered device, this could be useful to hide the live system ISO or image  inside  an‐
           other ISO or image, to create "clean" images.

       live-media-path=PATH
           Sets the path to the live filesystem on the medium. By default, it is set to '/live' and you should not change that unless you have customized your media accordingly.

       live-media-timeout=SECONDS
           Set the timeout in seconds for the device specified by "live-media=" to become ready before giving up.

       module=NAME
           Instead of using the default optional file "filesystem.module" (see below) another file could be specified without the extension ".module"; it should be placed on "/live" directory of the live
           medium.

       netboot[=nfs|cifs]
           This  tells live-boot to perform a network mount. The parameter "nfsroot=" (with optional "nfsopts="), should specify where is the location of the root filesystem.  With no args, will try cifs
           first, and if it fails nfs.

       nfsopts=
           This lets you specify custom nfs options.

       nofastboot
           This parameter disables the default disabling of filesystem checks in /etc/fstab. If you have static filesystems on your harddisk and you want them to be checked at boot time, use this parame‐
           ter, otherwise they are skipped.

       nopersistence
           disables the "persistence" feature, useful if the bootloader (like syslinux) has been installed with persistence enabled.

       noeject
           Do not prompt to eject the live medium.

       ramdisk-size
           This parameter defines a custom ramdisk size (it's the '-o size' option of tmpfs mount). By default, there is no ramdisk size set, so the default of mount applies (currently 50%  of  available
           RAM). Note that this option has currently no effect when booting with toram.

       overlay-size=SIZE
           The  size  of the tmpfs mount (used for the upperdir union root mount) in bytes, and rounded up to entire pages. This option accepts a suffix % to limit the instance to that percentage of your
           physical RAM or a suffix k, m or g for Ki, Mi, Gi (binary kilo (kibi), binary mega (mebi) and binary giga (gibi)). By default, 50% of available RAM will be used.

       swap=true
           This parameter enables usage of local swap partitions.

       persistence
           live-boot will probe devices for persistence media. These can be partitions (with the correct GPT name), filesystems (with the correct label) or image files (with the correct file name). Over‐
           lays are labeled/named "persistence" (see persistence.conf(5)). Overlay image files are named "persistence".

       persistence-encryption=TYPE1,TYPE2 ... TYPEn
           This option determines which types of encryption that are allowed to be used when probing devices for persistence media. If "none" is in the list, we allow unencrypted media; if "luks"  is  in
           the  list, we allow LUKS-encrypted media and if "lukslabel" is in the list we check if the container contains the label "persistence" before trying to open it. Whenever a device containing en‐
           crypted media is probed the user will be prompted for the passphrase. The default value is "none".

       persistence-media={removable|removable-usb}
           If you specify the keyword 'removable', live-boot will try to find persistence partitions on removable media only. Note that if you want to further restrict the media to usb mass storage only,
           you can use the 'removable-usb' keyword.

       persistence-method=TYPE1,TYPE2 ... TYPEn
           This option determines which types of persistence media we allow. If "overlay" is in the list, we consider overlays (i.e. "live-rw" and "home-rw"). The default is "overlay".

       persistence-path=PATH
           live-boot will look for persistency files in the root directory of a partition, with this parameter, the path can be configured so that you can have multiple directories on the same  partition
           to store persistency files.

       persistence-read-only
           Filesystem changes are not saved back to persistence media. In particular, overlays and netboot NFS mounts are mounted read-only.

       persistence-storage=TYPE1,TYPE2 ... TYPEn
           This  option  determines  which  types  of persistence storage to consider when probing for persistence media. If "filesystem" is in the list, filesystems with matching labels will be used; if
           "file" is in the list, all filesystems will be probed for archives and image files with matching filenames. The default is "file,filesystem".

       persistence-label=LABEL1,LABEL2 ... LABELn
           live-boot will use the names in this list (instead of "persistence") when searching for persistent storage. Each LABEL can be a valid filename, partition label, or GPT  name.  The  default  is
           "persistence".

       noeject
           This option causes live-boot to reboot without attempting to eject the media and without asking the user to remove the boot media.

       showmounts
           This  parameter  will  make  live-boot  to show on "/" the ro filesystems (mostly compressed) on "/lib/live". This is not enabled by default because could lead to problems by applications like
           "mono" which store binary paths on installation.

       silent
           If you boot with the normal quiet parameter, live-boot hides most messages of its own. When adding silent, it hides all.

       todisk=DEVICE
           Adding this parameter, live-boot will try to copy the entire read-only media to the specified device before mounting the root filesystem. It probably needs a  lot  of  free  space.  Subsequent
           boots should then skip this step and just specify the "live-media=DEVICE" boot parameter with the same DEVICE used this time.

       toram
           Adding this parameter, live-boot will try to copy the whole read-only media to the computer's RAM before mounting the root filesystem. This could need a lot of ram, according to the space used
           by the read-only media.

       union=overlay|aufs
           By default, live-boot uses overlay. With this parameter, you can switch to aufs.

       dm-verity-root-hash=IMAGE:ROOTHASH,IMAGE2:ROOTHASH2 ... IMAGEn:ROOTHASHn
           Explicitly specify a dm-verity root hash for a IMAGE. Full path needs to be specified. Hashes for multiple images can be comma separated specified.

       dm-verity-enforce-roothash-signature
           Enforces that the root hash has to be checked against a signature.

       dm-verity-oncorruption=ignore|panic|restart
           Sets the regarding action for the kernel if corruption occurs on a dm-verity device.

dm-verity Support
       live-boot has support for dm-verity backed root file systems. Which allows for error detection (and correction) in the underlying image.
       If  for  an image a file ending with .verity in the same directory as the image is found live-boot attempts to mount that image with dm-vertiy support.  For a given device with dm-vertiy support a
       root hash must be specified. Either in a file ending with .roothash or with the kernel command-line option dm-verity-root-hash.  If a file ending with .roothash.p7s is found it is used for  signa‐
       ture checking in dm-verity. If signature checking should be enforced the kernel command-line option dm-verity-enforce-roothash-signature must be set.
       Forward error detection gets enabled if a file ending with .fec and one with .fec.roots containing the number of roots are found.

       Example file structure:
           /live/filesystem.squashfs
           /live/filesystem.squashfs.verity
           /live/filesystem.squashfs.fec
           /live/filesystem.squashfs.fec.roots
           /live/filesystem.squashfs.roothash
           /live/filesystem.squashfs.roothash.p7s

FILES (old)
       /etc/live.conf
           Some variables can be configured via this config file (inside the live system).

       live/filesystem.module
           This  optional  file  (inside the live media) contains a list of white-space or carriage-return-separated file names corresponding to disk images in the "/live" directory. If this file exists,
           only images listed here will be merged into the root aufs, and they will be loaded in the order listed here. The first entry in this file will be the "lowest" point in the aufs, and  the  last
           file in this list will be on the "top" of the aufs, directly below /overlay.  Without this file, any images in the "/live" directory are loaded in alphanumeric order.
