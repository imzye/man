NAME
       cd-tkdesk - change directory of TkDesk's current file browser or list window

SYNOPSIS
       cd-tkdesk [ directory ]

DESCRIPTION
       If invoked with no argument, cd-tkdesk returns the path of the directory currently displayed in TkDesk's active window.  The active window is the file browser or list window that the mouse pointer
       was last in.

       If directory is given to cd-tkdesk, it will change the directory of TkDesk's currently active window to its value.

       Cd-tkdesk communicates with TkDesk through a TCP/IP server that needs to be started from within TkDesk using the menu entry "TkDesk Server" from TkDesk's "Options" menu.

OPTIONS
       directory
              The directory the currently active window of TkDesk should switch to.

FILES
       tkdeskclient
              Usually in "/usr/local/bin", this program is used to perform the actual communication with TkDesk.
