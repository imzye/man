Name
       Dist::Zilla::App::Command::msg_init - Add language translation catalogs to a dist

Synopsis
       In dist.ini:

         [LocaleTextDomain]
         textdomain = My-App
         lang_dir = po

       On the command line:

         dzil msg-init fr

Description
       This command initializes and adds one or more GNU gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>-style language catalogs to your distribution. It can either use an existing template file (such as
       can be created with the "msg-scan" command) or will scan your distribution's Perl modules directly to create the catalog.  It relies on the settings from the "LocaleTextDomain" plugin for its
       settings, and requires that the GNU gettext utilities be available.

   Options
       "--xgettext"

       The location of the "xgettext" program, which is distributed with GNU gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>. Defaults to just "xgettext" (or "xgettext.exe" on Windows), which should work
       if it's in your path. Not used if "--pot-file" points to an existing template file.

       "--msginit"

       The location of the "msginit" program, which is distributed with GNU gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>. Defaults to just "msginit" (or "msginit.exe" on Windows), which should work if
       it's in your path.

       "--encoding"

       The encoding to assume the Perl modules are encoded in. Defaults to "UTF-8".

       "--pot-file"

       The name of the template file to use to generate the message catalogs. If not specified, "$lang_dir/$textdomain.pot" will be used if it exists. Otherwise, a temporary template file will be created
       by scanning the Perl sources.

       "--copyright-holder"

       Name of the application copyright holder. Defaults to the copyright holder defined in dist.ini. Used only to generate a temporary template file.

       "--bugs-email"

       Email address to which translation bug reports should be sent. Defaults to the email address of the first distribution author, if available. Used only to generate a temporary template file.
