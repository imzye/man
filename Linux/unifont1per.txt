NAME
       unifont1per - Create BMP glyph files from GNU Unifont .hex file

SYNOPSIS
       unifont1per < input_file.hex

DESCRIPTION
       unifont1per  reads  a  GNU  Unifont  .hex  file  and for each code point in the file, creates an output Bitmapped Graphics (".bmp") file in the current directory.  The filename for each output file is
       "U+codepoint.bmp", where codepoint is the Unicode codepoint for the glyph.

       Each glyph entry in a Unifont .hex file is expected to be 16 rows tall, and can be 8, 16, 24, or 32 pixels wide.  The glyph sizes in output files are determined on a glyph-by-glyph basis.

       This program can be of use in extracting individual glyphs to display in a document or on a web page.

       WARNING!  This program generates one output file per code point that appears in the input stream.  If you feed this program a file with 1000 code points, it will generate 1000 files  in  your  current
       directory.

OPTIONS
       None.

FILES
       *.hex GNU Unifont font files, read from standard input

BUGS
       No known real bugs exist, except that this software does not perform extensive error checking on its input files.  If they're not in the format of the original GNU Unifont .hex file, all bets are off.
