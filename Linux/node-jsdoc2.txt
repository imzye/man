NAME
       jsdoc2 - Automatic documentation generation tool for JavaScript

SYNOPSIS

       jsdoc2 [OPTIONS] [<SRC_DIR>] [<SRC_FILE>] [...]

       jsdoc2 --help

USAGE
       A valid command line to run jsdoc2 might look like this:

       jsdoc2 -a -t=templates/jsdoc mycode.js

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the jsdoc2 command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       jsdoc2 is an automatic documentation generation tool for JavaScript. It is written in JavaScript and is run from a command line (or terminal) and uses NodeJS.

       Using this tool you can automatically turn JavaDoc-like comments in your JavaScript source code into published output files, such as HTML or XML.

       -d=PATH, --directory=PATH
           Output to this directory (defaults to "out").

       -D="myVar:My value", --define="myVar:My value"
           Multiple. Define a variable, available in JsDoc as JSDOC.opt.D.myVar.
