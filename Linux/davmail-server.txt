NAME
       davmail - POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP Exchange Gateway

SYNOPSIS
       davmail [-notray] [CONFIG_FILE_PATH]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the davmail command.

       davmail creates a gateway making the Microsoft Exchange mail, contacts and calendar protocol available in standard protocols such as POP, IMAP, CalDAV, SMTP and LDAP.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

OPTIONS
       davmail can take the path of the configuration file on the command line.

       The configuration file syntax is described deeply on the davmail website.

       davmail accepts the following options:

       -notray
              Do not create a system tray icon.

       Note that even when passing "-notray" davmail will still show a graphical user interface.
       To run davmail without a GUI set the "davmail.server" to "true" in the configuration file, or use the following option.

       -server
              Run in server mode (no GUI).

FILES
       $HOME/.davmail.properties
              The user configuration file. If it exists this will be loaded when the CONFIG_FILE_PATH argument is not passed on the command line.

       /etc/davmail.properties
              The system wide configuration file.

       /etc/default/davmail
              System wide initscript behaviour handling.
