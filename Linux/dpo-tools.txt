NAME
       dpo-tools - set of shell scripts that can aid in the translation of podebconf files

DESCRIPTION
       dpo-tools is a set of shell scripts that can aid in the translation of Debian's podebconf files.

       dpo-tools does not dictate any rule of how translations should be done, it just tries to reflect the conventions used in the mailing list debian-l10n-portuguese@lists.debian.org list.

SCRIPTS
       The scripts are as follows:

       dpo-get-templates: downloads a templates.pot file from the podebconf templates repository.

       dpo-init-po: creates and initializes a podebconf file from a file templates.

       dpo-apply-templates: updates a podebconf file with a new version of your templates file.

       dpo-apply-compendium: updates a odebconf file with strings already translated, from a compendium file.

       dpo-check: verifies if the podebconf file is well formed.

       dpo-diff: shows information in a diff format colorful and paged.

       dpo-make-patch: creates a patch file based on two versions of a podebconf file.

       dpo-wrap: breaks the rows of a podebconf file in column 80.

DEPENDENCIES
       dpo-tools depends on other programs to work correctly. You must have the following major programs installed on your computer:

               gettext utilities: msgfmt, msgcat, msgmerge
               awk
               colordiff

       To install them on a Debian system or derivative:

               $ sudo apt install gettext gawk colordiff

       You will also want to use the podebconf-display-po program. To install it on a Debian system or derivative:

               $ sudo apt install po-debconf

CONFIGURATION
       dpo-init-po.awk:  adjust  the  NOME and EMAIL variables. If you use gawk, the variable ANO must be adjusted at the beginning of each year. You can uncomment the line that automatically detects the
       year, if your awk interpreter has support for the strftime() function.

       dpo-init.po: edit the last line of the file to reflect the full path of the dpo-init.po.awk file, for instance: ~/bin/dpo-init-po.awk

       dpo-make-patch: set the variable ID with the initials of your name.

       dpo-apply-compendium: adjust the COMPENDIUM variable to reflect the full path of the compendium file, downloaded from http://i18n.debian.org/compendia/pt_BR/

EXAMPLES
       To initiate a new translation: the following commands sequence downloads a podebconf templates file, creates a podebconf file based on the downloaded templates file, initializes the podebconf file
       with frequently used information, updates the podebconf file with compendium strings, edits the podebconf file, breaks the lines of the podebconffile in column 80, checks if the podebconf file  is
       well formed ands tests the display of the podebconf file:

               $ dpo-get-templates package
               $ dpo-init-po package_version_templates.pot
               $ dpo-apply-compendium package_pt_BR.po
               $ vi package_pt_BR.po
               $ dpo-wrap package_pt_BR.po
               $ dpo-check package_pt_BR.po
               $ podebconf-display-po package_pt_BR.po
               send the package_pt_BR.po file to RFR

       To review a translation made by another translator and generate a patch with change suggestions:

               replace "me" with your initials in the following commands
               $ vi /etc/dpo-tools/make-patch
               $ cp package_pt_BR.po package_pt_BR.me.po
               $ vi package_pt_BR.me.po
               $ dpo-wrap package_pt_BR.me.po
               $ dpo-check package_pt_BR.me.po
               $ podebconf-display-po package_pt_BR.me.po
               $ dpo-make-patch package_pt_BR.po
               send the generated patch file, responding the RFR

       To apply a new version of the templates file to a podebconf file previously translated:

               $ dpo-get-templates package_pt_BR.po
               $ dpo-apply-templates package_pt_BR.po
