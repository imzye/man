       [--osx-launchd]

DESCRIPTION
       This  gateway  obtains the current Caller ID or message from  one or more NCID servers, called sending servers and inputs them into another NCID server called a receiving server.  Line labels are used
       to distinguish the different phone calls.

       There can be up to 4 sending servers, but the first sending server must be configured by either the command line or the configuration file.  The receiving server has a default and may not need  to  be
       configured.

       If  a  sending server disconnects, the gateway will keep trying to reconnect until it either succeeds or is terminated.  The gateway will send a disconnect message to the receiving server if a sending
       server disconnects and it will send a reconnect message to the receiving server if it reconnects.

       The log file is /var/log/ncid2ncid.log.

       If a pid file is given, usually /var/run/ncid2ncid.pid, then a pid file is used to store the process ID.

       The configuration file for ncid2ncid is /etc/ncid/ncid2ncid.conf.

OPTIONS
       -C <filename> | --config <filename>
              Configuration file.
              Default: /etc/ncid/ncid2ncid.conf

       -D | --debug
              Debug mode, ncid2ncid stays attached to the terminal and displays all messages that go into the log file.

       -f <fromhost[:fromport]>
              Specifies the first sending NCID server.  It sends the Caller ID and messages to another NCID server.  Port may be specified by suffixing the hostname with :<port>.  Input  must  be  <host>  or
              <host:port>.
              Default: :3333

       -H <0|1> | --hostname-flag <0|1>
              When the hosthame flag is set to 1, the IDENT string sent to a server will include the hostname with the program name.
              Default: 0

       -h | --help
              Prints this help

       -L <filename> | --logfile <filename>
              Specifies the logfile name to use.  The logfile must exist before it is used.
              Default: /var/log/ncid2ncid.log

       -t <[host][:port]> | --ncid <[host][:port]>
              Specifies the receiving NCID server.  It receives Caller ID and messages from another NCID server.  Port may be specified by suffixing the hostname with :<port>.  Input can be <host> or <:port>
              or <host:port>
              Default: localhost:3333

       -P <filename> | --pidfile <filename>
              Specifies the pidfile name to write.  Set to /var/run/ncidd.pid in an rc or init script when used as a service.  The program will still run if it does not have permission to  write  a  pidfile.
              There is no default.  If pidfile is not set, no pid file will be used.  Prints this help

       -V | --version
              Displays the version

       -v <1-9> | --verbose <1-9>
              Verbose mode. Send information into the logfile and display information for the -D  option.  Set a higher number for more information.  LEVEL2 will give a warning every time it fails to connect
              with an NCID server.  LEVEL8 will print the logfiles from every server and LEVEL9 will add the socket of the received logfile.
              To debug, try: verbose = 2
              Default: 1

       -W <0|1> | --warn <0|1>
              Send server disconnected or server reconnected messages to clients.
              Default: 0

       --osx-launchd
              This option is only for OSX when using launchd to control ncidd.  It prevents ncidd from entering daemon mode.  It is like debug mode, but nothing is printed to the screen.

EXAMPLES
       Forward Caller ID information or messages from localhost:3334 to localhost:3333
           ncid2ncid --fromhost localhost:3334

       Forward Caller ID information or messages from localhost:3334 to localhost:3333 in debug mode using verbose level 1.
           ncid2ncid -D -f localhost:3334

       Forward Caller ID information or messages from localhost:3334 to localhost:3333 in debug mode and display all logfiles.
           ncid2ncid -Dv8 -f localhost:3334

FILES
       /etc/ncid/ncid2ncid.conf
       /var/run/ncid2ncid.pid
       /var/log/ncid2ncid.log
