NAME
       rpmgrill - static analysis of koji builds

SYNOPSIS
       rpmgrill [--disable=LIST] [--verbose] [--blacklist-config=FILE] BASEDIR

       rpmgrill  --help  |  --version | --man

DESCRIPTION
       rpmgrill analyzes a set of RPMs (typically from a Koji build), looking for problems with the source and/or generated RPMs.  Unlike rpmlint, rpmgrill analyzes full builds, not individual RPMs.

       rpmgrill is not intended to be run directly by humans: it requires complex prep work to fetch and unpack the build RPMs. rpmgrill is best suited toward a CI environment in which other tools monitor
       builds, fetch them, run rpmgrill, and report results.

       If you are reading this as a casual user, you are almost certainly better off looking into rpmgrill-analyze-local.

OPTIONS
       --list-plugins
           List available plugins, then exit.

       --disable=LIST
           Disable the given plugins when running. LIST is a comma-separated list of plugin names as listed with "--list-plugins". This can be useful for development, when you might want to do quick
           iterations of a test but not spend 10 minutes in the VirusCheck plugin.

       --verbose
           Show progress messages.

       --blacklist-config=FILE
           Blacklisted tests will not be reported by rpmgrill. Blacklist configuration FILE is in YAML format:

           blacklist:
             Plugin1: test1, test2
             Plugin2: test3
             ...

           and tells rpmgrill that it should not report fails for specified tests within certain plugins.

       --help
           Emit usage hints.

       --version
           Display program version.

       --man
           Display this man page.

DIAGNOSTICS
       rpmgrill writes its results to the files "rpmgrill.*" in its working directory, for "*" in json, xml, yaml. Unexpected errors (probably bugs or FIXMEs in rpmgrill) are emitted to stderr.

FILES
       rpmgrill requires a pre-set-up directory hierarchy containing unpacked RPMs. Documenting that is way beyond the scope of this man page. See README.unpacking in the rpmgrill source tree, or the
       rpmgrill-fetch-build tool, for more details.

Examples
       Test a new set of builds from Koji:

           $ mkdir testdir && cd testdir
           $ koji download-task --logs <task id>

           # unpack all rpms in the current directory
           $ rpmgrill-unpack .

           # the unpacked directory is created by rpmgrill-unpack
           $ rpmgrill unpacked
