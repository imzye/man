NAME
       runas — program to run daemons as non priviledge users

SYNOPSIS
       runas [-c directorio]  [uid]  [gid]  [umask]  [program]  [[options]]

DESCRIPTION
       runas is a small program that allows administrators a generic way to run daemons as non privileged users.

       runas is equivalent to using su     but it strips off the environment and does not require the target user's shell to be legitimate (that is, listed under /etc/shells)

       The  main  reason of using runas is to avoid having daemons run as the root user, in some cases this might be necessary (like login programs, such as ssh or telnetd that need to switch to the user
       making the connection) but in many cases it might not be necessary at all.  It can be also a good replacement for su, since it prevents attacks to daemons through the use of environment variables.
       Just change (in your initialisation scripts under /etc/init.d) the line:

              su - daemon -c /usr/bin/blah

       to:

              runas daemon daemongroup /usr/bin/blah

OPTIONS
       This program just takes two command line options:

       -?        Show summary of options.

       -cdirectory
                 Chroot the daemon to a specific directory before execution.
