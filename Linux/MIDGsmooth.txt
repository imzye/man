NAME
       MIDGsmooth - send MIDG-formatted GPS data to a FlightGear instance

SYNOPSIS
       MIDGsmooth --help
           | --infile infile_name [options]...
           | --serial dev_name --outfile outfile_name [options]...

DESCRIPTION
       MIDGsmooth  is a utility that reads GPS data in MIDG format from a text
       file or from an MIDG device connected to the serial port, parses it and
       sends it to a FlightGear instance for replaying.

OPTIONS
       --help Display usage information and exit.

       --infile infile_name
              Read GPS data from infile_name.

       --serial dev_name
              Read GPS data from the serial device named dev_name.

       --outfile outfile_name
              Save the data retrieved from the device to outfile_name.

       --hertz frequency
              Specify  the frequency to use for sending data to the FlightGear
              instance.  By default, events are sent at a frequency of 60 Hz.

       --host hostname
              Send the data to the FlightGear instance running on hostname.

              If --host is not specified, the default is to send the  data  to
              localhost.

       --skip-seconds seconds
              Do not transmit the first seconds seconds of data.

              This  option  is ignored when reading GPS data from a serial de‐
              vice.

       --broadcast
              Send flight data model and control data as broadcast packets.

       --fdm-port port
              Set the port flight data model data should be sent  to.  By  de‐
              fault, data is sent to port 5505.

       --ctrls-port port
              Set the port control data should be sent to. By default, data is
              sent to port 5506.

       --altitude-offset meters
              Add the specified offset (in meters) to  the  altitude  sent  to
              FlightGear.

EXIT STATUS
       MIDGsmooth  exits  with 0 on success, with -1 if the syntax of the com‐
       mand-line arguments is wrong or an error occurs.
