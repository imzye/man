NAME
       update-exim4.conf.template - Regenerate exim4 configuration file template.

SYNOPSIS
       update-exim4.conf.template [-h|--help] [-n|--nobackup] [-o|--output file] [-r|--run]

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
              Show short help message and exit

       -n|--nobackup
              Overwrite existing file, instead of keeping it as /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template.bak.random-number

       -o|--output file
              Write output to file instead of /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template.

       -r|--run
              Actually  do  something. If this option is not specified update-exim4.conf.template will exit immediately. This option was introduced because update-exim4.conf.template overwrites configuration
              files.

DESCRIPTION
       The script update-exim4.conf.template regenerates the main configuration file template /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template from the configuration snippets in the /etc/exim4/conf.d directory tree.

       This process will overwrite all local changes in /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template and might be useful if there are local changes in the /etc/exim4/conf.d directory tree, for example by a  new  mail  re‐
       lated package dropping its own configuration snippets in there.

       update-exim4.conf.template  ignores  all  files  in  the  conf.d  directory  that  have  a  filename  which does not consist only of letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens ([:alnum:]_-), similar to
       run-parts(8).  For easy interaction with packages extending Exim additionally /etc/exim4/conf.d/foo/bar.rul is used instead of /etc/exim4/conf.d/foo/bar if it exists!

ENVIRONMENT
       If CONFDIR is set update-exim4.conf.template will search for the input files below $CONFDIR/conf.d instead of /etc/exim4/conf.d/ and will write the output to $CONFDIR/exim4.conf.template instead of to
       /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template (unless overridden with -o or --output).

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches would be greatly appreciated.
