NAME
       yamllint - Linter for YAML files

       A linter for YAML files.

       yamllint does not only check for syntax validity, but for weirdnesses like key repetition and cosmetic problems such as lines length, trailing spaces, indentation, etc.

SCREENSHOT
       [image: yamllint screenshot] [image]

       NOTE:
          The default output format is inspired by eslint, a great linting tool for Javascript.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
   Quickstart
   Running yamllint
       Basic usage:

          yamllint file.yml other-file.yaml

       You can also lint all YAML files in a whole directory:

          yamllint .

       Or lint a YAML stream from standard input:

          echo -e 'this: is\nvalid: YAML' | yamllint -

       The output will look like (colors are not displayed here):

          file.yml
            1:4       error    trailing spaces  (trailing-spaces)
            4:4       error    wrong indentation: expected 4 but found 3  (indentation)
            5:4       error    duplication of key "id-00042" in mapping  (key-duplicates)
            6:6       warning  comment not indented like content  (comments-indentation)
            12:6      error    too many spaces after hyphen  (hyphens)
            15:12     error    too many spaces before comma  (commas)

          other-file.yaml
            1:1       warning  missing document start "---"  (document-start)
            6:81      error    line too long (87 > 80 characters)  (line-length)
            10:1      error    too many blank lines (4 > 2)  (empty-lines)
            11:4      error    too many spaces inside braces  (braces)

       By  default,  the  output  of yamllint is colored when run from a terminal, and pure text in other cases. Add the -f standard arguments to force non-colored output. Use the -f colored arguments to
       force colored output.

       Add the -f parsable arguments if you need an output format parsable by a machine (for instance for syntax highlighting in text editors). The output will then look like:

          file.yml:6:2: [warning] missing starting space in comment (comments)
          file.yml:57:1: [error] trailing spaces (trailing-spaces)
          file.yml:60:3: [error] wrong indentation: expected 4 but found 2 (indentation)

       If you have a custom linting configuration file (see how to configure yamllint), it can be passed to yamllint using the -c option:

          yamllint -c ~/myconfig file.yaml

       NOTE:
          If you have a .yamllint file in your working directory, it will be automatically loaded as configuration by yamllint.

   Source code
       The source code of yamllint is currently hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/. Releases can be found on this page.

   Configuration
       yamllint uses a set of rules to check source files for problems.  Each rule is independent from the others, and can be enabled, disabled or tweaked. All these settings can be gathered in a config‐
       uration file.

       To use a custom configuration file, use the -c option:

          yamllint -c /path/to/myconfig file-to-lint.yaml

       If -c is not provided, yamllint will look for a configuration file in the following locations (by order of preference):

       • a file named .yamllint, .yamllint.yaml, or .yamllint.yml in the current working directory, or a parent directory (the search for this file is terminated at the user's home or filesystem root)

       • a filename referenced by $YAMLLINT_CONFIG_FILE, if set

       • a file named $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yamllint/config or ~/.config/yamllint/config, if present

       Finally if no config file is found, the default configuration is applied.

   Default configuration
       Unless told otherwise, yamllint uses its default configuration:

          ---

          yaml-files:
            - '*.yaml'
            - '*.yml'
            - '.yamllint'

          rules:
            anchors: enable
            braces: enable
            brackets: enable
            colons: enable
            commas: enable
            comments:
              level: warning
            comments-indentation:
              level: warning
            document-end: disable
            document-start:
              level: warning
            empty-lines: enable
            empty-values: disable
            float-values: disable
            hyphens: enable
            indentation: enable
            key-duplicates: enable
            key-ordering: disable
            line-length: enable
            new-line-at-end-of-file: enable
            new-lines: enable
            octal-values: disable
            quoted-strings: disable
            trailing-spaces: enable
            truthy:
              level: warning

       Details on rules can be found on the rules page.

       There is another pre-defined configuration named relaxed. As its name suggests, it is more tolerant:

          ---

          extends: default

          rules:
            braces:
              level: warning
              max-spaces-inside: 1
            brackets:
              level: warning
              max-spaces-inside: 1
            colons:
              level: warning
            commas:
              level: warning
            comments: disable
            comments-indentation: disable
            document-start: disable
            empty-lines:
              level: warning
            hyphens:
              level: warning
            indentation:
              level: warning
              indent-sequences: consistent
            line-length:
              level: warning
              allow-non-breakable-inline-mappings: true
            truthy: disable

       It can be chosen using:

          yamllint -d relaxed file.yml

   Extending the default configuration
       When writing a custom configuration file, you don't need to redefine every rule. Just extend the default configuration (or any already-existing configuration file).

       For instance, if you just want to disable the comments-indentation rule, your file could look like this:

          # This is my first, very own configuration file for yamllint!
          # It extends the default conf by adjusting some options.

          extends: default

          rules:
            comments-indentation: disable  # don't bother me with this rule

       Similarly, if you want to set the line-length rule as a warning and be less strict on block sequences indentation:

          extends: default

          rules:
            # 80 chars should be enough, but don't fail if a line is longer
            line-length:
              max: 80
              level: warning

            # accept both     key:
            #                   - item
            #
            # and             key:
            #                 - item
            indentation:
              indent-sequences: whatever

   Custom configuration without a config file
       It is possible -- although not recommended -- to pass custom configuration options to yamllint with the -d (short for --config-data) option.

       Its content can either be the name of a pre-defined conf (example: default or relaxed) or a serialized YAML object describing the configuration.

       For instance:

          yamllint -d "{extends: relaxed, rules: {line-length: {max: 120}}}" file.yaml

   Errors and warnings
       Problems detected by yamllint can be raised either as errors or as warnings.  The CLI will output them (with different colors when using the colored output format, or auto when run from  a  termi‐
       nal).

       By default the script will exit with a return code 1 only when there is one or more error(s).

       However if strict mode is enabled with the -s (or --strict) option, the return code will be:

          • 0 if no errors or warnings occur

          • 1 if one or more errors occur

          • 2 if no errors occur, but one or more warnings occur

       If the script is invoked with the --no-warnings option, it won't output warning level problems, only error level ones.

   YAML files extensions
       To configure what yamllint should consider as YAML files when listing directories, set yaml-files configuration option. The default is:

          yaml-files:
            - '*.yaml'
            - '*.yml'
            - '.yamllint'

       The same rules as for ignoring paths apply (.gitignore-style path pattern, see below).

       If you need to know the exact list of files that yamllint would process, without really linting them, you can use --list-files:

          yamllint --list-files .

   Ignoring paths
       It is possible to exclude specific files or directories, so that the linter doesn't process them. They can be provided either as a list of paths, or as a bulk string.

       You can either totally ignore files (they won't be looked at):

          extends: default

          ignore: |
            /this/specific/file.yaml
            all/this/directory/
            *.template.yaml

          # or:

          ignore:
            - /this/specific/file.yaml
            - all/this/directory/
            - '*.template.yaml'

       or ignore paths only for specific rules:

          extends: default

          rules:
            trailing-spaces:
              ignore: |
                /this-file-has-trailing-spaces-but-it-is-OK.yaml
                /generated/*.yaml

          # or:

          rules:
            trailing-spaces:
              ignore:
                - /this-file-has-trailing-spaces-but-it-is-OK.yaml
                - /generated/*.yaml

       Note that this .gitignore-style path pattern allows complex path exclusion/inclusion, see the pathspec README file for more details. Here is a more complex example:

          # For all rules
          ignore: |
            *.dont-lint-me.yaml
            /bin/
            !/bin/*.lint-me-anyway.yaml

          extends: default

          rules:
            key-duplicates:
              ignore: |
                generated
                *.template.yaml
            trailing-spaces:
              ignore: |
                *.ignore-trailing-spaces.yaml
                ascii-art/*

       You can also use the .gitignore file (or any list of files) through:

          ignore-from-file: .gitignore

       or:

          ignore-from-file: [.gitignore, .yamlignore]

       NOTE:
          However, this is mutually exclusive with the ignore key.

       NOTE:
          Files on the ignore-from-file list should use either UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. See Character Encoding for details and workarounds.

       If you need to know the exact list of files that yamllint would process, without really linting them, you can use --list-files:

          yamllint --list-files .

   Setting the locale
       It is possible to set the locale option globally. This is passed to Python's locale.setlocale, so an empty string "" will use the system default locale, while e.g.  "en_US.UTF-8" will use that.

       Currently this only affects the key-ordering rule. The default will order by Unicode code point number, while locales will sort case and accents properly as well.

          extends: default

          locale: en_US.UTF-8

   Rules
       When linting a document with yamllint, a series of rules (such as line-length, trailing-spaces, etc.) are checked against.

       A configuration file can be used to enable or disable these rules, to set their level (error or warning), but also to tweak their options.

       This page describes the rules and their options.

         as it remains the same within the file.

       • indent-sequences defines whether block sequences should be indented or not (when in a mapping, this indentation is not mandatory -- some people perceive the - as part of the indentation). Possi‐
         ble  values: true, false, whatever and consistent. consistent requires either all block sequences to be indented, or none to be. whatever means either indenting or not indenting individual block
         sequences is OK.

   key-duplicates
       Use this rule to prevent multiple entries with the same key in mappings.

       Options

       • Use forbid-duplicated-merge-keys to forbid the usage of multiple merge keys <<.

   key-ordering
       Use this rule to enforce alphabetical ordering of keys in mappings. The sorting order uses the Unicode code point number as a default. As a result, the  ordering  is  case-sensitive  and  not  ac‐
       cent-friendly (see examples below).  This can be changed by setting the global locale option.  This allows one to sort case and accents properly.

       Options

       • ignored-keys is a list of PCRE regexes to ignore some keys while checking order, if they match any regex.

       Default values (when enabled)

          rules:
            key-ordering:
              ignored-keys: []

       Examples

       1. With key-ordering: {}

   line-length
       Use this rule to set a limit to lines length.

       Options

       • max defines the maximal (inclusive) length of lines.

       • allow-non-breakable-words is used to allow non breakable words (without spaces inside) to overflow the limit. This is useful for long URLs, for instance. Use true to allow, false to forbid.

       • allow-non-breakable-inline-mappings implies allow-non-breakable-words and extends it to also allow non-breakable words in inline mappings.

       Default values (when enabled)

          rules:
            line-length:
              max: 80
              allow-non-breakable-words: true
              allow-non-breakable-inline-mappings: false

       Examples

       1. With line-length: {max: 70}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             long sentence:
               Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do

       4. With line-length: {max: 60, allow-non-breakable-words: false}

          the following code snippet would FAIL:

             this:
               is:
                 - a:

   new-line-at-end-of-file
       Use this rule to require a new line character (\n) at the end of files.

       The POSIX standard requires the last line to end with a new line character.  All UNIX tools expect a new line at the end of files. Most text editors use this convention too.

   new-lines
       Use this rule to force the type of new line characters.

       Options

       • Set  type  to unix to enforce UNIX-typed new line characters (\n), set type to dos to enforce DOS-typed new line characters (\r\n), or set type to platform to infer the type from the system run‐
         ning yamllint (\n on POSIX / UNIX / Linux / Mac OS systems or \r\n on DOS / Windows systems).

       Default values (when enabled)

          rules:
            new-lines:
              type: unix

   octal-values
       Use this rule to prevent values with octal numbers. In YAML, numbers that start with 0 are interpreted as octal, but this is not always wanted.  For instance 010 is the city code of  Beijing,  and
       should not be converted to 8.

       Options

       • Use forbid-implicit-octal to prevent numbers starting with 0.

       • Use forbid-explicit-octal to prevent numbers starting with 0o.

       Default values (when enabled)

          rules:
            octal-values:
              forbid-implicit-octal: true
              forbid-explicit-octal: true

       Examples

       1. With octal-values: {forbid-implicit-octal: true}

          the following code snippets would PASS:

             user:
               city-code: '010'

          the following code snippets would PASS:

             user:
               city-code: 010,021

          the following code snippets would FAIL:

             user:
               city-code: 010

       2. With octal-values: {forbid-explicit-octal: true}

          the following code snippets would PASS:

             user:
               city-code: '0o10'

          the following code snippets would FAIL:

             user:
               city-code: 0o10

   quoted-strings
       Use this rule to forbid any string values that are not quoted, or to prevent quoted strings without needing it. You can also enforce the type of the quote used.

       Options

       • quote-type defines allowed quotes: single, double or any (default).

       • required defines whether using quotes in string values is required (true, default) or not (false), or only allowed when really needed (only-when-needed).

       • extra-required is a list of PCRE regexes to force string values to be quoted, if they match any regex. This option can only be used with required: false and  required: only-when-needed.

       • extra-allowed is a list of PCRE regexes to allow quoted string values, even if required: only-when-needed is set.

       • allow-quoted-quotes allows (true) using disallowed quotes for strings with allowed quotes inside. Default false.

       • check-keys defines whether to apply the rules to keys in mappings. By default, quoted-strings rules apply only to values. Set this option to true to apply the rules to keys as well.

       Note: Multi-line strings (with | or >) will not be checked.

       Default values (when enabled)

          rules:
            quoted-strings:
              quote-type: any
              required: true
              extra-required: []
              extra-allowed: []
              allow-quoted-quotes: false
              check-keys: false

       Examples

       1. With quoted-strings: {quote-type: any, required: true}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             foo: "bar"
             bar: 'foo'
             number: 123
             boolean: true

          the following code snippet would FAIL:

             foo: bar

       2. With quoted-strings: {quote-type: single, required: only-when-needed}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             foo: bar
             bar: foo
             not_number: '123'
             not_boolean: 'true'
             not_comment: '# comment'
             not_list: '[1, 2, 3]'
             not_map: '{a: 1, b: 2}'

          the following code snippet would FAIL:

             foo: 'bar'

       3. With quoted-strings: {required: false, extra-required: [^http://, ^ftp://]}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             - localhost
             - "localhost"
             - "http://localhost"
             - "ftp://localhost"

          the following code snippet would FAIL:

             - http://localhost
             - ftp://localhost

       4. With quoted-strings: {required: only-when-needed, extra-allowed: [^http://, ^ftp://], extra-required: [QUOTED]}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             - localhost
             - "http://localhost"
             - "ftp://localhost"
             - "this is a string that needs to be QUOTED"

          the following code snippet would FAIL:

             - "localhost"
             - this is a string that needs to be QUOTED

       5. With quoted-strings: {quote-type: double, allow-quoted-quotes: false}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             foo: "bar\"baz"

          the following code snippet would FAIL:

             foo: 'bar"baz'

       6. With quoted-strings: {quote-type: double, allow-quoted-quotes: true}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             foo: 'bar"baz'

       7. With quoted-strings: {required: only-when-needed, check-keys: true, extra-required: ["[:]"]}

          the following code snippet would FAIL:

             foo:bar: baz

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             "foo:bar": baz

   trailing-spaces
       Use this rule to forbid trailing spaces at the end of lines.

       Examples

       1. With trailing-spaces: {}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             this document doesn't contain
             any trailing
             spaces

          the following code snippet would FAIL:

             this document contains
             trailing spaces
             on lines 1 and 3

   truthy
       Use this rule to forbid non-explicitly typed truthy values other than allowed ones (by default: true and false), for example YES or off.

       This can be useful to prevent surprises from YAML parsers transforming [yes, FALSE, Off] into [true, false, false] or {y: 1, yes: 2, on: 3, true: 4, True: 5} into {y: 1, true: 5}.

       Depending  on  the YAML specification version used by the YAML document, the list of truthy values can differ. In YAML 1.2, only capitalized / uppercased combinations of true and false are consid‐
       ered truthy, whereas in YAML 1.1 combinations of yes, no, on and off are too. To make the YAML specification version explicit in a YAML document, a %YAML 1.2 directive can be used (see example be‐
       low).

       Options

       • allowed-values defines the list of truthy values which will be ignored during linting. The default is ['true', 'false'], but can be changed to  any  list  containing:  'TRUE',  'True',   'true',
         'FALSE', 'False', 'false', 'YES', 'Yes', 'yes', 'NO', 'No', 'no', 'ON', 'On', 'on', 'OFF', 'Off', 'off'.

       • check-keys disables verification for keys in mappings. By default, truthy rule applies to both keys and values. Set this option to false to prevent this.

       Default values (when enabled)

          rules:
            truthy:
              allowed-values: ['true', 'false']
              check-keys: true

       Examples

       1. With truthy: {}

          the following code snippet would PASS:

             boolean: true

   Disable with comments
   Disabling checks for a specific line
       To prevent yamllint from reporting problems for a specific line, add a directive comment (# yamllint disable-line ...) on that line, or on the line above. For instance:

          # The following mapping contains the same key twice,
          # but I know what I'm doing:
          - key: value 1
            key: value 2  # yamllint disable-line rule:key-duplicates

          - This line is waaaaaaaaaay too long but yamllint will not report anything about it.  # yamllint disable-line rule:line-length
          - This line will be checked by yamllint.

       or:

          # The following mapping contains the same key twice,
          # but I know what I'm doing:
          - key: value 1
            # yamllint disable-line rule:key-duplicates
            key: value 2

          # yamllint disable-line rule:line-length
          - This line is waaaaaaaaaay too long but yamllint will not report anything about it.
          - This line will be checked by yamllint.

       It is possible, although not recommend, to disabled all rules for a specific line:

          # yamllint disable-line
          -  {    all : rules ,are disabled   for this line}

       You can't make yamllint ignore invalid YAML syntax on a line (which generates a syntax error), such as when templating a YAML file with Jinja. In some cases, you can workaround this by putting the
       templating syntax in a YAML comment. See Putting template flow control in comments.

       If you need to disable multiple rules, it is allowed to chain rules like this: # yamllint disable-line rule:hyphens rule:commas rule:indentation.

   Disabling checks for all (or part of) the file
       To prevent yamllint from reporting problems for the whole file, or for a block of lines within the file, use # yamllint disable ... and # yamllint enable ... directive comments. For instance:

          # yamllint disable rule:colons
          - Lorem       : ipsum
            dolor       : sit amet,
            consectetur : adipiscing elit
          # yamllint enable rule:colons

          - rest of the document...

       It is possible, although not recommend, to disabled all rules:

          # yamllint disable
          - Lorem       :
                  ipsum:
                    dolor : [   sit,amet]
          -         consectetur : adipiscing elit
          # yamllint enable

       If you need to disable multiple rules, it is allowed to chain rules like this: # yamllint disable rule:hyphens rule:commas rule:indentation.

   Disabling all checks for a file
       To prevent yamllint from reporting problems for a specific file, add the directive comment # yamllint disable-file as the first line of the file.  For instance:

          # yamllint disable-file
          # The following mapping contains the same key twice, but I know what I'm doing:
          - key: value 1
            key: value 2

          - This line is waaaaaaaaaay too long but yamllint will not report anything about it.

       or:

          # yamllint disable-file
          # This file is not valid YAML because it is a Jinja template
          {% if extra_info %}
          key1: value1
          {% endif %}
          key2: value2

   Putting template flow control in comments
       Alternatively  for  templating you can wrap the template statements in comments to make it a valid YAML file. As long as the templating language doesn't use the same comment symbol, it should be a
       valid template and valid YAML (pre and post-template processing).

       Example of a Jinja2 code that cannot be parsed as YAML because it contains invalid tokens {% and %}:

          # This file IS NOT valid YAML and will produce syntax errors
          {% if extra_info %}
          key1: value1
          {% endif %}
          key2: value2

       But it can be fixed using YAML comments:

          # This file IS valid YAML because the Jinja is in a YAML comment
          # {% if extra_info %}
          key1: value1
          # {% endif %}
          key2: value2

   Development
       yamllint provides both a script and a Python module. The latter can be used to write your own linting tools.

       Basic example of running the linter from Python:

          import yamllint.config
          import yamllint.linter

          yaml_config = yamllint.config.YamlLintConfig("extends: default")
          for p in yamllint.linter.run(open("example.yaml", "r"), yaml_config):
              print(p.desc, p.line, p.rule)

       class yamllint.linter.LintProblem(line, column, desc='<no description>', rule=None)
              Represents a linting problem found by yamllint.

              column Column on which the problem was found (starting at 1)

              desc   Human-readable description of the problem

              line   Line on which the problem was found (starting at 1)

              rule   Identifier of the rule that detected the problem

       yamllint.linter.run(input, conf, filepath=None)
              Lints a YAML source.

              Returns a generator of LintProblem objects.

              Parameters

                     • input -- buffer, string or stream to read from

                     • conf -- yamllint configuration object

   Integration with text editors
       Most text editors support syntax checking and highlighting, to visually report syntax errors and warnings to the user. yamllint can be used to syntax-check YAML source, but a bit of  configuration
       is required depending on your favorite text editor.

   Vim
       Assuming that the ALE plugin is installed, yamllint is supported by default. It is automatically enabled when editing YAML files.

       If you instead use the syntastic plugin, add this to your .vimrc:

          let g:syntastic_yaml_checkers = ['yamllint']

   Neovim
       Assuming that the neomake plugin is installed, yamllint is supported by default. It is automatically enabled when editing YAML files.

   Emacs
       If you are flycheck user, you can use flycheck-yamllint integration.

   Visual Studio Code
       https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fnando.linter

   IntelliJ

   Integration with other software
   Integration with pre-commit
       You can integrate yamllint in the pre-commit tool.  Here is an example, to add in your .pre-commit-config.yaml

          ---
          # Update the rev variable with the release version that you want, from the yamllint repo
          # You can pass your custom .yamllint with args attribute.
          repos:
            - repo: https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint.git
              rev: v1.29.0
              hooks:
                - id: yamllint
                  args: [--strict, -c=/path/to/.yamllint]

   Integration with GitHub Actions
       yamllint  auto-detects when it's running inside of GitHub Actions and automatically uses the suited output format to decorate code with linting errors. You can also force the GitHub Actions output
       with yamllint --format github.

       A minimal example workflow using GitHub Actions:

          ---
          on: push  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy

          jobs:
            lint:
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v3

                - name: Install yamllint
                  run: pip install yamllint

                - name: Lint YAML files
                  run: yamllint .

   Integration with GitLab
       You can use the following GitLab CI/CD stage to run yamllint and get the results as a Code quality (Code Climate) report.

          ---
          lint:
            stage: lint
            script:
              - pip install yamllint
              - mkdir reports
              - >
                yamllint -f parsable . | tee >(awk '
                BEGIN {FS = ":"; ORS="\n"; first=1}
                {
                    gsub(/^[ \t]+|[ \t]+$|"/, "", $4);
                    match($4, /^\[(warning|error)\](.*)\((.*)\)$/, a);
                    sev = (a[1] == "error" ? "major" : "minor");
                    if (first) {
                        first=0;
                        printf("[");
                    } else {
                        printf(",");
                    }
                    printf("{\"location\":{\"path\":\"%s\",\"lines\":{\"begin\":%s,"\
                           "\"end\":%s}},\"severity\":\"%s\",\"check_name\":\"%s\","\
                           "\"categories\":[\"Style\"],\"type\":\"issue\","\
                           "\"description\":\"%s\"}", $1, $2, $3, sev, a[3], a[2]);
                }
                END { if (!first) printf("]\n"); }' > reports/codequality.json)
            artifacts:
              when: always
              paths:
                - reports
              expire_in: 1 week
              reports:
                codequality: reports/codequality.json

   Integration with Arcanist
       You can configure yamllint to run on arc lint. Here is an example .arclint file that makes use of this configuration.

          {
            "linters": {
              "yamllint": {
                "type": "script-and-regex",
                "script-and-regex.script": "yamllint",
                "script-and-regex.regex": "/^(?P<line>\\d+):(?P<offset>\\d+) +(?P<severity>warning|error) +(?P<message>.*) +\\((?P<name>.*)\\)$/m",
                "include": "(\\.(yml|yaml)$)"
              }
            }
          }

   Character Encoding
       When yamllint reads a file (whether its a configuration file or a file to lint), yamllint will try to automatically detect that file’s character encoding. In order for the automatic  detection  to
       work properly, files must follow these two rules (see this section of the YAML specification for details):

       • The file must be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32.

       • The file must begin with either a byte order mark or an ASCII character.

   Override character encoding
       Previous  versions  of yamllint did not try to autodetect the character encoding of files. Previous versions of yamllint assumed that files used the current locale’s character encoding. This meant
       that older versions of yamllint would sometimes correctly decode files that didn’t follow those two rules. For the sake of backwards compatibility, the current version of yamllint  allows  you  to
       disable  automatic  character  encoding  detection  by setting the YAMLLINT_FILE_ENCODING environment variable. If you set the YAMLLINT_FILE_ENCODING environment variable to the the name of one of
       Python’s standard character encodings, then yamllint will use that character encoding instead of trying to autodetect the character encoding.

       The YAMLLINT_FILE_ENCODING environment variable should only be used as a stopgap solution. If you need to use YAMLLINT_FILE_ENCODING, then you should really update your YAML files  so  that  their
       character  encoding can automatically be detected, or else you may run into compatibility problems.  Future versions of yamllint may remove support for the YAMLLINT_FILE_ENCODING environment vari‐
       able, and other YAML processors may misinterpret your YAML files.
