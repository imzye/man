NAME
       Test2::Util::UUID - Utils for generating UUIDs under Test2.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a consistent UUID source for all of Test2.

SYNOPSIS
           use Test2::Util::UUID qw/gen_uuid looks_like_uuid uuid2bin bin2uuid/;

           my $uuid = gen_uuid;

           my $bin = bin2uuid($uuid);

           my $uuid_again = uuid2bin($uuid);

UNDER THE HOOD
       One of the following modules will be used under the hood, they are listed here in order of preference.

       UUID >= 0.35
           When  possible  this  module  will  use the UUID cpan module, but it must be version 0.35 or greater to avoid a fork related bug. It will generate version 7 UUIDs as they are most suitible for
           database entry.

       Data::UUID::MT
           Data::UUID::MT is the second choice for UUID generation. With this module version 4 UUIDs are generated as they are fairly usable in databases.

       UUID::Tiny - slow
           UUID::Tiny is used if the previous 2 are not available. This module is pure perl and thus could be slower than the others. Version 4 UUIDs are generated when this module is used.

           A warning will be issued with this module. You can surpress the warning with either the $TEST2_UUID_NO_WARN environment variable or the "warn => 0" import argument.

       Data::UUID - Not Suitible for Databases
           This is the last resort module. This generates UUIDs fast, but they are of a type/version that is not suitible for database keys.

           A warning will be issued with this module. You can surpress the warning with either the $TEST2_UUID_NO_WARN environment variable or the "warn => 0" import argument.

   CONTROLLING WARNINGS
       AT IMPORT

           use Test2::Util::UUID 'gen_uuid', warn => 0;

       Passing in "warn => 0" will disable the warnings normally issued when using UUID::Tiny or Data::UUID as a backend.

   SELECTING A BACKEND
       AT IMPORT

       If you wish to override the order and specify which backend to use you may do so by listing them during import prefixed with ':'.

           use Test2::Util::UUID 'gen_uuid', backends => [':UUID', ':UUID::Tiny'];

       The above will try the UUID module first, followed by the UUID::Tiny module. It will not try Data::UUID::MT or Data::UUID.

       Note: You must include these import arguments anywhere you import this module, otherwise the other imports will use the default list, resulting in different places using different UUIDs.

       THE $TEST2_UUID_BACKEND ENV VAR

       Setting the $TEST2_UUID_BACKEND env var to one of the backends, or a comma seperated list will override the default list for all imports. It will NOT override imports that specify their own lists.

EXPORTS
       $uuid = gen_uuid()
           Generate a UUID, always normalized to upper case.

       $uuid_or_undef = looks_like_uuid($UUID)
           Checks if the provided value looks like a UUID. Make sure it is defined, 36 characters long, has dashes, and only contains 0-9 a-f and dash (case insensitive).

           Returns the input value if it looks like a UUID, otherise it returns undef.
