       Class::C3::next - Pure-perl next::method and friends

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used internally by Class::C3 when necessary, and shouldn't be used (or required in distribution dependencies) directly.  It defines "next::method", "next::can", and
       "maybe::next::method" in pure perl.
