DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents Therion and provides an overview of the package.

       Therion is a program that processes Therion data files to produce cave surveys. The data files are usually .th files which contain survey data (largely equivalent to Survex .svx files), .th2 files
       which contain drawing data, and thconfig files which control the data files to be used and the maps to be output.

       Therion outputs PDF and SVG files for drawings, Survex .3d files, Compass .PLT files and VRML files for 3D models.

       Therion uses a number of helper programs to do its job. Survex is used to process the centreline data, MetaPost is used to draw cave symbols, and pdfTeX generates the final maps.

       In  order  to  make  the entering of drawing data practical, and to make the editing of survey files easier, a graphical editor XTherion is included. This also includes a 'compiler' function which
       runs Therion on the data to produce output. This is implemented using Tcl/Tk.

       The Therion data files describe the cave as text in terms of objects so the corresponding graphical representations are only inserted at output generation time. This means that  a  survey  can  be
       produced using whichever symbol set you require by specifying the relevant set of MetaPost macros. Currently the UIS symbol set is supported.

       Multiple languages and character sets are supported — currently ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-7, UTF-8, ASCII and CP1250.

ARGUMENTS
       therion  takes  only  one argument — a config-file. If no file is specified then the default thconfig file in the current directory will be used. A new default file can be created using the -g op‐
       tion.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ("--").  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete  description,  see  The  Therion
       Book.

       -h, --help
                 Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
                 Show version information.

       -q        Quiet mode — minimise output.

       -g        Generate a new configuration file. This will be the given config-file if specified, or thconfig in the current directory if not. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

       -i        Ignore comments when writing (-g|-u) configuration file.

       -L        Do not create a log-file. Normally all messages are written into a therion.log file.

       -l log-file
                 Change the name of the log file.

       -p search-path
                 This option is used to set the search path (or list of paths, separated by colon), which therion will use to find its source files (if it doesn't find them in the working directory).

       -q        Run therion in quiet mode. It will print only warning and error messages (to STDERR).

       --print-encodings
                 Print a list of all supported encodings.

       --print-init-file
                 Print a default initialisation file. For more details see the Initialisation section in the Appendix of the Therion Book.

       -s        Set the name of the source file.

       -u        Upgrade the configuration file.

       -d        Turn on debugging mode. The current implementation creates a temporary directory named thTMPDIR (in your system temporary directory) and does not delete any temporary files.
