NAME
       oggSplit - demultiplexes ogv files

SYNOPSIS
       oggSplit file.ogv

DESCRIPTION
       oggSplit demultiplexes a multiplexed ogg file into several files with one stream each.

       An  ogg  video  file (with extension .ogv) usually consist of an audio and a video stream. The command line tool oggSplit disjoins these streams into separate files. This is also often called demulti‐
       plexing.

       After that you have all embedded files of this input file with the following naming:

       theora_<ID>.ogv: This is the video stream encoded with the theora codec. The <ID> is the stream ID that is created by the encoder to uniquely identify this stream.

       vorbis_<ID>.oga: This is the audio stream encoded with the vorbis codec. The <ID> is the stream ID that is created by the encoder to uniquely identify this stream.

       unknown_<ID>.ogv: This is an unknown stream, that could not be interpreted. The <ID> is the stream ID that is created by the encoder to uniquely identify this stream.

       All files are fully playable with your favoured video or audio player (except the streams, that are uninterpreted).
