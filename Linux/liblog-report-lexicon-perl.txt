Log::Report::Lexicon::Table(3pm)                                                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                    Log::Report::Lexicon::Table(3pm)

NAME
       Log::Report::Lexicon::Table - generic interface to translation tables

INHERITANCE
        Log::Report::Lexicon::Table is extended by
          Log::Report::Lexicon::MOTcompact
          Log::Report::Lexicon::POT
          Log::Report::Lexicon::POTcompact

SYNOPSIS
         # use one of the extensions, for instance:
         my $pot = Log::Report::Lexicon::POT->read('po/nl.po', charset => 'utf-8')
                or panic;

DESCRIPTION
       This base class defines the generic interface for translation tables.

       Currently, there are three extensions:

       •   Log::Report::Lexicon::POT

           This is a relatively heavy implementation, used to read but also to write PO files.  It is used by xgettext-perl, for instance, to administer the collection of discovered msgid's.

       •   Log::Report::Lexicon::POTcompact

           Light-weighted read-only access to PO-file information.

       •   Log::Report::Lexicon::MOTcompact

           Read-only access to MO-file information.  These binary MO-files are super efficient.

METHODS
   Constructors
       $class->new(%options)

   Attributes
   Managing PO's
       Translation

       $obj->msgid( STRING, [$msgctxt] )
           Lookup the Log::Report::Lexicon::PO with the "STRING".  Returns "undef" when not defined.

       $obj->msgstr( $msgid, [$count, $msgctxt] )
           Returns the translated string for $msgid.  When not specified, $count is 1.

       Administration

       $obj->add($po)
           Add the information from a $po into this POT.  If the msgid of the $po is already known, that is an error.

       $obj->header($field)
           The translation of a blank MSGID is used to store a MIME header, which contains some meta-data.  The $field value is looked-up (case-insensitive) and returned.

       $obj->nrPlurals()
           Returns the number of plurals, when not known then '2'.

       $obj->pluralIndex($count)
           Returns the msgstr index used to translate a value of $count.

       $obj->setupPluralAlgorithm()
           This  method  needs  to  be called after setting (reading or creating) a new table header, to interpret the plural algorithm as specified in the "Plural-Forms" header field.  [1.09] The header
           field is not required when not used.

           A full list of plural forms per language can be found at <https://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/localization-guide/en/latest/l10n/pluralforms.html>

       $obj->translations( [$active] )
           Returns a list with all defined Log::Report::Lexicon::PO objects. When the string $active is given as parameter, only objects which have references are returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Error: invalid plural-form algorithm '$alg'
           Cast by setupPluralAlgorithm()

       Error: only acceptable parameter is 'ACTIVE'
           Cast by translations()

       Error: there is no Plural-Forms field in the header, but needed
           Cast by pluralIndex()
