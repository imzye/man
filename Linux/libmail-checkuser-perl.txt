NAME
       cufilter - Filter emails through Mail::CheckUser

SYNOPSIS
       Add the following lines to your ~/.procmailrc:

         # Filter mail through Mail::CheckUser
         :0f
         | /usr/bin/cufilter

DESCRIPTION
       When email messages are filtered through this program using the procmail settings as outlined in the SYNOPSYS, the email address in the "From:" header is passed through Mail::CheckUser to ensure
       validity.  If there is a problem with the email address, the "Subject:" header is modified to show which email address failed along with the failure reason.  No messages are lost, but it provides
       an easy way for the mail client to organize, sort, or filter based on the subject tweaks.

EXAMPLES
       Lets say a spammer sends a message with the following headers:

         From: god@heaven.org
         To: you@host.com
         Subject: Happy Pill

       Then the new headers might change to the following:

         From: god@heaven.org
         To: you@host.com
         Subject: [CU!god@heaven.org!DNS failure: SERVFAIL] Happy Pill

       This makes it easy to filter for mail clients.

INSTALL
       This file can be installed into /usr/bin/cufilter and is intended to be utilized through the procmail functionality by adding the following lines to your ~/.procmailrc configuration.

         # Filter mail through Mail::CheckUser
         :0f
         | /usr/bin/cufilter
