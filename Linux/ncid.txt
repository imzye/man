DESCRIPTION
       The  ncid client displays Caller ID information sent to it by the NCID server.  In the default GUI mode, if the server is configured to send the Call Log, it will load the call log in the call history
       window at startup.  The history window is then updated by ncid whenever a call is received.

       The size of the client window at startup is controlled by the the ncid.conf file.  The user can resize the window, but there is a minimum size restriction.

       The history window displays one line per call or message.  Each line starts with a line label.  Under Help->Line Labels you can read about each one.

       The view window shows all Line Types that can appear in the history window.  The view window also shows all LineIDS that do appear in the history window.  The view  menu  can  select  Line  Types  and
       LineIDS for viewing.  Those not selected have a horizontal line through them.

       The message window will send a user typed single line message to the server which, in turn, will send it to all connected clients.

       The ncid client supports three themes:

              Day:      Color theme on a white background.
              Night:    Color theme on a black background.
              Default:  Black and white theme.

       The ncid client runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.  If ncid is given the --no-gui option, it will run without a GUI.

       If  ncid is given the --module <module name> option, it will output to either an external program or output module.  The ncid client can be configured to call any single module.  It cannot call multi‐
       ple modules, but multiple clients can be used, each calling a different output module.

       If ncid is configured to output to an external program, it will test for it and if it is not found, or if it is not executable, it will terminate with an error message.

       The default configuration file for ncid is /etc/ncid/ncid.conf.

       The distributed output modules are listed in the ncid_modules man page.  They are customized as needed in the /etc/ncid/conf.d/ncid-<module name>.conf files.

       Whenever the server connection is broken, ncid will normally try to reconnect every 15 seconds.  It provides a visual indication of the countdown and number of tries.  If the delay between attempts is
       set to zero seconds, ncid will not attempt a reconnect.

OPTIONS
       --no-gui
              Do not display CID information using a GUI.

              Default: display CID using a GUI.

       --alt-date | -A
              Display the date in an alternate format.  Assuming the date separator is a "/", the date is displayed as dd/mm/yyyy.

              Default: display the date as mm/dd/yyyy

       --call-log | -c
              Configure ncid to tell the server to send the call log.  Only used in the NoGUI mode.

              Default: The call log is not sent.

       --delay <seconds> | -D <seconds>
              If <seconds> > 0, delay <seconds> between server connection attempts.
              If <seconds> = 0, only one attempt to reconnect to server will be made.

              Default: 15 seconds

       --help | -h
              Display usage.

       --hostname-flag | -H
              Changes the LINE field to <hostname>:ncid for created messages and adds <hostname> to the IDENT string

              Default LINE field: ncid.

       --module <module name> | -m <module name>
              Output the Caller ID information to the external program or output module.  <module name> is the name of the output module (program) to use.  The selected module is sent all calls and messages.

              Default module PATH: /usr/share/ncid/modules

       --noexit | -X
              Configure ncid to ignore the close window button.

       --pidfile | -p
              Name  of PID file to create.  Set to /var/run/ncid.pid in an rc or init script when used as a service.  Set to /var/run/<module name>.pid in an rc or init script when used as a service and when
              using a output module.  There is no default.  If pidfile is not set, no pid file will be used.

       --PopupTime <seconds> | -t <seconds>
              Time the popup is forced to stay on top of all windows.  Range is 1 second to 5 seconds, or 0 to disable.

              Default popup time is 1 second.

       --ring <count> | -r <count>
              Execute output module on specific ring count.
              All count values: -9 -3 -2 -1 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

              For modems that indicate RING, count can be: -9 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
              A count of -9 executes the output module on each ring.
              A count of 0 executes the output module when ringing stops.
              A count of 1 should never be used in the US/Canada, because Caller ID is sent between rings 1 and 2.
              A count between 2-9 executes the output module on that ring number.
              A count greater than 9 is not useful.

              For VoIP, using a SIP gateway, count is: -3 -2 -1
              For POTS, using a wc2ncid gateway, count is: -2 -1
              A count of -1 executes the output module on call termination without pickup.
              A count of -2 executes the output module on call termination after pickup.
              A count of -3 executes the output module on line busy termination.

              Default: output module called as soon as CID received

       --verbose | -v
              Display formatted CID information, including CID log file.

              Default: silent

       --version | -V
              Display version and exit.

       --wakeup | -W
              Works only on X-Windows and Gnome. On the first ring, this causes module ncid-wakeup to be executed to wake the monitor and/or exit the screensaver.  Do not use with the "--module | -m" option.

ARGUMENTS
       IP_ADDRESS | HOSTNAME         Set the IP Address.

                                     Default: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

       PORT_NUMBER                   Set the port number.

                                     Default: 3333
