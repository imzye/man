NAME
       rubberband — an audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting utility program

SYNOPSIS
       rubberband [options]  [input file]  [output file]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rubberband command.

       Rubber Band is a program that permits you to change the tempo and pitch of an audio recording independently of one another.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`--').  A summary of options is included below.

       You must specify at least one of the following time and pitch ratio options.

       -t, --time X
                 Stretch to X times original duration, or

       -T, --tempo X
                 Change tempo by multiple X (equivalent to --time 1/X), or

       -T, --tempo X:Y
                 Change tempo from X to Y (same as --time X/Y), or

       -D, --duration X
                 Stretch or squash to make output file X seconds long

       -p, --pitch X
                 Raise pitch by X semitones, or

       -f, --frequency X
                 Change frequency by multiple X

       The following options provide ways of making the time and frequency ratios change during the audio:

       -M, --timemap F
                 Use file F as the source for time map

       A  time  map (or key-frame map) file contains a series of lines, each with two sample frame numbers separated by a single space. These are source and target frames for fixed time points within the
       audio data, defining a varying stretch factor through the audio. When supplying a time map you must specify an overall stretch factor using -t, -T, or -D as well, to determine the total output du‐
       ration.

           --pitchmap F
                 Use file F as the source for pitch map

       A pitch map file contains a series of lines, each with two values: the input sample frame number and a pitch offset in semitones, separated by a single space. These specify a varying pitch  factor
       through  the audio. The offsets are all relative to an initial offset specified by the pitch or frequency option, or relative to no shift if neither was specified. Offsets are not cumulative. This
       option implies realtime mode (-R) and also enables a high-consistency pitch shifting mode, appropriate for dynamic pitch changes.  Because of the use of realtime mode, the  overall  duration  will
       not be exact.

           --freqmap F
                 Use file F as the source for freq map

       A frequency map file is like a pitch map, except that its second column lists frequency multipliers rather than pitch offsets (like the difference between pitch and frequency options above)

       The following options affect the sound manipulation and quality

       -2, --fast
                 Use the R2 (faster) engine

       This is the default (for backward compatibility) when this tool is invoked as "rubberband". It was the only engine available in versions prior to v3.0.

       -3, --fine
                 Use the R3 (finer) engine

       This is the default when this tool is invoked as "rubberband-r3". It almost always produces better results than the R2 engine, but with significantly higher CPU load.

       -F, --formant
                 Enable formant preservation when pitch shifting

       This option attempts to keep the formant envelope unchanged when changing the pitch, retaining the original timbre of vocals and instruments in a recognisable way.

       -c, --crisp N
                 Crispness (N = 0,1,2,3,4,5); default 4 (see below)

       This option only has an effect when using the R2 (faster) engine. See below for details of the different levels.

       The remaining options fine-tune the processing mode and stretch algorithm.  The default is to use none of these options.  The options marked (2) currently only have an effect when using the R2 en‐
       gine (see -2, -3 options above).

       -R, --realtime
                 Select realtime mode (implies --no-threads).  This utility does not do realtime stream processing; the option merely selects realtime mode for the stretcher it uses

       --no-threads
                 No extra threads regardless of CPU and channel count (R2)

       --threads Assume multi-CPU even if only one CPU is identified (R2)

       --no-transients
                 Disable phase resynchronisation at transients (R2)

       --bl-transients
                 Band-limit phase resync to extreme frequencies (R2)

       --no-lamination
                 Disable phase lamination (R2)

       --smoothing
                 Apply window presum and time-domain smoothing (R2)

       --detector-perc
                 Use percussive transient detector (as in pre-1.5) (R2)

       --detector-soft
                 Use soft transient detector (R2)

       --window-long
                 Use longer processing window (actual size may vary) (R2)

       --window-short
                 Use shorter processing window (with the R3 engine this is effectively a quick "draft mode")

       --pitch-hq
                 In RT mode, use a slower, higher quality pitch shift

       --centre-focus
                 reserve focus of centre material in stereo (at a cost in width and individual channel quality)

       --ignore-clipping
                 Ignore clipping at output; the default is to restart with reduced gain if clipping occurs

       -L, --loose
                 [Accepted for compatibility but ignored; always off]

       -P, ---precise
                 [Accepted for compatibility but ignored; always on]

       -d, --debug N
                 Select debug level (N = 0,1,2,3); default 0, full 3 (N.B. debug level 3 includes audible ticks in output)

       The following options are for output control and administration:

       -q, --quiet
                 Suppress progress output

       -V, --version
                 Show version number and exit

       -h, --help
                 Show the normal help output

       -H, --full-help
                 Show the full help output

       "Crispness" levels:

       0         equivalent to --no-transients --no-lamination --window-long

       1         equivalent to --detector-soft --no-lamination --window-long (for piano)

       2         equivalent to --no-transients --no-lamination

       3         equivalent to --no-transients

       4         equivalent to --bl-transients

       5         default processing options

       6         equivalent to --no-lamination --window-short (may be good for drums)
