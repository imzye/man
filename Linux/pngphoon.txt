NAME
       pngphoon — Creates a png file with the current phase of the moon

SYNOPSIS
       pngphoon [-w width]  [-h height]  [-f filename]  [-x moons_in_x]  [-y moons_in_y]  [-F foreground_color]  [-B background_color]  [-s density]  [-b]  [-S]  [-q]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pngphoon command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       pngphoon  is a program that creates a PNG image of the current phase of the moon. It is a successor to xphoon but does not write to the root window, but to a file.  You can use it with window man‐
       agers that accept commands for their background image settings.  It is pronounced "pingphoon" (like "typhoon").

OPTIONS
       This program takes the following options.

       -h        Mandatory. Gives the image height. The image must be at least 760px high to be able to contain the moon. If the image is smaller only the stars will be plotted.

       -w        Mandatory. Gives the image width. The image must be at least 760px wide to be able to contain the moon. If the image is smaller only the stars will be plotted.

       -f        Mandatory. File name the PNG image shall be written to, for output to stdout use - instead of a filename

       -x        Number of moons in x axis (for multihead configurations)

       -y        Number of moons in y axis (for multihead configurations)

       -s        Star density

       -b        Black (no earthlight)

       -S        Southern hemisphere (rotate image 180 degrees)

       -q        Quiet (disable warnings)
