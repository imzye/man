NAME
       qemu-ga-ref - QEMU Guest Agent Protocol Reference

       This manual describes the commands supported by the QEMU Guest Agent Protocol.

       For locating  a particular item, please see the QGA Index.

       The following notation is used in examples:

          Example:

              -> ... text sent by client (commands) ...
              <- ... text sent by server (command responses and events) ...

       Example text is formatted for readability.  However, in real protocol usage, its commonly emitted as a single line.

       Please refer to the QEMU Machine Protocol Specification for the general format of commands, responses, and events.

       Command guest-sync-delimited (Since: 1.1)
              Echo back a unique integer value, and prepend to response a leading sentinel byte (0xFF) the client can check scan for.

              This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale data from previous client.  It must be issued upon initial connec‐
              tion, and after any client-side timeouts (including timeouts on receiving a response to this command).

              After  issuing  this request, all guest agent responses should be ignored until the response containing the unique integer value the client passed in is returned.  Receival of the 0xFF sen‐
              tinel byte must be handled as an indication that the client's lexer/tokenizer/parser state should be flushed/reset in preparation for reliably receiving the subsequent response.  As an  op‐
              timization, clients may opt to ignore all data until a sentinel value is receiving to avoid unnecessary processing of stale data.

              Similarly, clients should also precede this request with a 0xFF byte to make sure the guest agent flushes any partially read JSON data from a previous client connection.

              Arguments

                     • id (int) -- randomly generated 64-bit integer

              Return int -- The unique integer id passed in by the client

       Command guest-sync (Since: 0.15.0)
              Echo back a unique integer value

              This  is  used  by clients talking to the guest agent over the wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale data from previous client.  All guest agent responses should be
              ignored until the provided unique integer value is returned, and it is up to the client to handle stale whole or partially-delivered JSON text in such a way that this response  can  be  ob‐
              tained.

              In  cases  where  a  partial  stale  response was previously received by the client, this cannot always be done reliably.  One particular scenario being if qemu-ga responses are fed charac‐
              ter-by-character into a JSON parser.  In these situations, using guest-sync-delimited may be optimal.

              For clients that fetch responses line by line and convert them to JSON objects, guest-sync should be sufficient, but note that in cases where the channel is dirty some attempts  at  parsing
              the response may result in a parser error.

              Such clients should also precede this command with a 0xFF byte to make sure the guest agent flushes any partially read JSON data from a previous session.

              Arguments

                     • id (int) -- randomly generated 64-bit integer

              Return int -- The unique integer id passed in by the client

       Command guest-ping (Since: 0.15.0)
              Ping the guest agent, a non-error return implies success

       Command guest-get-time (Since: 1.5)
              Get the information about guest's System Time relative to the Epoch of 1970-01-01 in UTC.

              Return int -- Time in nanoseconds.

       Command guest-set-time (Since: 1.5)
              Set guest time.

              When  a guest is paused or migrated to a file then loaded from that file, the guest OS has no idea that there was a big gap in the time.  Depending on how long the gap was, NTP might not be
              able to resynchronize the guest.

              This command tries to set guest's System Time to the given value, then sets the Hardware Clock (RTC) to the current System Time.  This will make it easier for a guest to resynchronize with‐
              out waiting for NTP. If no time is specified, then the time to set is read from RTC. However, this may not be supported on all platforms (i.e.  Windows). If that's the case  users  are  ad‐
              vised to always pass a value.

              Arguments

                     • time (int, optional) -- time of nanoseconds, relative to the Epoch of 1970-01-01 in UTC.

              Arguments

                     • mode (string, optional) -- "halt", "powerdown" (default), or "reboot"

              This  command  does  NOT  return  a  response  on  success.   Success  condition  is  indicated by the VM exiting with a zero exit status or, when running with --no-shutdown, by issuing the
              query-status QMP command to confirm the VM status is "shutdown".

       Command guest-file-open (Since: 0.15.0)
              Open a file in the guest and retrieve a file handle for it

              Arguments

       Object GuestFileRead (Since: 0.15.0)
              Result of guest agent file-read operation

              Members

                     • count (int) -- number of bytes read (note: count is before base64-encoding is applied)

                     • eof (boolean) -- whether EOF was encountered during read operation.

       Command guest-file-read (Since: 0.15.0)
              Read from an open file in the guest.  Data will be base64-encoded.  As this command is just for limited, ad-hoc debugging, such as log file access, the number of bytes to read is limited to
              48 MB.

              Arguments

                     • handle (int) -- filehandle returned by guest-file-open

                     • count (int, optional) -- maximum number of bytes to read (default is 4KB, maximum is 48MB)

              Return GuestFileRead

       Object GuestFileWrite (Since: 0.15.0)
              Result of guest agent file-write operation

              Members

                     • count (int) -- number of bytes written (note: count is actual bytes written, after base64-decoding of provided buffer)

                     • eof (boolean) -- whether EOF was encountered during write operation.

       Command guest-file-write (Since: 0.15.0)
              Write to an open file in the guest.

              Arguments

                     • handle (int) -- filehandle returned by guest-file-open

                     • buf-b64 (string) -- base64-encoded string representing data to be written

                     • count (int, optional) -- bytes to write (actual bytes, after base64-decode), default is all content in buf-b64 buffer after base64 decoding

              Return GuestFileWrite

       Object GuestFileSeek (Since: 0.15.0)
              Result of guest agent file-seek operation

              Members

                     • position (int) -- current file position

                     • eof (boolean) -- whether EOF was encountered during file seek

       Enum QGASeek (Since: 2.6)
              Symbolic names for use in guest-file-seek

              Values

                     • set -- Set to the specified offset (same effect as 'whence':0)

                     • cur -- Add offset to the current location (same effect as 'whence':1)

                     • end -- Add offset to the end of the file (same effect as 'whence':2)

       Alternate GuestFileWhence (Since: 2.6)
              Controls the meaning of offset to guest-file-seek.

              Alternatives

                     • value (int) -- Integral value (0 for set, 1 for cur, 2 for end), available for historical reasons, and might differ from the host's or guest's SEEK_* values (since: 0.15)

                     • name (QGASeek) -- Symbolic name, and preferred interface

       Command guest-file-seek (Since: 0.15.0)
              Seek to a position in the file, as with fseek(), and return the current file position afterward.  Also encapsulates ftell()'s functionality, with offset=0 and whence=1.

              Arguments

                     • handle (int) -- filehandle returned by guest-file-open

                     • offset (int) -- bytes to skip over in the file stream

       Command guest-file-flush (Since: 0.15.0)
              Write file changes buffered in userspace to disk/kernel buffers

              Arguments

                     • handle (int) -- filehandle returned by guest-file-open

       Enum GuestFsfreezeStatus (Since: 0.15.0)
              Availability: CONFIG_WIN32 or CONFIG_FSFREEZE

              An enumeration of filesystem freeze states

              Values

                     • thawed -- filesystems thawed/unfrozen

                     • frozen -- all non-network guest filesystems frozen

       Command guest-fsfreeze-status (Since: 0.15.0)
              Availability: CONFIG_WIN32 or CONFIG_FSFREEZE

              Get guest fsfreeze state.

              NOTE:
                 This may fail to properly report the current state as a result of some other guest processes having issued an fs freeze/thaw.

              Return GuestFsfreezeStatus

       Command guest-fsfreeze-freeze (Since: 0.15.0)
              Availability: CONFIG_WIN32 or CONFIG_FSFREEZE

              Sync and freeze all freezable, local guest filesystems.  If this command succeeded, you may call guest-fsfreeze-thaw later to unfreeze.

              On error, all filesystems will be thawed.  If no filesystems are frozen as a result of this call, then guest-fsfreeze-status will remain "thawed" and calling guest-fsfreeze-thaw is not nec‐
              essary.

              Return int -- Number of file systems currently frozen.

              NOTE:
                 On Windows, the command is implemented with the help of a Volume Shadow-copy Service DLL helper.  The frozen state is limited for up to 10 seconds by VSS.

       Command guest-fsfreeze-freeze-list (Since: 2.2)
              Availability: CONFIG_WIN32 or CONFIG_FSFREEZE

              Sync and freeze specified guest filesystems.  See also guest-fsfreeze-freeze.

              On error, all filesystems will be thawed.

              Arguments

                     • mountpoints ([string], optional) -- an array of mountpoints of filesystems to be frozen.  If omitted, every mounted filesystem is frozen.  Invalid mount points are ignored.

              Return int -- Number of file systems currently frozen.

       Command guest-fsfreeze-thaw (Since: 0.15.0)
              Availability: CONFIG_WIN32 or CONFIG_FSFREEZE

              Unfreeze all frozen guest filesystems

              Return int -- Number of file systems thawed by this call

              NOTE:
                 If the return value does not match the previous call to guest-fsfreeze-freeze, this likely means some freezable filesystems were unfrozen before this call, and that the filesystem  state
                 may have changed before issuing this command.

       Object GuestFilesystemTrimResult (Since: 2.4)
              Availability: CONFIG_WIN32 or CONFIG_FSTRIM.INDENT 7.0

       Members

              • path (string) -- path that was trimmed

              • error (string, optional) -- an error message when trim failed

              • trimmed (int, optional) -- bytes trimmed for this path

              • minimum (int, optional) -- reported effective minimum for this path

       Object GuestFilesystemTrimResponse (Since: 2.4)
              Availability: CONFIG_WIN32 or CONFIG_FSTRIM.INDENT 7.0

       Members

              • paths ([GuestFilesystemTrimResult]) -- list of GuestFilesystemTrimResult per path that was trimmed

       Command guest-fstrim (Since: 1.2)
              Availability: CONFIG_WIN32 or CONFIG_FSTRIM

              Discard (or "trim") blocks which are not in use by the filesystem.

              Arguments

                     • minimum  (int, optional) -- Minimum contiguous free range to discard, in bytes.  Free ranges smaller than this may be ignored (this is a hint and the guest may not respect it).  By
                       increasing this value, the fstrim operation will complete more quickly for filesystems with badly fragmented free space, although not all blocks will  be  discarded.   The  default
                       value is zero, meaning "discard every free block".

              Return GuestFilesystemTrimResponse -- status of all trimmed paths.  (since 2.4)

       Command guest-suspend-disk (Since: 1.1)
              Availability: CONFIG_LINUX or CONFIG_WIN32

              Suspend guest to disk.

              This command attempts to suspend the guest using three strategies, in this order:

              • systemd hibernate

              • pm-utils (via pm-hibernate)

              • manual write into sysfs

              This command does NOT return a response on success.  There is a high chance the command succeeded if the VM exits with a zero exit status or, when running with --no-shutdown, by issuing the
              query-status QMP command to to confirm the VM status is "shutdown". However, the VM could also exit (or set its status to "shutdown") due to other reasons.

              Errors

                     • If suspend to disk is not supported, Unsupported

              NOTE:
                 It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command before sending commands when the guest resumes.

       Command guest-suspend-ram (Since: 1.1)
              Availability: CONFIG_LINUX or CONFIG_WIN32

              Suspend guest to ram.

              This command attempts to suspend the guest using three strategies, in this order:

              • systemd hibernate

              • pm-utils (via pm-hibernate)

              • manual write into sysfs

              IMPORTANT:  guest-suspend-ram  requires  working wakeup support in QEMU. You should check QMP command query-current-machine returns wakeup-suspend-support: true before issuing this command.
              Failure in doing so can result in a suspended guest that QEMU will not be able to awaken, forcing the user to power cycle the guest to bring it back.

              This command does NOT return a response on success.  There are two options to check for success:

              1. Wait for the SUSPEND QMP event from QEMU

              2. Issue the query-status QMP command to confirm the VM status is "suspended"

              Errors

                     • If suspend to ram is not supported, Unsupported

              NOTE:
                 It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command before sending commands when the guest resumes.

       Command guest-suspend-hybrid (Since: 1.1)
              Availability: CONFIG_LINUX

              Save guest state to disk and suspend to ram.

              This command attempts to suspend the guest by executing, in this order:

              • systemd hybrid-sleep

              • pm-utils (via pm-suspend-hybrid)

              IMPORTANT: guest-suspend-hybrid requires working wakeup support in QEMU. You should check QMP command query-current-machine returns wakeup-suspend-support: true before issuing this command.
              Failure in doing so can result in a suspended guest that QEMU will not be able to awaken, forcing the user to power cycle the guest to bring it back.

              This command does NOT return a response on success.  There are two options to check for success:

              1. Wait for the SUSPEND QMP event from QEMU

              2. Issue the query-status QMP command to confirm the VM status is "suspended"

              Errors

                     • If hybrid suspend is not supported, Unsupported

              NOTE:
                 It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command before sending commands when the guest resumes.

       Command guest-get-vcpus (Since: 1.5)
              Availability: CONFIG_LINUX or CONFIG_WIN32

              Retrieve the list of the guest's logical processors.

              This is a read-only operation.

              Return [GuestLogicalProcessor] -- The list of all VCPUs the guest knows about.  Each VCPU is put on the list exactly once, but their order is unspecified.

       Command guest-set-vcpus (Since: 1.5)
              Availability: CONFIG_LINUX

              Attempt to reconfigure (currently: enable/disable) logical processors inside the guest.

              Arguments

                     • vcpus  ([GuestLogicalProcessor])  -- The logical processors to be reconfigured.  This list is processed node by node in order.  In each node logical-id is used to look up the guest
                       VCPU, for which online specifies the requested state.  The set of distinct logical-id's is only required to be a subset of the guest-supported identifiers.  There's no  restriction
                       on  list  length or on repeating the same logical-id (with possibly different online field).  Preferably the input list should describe a modified subset of guest-get-vcpus' return
                       value.

              Return int --

                     The length of the initial sublist that has been successfully processed.  The guest agent maximizes this value.  Possible cases:

                     • 0: if the vcpus list was empty on input.  Guest state has not been changed.  Otherwise,

                     • < length(vcpus): more than zero initial nodes have been processed, but not the entire vcpus list.  Guest state has changed accordingly.  To retrieve the  error  (assuming  it  per‐
                       sists), repeat the call with the successfully processed initial sublist removed.  Otherwise,

                     • length(vcpus): call successful.

              Errors

                     • If the reconfiguration of the first node in vcpus failed.  Guest state has not been changed.
