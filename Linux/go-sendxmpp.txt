NAME
       go-sendxmpp - A tool to send messages to an XMPP contact or MUC.

LOCATION
       The  account  data is expected at ~/.config/go-sendxmpp/config (preferred), ~/.config/go-sendxmpp/sendxmpprc (deprecated) or ~/.sendxmpprc (for compatibility with the original perl sendxmpp) if no
       other configuration file location is specified with -f or --file. The configuration file is expected to be in the following format:

FORMAT
       username: [your_jid]
       jserver: [jabber_server]
       port: [jabber_port]
       password: [your_jabber_password]
       eval_password: [command_to_unlock_your_password]
       alias: [your_alias]

REQUIRED SETTINGS
       If all necessary settings are supplied as command line arguments no config file is needed at all. Setting jserver and port might not be necessary depending on the used server.
       You should either use a password manager and the setting eval_password or add your password in plaintext to the config file with the setting password. Please be careful with eval_password  as  any
       command put there will be executed.
