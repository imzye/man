NAME
       claws-mail-address-keeper - keep outgoing addresses in address book

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-address-keeper package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page

       claws-mail-address-keeper is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       It allows saving typed outgoing addresses to address book automatically in case they are unknown, i.e., not already present in the address book.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named address_keeper.so, and press
       the “Open” button.

LIMITATIONS
       Messages have to be sent or saved for later sending for the address collection to work. Addresses will be saved regardless the success of the sending operation.

SEE ALSO
       claws-mail(1), claws-mail-extra-plugins(7).
