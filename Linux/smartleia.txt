NAME
       smartleia - Make LEIA board a generic smart card driver for PC/SC daemon

SYNPSIS
       smartleia

DESCRIPTION
       smartleia  connects to the local PC/SC daemon VPCD backend socket in order to connect the LEIA board to PC/SC.  All PC/SC clients can interact with the smart card connected to the LEIA board as if
       it is a real smartcard reader.

       The main difference here is that the smartleia Python API does not abtract the communication with the board over the usual USB CCID class device, but direclty transmit APDU to the board.

       Smartleia is using the Python3 smartleia library API, which give advanced control on the way communication is donne between the host and the smart card, including secure channel selection, and ne‐
       gotiation, etc.

OPTIONS
       none.
