SAMBA-TOOL(8)                                                                           System Administration tools                                                                           SAMBA-TOOL(8)

NAME
       samba-tool - Main Samba administration tool.

SYNOPSIS

       samba-tool [-h] [-W myworkgroup] [-U user] [-d debuglevel] [--v]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

OPTIONS
       Samba-tool consists of many sub-commands, each of which have their own set of options. The options listed in this section are common across several sub-commands.

       -h|--help
           Show a help message and exit.

       -r|--realm=REALM
           Set the realm for the domain.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the realm parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --simple-bind-dn=DN
           DN to use for a simple bind.

       --password
           Specify the password on the commandline.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           If --password is not specified, the tool will check the PASSWD environment variable, followed by PASSWD_FD which is expected to contain an open file descriptor (FD) number.

           Finally it will check PASSWD_FILE (containing a file path to be opened). The file should only contain the password. Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted
           users!

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a race.

       -U|--user=[DOMAIN\]USERNAME[%PASSWORD]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %PASSWORD is not specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the USER environment variable (which is also permitted to also contain the password separated by a %),
           then the LOGNAME variable (which is not permitted to contain a password) and if either exists, the value is used. If these environmental variables are not found, the username found in a
           Kerberos Credentials cache may be used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the
           credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the -A for more
           details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing user-supplied values onto the command line. For security it is better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed,
           or obtain the password once with kinit.

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process title (as seen in ps), this is after startup and so is subject to a race.

       -W|--workgroup=WORKGROUP
           Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in smb.conf. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the
           client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM).

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the workgroup parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the command line will be silently ignored and no password will be used.

       --use-kerberos=desired|required|off
           This parameter determines whether Samba client tools will try to authenticate using Kerberos. For Kerberos authentication you should use DNS names instead of IP addresses when connecting to a
           service. By default Samba client tools will try to use the default Kerberos credential cache (ccache). In case the ccache does not exist or -U|--user option was specified, clients will ask to
           enter a password and will obtain a Kerberos ticket (kinit) for you. If you want to use an alternative Kerberos credentical cache, use the --use-krb5-ccache option.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the client use kerberos parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --use-krb5-ccache=CCACHE
           Specifies the credential cache location for Kerberos authentication.

           This will enforce --use-kerberos=required.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the connection. The format of the file is:

                                   username = <value>
                                   password = <value>
                                   domain   = <value>

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users!

       -H URL, --URL=URL
           LDB URL for database or target server.

           The URL can either be a plain file path, or use one of the schemes listed here. If a plain path is used, it is treated as if 'tdb://' was used.

           tdb://PATH
               PATH is the location of a TDB database.

           mdb://PATH
               PATH is the location of an LMDB database.

           ldb://PATH
               PATH is the location of an LDB database, in either LMDB or TDB format. The formats will be tried one after another until one succeeds or all fail. It is safe to use this if you don't know
               the format of the file.

           ldap://HOSTNAME, ldaps://HOSTNAME
               The LDB backend is the named ldap server. ldaps:// wraps the connection in TLS.

           ldapi://SOCKET
               The backend server is a local ldap server using a unix domain socket.

       --color=always|never|auto
           use colour if available (default: auto)

       --ipaddress=IPADDRESS
           IP address of the server

       -s FILE, --configfile=FILE
           Use this smb.conf configuration file.

       --color=always|never|auto
           Indicate whether samba-tool should use ANSI colour codes in its output. If 'auto' (the default), samba-tool will use colour when its output is directed toward a terminal, unless the NO_COLOR
           environment variable is set and non-empty.

           The values 'yes' and 'force' are accepted as synonyms for 'always'; 'no' and 'none' for 'never'; and 'tty' and 'if-tty' for 'auto'.

           Note that asking for colour doesn't mean samba-tool will necessarily be very colourful. Many commands are very monochrome, particularly when successful.

       -V, --version
           Display the version number and exit.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 1 for client applications.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a
           reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE
           amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log level parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --debug-stdout
           This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients are logging to STDERR.

       -n, --dry-run
           Do not actually change anything, but show what would happen.

       --client-version=w2k|dotnet|longhorn

           Mark records older than the specified date as static.

       --mark-records-static-regex=REGEXP
           Mark records that match the given perl-compatible regular expression as static.

       --mark-records-dynamic-regex=REGEXP
           Mark records that match the given perl-compatible regular expression as dynamic.

       --aging=0|1
           --aging=1 to enable aging for this zone.

           --aging=0 to disable aging for this zone.

       --norefreshinterval=HOURS
           avoid further refreshes for this long after a dynamic update. Set to zero to use the default.

       --service-allowed-to-authenticate-from
           Conditions a device must meet for service accounts covered by this policy to be allowed to authenticate. While this is a restriction on the device, any conditional ACE rules are expressed as
           if the device was a user.

           Must be a valid SDDL string without reference to Device keywords.

           SDDL Example: O:SYG:SYD:(XA;OICI;CR;;;WD;(Member_of {SID(AU)}))

       --service-allowed-to-authenticate-to=SDDL
           This policy, applying to a service account (eg a Managed Service Account, Group Managed Service Account), restricts which accounts may access it.

           Must be a valid SDDL string. The SDDL can reference both bare (user) and Device conditions.

           SDDL Example: O:SYG:SYD:(XA;OICI;CR;;;WD;(Member_of {SID(AO)}))

   user addunixattrs username uid-number [options]
       Add RFC2307 attributes to a user.

       This command adds Unix attributes to a user account in the Active Directory domain.

       The username specified on the command is the sAMaccountName.

       You must supply a unique uid.

       Unix (RFC2307) attributes will be added to the user account.

       If you supply a group id with '--gid-number', this will be used for the users Unix 'gidNumber' attribute.

       If '--gid-number' is not supplied, the users Unix gidNumber will be set to the one found in 'Domain Users', this means Domain Users must have a gidNumber attribute.

       If '--unix-home' is not supplied, the users Unix home directory will be set to /home/DOMAIN/username.

       If '--login-shell' is not supplied, the users Unix login shell will be set to '/bin/sh'

       If ---gecos' is not supplied, the users Unix gecos field will be set to the user's 'CN' attribute.

       Add 'idmap_ldb:use rfc2307 = Yes' to the smb.conf on DCs to use these attributes for UID/GID mapping.

       The command may be run from the root userid or another authorised userid. The -H or --URL= option can be used to execute the command against a remote server.

       Example1:

           samba-tool user addunixattrs User1 10001

       Example1 shows how to add RFC2307 attributes to a domain enabled user account, Domain Users will be set as the users gidNumber.

       The users Unix ID will be set to '10001', provided this ID isn't already in use.

       Example2:

           samba-tool user addunixattrs User2 10002 --gid-number=10001 --unix-home=/home/User2

       Example2 shows how to add RFC2307 attributes to a domain enabled user account.

       The users Unix ID will be set to '10002', provided this ID isn't already in use.

       The users gidNumber attribute will be set to '10001'

       The users Unix home directory will be set to '/home/user2'

       Example3:

           samba-tool user addunixattrs User3 10003 --gid-number=10001 --login-shell=/bin/false --gecos='User3 test'

       Example3 shows how to add RFC2307 attributes to a domain enabled user account.

       The users Unix ID will be set to '10003', provided this ID isn't already in use. The users gidNumber attribute will be set to '10001'. The users Unix login shell will be set to '/bin/false'. The
       users gecos field will be set to 'User3 test'.

   vampire [options] domain
       Join and synchronise a remote AD domain to the local server. Please note that samba-tool vampire is deprecated, please use samba-tool domain join instead.

   visualize [options] subcommand
       Produce graphical representations of Samba network state. To work out what is happening in a replication graph, it is sometimes helpful to use visualisations.

       There are two subcommands, two graphical modes, and (roughly) two modes of operation with respect to the location of authority.

   MODES OF OPERATION
       samba-tool visualize ntdsconn
           Looks at NTDS connections.

       samba-tool visualize reps
           Looks at repsTo and repsFrom objects.

       samba-tool visualize uptodateness
           Looks at replication lag as shown by the uptodateness vectors.

   GRAPHICAL MODES
       --distance
           Distances between DCs are shown in a matrix in the terminal.

       --dot
           Generate Graphviz dot output (for ntdsconn and reps modes). When viewed using dot or xdot, this shows the network as a graph with DCs as vertices and connections edges. Certain types of
           degenerate edges are shown in different colours or line-styles.

       --xdot
           Generate Graphviz dot output as with [--dot] and attempt to view it immediately using /usr/bin/xdot.

       -r
           Normally, samba-tool talks to one database; with the [-r] option attempts are made to contact all the DCs known to the first database. This is necessary for samba-tool visualize uptodateness
           and for samba-tool visualize reps because the repsFrom/To objects are not replicated, and it can reveal replication issues in other modes.

   help
       Gives usage information.
