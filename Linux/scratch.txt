NAME
       Scratch - An easy to use interactive programming environment for ages 8 and up.

Description
       Scratch is an easy, interactive, collaborative programming environment designed for creation of interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art -- and sharing these on the web. Scratch

       while also gaining a deeper understanding of the process of design.  This man page contains  basic  information  about  Scratch.  For  additional  information,  see  the  Scratch  website  at
