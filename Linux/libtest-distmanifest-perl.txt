NAME
       Test::DistManifest - Author test that validates a package MANIFEST

VERSION
       version 1.014

SYNOPSIS
       This is the common idiom for author test modules like this, but see the full example in examples/checkmanifest.t and, more importantly, Adam Kennedy's article:
       <http://use.perl.org/use.perl.org/_Alias/journal/38822.html>

         use Test::More;
         eval 'use Test::DistManifest';
         if ($@) {
           plan skip_all => 'Test::DistManifest required to test MANIFEST';
         }

         manifest_ok('MANIFEST', 'MANIFEST.SKIP'); # Default options

         manifest_ok(); # Functionally equivalent to above

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple method of testing that a MANIFEST matches the distribution.

       It tests three things:

EXPORTS
       By default, this module exports the following functions:

       •   manifest_ok

       1.  Everything in MANIFEST exists

       2.  Everything in the package is listed in MANIFEST, or subsequently matches a regular expression mask in MANIFEST.SKIP

       3.  Nothing exists in MANIFEST that also matches a mask in MANIFEST.SKIP, so as to avoid an unsatisfiable dependency conditions

       If  there  is  no  MANIFEST.SKIP included in your distribution, this module will replicate the toolchain behaviour of using the default system-wide MANIFEST.SKIP file. To view the contents of this
       file, use the command:

         $ perldoc -m ExtUtils::MANIFEST.SKIP

FUNCTIONS
   manifest_ok
         manifest_ok( $manifest, $skipfile )

       This subroutine checks the manifest list contained in $manifest by using "Module::Manifest" to determine the list of files and then checking for the existence of all such files. Then, it checks if
       there are any files in the distribution that were not specified in the $manifest file but do not match any regular expressions provided in the $skipfile exclusion file.

       If your MANIFEST file is generated by a module installation toolchain system such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build or Module::Install, then you shouldn't have any problems with  these  files.
       It's just a helpful test to remind you to update these files, using:

         $ make manifest # For ExtUtils::MakeMaker
         $ ./Build manifest # For Module::Build

NON-FATAL ERRORS
       By default, errors in the MANIFEST or MANIFEST.SKIP files are treated as fatal, which really is the purpose of using "Test::DistManifest" as part of your author test suite.

       In  some  cases  this  is  not  desirable  behaviour, such as with the Debian Perl Group, which runs all tests - including author tests - as part of its module packaging process. This wreaks havoc
       because Debian adds its control files in "debian/" downstream, and that directory or its files are generally not in MANIFEST.SKIP.

       By setting the environment variable MANIFEST_WARN_ONLY to a true value, errors will be non-fatal - they show  up  as  diagnostic  messages  only,  but  all  tests  pass  from  the  perspective  of
       "Test::Harness".

       This can be used in a test script as:

         $ENV{MANIFEST_WARN_ONLY} = 1;

       or from other shell scripts as:

         export MANIFEST_WARN_ONLY=1

       Note that parsing errors in MANIFEST and circular dependencies will always be considered fatal. The author is not aware of any cases where other behaviour would be useful.

GUTS
       This module internally plans four tests:

       1.  MANIFEST can be parsed by "Module::Manifest"

       2.  Check  which  files  exist  in  the  distribution  directory that do not match an existing regular expression in MANIFEST.SKIP and not listed in the MANIFEST file. These files should either be
           excluded from the test by addition of a mask in MANIFEST.SKIP (in the case of temporary development or test files) or should be included in the MANIFEST.

       3.  Check which files are specified in MANIFEST but do not exist on the disk.  This usually occurs when one deletes a test or similar script from the distribution, or accidentally moves it.

       4.  Check which files are specified in both MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP.  This is clearly an unsatisfiable condition, since the file in question  cannot  be  expected  to  be  included  while  also
           simultaneously ignored.

       If you want to run tests on multiple different MANIFEST files, you can simply pass 'no_plan' to the import function, like so:

         use Test::DistManifest 'no_plan';

         # Multiple tests work properly now
         manifest_ok('MANIFEST', 'MANIFEST.SKIP');
         manifest_ok();
         manifest_ok('MANIFEST.OTHER', 'MANIFEST.SKIP');

       I doubt this will be useful to users of this module. However, this is used internally for testing and it might be helpful to you. You can also plan more tests, but keep in mind that the idea of "3
       internal tests" may change in the future.

       Example code:

         use Test::DistManifest tests => 5;
         manifest_ok(); # 4 tests
         ok(1, 'is 1 true?');

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       •   Thanks to Adam Kennedy for developing Module::Manifest, which provides much of the core functionality for these tests.

       •   Thanks to Apocalypse <apocal@cpan.org>, for helping me track down an obscure bug caused by circular dependencies: when files are expected by MANIFEST but explicitly skipped by MANIFEST.SKIP.

CAVEATS
       •   There is currently no way to test a MANIFEST/MANIFEST.SKIP without having the files actually exist on disk. I am planning for this to change in the future.

       •   This module has not been tested very thoroughly with Unicode.

       •   This  module  does  not  produce any useful diagnostic messages in terms of how to correct the situation. Hopefully this will be obvious for anybody using the module; the emphasis should be on
           generating helpful error messages.
