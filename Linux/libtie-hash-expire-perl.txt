NAME
       Tie::Hash::Expire - Hashes with keys that expire after a user-set period.

SYNOPSIS
         use Tie::Hash::Expire;

         my %test;
         tie %test, 'Tie::Hash::Expire', {'expire_seconds' => 10};

         $test{'dog'} = 'doghouse';
         sleep 5;
         $test{'bird'} = 'nest';
         sleep 6;

         print keys %test, "\n";       # The only key is 'bird'

         my %hi_res;
         tie %hi_res, 'Tie::Hash::Expire', {'expire_seconds' => 5.21};
               # Decimal number of seconds works if you have Time::HiRes

ABSTRACT
       Hashes tied to Tie::Hash::Expire have keys that cease to exist 'expire_seconds' after their most recent modification or their creation.

DESCRIPTION
       Hashes tied to Tie::Hash::Expire behave like normal hashes in all respects except that when a key is added or the value associated with a key is changed, the current time is stored, and after
       'expire_seconds' the key and value are removed from the hash.

       Resolutions finer than seconds are available if the module finds access to Time::HiRes.  If Time::HiRes is available, you can expect expiration to be accurate to 0.001 seconds.  You may specify
       'expire_seconds' to be decimal numbers like 5.12 .  If Time::HiRes is available, this number will be used precisely.  If you specify a decimal number and don't have access to Time::HiRes, a
       warning is generated and the code will function as though you specified the next higher integer.

       The number of seconds specified by 'expire_seconds' is taken to mean an absolute maximum lifespan for the key, at the resolution described above.  In other words, if you set 'expire_seconds' to 1
       second, and do not have Time::HiRes, keys could expire as quickly as the next machine instruction, but will not last longer than 1 second.
