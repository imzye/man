NAME
       barcode - a standalone program to convert text strings to printed bars

SYNOPSIS
       barcode [[-b - | string] | [-i - | input_file]] [-e encoding] [-o - | outfile] [ other-flags ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the barcode command as provided by barcode package.

       GNU  barcode  is a standalone program that converts text strings to printed bars.  It is able to read user supplied strings from the command line or a data file (standard input by default) and en‐
       code all of them.

OPTIONS
       barcode accepts the following options:

       --help or -h
              Print a usage summary and exit.

       -i <arg>
              Specify input file (strings to encode), default is stdin

       -o <arg>
              Specify output file, default is stdout

       -b <arg>
              Specify string to encode (use input file if missing)

       -e <arg>
              Specify encoding type (default is best fit for first string)

       -u <arg>
              Specify unit to be used ("mm", "in", ...).  This option is used to decode -g, -t and -p.

       -g <arg>
              Specify geometry on the page: [<wid>x<hei>][+<margin>+<margin>]

       -t <arg>
              Specify table geometry: <cols>x<lines>[+<margin>+<margin>]

       -m <arg>
              Specify internal margin for each item in a table: <xm>[,<ym>]

       -n     Be "numeric": avoid printing text along with the bars

       -c     no Checksum character, if the chosen encoding allows it

       -E     Print one code as eps file (default: multi-page ps)

       -S     Print one code as svg file (default: multi-page ps)

       -P     Create PCL output instead of postscript

       -p <arg>
              Specify page size. Please refer to texinfo doc for more information.

       -s     Use streaming mode. Please refer to texinfo doc for more information.

ENCODING TYPES
       The program encodes text strings passed either on the command line (with -b) or retrieved from standard input.  The text representation is interpreted according to certain rules. Please  refer  to
       texinfo doc as described below for detail introduction.

       To get a list of supported encoding type names, please call the program with "-h" option.
