NAME
       avlcpt - convert ArcView® Legend gradients to GMT colour palette tables

SYNOPSIS
       avlcpt [-b rgb] [-f rgb] [-h] [-l adjust] [-n rgb] [-o file]
              [-p precision] [-u adjust] [-v] [-V] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The avlcpt utility will extract a gradient from an ArcView Legend (avl)
       file and write it to the GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) cpt format. Note
       that not every avl file will contain a gradient, some just have
       patterns.

       The program will read from stdin if a file is not specified as the
       final argument, and write to stdout if the -o option is not specified.

OPTIONS
       In the following, all rgb specifications should be of the form
       red/green/blue where the colour components are integers in the range 0
       to 255.

       -b, --background rgb
           Set the background colour of the output.

       --backtrace-file path
           Specify a file to which to write a formatted backtrace. The file
           will only be created if there is a backtrace created, typically
           when an error occurs.

       --backtrace-format format
           Specify the format of the backtrace written to the files specified
           by --backtrace-file, one of plain, xml or json.

       -f, --foreground rgb
           Set the foreground colour of the output.

       -h, --help
           Brief help.

       -l, --lower adjust
           Decrease the lower limit on each segment by the specified amount.

       -n, --nan rgb
           Set the NaN (no data) colour of the output.

       -o, --output file
           Write the output to file, rather than stdout.

       -p, --precision precision
           Specify rounding. ArcView legends have a rather interesting
           approach to height specification whereby colour ranges might be
           0-49, 50-99, and so on. The cpt format requires that the end of one
           segment be at the same as the start of the next, so some rounding
           of the input will usually be required. The precision is specified
           directly rather than by number of digits, so that -p10 will round
           to the nearest 10 and so on.

       -u, --upper adjust
           Increase the upper limit on each segment by the specified amount.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose operation.

       -V, --version
           Version information.
