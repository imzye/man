NAME
       cscope-indexer - Script to index files for cscope

SYNOPSIS
       cscope-indexer [-v] [-f database_file] [-i list_file] [-l] [-r]

DESCRIPTION
       This  script  generates  a  list of files to index (cscope.out), which is then (optionally) used to generate a cscope database.  You can use this script to just build a list of files, or it can be
       used to build a list and database.  This script is not used to just build a database (skipping the list of files step), as this can be simply done by just calling "cscope -b".

       Normally, cscope will do its own indexing, but this script can be used to force indexing.  This is useful if you need to recurse into subdirectories, or have many files to index (you can run  this
       script  from a cron job, during the night).  It is especially useful for large projects, which can contstantly have source files added and deleted; by using this script, the changing sources files
       are automatically handled.

       Currently, any paths containing "/CVS/" or "/RCS/" are stripped out (ignored).

OPTIONS
       -f database_file
              Specifies the cscope database file (default: cscope.out).

       -i list_file
              Specifies the name of the file into which the list of files to index is placed (default: cscope.files).

       -l     Suppress the generation/updating of the cscope database file.  Only a list of files is generated.

       -r     Recurse into subdirectories to locate files to index.  Without this option, only the current directory is searched.

       -v     Be verbose.  Output simple progress messages.
