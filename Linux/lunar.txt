NAME
       lunar - a calendar conversion utility

SYNOPSIS
       lunar [-usthg5b]
       lunar [-usthg5b] year month day [hour]
       lunar [-usthg5b] -i [-l] year month day [hour]
       lunar --help

DESCRIPTION
       The lunar program performs date conversion between the Gregorian Solar Calendar (SC) and the Chinese Lunar Calendar (LC).  Given a date in either calendar, the program also outputs the correspond‐
       ing "shengxiao" (animal of the year) and "ganzhi" characters.  The date range currently covered is from about 1900 A.D. to 2049 A.D.

       For  the sake of convenience, we choose the convention such that the solar and lunar year numbers of the first day of a lunar year are the same.  For example, SC 1991.2.15 is LC 1991.1.1, while SC
       1991.2.14 is LC 1990.12.30.  Moreover, we choose the convention such that the solar and lunar hour numbers (in 24-hour clock) of a date are the same, although a lunar day starts at 23:00 of a  so‐
       lar day. This means that SC 1991.2.15.23 is LC 1991.1.2.23, while SC 1991.2.16.0 is LC 1991.1.2.0, and SC 1991.2.16.1 is LC 1991.1.2.1.

       The standard time of the Lunar Calendar is Beijing (Hong Kong) Standard Time, not GMT.  Be sure to adjust appropriately for other time zones and "Daylight Saving Time".

       In  the  Lunar  Calendar, a normal year has 12 months, and a leap year (run-nian) has 13 months, where the extra month is called a "leap month" (run-yue).  For example, the leap month that follows
       immediately the 6-th lunar month is called the 6-th leap month.  A (leap) month is either a short or long one, which has 29 or 30 days respectively.

       There are 10 gan's and 12 zhi's.  The ganzhi labeling of the year, month, day and hour of a date is a member of the Cartesian product GxGxGxG, where G = {1,2,...,60}.  For example, "jia-zi" is  1,
       "yi-chou" is 2, and so on.  The ganzhi of the j-th leap month is the same as that of the j-th month.

OPTIONS
       Since  lunar was first packaged for Debian in 2002, the Debian package maintainer has made minor additions such as Big5 and UTF-8 support.  More recently, lunar gained the ability to detect system
       locale and choose the correct character set.

       Lunar now also detects and displays the current China Standard Time by default, so that the year month day [hour] parameters are now optional for solar-to-lunar calendar conversion.

       The possible options are

       -b     output ganzhi in special "bitmap" characters.

       -u, --utf8
              output hanzi or Chinese characters encoded in UTF-8.

       -s     output simplified Chinese (for UTF-8 only).

       -t     output traditional Chinese (for UTF-8 only).

       -g, -h, --gb
              output hanzi or Chinese characters encoded in (highest-bit-set) GB code.

       -5, --big5
              output hanzi or Chinese characters encoded in Big5.

       -i     convert a lunar date to solar date.  The default is to convert a solar date to a lunar date.

       -l     indicate the month is a lunar leap month.  This option is meaningful only when the "-i" option is used.

       --help Print a help message.
