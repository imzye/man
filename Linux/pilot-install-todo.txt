OPTIONS
   pilot-install-todo options
                               -P,
                               --priority priority

       Specify the priority of the ToDo entry - 1|2|3|4|5 (defaults to a priority of 1).

        NOTE: this value has changed from the default of 4 to the default of 1, just as a new ToDo entry on the Palm would set it.

                               -d,
                               --due duedate

       The due Date MM/DD/YYYY (defaults to blank, no due date if this is not specified).

                               -c, --completed

       Mark the item complete (the default is to mark the item as incomplete, as the Palm would do it).

                               -D,
                               --description title
