NAME
       minisat+ - A Solver for Pseudo-Boolean Constraints

SYNOPSIS
       minisat+ <input-file> [<result-file>] [<option> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       MiniSat+ is a solver for Pseudo-Boolean constraints, based on MiniSat.

       Pseudo-Boolean  constraints can be used to describe certain kinds of combinatorial optimization problems. Variables are Boolean, that is can take as values only 0 or 1. (In-)equations used in hard
       constraints and objective functions, however, may use arbitrary integer coefficients.

       Minisat+ accepts problem specifications written in the OPB format.

OPTIONS
   Solver options:
       -M,-minisat
              Use MiniSat v1.13 as backend (default)

       -S,-satelite
              Use SatELite v1.0 as backend

       -ca,-adders
              Convert PB-constrs to clauses through adders.

       -cs,-sorters
              Convert PB-constrs to clauses through sorters.

       -cb,-bdds
              Convert PB-constrs to clauses through bdds.

       -cm,-mixed
              Convert PB-constrs to clauses by a mix of the above. (default)

       -ga,-gs,-gb,-gm
              Override conversion for goal function (long name: -goal-xxx).

       -w,-weak-off
              Clausify with equivalences instead of implications.

       -bdd n, -thres=n
              Set threshold for preferring BDDs in mixed mode to n (default: 3)

       -sort-thres=n
              Set threshold for preferring sorters to n. Tried after BDDs (default: 20)

       -goal n, -bias=n
              Set bias goal function conversion towards sorters to n (default: 3).

       -1, -first
              Don't minimize, just give first solution found

       -A, -all
              Don't minimize, give all solutions

       -goal=n
              Set initial goal limit to n.

       -p, -pbvars
              Restrict decision heuristic of SAT to original PB variables.

       -ps{+,-,0}
              Polarity suggestion in SAT towards/away from goal (or neutral).

   Input options:
       -of, -old-fmt
              Use old variant of OPB file format.

   Output options:
       -s, -satlive
              Turn off SAT competition output.

       -a, -ansi
              Turn off ANSI codes in output.

       -vn Set verbosity level to n. Possible values for
              n are 1,2,3 (default: 1).

       -cnf=file
              Write SAT problem to a file file. If the input problem is found to be trivially unsatisfiable then no file is written.

EXIT CODES
       If parsing of the input fails then the program exits with exit code 5.
