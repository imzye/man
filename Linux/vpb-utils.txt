NAME
       ringstat - Perform a simple test of FXS (station) port ring and audio paths.

SYNOPSIS
       ringstat [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  ringstat  utility performs a simple test of FXS port ring circuits.  It exercises the card base functions including the audio path, ring and hook detection.  The ports will ring while on
       hook, play 10 seconds of dial tone if taken off hook, then ring again when they go back on hook.

       Press any key (on the keyboard) to end this test.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       --module number
              Explicitly select the module of a card to test.  Default assumes 8 ports on the card to test.  Valid values here are presently 0 or 1.  It also assumes all modules have 4 ports.   This
              option may change in the future.
