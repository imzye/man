PYTEST-3(1)                                                                                          pytest                                                                                         PYTEST-3(1)

NAME
       pytest - pytest usage

CALLING PYTEST-3 THROUGH PYTHON -M PYTEST-3
       You can invoke testing through the Python interpreter from the command line:

          python -m pytest [...]

       This is almost equivalent to invoking the command line script pytest [...]  directly, except that calling via python will also add the current directory to sys.path.

POSSIBLE EXIT CODES
       Running pytest can result in six different exit codes:

       Exit code 0
              All tests were collected and passed successfully

       Exit code 1
              Tests were collected and run but some of the tests failed

       Exit code 2
              Test execution was interrupted by the user

       Exit code 3
              Internal error happened while executing tests

       Exit code 4
              pytest command line usage error

       Exit code 5
              No tests were collected

GETTING HELP ON VERSION, OPTION NAMES, ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
          pytest --version   # shows where pytest was imported from
          pytest --fixtures  # show available builtin function arguments
          pytest -h | --help # show help on command line and config file options

STOPPING AFTER THE FIRST (OR N) FAILURES
       To stop the testing process after the first (N) failures:

          pytest -x            # stop after first failure
          pytest --maxfail=2    # stop after two failures

SPECIFYING TESTS / SELECTING TESTS
       Pytest supports several ways to run and select tests from the command-line.

       Run tests in a module

          pytest test_mod.py

       Run tests in a directory

          pytest testing/

       Run tests by keyword expressions

          pytest -k "MyClass and not method"

       This  will  run tests which contain names that match the given string expression, which can include Python operators that use filenames, class names and function names as variables.  The example above
       will run TestMyClass.test_something  but not TestMyClass.test_method_simple.

       Run tests by node ids

       Each collected test is assigned a unique nodeid which consist of the module filename followed by specifiers like class names, function names and parameters from parametrization, separated by ::  char‐
       acters.

       To run a specific test within a module:

          pytest test_mod.py::test_func

       Another example specifying a test method in the command line:

          pytest test_mod.py::TestClass::test_method

       Run tests by marker expressions

          pytest -m slow

       Will run all tests which are decorated with the @pytest.mark.slow decorator.

       For more information see marks.

       Run tests from packages

          pytest --pyargs pkg.testing

       This will import pkg.testing and use its filesystem location to find and run tests from.

MODIFYING PYTHON TRACEBACK PRINTING
       Examples for modifying traceback printing:

          pytest --showlocals # show local variables in tracebacks
          pytest -l           # show local variables (shortcut)

          pytest --tb=auto    # (default) 'long' tracebacks for the first and last
                               # entry, but 'short' style for the other entries
          pytest --tb=long    # exhaustive, informative traceback formatting
          pytest --tb=short   # shorter traceback format
          pytest --tb=line    # only one line per failure
          pytest --tb=native  # Python standard library formatting
          pytest --tb=no      # no traceback at all

       The  --full-trace causes very long traces to be printed on error (longer than --tb=long). It also ensures that a stack trace is printed on KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C).  This is very useful if the tests
       are taking too long and you interrupt them with Ctrl+C to find out where the tests are hanging. By default no output will be shown (because KeyboardInterrupt is caught by pytest). By using this option
       you make sure a trace is shown.

DETAILED SUMMARY REPORT
       The -r flag can be used to display a "short test summary info" at the end of the test session, making it easy in large test suites to get a clear picture of all failures, skips, xfails, etc.

       Example:

          # content of test_example.py
          import pytest

          @pytest.fixture
          def error_fixture():
              assert 0

          def test_ok():
              print("ok")

          def test_fail():
              assert 0

          def test_error(error_fixture):
              pass

          def test_skip():
              pytest.skip("skipping this test")

          def test_xfail():
              pytest.xfail("xfailing this test")

          @pytest.mark.xfail(reason="always xfail")
          def test_xpass():
              pass

          • f - failed

          • E - error

          • s - skipped

DROPPING TO PDB (PYTHON DEBUGGER) ON FAILURES
       Python comes with a builtin Python debugger called PDB.  pytest allows one to drop into the PDB prompt via a command line option:

          pytest --pdb

       This will invoke the Python debugger on every failure (or KeyboardInterrupt).  Often you might only want to do this for the first failing test to understand a certain failure situation:

          pytest -x --pdb   # drop to PDB on first failure, then end test session
          pytest --pdb --maxfail=3  # drop to PDB for first three failures

       Note that on any failure the exception information is stored on sys.last_value, sys.last_type and sys.last_traceback. In interactive use, this allows one to drop into postmortem debugging with any de‐
       bug tool. One can also manually access the exception information, for example:

          >>> import sys
          >>> sys.last_traceback.tb_lineno
          42
          >>> sys.last_value
          AssertionError('assert result == "ok"',)

DROPPING TO PDB (PYTHON DEBUGGER) AT THE START OF A TEST
       pytest allows one to drop into the PDB prompt immediately at the start of each test via a command line option:

          pytest --trace

       This will invoke the Python debugger at the start of every test.

SETTING BREAKPOINTS
       To set a breakpoint in your code use the native Python import pdb;pdb.set_trace() call in your code and pytest automatically disables its output capture for that test:

       • Output capture in other tests is not affected.

       • Any prior test output that has already been captured and will be processed as such.

       • Output capture gets resumed when ending the debugger session (via the continue command).

USING THE BUILTIN BREAKPOINT FUNCTION
       Python 3.7 introduces a builtin breakpoint() function.  Pytest supports the use of breakpoint() with the following behaviours:

          • When breakpoint() is called and PYTHONBREAKPOINT is set to the default value, pytest will use the custom internal PDB trace UI instead of the system default Pdb.

          • When tests are complete, the system will default back to the system Pdb trace UI.

          • With --pdb passed to pytest, the custom internal Pdb trace UI is used with both breakpoint() and failed tests/unhandled exceptions.

          • --pdbcls can be used to specify a custom debugger class.

PROFILING TEST EXECUTION DURATION
       To get a list of the slowest 10 test durations:

          pytest --durations=10

       By default, pytest will not show test durations that are too small (<0.01s) unless -vv is passed on the command-line.

CREATING JUNITXML FORMAT FILES
       To create result files which can be read by Jenkins or other Continuous integration servers, use this invocation:

          pytest --junitxml=path

       to create an XML file at path.

       To set the name of the root test suite xml item, you can configure the junit_suite_name option in your config file:

          [pytest]
          junit_suite_name = my_suite

       New in version 4.0.

       JUnit XML specification seems to indicate that "time" attribute should report total test execution times, including setup and teardown (1, 2).  It is the default pytest behavior. To report  just  call
       durations instead, configure the junit_duration_report option like this:

          [pytest]
          junit_duration_report = call

   record_property
       If you want to log additional information for a test, you can use the record_property fixture:

          def test_function(record_property):
              record_property("example_key", 1)
              assert True

       This will add an extra property example_key="1" to the generated testcase tag:

          <testcase classname="test_function" file="test_function.py" line="0" name="test_function" time="0.0009">
            <properties>
              <property name="example_key" value="1" />
            </properties>
          </testcase>

       Alternatively, you can integrate this functionality with custom markers:

          # content of conftest.py

          def pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config, items):
              for item in items:
                  for marker in item.iter_markers(name="test_id"):
                      test_id = marker.args[0]
                      item.user_properties.append(("test_id", test_id))

       And in your tests:

          # content of test_function.py
          import pytest

          @pytest.mark.test_id(1501)
          def test_function():
              assert True

       Will result in:

          <testcase classname="test_function" file="test_function.py" line="0" name="test_function" time="0.0009">
            <properties>
              <property name="test_id" value="1501" />
            </properties>
          </testcase>

       WARNING:
          Please note that using this feature will break schema verifications for the latest JUnitXML schema.  This might be a problem when used with some CI servers.

   record_xml_attribute
       To add an additional xml attribute to a testcase element, you can use record_xml_attribute fixture. This can also be used to override existing values:

          def test_function(record_xml_attribute):
              record_xml_attribute("assertions", "REQ-1234")
              record_xml_attribute("classname", "custom_classname")
              print("hello world")
              assert True

       Unlike  record_property,  this  will  not  add a new child element.  Instead, this will add an attribute assertions="REQ-1234" inside the generated testcase tag and override the default classname with
       "classname=custom_classname":

          <testcase classname="custom_classname" file="test_function.py" line="0" name="test_function" time="0.003" assertions="REQ-1234">
              <system-out>
                  hello world
              </system-out>
          </testcase>

       WARNING:
          record_xml_attribute is an experimental feature, and its interface might be replaced by something more powerful and general in future versions. The functionality per-se will be kept, however.

          Using this over record_xml_property can help when using ci tools to parse the xml report.  However, some parsers are quite strict about the elements and attributes that are allowed.  Many tools use
          an xsd schema (like the example below) to validate incoming xml.  Make sure you are using attribute names that are allowed by your parser.

          Below is the Scheme used by Jenkins to validate the XML report:

              <xs:element name="testcase">
                  <xs:complexType>
                      <xs:sequence>
                          <xs:element ref="skipped" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
                          <xs:element ref="error" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                          <xs:element ref="failure" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                          <xs:element ref="system-out" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                          <xs:element ref="system-err" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                      </xs:sequence>
                      <xs:attribute name="name" type="xs:string" use="required"/>
                      <xs:attribute name="assertions" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
                      <xs:attribute name="time" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
                      <xs:attribute name="classname" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
                      <xs:attribute name="status" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
                  </xs:complexType>
              </xs:element>

   record_testsuite_property
       New in version 4.5.

       If you want to add a properties node at the test-suite level, which may contains properties that are relevant to all tests, you can use the record_testsuite_property session-scoped fixture:

       The record_testsuite_property session-scoped fixture can be used to add properties relevant to all tests.

          import pytest

          @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
          def log_global_env_facts(record_testsuite_property):
              record_testsuite_property("ARCH", "PPC")
              record_testsuite_property("STORAGE_TYPE", "CEPH")

          class TestMe(object):
              def test_foo(self):
                  assert True

       The fixture is a callable which receives name and value of a <property> tag added at the test-suite level of the generated xml:

          <testsuite errors="0" failures="0" name="pytest" skipped="0" tests="1" time="0.006">
            <properties>
              <property name="ARCH" value="PPC"/>
              <property name="STORAGE_TYPE" value="CEPH"/>
            </properties>
            <testcase classname="test_me.TestMe" file="test_me.py" line="16" name="test_foo" time="0.000243663787842"/>
          </testsuite>

       name must be a string, value will be converted to a string and properly xml-escaped.

       The generated XML is compatible with the latest xunit standard, contrary to record_property and record_xml_attribute.

CREATING RESULTLOG FORMAT FILES
          This option is rarely used and is scheduled for removal in 5.0.

          See the deprecation docs for more information.

       To create plain-text machine-readable result files you can issue:

          pytest --resultlog=path

       and look at the content at the path location.  Such files are used e.g.  by the PyPy-test web page to show test results over several revisions.

SENDING TEST REPORT TO ONLINE PASTEBIN SERVICE
       Creating a URL for each test failure:

          pytest --pastebin=failed

       This  will  submit test run information to a remote Paste service and provide a URL for each failure.  You may select tests as usual or add for example -x if you only want to send one particular fail‐
       ure.

       Creating a URL for a whole test session log:

          pytest --pastebin=all

       Currently only pasting to the http://bpaste.net service is implemented.

EARLY LOADING PLUGINS
       You can early-load plugins (internal and external) explicitly in the command-line with the -p option:

          pytest -p mypluginmodule

       The option receives a name parameter, which can be:

       • A full module dotted name, for example myproject.plugins. This dotted name must be importable.

       • The entry-point name of a plugin. This is the name passed to setuptools when the plugin is registered. For example to early-load the pytest-cov plugin you can use:

            pytest -p pytest_cov

DISABLING PLUGINS
       To disable loading specific plugins at invocation time, use the -p option together with the prefix no:.

       Example: to disable loading the plugin doctest, which is responsible for executing doctest tests from text files, invoke pytest like this:

          pytest -p no:doctest

CALLING PYTEST-3 FROM PYTHON CODE
       You can invoke pytest from Python code directly:

          pytest.main()

       this acts as if you would call "pytest" from the command line.  It will not raise SystemExit but return the exitcode instead.  You can pass in options and arguments:

          pytest.main(['-x', 'mytestdir'])

       You can specify additional plugins to pytest.main:

          # content of myinvoke.py
          import pytest
          class MyPlugin(object):
              def pytest_sessionfinish(self):
                  print("*** test run reporting finishing")

          pytest.main(["-qq"], plugins=[MyPlugin()])

       Running it will show that MyPlugin was added and its hook was invoked:

          $ python myinvoke.py
          .FEsxX.                                                              [100%]*** test run reporting finishing

          ================================== ERRORS ==================================
          _______________________ ERROR at setup of test_error _______________________

              @pytest.fixture
              def error_fixture():
          >       assert 0
          E       assert 0

          test_example.py:6: AssertionError
          ================================= FAILURES =================================
          ________________________________ test_fail _________________________________

              def test_fail():
          >       assert 0
          E       assert 0

          test_example.py:14: AssertionError

       NOTE:
          Calling pytest.main() will result in importing your tests and any modules that they import. Due to the caching mechanism of python's import system, making subsequent calls to pytest.main() from the
          same  process will not reflect changes to those files between the calls. For this reason, making multiple calls to pytest.main() from the same process (in order to re-run tests, for example) is not
          recommended.
