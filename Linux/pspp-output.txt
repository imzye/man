NAME
       pspp-output - convert and operate on SPSS viewer (SPV) files

SYNOPSIS
       pspp-output detect file
       pspp-output [options] dir file
       pspp-output [options] convert source destination
       pspp-output --help | -h
       pspp-output --version | -v

DESCRIPTION
       pspp-output is a command-line utility accompanying PSPP.  It supports multiple operations on SPSS viewer or .spv files, here called SPV files.  SPSS 16 and later writes SPV files to represent the con‐
       tents of its output editor.

       SPSS 15 and earlier versions instead use .spo files.  pspp-output does not support this format.

       pspp-output has a number of subcommands, documented separately below.  pspp-output also has several undocumented command forms that developers may find useful for debugging.

   The detect command
       When invoked as pspp-output detect file, pspp-output reads enough of file to determine whether it is an SPV file.  If so, it exits successfully without outputting anything.  When file is  not  an  SPV
       file or if some other error occurs, pspp-output prints an error message and exits with a failure indication.

   The dir command
       When  invoked  as  pspp-output dir file, pspp-output prints on stdout a table of contents for SPV file file.  By default, this table lists every object in the file, except for hidden objects.  See the
       Input Selection Options section below for information on the options available to select a subset of objects.

       The following additional option for dir is intended mainly for use by PSPP developers:

       --member-names
              Also show the names of the Zip members associated with each object.

   The convert command
       When invoked as pspp-output convert source destination, pspp-output reads the SPV file source and converts it to another format, writing the output to destination.

       By default, pspp-output infers the intended format for destination from its extension.  The known extensions are generally: csv html list odt pdf ps spv svg txt.  Use --help to see an  accurate  list,
       since a given installation might be built without support for some formats.

       See the Input Selection Options section below for information on the options available to select a subset of objects to include in the output.  The following additional options are accepted:

       -O format=format
              Overrides the format inferred from the output file's extension.  format must be one of the extensions listed above.

       -O option=value
              Sets an option for the output file format.  Refer to the PSPP manual for details of the available output options.

       -F
       --force
              By default, if the source is corrupt or otherwise cannot be processed, the destination is not written.  These option make pspp-output write the output as best it can, even with errors.

   Input Selection Options
       The dir and convert commands, by default, operate on all of the objects in the source SPV file, except for objects that are not visible in the output viewer window.  The user may specify these options
       to select a subset of the input objects.  When multiple options are used, only objects that satisfy all of them are selected:

       --select=[^]class...
              Include only objects of the given class; with leading ^, include only objects not in the class.  Use commas to separate multiple classes.  The supported classes are:

                     charts headings logs models tables texts trees warnings outlineheaders pagetitle notes unknown other

              Use --select=help to print this list of classes.

       --commands=[^]command...
       --subtypes=[^]subtype...
       --labels=[^]label...
              Include only objects with the specified command, subtype, or label.  With a leading ^, include only the objects that do not match.  Multiple values may be specified separated by commas.  An as‐
              terisk at the end of a value acts as a wildcard.

              The  --command  option matches command identifiers, case insensitively.  All of the objects produced by a single command use the same, unique command identifier.  Command identifiers are always
              in English regardless of the language used for output.  They often differ from the command name in PSPP syntax.  Use the pspp-output program's dir command to print command identifiers  in  par‐
              ticular output.

              The --subtypes option matches particular tables within a command, case insensitively.  Subtypes are not necessarily unique: two commands that produce similar output tables may use the same sub‐
              type.  Subtypes are always in English and dir will print them.

              The --labels option matches the labels in table output (that is, the table titles).  Labels are affected by the output language, variable names and labels, split file settings, and  other  fac‐
              tors.

       --instances=instance...
              Include  the  specified  instance  of an object that matches the other criteria within a single command.  The instance may be a number (1 for the first instance, 2 for the second, and so on) or
              last for the last instance.

       --show-hidden
              Include hidden output objects in the output.  By default, they are excluded.

       --or   Separates two sets of selection options.  Objects selected by either set of options are included in the output.

       The following additional input selection options are intended mainly for use by PSPP developers:

       --errors
              Include only objects that cause an error when read.  With the convert command, this is most useful in conjunction with the --force option.

       --members=member...
              Include only the objects that include a listed Zip file member.  More than one name may be included, comma-separated.  The members in an SPV file may be listed with the dir  command  by  adding
              the --show-members option or with the zipinfo program included with many operating systems.  Error messages that pspp-output prints when it reads SPV files also often include member names.

       --member-names
              Displays the name of the Zip member or members associated with each object just above the object itself.

OPTIONS
       -h
       --help Prints a usage message on stdout and exits.

       -v
       --version
              Prints version information on stdout and exits.
