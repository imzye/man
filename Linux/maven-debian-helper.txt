NAME
       Maven - manual page for Maven Repo Helper version 1.7.1

SYNOPSIS
       mh_lspoms [option]... <package>

DESCRIPTION
       Looks for all POM files defined in the source of the project.

       Where

              <package> is the name of the binary package,

              e.g. libcommons-lang-java. Default to the first binary found in the debian/control file

OPTIONS

       -h --help: show this text

       -V --version: show the version

       -p<package> --package=<package>: package to act on

       -f --force: force run even if the .poms files exist.

              Only maven.rules will be created, assuming that it did not exist before.

       -n --non-interactive: non interactive session, don't ask questions.

       -o --offline: don't ever connect to the internet, for Debian build

              compatibility.

       You  need to execute it on the unpacked origial source tree, merged with the debian/ folder. It will create the file debian/<binary package>.poms which contains all the POMs to deploy to the Maven
       repository and is used by mh_installpoms.

   The contents of debian/<binary package>.poms should be:
              * one POM file location per line, * optionally, the location is followed by the option --no-parent

              to indicate that if this POM inherits from a parent, the parent element will be removed.
