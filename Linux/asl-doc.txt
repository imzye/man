NAME
       ag++ — a frontend to ac++ and g++

SYNOPSIS
       ag++  -o output input.cpp

       ag++  -c -o output.o -o input.cpp

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ag++ command.

       ag++ is a frontend to ac++ and g++ provided by AspectC++.  For a better (and more complete) reference, see the AspectC++ documentation.

       ag++        is called much like g++ itself. Check the two syntax forms above and follow these explanations:

       The  first syntax form takes input.cpp and generates an executable named output, after weaving into input.cpp all the aspects that crosscut it.  input.cpp has restrictions as it would have if
       we were compiling a regular C++ program: it must have an main() function, and everything you already know.

       The second syntax form takes input.cpp and generates an object file named output.o, after weaving into input.cpp all the aspects that crosscut it.

       Note: in both cases, input.cpp       isn't actually changed. g++ weaves to temporary files.

       Common g++ arguments, like -I INDCIR, -L LIBCIR, -l libfoo, and so on, are recognized by ag++ and rightly passed to g++.

OPTIONS
       Further options can be seen in AspectC++ documentation.
