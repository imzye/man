NAME
       psreport — Report on the contents of a PS

SYNOPSIS
       psreport [-err stdout] [-err stderr] [-verbose | -v] [-max max_pkts | -m max_pkts] [-dvd | -notdvd | -nodvd] in_file | -stdin

DESCRIPTION
       Report on the packets in a Program Stream.

   Files
       in_file
               is an H.222 Program Stream file (but see -stdin below)

   Switches
       -err stdout
               Write error messages to standard output (the default)

       -err stderr
               Write error messages to standard error (Unix traditional)

       -stdin  Input from standard input, instead of a file

       -v, -verbose
               Output packet data as well

       -stdin  Take input from <stdin>, instead of a named file

       -max max_pkts, -m max_pkts
               Maximum number of PS packets to read

       -dvd    The PS data is from a DVD. This is the default.  This switch has no effect on MPEG-1 PS data.

       -notdvd, -nodvd
               The PS data is not from a DVD.  The DVD specification stores AC-3 (Dolby), DTS and other audio in a specialised manner in private_stream_1.
