NAME
       yaku-ns - small and simple DNS server

SYNOPSIS
       yaku-ns [-p <port>] [-P <port>] [-f <port>] [-C <max>] [-F <max>] [-T <forward_timeout>] [-c <config_file>] [-l <logfile>] [-r <chroot jail>] [-u owner] [-b <addr>] [-xdhV]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple and small DNS server.  Major features are:
        - Support for A, MX, NS, TXT, PTR, SOA in local resource records
        - Additional RRs handling
        - Responses cache, with optional TTL expiration
        - Forwarding to multiple exteral DNS servers, with simultaneous or
          time-driven query
        - Optional TCP zone transfer
        - A in RRs shuffling
        - Built-in ACL rules
        - Root privileges squashing
        - Chroot jail under unix systems
        - Secure DNS IDs to prevent DNS forget
        - Logging
        - Very simple config file

OPTIONS
       -p <port>
              Use the UDP port <port> for the DNS service.

       -P <port>
              Use the TCP port <port> for the DNS under TCP service.  The only two requests accepted under TCP are IN/AXFR and IN/SOA.

       -f <port>
              Query the external DNS servers to the port <port>.

       -C <size>
              Use a cache of size <size>, 0 is no-cache.

       -F <max>
              Use a forwarded request queue of size <size>, 0 turn off the forwarding.

       -T <timeout>
              Forwarded requets expire in <timeout> seconds.

       -c <file>
              Use  the config file <file>: WARNING you must specify the absolute path here, since the server chdir() to "/".  Also note that this path is relative to the chroot jail.  Use "-" as filename
              to provide the configuration from the standard input.

       -l <file>
              Use the <file> for yaku-ns logs. Remember to use an absolute path, relative to the chroot (if used).

       -r <directory>
              Chroot to <directory>.

       -u <username>
              Run as <username> (default is nobody, not so secure).

       -b <address>
              Bind only the interface with IP address <address>.

       -x     Enable the TCP services.

       -d     Demonize.

       -h     Show some help.

       -V     Verbosity level: -V: low level, -VV medium level, -VVV high level of verbosity. -VVV is raccomanded for new users.

SIGNALS
       The DNS server yaku-ns performs different action if some signal is received:
         SIGHUP    Reload the configuration (use on record updates)
         SIGUSR1   Force yaku-ns to log some debugging information
         SIGUSR2   Switch the forwarding ON/OFF
