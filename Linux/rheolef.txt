NAME
       mkgeo_ball - unstructured mesh of an ellipsoid (rheolef-7.2)

SYNOPSIS
       mkgeo_ball [options] [n]

EXAMPLE
       mkgeo_ball -t 10 | geo -

       The previous command build a triangle based 2d unstructured mesh of the unit ball

DESCRIPTION
       This command is useful when testing programs on simple geometries. Invocation is similar to those of mkgeo_grid(1) . It calls gmsh as unstructured mesh generator. It avoid the preparation of an
       input file for a mesh generator. The optional n argument is an integer that specifies the subdivision in each direction. By default n=10. The mesh files goes on standard output.

THE MESH ORDER
       -order int

            The polynomial approximation mesh order, for the curved boundary, as defined by gmsh. Default is order=1.

ELEMENT TYPE OPTION
       -e

            1d mesh using edges.

       -t

            2d mesh using triangles.

       -q

            2d mesh using quadrangles (rectangles).

       -T

            3d mesh using tetrahedra.

       -P

            3d mesh using prisms.

       -H

            3d mesh using hexahedra.

       -tq

            2d mesh using both triangles and quadrangles.

       -TP
       -PH
       -TPH

            3d mixed mesh combining tetrahedra, prisms and/or hexahedra.

THE GEOMETRY
       -a float
       -b float
       -c float
       -d float
       -f float
       -g float

            The geometry can be ellipse/ellipsoid inscribed in the [a,b]x[c,d] rectangle or the [a,b]x[c,d]x[f,g] parallelepiped. By default a=c=f=-1 and b=d=g=1, thus, the unit balls are considered.

       -s

            Only a surface mesh is generated: a curved line in 2d or a curved surface mesh in 3d. In 3d, supports both '-t' and '-q' options.

BOUNDARY DOMAINS
       The meshes defines a domain named boundary that groups all boundary sides.

OTHERS OPTIONS
       -[no]fix

            By default, internal face and volume node from gmsh are recomputed, since they have incorrect coordinate that destroy the convergence properties of isoparametric high order elements (order >=
           3). The -nofix option skip this correction: this option is available for test purpose.

       -[no]clean

            Clear temporary files (this is the default).

       -[no]verbose

            Print intermediate commands and information messages.
