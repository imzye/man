NAME
       fcml-asm - single-line assembler

SYNOPSIS
       fcml-asm [-abs] [-sib] [-rex] [-all] [-gas] [-asa<size>] [-osa<size>] -m<size> -ip <address> <instruction>

DESCRIPTION
       fcml-asm is a single-line assembler for Intel iAPx86, IA-32 and EM64T CPUs, and compatible CPUs from other manufacturers.

       It displays all possible encodings of the given assembly-language instruction.

OPTIONS
       fcml-asm accepts the following options:

       -abs   Prefer absolute memory addressing where possible. This is particularly useful in 64-bit mode, for RIP addressing.

       -sib   Prefer encoding using a SIB byte (scale * index + base).

       -rex   Use a REX prefix even if it is optional.

       -all   Return all possible forms of the instruction.

       -gas   Use GNU Assembler dialect (also known as AT&T). The Intel dialect is used by default.

       -asa<size>
              Specify the size of the address size attribute (16, 32 or 64 for respectively 16, 32 and 63 bits).

       -osa<size>
              Specify the size of the operand size attribute (16, 32 or 64 for respectively 16, 32 and 63 bits).

       -m<size>
              Specify the addressing mode (16, 32 or 64).

       -ip <address>
              Specify the instruction pointer address (IP, EIP or RIP).
