NAME
       dms - UPnP DLNA Digital Media Server

SYNOPSIS
       dms [options]

DESCRIPTION
       dms is a UPnP DLNA Digital Media Server. It runs from the terminal, and serves content directly from the filesystem from the working directory, or the path given. The SSDP component will broadcast
       and respond to requests on all available network interfaces.

       dms advertises and serves the raw files, in addition to alternate transcoded streams when it's able, such as mpeg2 PAL-DVD and WebM for the Chromecast. It will also provide thumbnails where possi‐
       ble.

       dms  uses  ffprobe/avprobe to get media data such as bitrate and duration, ffmpeg/avconv for video transoding, and ffmpegthumbnailer for generating thumbnails when browsing. These commands must be
       in the PATH given to dms or the features requiring them will be disabled.

   Known Compatible Players and Renderers

          • Chromecast

          • VLC

          • LG Smart TVs, with varying success.
