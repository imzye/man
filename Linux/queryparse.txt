queryparse(1)               General Commands Manual              queryparse(1)

NAME
       queryparse - extract DNS queries from pcap capture files.

SYNOPSIS
       queryparse  [-i input file ] [-o output file ] [-r recursion only ] [-R
       parse responses ]

DESCRIPTION
       queryparse is a tool designed to extract DNS queries from  pcap-format‐
       ted  packet capture files and save them in a form suitable for input to
       Nominum's dnsperf or resperf benchmarking tools.  queryparse will  only
       examine  UDP  packets,  and  currently supports Ethernet and Cisco HDLC
       frame types.

OPTIONS
       -i filename
              Attempt to extract DNS queries from filename, which should be  a
              pcap-formatted  packet  capture session (e.g., a file created by
              tcpdump or ethereal).

       -o filename
              Write queries to filename in a  format  suitable  for  input  to
              Nominum's dnsperf or resperf benchmarking tools.

       -r     Keep  queries  that  do not have the RD (recursion desired) flag
              set.  This is useful when parsing packet captures from  authori‐
              tative  nameservers.   When  parsing captures from caching name‐
              servers, do not use it unless you also want to parse the  outgo‐
              ing queries from the nameserver.  Defaults to discarding queries
              with RD=0.

       -R     Parse responses (QR=1) instead of queries (QR=0).
