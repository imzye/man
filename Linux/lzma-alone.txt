NAME
       LZMA - a compression algorithm, based on Lempel Ziv's compression method.

SYNOPSIS
       lzma <e|d> inputFile outputFile [switches...]

DESCRIPTION
       LZMA provides high compression ratio and very fast decompression, so it is very suitable for embedded applications. For example, it can be used for ROM (firmware) compression.

       lzma is the default and general compression method of 7z format in 7-Zip program.

       e      Encode file

       d      Decode file

       b      Benchmark
