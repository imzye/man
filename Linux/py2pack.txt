EXAMPLES
       Creating a package from a Python module involves the following steps:

        1. Search for your favorite Python module, for example, :

               $ py2pack search pylint
               searching for package pylint...
               found logilab.pylintinstaller-0.15.2
               found plpylint-0.1.2
               found pylint-0.22.0

        2. Download

               $ py2pack fetch
               downloading package pylint-0.22.0...
               from http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pylint/pylint-0.22.0.tar.gz

        3. Create a SPEC file, for example, for openSUSE:

               $ py2pack generate -t opensuse.spec -f python-pylint.spec pylint

        4. Check the SPEC file python-pylint.spec and adapt it to your needs.
