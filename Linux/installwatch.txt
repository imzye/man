NAME
       installwatch — Track installation of software

SYNOPSIS
       installwatch [options]  [command]

DESCRIPTION
       installwatch  is a program that is used in order to track the changes made while installing local software (i.e.  "make install"). It monitors the requested command, and produces a log which indicates
       all created and modified files. By default it outputs to syslog(3) using a priority of "LOG_USER | LOG_INFO". This may be overridden by the use of the -o flag. The log format is as follows:

       <return-value> <syscall-name> <argument> #<comment>

       Each field is delimited by a "^I" character if logging to syslog(3), or by a tab when logging to a file.

ENVIRONMENT
       INSTALLWATCH_BACKUP_PATH
                 Set this variable to the location that you want installwatch to copy the original version of files which get modified. The directory will be created if it does not exist, assuming  that  the
                 parent is writable.

OPTIONS
       These program follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

                 -o        --logfile
                 Directs that output from the logged command be written to the filename specified. If the specified file already exists, it will be truncated.

       -r           --root
                 Sets the directory under which meta-info and translated files  will be stored.

       -t           --trans
                 Toggle translation capabilities.

       -e           --exclude
                 Sets a comma separated neutral directory list, that won't be concerned by translation or backups.

       -d           --dbgfile
                 Specify a debug file.

       -v       --dbglvl
                 Sets the debug level to be used.

       -h         --help
                 Show help information.

BUGS
       installwatch  does  not  work  with programs which are statically linked with libc. Due to LD_PRELOAD limitations, it does not work with suid programs (this would probably introduce security problems,
       anyway).

       mknod(2) is not monitored.
