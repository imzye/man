IRXEVENT(1)                                                                                    User Commands                                                                                    IRXEVENT(1)

NAME
       irxevent - infrared X-event sender

SYNOPSIS
       irxevent [option]... [config file]

DESCRIPTION
       Irxevent  is  a program to send button clicks and key presses to X applications triggered by a LIRC driven remote control. You can control your favorite CD/MP3 player, your TV tuner program or any
       other X application that responds to keyboard or mouse input. If you like to you can send emacs ^X^S from your armchair.

       Irxevent is a complement to irexec(1) and irpty(1).

FILES
       Irxevent works with the same config file as irexec and irpty (~/.config/lircrc). For a complete sample lircrc look at examples/lircrc.

       Part of your .lircrc could look like this:

       begin
               prog = irxevent
               button = VIDEO_UP
               config = Key SHIFT-KP_Add CurrentWindow
       end
       begin
               prog = irxevent
               button = VIDEO_DOWN
               config = Key SHIFT-KP_Subtract CurrentWindow
       end
       begin
               prog = irxevent
               button = STOP
               config = Key ctrl-c CurrentWindow
       end
       begin
               prog = irxevent
               button = 0
               config = Key f xawtv
               config = Key f xawtv
       end
       begin
               prog = irxevent
               button = POWER
               config = Key q xawtv
       end
       begin
               prog = irxevent
               button = CH_DOWN
               config = Button 1 329 92 kscd
       end
       begin
               prog = irxevent
               button = UP
               config = Button 1 110 80 GQmpeg
       end
       begin
               prog = irxevent
               button = DOWN
               config = Button 1 130 80 GQmpeg
       end

       Simply said config =  lines may look like this:

       config = Key [shift-][ctrl-][alt-]<key> [Focus] <windowname>
               | WindowID <id> | CurrentWindow | RootWindow
       config = Button <button> <x> <y> [Focus] <windowname> | WindowID <id>
               | CurrentWindow | RootWindow
       config = xy_Key <x> <y> [shift-][ctrl-][alt-]<key> [Focus]
               <windowname> | WindowID id | CurrentWindow | RootWindow

       Some more examples:

       config = Key Up xawtv
       config = Key Down xawtv
       config = Button 1 50 110 xclickme
       config = Key q xawtv
       config = Key ctrl-c mpg123
       config = Key shift-Page_Up rxvt

       In BNF this looks like:

          LINE    = "config =" <KEY|BUTTON|XYKEY> <TARGET> |
                    "config =" <KEY|BUTTON|XYKEY> "Focus" <TARGET>
          XYKEY   = "xy_Key" <x_position> <y_position> <MOD><KEYSPEC>
          KEY     = "Key" <MOD><KEYSPEC>
          MOD     = ["shift-"]["numlock-"]["ctrl-"]["alt-"]["meta-"]
                    ["numlock-"]["mod3-"]["mod4-"]["mod5-"]["altgr-"]["scrlock-"]
          KEYSPEC = Keyname | "KeySym:"KeySym | "KeyCode:"KeyCode
          BUTTON  = "Button" <1..5> <x_position> <y_position>
          TARGET  = Windowname | "WindowID" id | "CurrentWindow" | "RootWindow"

          Keyname:
            is the key symbol that is declared in X windows. E.g. "Up" refers to the cursor arrow pointing up. "KP_Add" is the plus sign on the key pad. Just take a look at irxevent.keys (in the documen‐
            tation directory) if you are not sure about a symbol's name.
          KeySym:
            number as returned by XStringToKeysym(3x).
          KeyCode:
            number as returned by XKeysymToKeycode(3x).
          Windowname:
            can be the first characters of the window name displayed by the window manager or the name that is displayed below the icon. Some programs use the name displayed by the window manager to show
            a lot of status information but don't change the icon name (like xawtv). Others append information to the window name ("GQmpeg - kill_windooz.mp3"). If neither window name nor icon name match
            the given Windowname information from XClassHint(3x) will be checked.
          CurrentWindow:
            refers to the active window as returned by XGetInputFocus(3x). Most times this is the window with your mouse pointer in it.
          RootWindow:
            refers to the root window as returned by RootWindow(3x). You may need this to send events to the window manager.
          WindowID id:
            refers to the window with window identifier id. id should be a decimal number. It is useful when irxevent can't find the desired window by other means.
          Focus:
            will send the specified event to the given window only if it currently has the input focus. This of course does not make much sense when combined with CurrentWindow.

TROUBLESHOOTING
       If you have problems finding the coordinates for a button click you can try xev -id <window_id>. The window_id can be found using xwininfo.

       There are programs that do not accept any synthetic X-events by default because they can cause security problems. Currently xterm and xemacs are known to ignore events simulated by irxevent.

       You can however make xterm accept external events by enabling "Allow SendEvents" in the "Main Options" (hold down the Ctrl button and press the left mouse button inside the xterm window). You  can
       as well place this line into your .Xresources file to change this permanently:

          XTerm.vt100.allowSendEvents: true

       Yet another possibility is to start xterm like this:

          xterm -xrm "XTerm.vt100.allowSendEvents: true"

       xemacs will accept events if you set a built-in variable. The following was taken from the online help:

          `x-allow-sendevents' is a built-in boolean variable.

          Value: t

          Documentation:

          *Non-nil means to allow synthetic events.  Nil means they are ignored.

          Beware: allowing emacs to process SendEvents opens a big security hole.

          In order to allow events you have to evaluate this lisp code (press Meta-x and enter the following expression):

                   (setq x-allow-sendevents t)

          Placing this line into your .xemacs-options file should have the same result.

       If you have problems sending events please drop me an email.
