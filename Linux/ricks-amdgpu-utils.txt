GPU-LS(1)                                                              Ricks-Lab GPU Utilities                                                             GPU-LS(1)

NAME
       gpu-ls - display details about gpu compatible GPU cards

SYNOPSIS
       gpu-ls [--short]
       gpu-ls [--help | --about]
       gpu-ls [--clinfo] [--no_fan] [--ppm] [--pstates]

CONFIGURATION
       In  order  to  get maximum capability of these utilities, you should be running with a kernel that provides support of the GPUs you have installed.  If using
       AMD GPUs, installing the latest amdgpu driver package or the latest ROCm release, may provide additional capabilities. If you  have  Nvidia  GPUs  installed,
       nvidia-smi must also be installed in order for the utility reading of the cards to be possible.  Writing to GPUs is currently only possible for AMD GPUs, and
       only with compatible cards and with the the AMD ppfeaturemask set to 0xfffd7fff. This can be accomplished by adding  amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff  to  the
       GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT value in /etc/default/grub and executing sudo update-grub.

DESCRIPTION
       gpu-ls displays most relevant parameters for installed and compatible GPUs.  The default behavior is to list relevant base parameters by GPU.

OPTIONS
        --about
              Will display details about gpu-ls.

        --clinfo
              If the clinfo package is installed, openCL details will be included in the output for each compatible GPU.

        --no_fan
              Will exclude fan information from the display.  Useful with water cooled GPUs.

        --short
              Will display short list of key descriptive parameters for each installed GPU.

        --table
              Will display table of basic GPU parameters.

        --ppm Will display descriptions of available power performance modes.

        --pstates
              Will display P-state table for system and memory clocks.

        --debug
              Will output additional useful debug/troubleshooting details to a log file.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
       gpu-ls

       This  will display the basic parameters for all compatible GPUs.  These include device ID, GPU frequency/voltage control type, decoded device ID, card model,
       short card model, display card model, card number, card path, PCIe ID, driver, vBIOS version, HWmon path, current power, power  cap,  power  cap  range,  fan
       enable,  fan PWM mode, current fan PWM, current fan speed, fan target speed, fan speed range, fan PWM range, current temp, critical temp, current VddGF, Vddc
       range, current GPU loading, memory details, link speed, link width, current Sclk p-state, current Sclk frequency, Sclk range, current Mclk  p-state,  current
       Mclk frequency, Mclk range, power performance mode, and power force performance level.

       gpu-ls --short

       This will produce a short list of key descriptive parameters for each installed GPU.

       gpu-ls --clinfo

       In addition to the basic parameters, openCL parameters are also displayed for each compatible GPU.  This option is dependent on the installation of clinfo.

       gpu-ls --ppm

       Instead of the basic parameters, a table of power/performance modes is displayed.

       gpu-ls --pstates

       Instead of the basic parameters, a table of power states or curve points is displayed.

FILES
       /usr/share/misc/pci.ids
              The system list of all known PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses).  It can be updated with the update-pciids command.

       /sys/class/drm/card*/device/pp_od_clk_voltage
              Special driver file for each AMD GPU required by some rickslab-gpu-utils.

       /etc/default/grub
              The grub defaults file where amdgpu.ppfeaturemask needs to be set.

BUGS
       Known  to  not  work  well  with  Fiji  ProDuo  cards  and  will  issue  warning  messages  for Fiji Nano cards.  Please report any additional bugs/issues at
       https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/amdgpu-utils
