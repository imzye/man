NAME
       evdev-joystick - joystick calibration program

SYNOPSIS
       evdev-joystick --help
       evdev-joystick --listdevs
       evdev-joystick --showcal <device‐path>
       evdev-joystick --evdev device‐path> [--axis <axis>] [--minimum <value>] [--maximum <value>] [--deadzone <value>] [--fuzz <value>]

DESCRIPTION
       evdev-joystick calibrates joysticks.  Calibrating a joystick ensures the positions on the various axes are correctly interpreted.

OPTIONS
       --h, --help
              Print out a summary of available options.

       --l, --listdevs
              List all joystick devices found.

       --s, --showcal <device‐path>
              Show the current calibration for the specified device.

       --e, --evdev <device‐path>
              Specify the joystick device to modify.

       --a, --axis <axis>
              Specify the axis to modify (by default, all axes are calibrated).

       --m, --minimum <value>
              Change the minimum for the current joystick.

       --M, --maximum <value>
              Change the maximum for the current joystick.

       --d, --deadzone <value>
              Change the deadzone for the current joystick.

       --f, --fuzz <value>
              Change the fuzz for the current joystick.

CALIBRATION
       Using  the Linux input system, joysticks are expected to produce values between -32767 and 32767 for axes, with 0 meaning the joystick is centred.  Thus, full‐left should produce -32767 on the X axis,
       full‐right 32767 on the X axis, full‐forward -32767 on the Y axis, and so on.

       Many joysticks and gamepads (especially older ones) are slightly mis‐aligned; as a result they may not use the full range of values (for the extremes of the axes), or more annoyingly they may not give
       0  when  centred.  Calibrating a joystick provides the kernel with information on a joystick's real behaviour, which allows the kernel to correct various joysticks' deficiencies and produce consistent
       output as far as joystick‐using software is concerned.

       jstest(1) is useful to determine whether a joystick is calibrated: when run, it should produce all 0s when the joystick is at rest, and each axis should be able to produce the values -32767 and 32767.
       Analog joysticks should produce values in between 0 and the extremes, but this is not necessary; digital directional pads work fine with only the three values.
