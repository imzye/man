NAME
       spdrs60 - SRCP digital model railroad controller with a look of the German Railway SpDrS60 switch-boxes.

SYNOPSIS
       spdrs60 [ -options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       spdrs60 is a graphical Simple Railroad Command Protocol (SRCP) client to
        comfortably  control  a  digital  model  railroad.   His look has been adopted from the original German Railway SpDrS60 switch-boxes.  It is designed for use with a SRCP server as provided by the DDL
       project.  For historical reasons there have been several partly incompatible versions of SRCP.  This version of spdrs60 only supports SRCP version 0.8.4 and hence needs a  suitable  SRCP  server  like
       srcpd (http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/).  For basic usage of spdrs60 it may be sufficent to connect to servers providing older SRCP standards ranging from 0.8.0 to 0.8.3.

   Generic Messages
       spdrs60  supports  Generic  Messages  (GM)  which  were  introduced to SRCP in version 0.8.4. This feature is used to transport CRCF (Common Railroad Configuration Files) data enabling SRCP clients to
       exchange information not part of the SRCP specification.  spdrs60 acts as CRCF server and client and can communicate with CRCF clients like dtcltiny to provide route specific information.

OPTIONS
       For now spdrs60 does not implement special command-line options, but supports generic options of the underlying Qt-library.

       -geometry WxH+X+Y
              Sets the size and location of the main window. This may be specially useful for displaying a full-size railroad layout.

FILES
       ~/.spdrs60rc
              Personal spdrs60 defaults (see Edit Preferences menu).

CONFORMING TO
       This version of spdrs60 is conforming to SRCP 0.8.4.

BUGS
       There may still be some bugs worth to be smashed. Please send bug reports or suggestions for improvements to the spdrs60 user mailinglist <spdrs60-user@lists.sourceforge.net>.

EXAMPLE
       spdrs60
              Display the main window with an empty layout. Pre-loading of a preferred layout file is controlled by the preferences dialog.

       spdrs60 -geometry 800x600+0+0
              Display the man window in 800x600 pixel size and place it to the upper left corner.
