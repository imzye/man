NAME
       xte - Generates fake input using the XTest extension

SYNOPSIS
       xte [options] commands...

DESCRIPTION
       xte is a program that generates fake input using the XTest extension, more reliable than xse.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -i id  XInput 2.x device to use. List devices with 'xinput list'.

       -x display
              Send commands to remote X server. Note that some commands may not work correctly unless the display is on the console, e.g. the display is currently controlled by the keyboard and mouse and not
              in the background. This seems to be a limitation of the XTest extension.

              Show summary of options.

LIMITATIONS
       The str command doesn't support Unicode characters with more than two bytes. Further, character composing sequences to generate special charactes are limited to Multi_key plus two characters. The  set
       of supported characters depends on the current keyboard layout.
