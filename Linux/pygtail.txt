NAME
       pygtail - read log file lines that have not been read

SYNOPSIS
       pygtail [options] logfile

DESCRIPTION
       Print log file lines that have not been read.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -o OFFSET_FILE, --offset-file=OFFSET_FILE
              File to which offset data is written (default: <logfile>.offset).

       -p, --paranoid
              Update the offset file every time we read a line (as opposed to only when we reach the end of the file).

       -n EVERY_N, --every-n=EVERY_N
              Update the offset file every n'th time we read a line (as opposed to only when we reach the end of the file).

       --no-copytruncate
              Don't support copytruncate-style log rotation.  Instead, if the log file shrinks, print a warning.

       --version
              Print version and exit.
