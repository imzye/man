       ircat [options] <prog>

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  prints config strings to standard output. It can be used

       prog entries in .lircrc.

       begin
               prog = myprog
               button = KEY_CHANNELUP
               config = next_file
       end

       then

       $ ircat myprog

       will print "next_file" (followed by  newline)  every  time  the  button
       bound to KEY_CHANNELUP is pressed.
