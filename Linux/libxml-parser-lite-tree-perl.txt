NAME
       XML::Parser::Lite::Tree - Lightweight XML tree builder

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Parser::Lite::Tree;

         my $tree_parser = XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::instance();
         my $tree = $tree_parser->parse($xml_data);

           OR

         my $tree = XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::instance()->parse($xml_data);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a singleton class for parsing XML into a tree structure. How does this differ from other XML tree generators? By using XML::Parser::Lite, which is a pure perl XML parser. Using this module
       you can tree-ify simple XML without having to compile any C.

       For example, the following XML:

         <foo woo="yay"><bar a="b" c="d" />hoopla</foo>

       Parses into the following tree:

               {
                 'children' => [
                                 {
                                   'children' => [
                                                   {
                                                     'children' => [],
                                                     'attributes' => {
                                                                       'a' => 'b',
                                                                       'c' => 'd'
                                                                     },
                                                     'type' => 'element',
                                                     'name' => 'bar'
                                                   },
                                                   {
                                                     'content' => 'hoopla',
                                                     'type' => 'text'
                                                   }
                                                 ],
                                   'attributes' => {
                                                     'woo' => 'yay'
                                                   },
                                   'type' => 'element',
                                   'name' => 'foo'
                                 }
                               ],
                 'type' => 'root'
               };

       Each node contains a "type" key, one of "root", "element" and "text". "root" is the document root, and only contains an array ref "children". "element" represents a normal tag, and contains an
       array ref "children", a hash ref "attributes" and a string "name".  "text" nodes contain only a "content" string.

METHODS
       "instance()"
           Returns an instance of the tree parser.

       "new( options... )"
           Creates a new parser. Valid options include "process_ns" to process namespaces.

       "parse($xml)"
           Parses the xml in $xml and returns the tree as a hash ref.
