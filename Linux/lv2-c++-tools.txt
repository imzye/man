NAME
       lv2peg - program that generates C header files from Turtle files containing LV2 plugin data.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the lv2peg command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       lv2peg program that generates C header files from Turtle files containing LV2 plugin data.  This is useful for keeping the RDF data and your source code syn‐
       chronised while you are working on the plugin and maybe changing things like port types and ranges.

       By  including  the  generated  file  in  the source code for your plugin and setting up your build system to regenerate it when the RDF file changes, you can
       change the port indices, the ranges and default values, the plugin URI etc without having to update your code manually.  For more  information  please  visit
