NAME
     fq — job queue log viewer

SYNOPSIS
     fq [-a] [-n] [-q] [job id ...]

DESCRIPTION
     fq is a simple utility for “following” the output of nq(1) jobs.

     Without arguments, the output of the currently running and queued as-of-now jobs is emitted; else the presented job ids are used.

     fq automatically terminates after the corresponding jobs are done.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Output all log files, even of already finished jobs.

     -n      Don't wait for new output.  Can be used to look at enqueued commands.

     -q      Only print the first line of each job output (i.e. the exec line).

ENVIRONMENT
     NQDIR   Directory where lock files/job output resides, see nq(1).

EXIT STATUS
     The fq utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

INTERNALS
     On Linux, inotify(7) is used to monitor job output.  On FreeBSD and macOS, kqueue(2) is used.  On other operating systems, polling is used.
