NAME
       dahdi_span_assignments - handle DAHDI spans assignments

SYNOPSIS
       dahdi_span_assignments [-v|--verbose] [-n|--dry-run] <add|remove|auto> [devpath...]

       dahdi_span_assignments [-v|--verbose] list [devpath...]

       dahdi_span_assignments [-v|--verbose] [-k|--key key] dumpconfig

       dahdi_span_assignments -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       Channels  in  DAHDI devices (such as DAHDI PCI cards) are groups to logical units called "spans" (for example: a port in a digital card is a span).  When the kernel module parameter dahdi.auto_as‐
       sign_span is unset, DAHDI devices that register with DAHDI don't cause their spans to be automatically assigned.

       This allows user-space to order DAHDI to assign them to specific span and channel numbers. That way, specific spans on specific DAHDI devices may be assigned with specific span and channel numbers
       regardless of the registration order of the hardware (or if all hardware is present at all).

       dahdi_span_assignments is used to assign those spans or to help creating the configuration file used in their assignment: /etc/dahdi/assigned-spans.conf .

SUB-COMMANDS
       There are several sub-commands.

       All sub-commands take an optional list of paths to SysFS nodes of devices. If given, the command will only operate on those DAHDI devices. The default is to operate on  all  devices  (which  would
       normally be the sane case when running from the command-line).

       add [devpath ...]
              Applies to all devices or to those listed on the command line.  Parameters are paths (in SysFS) to DAHDI devices with unassigned spans.

              The command will assign spans with DAHDI according to configuration in assigned-spans.conf.

              If no line matches the span, or if the assignment for it fails (it is not available) it will remain unassigned.

              If any of the span settings fails (the span number or range of channels is already in use), the program will print a message, but continue applying the others. In such a case you should fix
              assigned-spans.conf and re-run add (or run auto to give those channels the first available range and regenerate the file with 'dahdi_genconf assignedspans').

       remove [devpath ...]
              Applies to all devices or to those listed on the command line.  Parameters are paths (in SysFS) to DAHDI devices with assigned spans.

              The command will un-assign them.

       auto [devpath ...]
              Applies to all devices or to those listed on the command line.  Parameters are paths (in SysFS) to DAHDI devices with unassigned spans.

              Each span is assigned to first available span number and channel numbers, as if dahdi.auto_assign_span was set. The configuration file doesn't affect these assignments.

       list
              List all spans in the system.

       dumpconfig
              List  all  assigned  spans in the system in a format fit to be used in assigned-spans.conf. Use this to generate a configuration file after you have (automatically or manually) assigned all
              existing spans.

              dahdi_genconf assignedspans uses this command internally.

OPTIONS
       -v --verbose
              Verbose output.

       -n --dry-run
              Don't assign / un-assign spans. Only print commands used to do so.

       -k key
              For dumpconfig - The key by which to identify the hardware in the generated configuration. Legal values:

              hwid
                     Hardware identifier (e.g.: software-readable serial number). This is the default. If the device has no hwid, devpath is used.

              location
                     The location field (file) in the SysFS device node (directory) for the DAHDI device. If not available (typically: DAHDI version <= 2.7.x), devpath is used.

              devpath
                     Path in SysFS to the device node.

CONFIGURATION
       /etc/dahdi/assigned-spans.conf is a file with lines specifying assignment of spans.

       Empty lines or lines beginning with '#' are ignored.

       Each line is in the format of:

       ID        spanspec ...

       The ID field specifies the DAHDI device and the spanspecs define how to assign its spans. A line may have multiple spanspecs in a single line (though dumpconfig generates a configuration with  one
       per line).

   Span Identifier
       A  DAHDI device may be specified either by a hardware identifier (a software readable serial number or whatever) or the location in which it is installed on the system. The former makes it simpler
       to change connector / slot whereas the latter makes it simpler to replace a unit.

       The value in this field is matched (when the commands add and remove) are used) to the following values:

        hwid
        @location
        devpath

       See above for their descriptions. The value may include shell wildcards: *, ? and [], which are used in the match. The values to be matched are first cleaned up: '!' is replaced with '/'  and  any
       character beyond "a-zA-Z0-9/:.-" is removed.

   Span Specification
       Each line should have one or more span specifications: this is the value used to assign a span with DAHDI in the SysFS interface. A specification has three colon-separated numbers:

       rel_span_no:span_no:first_chan

       for instance, the following are four span specifications for a quad-E1 device: 1:6:53 2:7:84 3:8:115 4:9:146 occupying spans 6-9 and channels 53-176.

       rel_span_no
              The relative number of the span in the device. E.g.: port number.

       span_no
              The desired DAHDI span number. Must be available.

       first_chan
              The desired DAHDI channel number for the first DAHDI channel in the span.  All channels of the span will be assigned following it and hence that space must be available.

ENVIRONMENT
       DAHDICONFDIR
              The directory in which assigned-spans.conf resides. /etc/dahdi if not overridden from the environment.

       DAHDISASSIGNEDSPANSCONF
              The path to assigned-spans.conf resides. /etc/dahdi/assigned-spans.conf if not overridden from the environment.

       SPAN_ASSIGNMENTS_KEY
              The default value for -k . Defaults to "hwid" if not overridden from the environment.

FILES
       /etc/dahdi/assigned-spans.conf
              The default location for the configuration file.

       /sys/bus/dahdi_devices/devices/device
              SysFS node for the device. In this directory reside the following files, among others:

              location
                     The value of the device's location field.

              assign_span, unassign_span, auto_assign
                     Write only files for the operations. Used by add, remove and auto, respectively.
