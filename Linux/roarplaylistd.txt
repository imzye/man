NAME
       rpld - RoarAudio PlayList Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       rpld [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The RoarAudio PlayList Daemon is a daemon which manages playlists and can play files or streams from those lists using a RoarAudio Sound Server.

MISC OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Show a small help.

       --daemon
              Daemonize (go into background).

       --watchdog
              Start watchdog. This will automatically terminate the daemon if it stops responding.

       --server SERVER
              Set default server to the RoarAudio server (e.g. roard) at SERVER.

       --server-queue SERV
              The server to use for the Main Queue.  Normally --server should be used.

       --server-info SERV
              Copies  the serverinfo data from the given server. Use +default as server to use the data from the default server.  The following data is copied from the server: location, description, contact,
              serial and uiurl.

       --pidfile PIDFILE
              Write a pidfile at PIDFILE.

       --histsize NUM
              Set size of the default history playlist to NUM entries.  This may be overwritten by restoring a store.  The special value of "default" can be used to not alter the value.  This may be used  by
              init scripts to keep the default.

       --location  LOC
              Sets lion-readable location of server.  Examples: livingroom, room 32

       --description  DESC
              Sets lion-readable description of server.  Examples: Stereo, UKW Transmitter

       --contact CONTACT
              Sets contact information for the server.

       --serial SERIAL
              Sets the serial number for this device or server.  This is normally only used by embedded systems.

       --uiurl UIURL
              Sets  the  URL of the user interface for this device or server.  This is normally only used by embedded systems.  It is common to set this to a URL of type HTTP but all protocols are considered
              valid. This includes ssh, telnet and others.

       --plugin-load PLUGIN
              Load plugin PLUGIN.

       --plugin-args ARGS
              Set the plugin arguments for the plugin loaded next to ARGS.  This must always be used before --plugin-load.

SECURITY OPTIONS
       --user    USER
              Sets UID to USER.

       --group   GROUP
              Sets GID to GROUP.

       --allow-running-as-root
              Allow one to run as root. This is a bad thing to do.  Do never set this option. This will open very bad security holes!

STORE OPTIONS
       --restore
              Restore state from store.

       --no-restore
              Do not restore state from store.

       --auto-restore
              will restore old state if possible.  This is a non-fatal version of --restore.

       --store
              Store state on exit.

       --no-store
              Do not store state on exit.

       --store-path DIR
              Location where to store/restore from/to.

PLAYBACK OPTIONS
       --play Start in playling state.

       --stopped
              Start in stopped state (default).

       --no-default-queue
              Do not create a default queue. If set and no store is loaded or the loaded store does not contain any queues itself rpld will not connect to any RoarAudio server at  startup  at  all.  This  is
              mainly for debuggung and testing.

       --role ROLE
              Set role for streams (default: music).  The special value of "default" can be used to use the default.

       --codec-helper-rate RATE
              Set the sample rate the codec helper uses as it's output format.

       --codec-helper-bits BITS
              Set the number of bits the codec helper uses as it's output format.

       --codec-helper-channels CHANNELS
              Set the number of channels the codec helper uses as it's output format.

       --codec-helper-codec CODEC
              Set the codec the codec helper uses as it's output format.

PLAYLIST OPTIONS
       --playlist-import PLAYLIST TYPE FILE
              Load playlist PLAYLIST of type TYPE from file FILE.  The playlist is created if it does not exist.

       --playlist-export PLAYLIST TYPE FILE
              save playlist PLAYLIST to file FILE in format TYPE.
