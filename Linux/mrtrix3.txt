NAME
       MRtrix3 - diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tractography

DESCRIPTION
       MRtrix  is  a  set  of tools to perform diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tractography of the brain in the presence of crossing fibres, using Constrained Spherical Deconvolution, and a probabil‐
       isitic streamlines algorithm. Magnetic resonance images in DICOM, ANALYZE, or uncompressed NIfTI format are supported.

DEBIAN
       All MRtrix programs are installed in /usr/lib/mrtrix/bin.  You either have to call them with their full path, or extend the search path by this directory.  The MRtrix documentation has information
       on how to do that for a number of popular environments. Please note that it is not necessary to modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH -- despite the advice in the MRtrix manual.
