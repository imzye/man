BOTCH-GRAPH2TEXT(1)                                                                               botch tools                                                                               BOTCH-GRAPH2TEXT(1)

NAME
       botch-graph2text - for each vertex in a graph print a formatted line on standard output

SYNOPSIS
       botch-graph2text [options] [ingraph] formatstring

DESCRIPTION
       Given a formatstring of the form "{attr1} {attr2}...", print a line with this format for every vertex in the graph, replacing "{attr}" placeholders with the value of the attribute "attr" for that
       vertex. If no attribute with name "attr" was found, then the placeholder "{XXX}" remains in the output string. To write a literal opening or closing curly brace, type them twice, respectively.  The
       special placeholder "{__ID__}" is replaced with the vertex identifier.

       If the positional arguments is omitted, then read GraphML or dot from standard input.  Passing a '-' as either argument, explicitly specifies to read the input from standard input. The input graph
       type will be determined automatically.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display help.

       --vertex=VERT
           This option picks the set of vertices that will be output. The VERT argument is a key/value pair (separated by a colon) of a graph attribute and its value. By default (without this option), all
           vertices of the graph are considered.

           The special key "__ID__" allows one to select the unique vertex identifier.

           This option can be specified more than once. The final set of vertices is chosen such that all vertices match all key/value pairs. Multiple --vertex options thus form a logical conjunction (they
           are AND-ed together).

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

EXAMPLE
       Find all source packages that build depend on "texlive-binaries:amd64 (=2015.20150524.37493-5)".

       Using package selection and reverse dependency cone computation by ceve:

               dose-ceve -r "texlive-binaries:amd64 (= 2015.20150524.37493-5)" --deb-native-arch=amd64 -G pkg -T grml deb://Packages debsrc://Sources \
                       | botch-graph-sources - - \
                       | botch-graph2text - "{realpackage} (= {realversion})" --vertex type:src \
                       | sort

       Using package selection and ancestor vertex computation by botch:

               dose-ceve --deb-native-arch=amd64 -G pkg -T grml deb://Packages debsrc://Sources \
                       | botch-graph-ancestors - - --target realpackage:texlive-binaries:amd64 realversion:2015.20150524.37493-5 \
                       | botch-graph-sources - - \
                       | botch-graph2text - "{realpackage} (= {realversion})" --vertex type:src \
                       | sort
