NAME
       Podget - Simple tool to automate downloading of podcasts.

SYNOPSIS
       podget <options>

DESCRIPTION
       Podget is a simple podcast aggregator/downloader optimized for scheduled background jobs (i.e. cron).

       It features support for:
       - Downloading podcasts from RSS and ATOM XML feeds.
       - For sorting the files into folders and categories.
       - For importing URLs from iTunes PCAST files and OPML lists.
       - Automatic M3U & ASX playlist creation.
       - Cleanup of old files.
       - Automatic UTF-16 conversion for feeds hosted on MS Windows Servers.

       Podget  works by extracting the <enclosure> tags from the feed then downloading the specified URL.  There is one exception when Podget will ignore <enclosure> tags and that is when they are within
       <podcast:liveItem> tags because Podget is an aggregator and not a player so has not been optimized for live content.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       By default, Podget relies on two configuration files.

       podgetrc
              This is a file with most options for how Podget should run.

              If it is required to run podget with different options for certain feeds, then additional configuration files can be created and used with the --config or -c option.  When  this  option  is
              run with a new filename that does not exist yet, the file is created with default options that can then be customized as necessary.

       serverlist
              This is a file of all the feeds that Podget should monitor and download from.

              If  you  need to separate your feeds into multiple lists, then additional files can be created with the --serverlist option.  When this option is run with a new filename that does not exist
              yet, the file is created with a default list of a single feed.  Whenever a new list is created, Podget will download a single item from the single feed included by default  to  verify  that
              everything is working.

              For a description of the options available for this file, please refer to the SERVER LIST CONFIGURATION section of this document.

   USER CONFIGURATION DIRECTORY
       The first time a user runs podget, it will create a configuration directory.  In this directory, it will install the default configuration files.

       Where this configuration directory is automatically placed is dependent upon the version of Podget that you used when you first ran it.

       For version 0.8.10 and before:
              $HOME/.podget

       For later versions:
              If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set then it will be placed in:  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/podget
              IF unset, then it will be placed in: $HOME/.config/podget

       If  a  user  wants  to  clean up their $HOME directory by moving their existing configuration directory to either of the new locations, it can be done but it is necessary to remember to remove the
       leading period so it is no longer a hidden directory.
              Example:  mv $HOME/.podget $HOME/.config/podget

       These locations can be overridden by the use of the --dir_config or -d option when you run podget.

   WHICH CONFIGURATION DIRECTORY IS USED
       Since there are at least three possible locations for the configuration directory then it is necessary to know which one podget will use.  To keep things simple, Podget uses the first one it finds
       and tests in the following order:

         1.  $HOME/.podget
         2.  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/podget
         3.  $HOME/.config/podget

       This location testing is skipped by the use of the --dir_config or -d option.

   AUTOMATIC CLEANUP
       You can enable automatic cleanup with every run by configuring it in your podgetrc file. Simply set the following options:

         # Autocleanup.
         # 0 == disabled
         # 1 == delete any old content
         cleanup=1

         # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
         # older than this.
         cleanup_days=7

       However, some people prefer to run cleanup as a separate cron session. To do that, set the options in podgetrc to:

         # Autocleanup.
         # 0 == disabled
         # 1 == delete any old content
         cleanup=0

         # Number of days to keep files.   Cleanup will remove anything
         # older than this.
         cleanup_days=7

       Then add something similar to this example to your crontab:

         # Once a week on Sunday at 04:07AM
         07 04 * * Sun /usr/bin/podget -C

   MULTIPLE CONCURRENT SESSIONS
       Podget checks for sessions using the same core configuration file that may already be running when it starts and exits if any are found.  This insures that any long running sessions are not inter‐
       rupted by new ones.

       If you have feeds that require distinct configurations, then you can enable them to run simultaneously by using separate configuration files for each.  Then if you have sufficient  bandwidth,  you
       can call them all at the same time.

       Example Crontab configuration:

         00 02 * * * /usr/bin/podget -c podgetrc-group1
         00 02 * * * /usr/bin/podget -c podgetrc-group2

   SEQUENTIAL SESSIONS
       Sometimes, you have feed lists that use the same configuration but you wish to keep separate.  There are two ways to handle this.

       First, run then separately from crontab with sufficient time in between so they don't interfere with each other.

         00 02 * * * /usr/bin/podget --serverlist RSS-Feeds
         00 03 * * * /usr/bin/podget --serverlist ATOM-Feeds

       The second option is to place them into a shell script so they are called sequentially and do not interfere with each other and then add it to your crontab.

         #!/usr/bin/env bash
         /usr/bin/podget --serverlist RSS-Feeds
         /usr/bin/podget --serverlist ATOM-Feeds

   ENABLING DEBUG OUTPUT
       Debug output can be enabled in two ways.

       The  first  way is by uncommenting the DEBUG option in your podgetrc and setting it to '1'.  However this way will not enable DEBUG until just over 1400 lines of script have run and when  podgetrc
       finally is read.  This is sufficient for most issues.

       The second way is from the command-line and enables debug as early as possible.

       Simply execute podget like so:

         $ DEBUG=1 podget -vvvv

       You can enable other options as well if you need to but for debugging purposes, it is highly recommended that you enabled as much verbosity as possible.

   SERVER LIST CONFIGURATION
       By default, Podget uses serverlist for the default list of servers to contact. However you can configure the name with the config_serverlist variable in your podgetrc file.

       Feeds are listed one per line in the serverlist file.

       Default format with category and name:
              <url> <category> <name>

       Alternate Formats:
       1. With a category but no name.
              <url> <category>
       2. With a name but no category (2 ways).
              <url> No_Category <name>
              <url> . <name>
       3. With neither a category or name.
              <url>

       1. URL Rules:
              A. Any spaces in the URL need to be converted to %20
       2. Category Rules:
              A. Must be one word without spaces.
              B. You may use underscores and dashes.
              C. You can insert date substitutions.
                     %YY%  ==  Year
                     %MM%  ==  Month
                     %DD%  ==  Day
              D. Category disabling:
                     - With a name, the category must either be a single period (.) or 'No_Category'.
                     - If the name is blank, the category can also be blank.
       3. Name Rules:
              A. If you are creating ASX playlists, make sure the feed name does not have any spaces in it and the filename cannot be blank.
              B. You can leave the feed name blank, and files will be saved in the category directory.
              C. Names with spaces are only compatible with filesystems that allow for spaces in filenames.  For example, spaces in feed names are OK for feeds saved to Linux ext partitions but  are  not
              OK for those saved to Microsoft FAT partitions.
              D. Feed names can be disabled by leaving them blank.
       4. Disable the downloading of any feed by commenting it out with a leading #.

       Example:
        http://www.lugradio.org/episodes.rss Linux LUG Radio

       Example with date substitution in the category and a blank feed name:
        https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/worldservice/summary/rss.xml News-%YY%-%MM%-%DD%

       Example of two ways to do a feed with authentication:
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name USER:username PASS:password
        http://username:password@somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name

              NOTE: The second method will fail if a colon (:) is part of the username or password.  Both methods will fail if a space is part of the username or password.

       Common Options:

       OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION
              Attempt to get filename from the Content-Disposition tag that is part of wget --server-response.

       OPT_DISPOSITION_FAIL
              This  option works in conjunction with OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION by removing any URLs that fail to receive a filename from the COMPLETED log.  This allows them to be automatically retried the
              next time a session runs.  If this option is added to a feed that has already been downloaded then the user will need to remove the URLs for the problematic files  from  the  COMPLETED  log
              manually. On one feed this allowed for the improvement of the number of filename problems from approximately 15% to under 2% over the course of 6 sessions.  Those sessions can occur sequen‐
              tially on one day or as part of your established cron rotation.

       OPT_FEED_ORDER_ASCENDING
              By  default,  Podget  assumes  that items in a feed will be listed from newest to oldest (descending order).  This option will modify Podget's handling of the feed for those that are listed
              from oldest to newest.  This option will not have any noticeable effect for feeds where you want to download every item.  It will have an effect for new feeds when combined with  the  --re‐
              cent [COUNT] option.

       OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_NEWFIRST
              Most  playlist  options  create  lists  of  just the new items that are downloaded in the current session.  This option creates or updates a full playlist for all items available for a feed
              sorted from newest to oldest based on the modification date/time of the file.

       OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_OLDFIRST
              Same as OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_NEWFIRST except playlist is ordered from oldest to newest.

       OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION
              Some feeds do not have the detailed filename listed in the FEED but rather rename the file on redirection.  This option addresses that issue by attempting to grab the filename from the last
              'Location:' tag in the output of 'wget --server-response'.

       OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE
              For feeds that use a singular filename for each item that is identified by a long somewhat incomprehensible string in the URL.  These feeds were previously  fixed  with  FILENAME_FORMATFIX4
              which would append the string to the common filename to produce unique filenames for each item.  However this produced filenames that were not very easy to understand.  This option gives us
              another  method  for  dealing  with  these  common  filenames.  This appends the date of the files last change (modification date) as a prefix to the filename in the format of YYYYMMDD_HHh‐
              MMm_<common-part>.  This makes the filenames sortable and gives the user something that makes a moderate amount of sense.  Does not work for all feeds, for some feeds the last  modification
              time for each file is the time of download.  Which may be acceptable in some situations but can cause confusion when downloading more than one item at a time from a feed.

       OPT_WGET_DEFUSERAGENT
              Configure  Wget  to  use  it's  default  user-agent  (normally  formatted  similar  to  "Wget/1.21.2")  and to not use either Podget's default user-agent ("Podget") or a custom agent set in
              WGET_BASEOPTS in podgetrc.

       OPT_NO_CERT_CHECK
              Disable wget SSL certificate verification.  This is common used for feeds that are using self-signed certificates.

       OPT_PREFER_IPv4 or OPT_PREFER_IPv6
              Configure wget so that when a DNS lookup gives a choice of several addresses that it should connect to the specified family first.

       Examples:
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_PREFER_IPv4
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_PREFER_IPv6
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_WGET_DEFUSERAGENT
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_NO_CERT_CHECK
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_CONTENT_DISPOSITION OPT_DISPOSITION_FAIL
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_LOCATION OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FEED_ORDER_ASCENDING
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_NEWFIRST
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FEED_PLAYLIST_OLDFIRST

       RSS Feed Options:
              There are three options for RSS Feeds that are not supported for ATOM feeds.

              The first two are related with the renaming the downloaded files with the contents of the <TITLE> tag from the HTML and the third is to expand what tags Podget gets content from.

       OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG
              This first version is for handling feeds that place the <TITLE> tag before the <ENCLOSURE> tag.  The majority of tested feeds that use <TITLE> tags follow this order.

       OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_REVTITLETAG
              The second version is for handling feeds that have the <ENCLOSURE> tag first followed by the <TITLE> tag.

       OPT_RSS_MEDIACONTENT
              This third option will enable Podget to download content from <MEDIA:CONTENT> tags in addition to <ENCLOSURE> tags.

       Examples:
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_REVTITLETAG
        http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name OPT_RSS_MEDIACONTENT

       To determine if the feed uses <TITLE> tags and in which order, run the following with the URL for the feed:

               wget -O - http://somesite.com/feed.rss | sed -n -e :a -e 's/.*<enclosure.*url\s*=\s*"\([^"]+\)".*/URL 1/Ip' -e t -e "s/.*<enclosure.*url\s*'=\s*\([^i]\+\)'.*/URL \1/Ip" -e t -e 's/.*<title>\(.*\)<[/]title>.*$/TITLE 1/Ip' -e t -e '/\(<enclosure\|<title>\).*/I{N;s/ *0 /;T;ba}'

       This will produce a list of lines that start with either TITLE or URL.  The  URL is from the <ENCLOSURE> tag and the TITLE is obviously from the <TITLE> tag.  On many feeds  the  first  thing  you
       will notice is a few uses of the <TITLE> tag before the first URL is specified.  In that case, Podget uses the last TITLE found, so the earlier ones are discard.  The important part is when we get
       to  the  first URL, from there we need to determine if the title for that item came before or after the URL.  If it comes first then we use OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_TITLETAG for it.  If the title comes
       second then we use OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_REVTITLETAG.

       On some feeds, the downloaded filename will not have anything identifiable to determine which TITLE goes with it.  In those cases it may be necessary to download a few items and listen to them  to
       determine which order they use.

       On some feeds, it will be discovered that the downloaded filename and the TITLE are very similar.  In those cases, it is left to the user to determine which they prefer.

       On  some  feeds,  the  TITLE will have very little to specify when it was recorded and it may be useful to use the OPT_FILENAME_RENAME_MDATE option to add a date tag to each filename as it is con‐
       verted.

       And on some feeds, there will be a complete absence of TITLE lines.  Those feeds do not use the tag so using either option will not produce any changes.

       Atom Feed Options:
              The following options are available for advanced handling of Atom feeds.

       ATOM_FILTER_SIMPLE
              This option will enable filtering for just audio or video files from a feed.

       ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="type"
              This option allows more detailed filtering of the variety of types available.  This can limit the files downloaded to one type (example:  "audio/mpeg") or to a  few  types  (example:  "(au‐
              dio|video)/.*" for all audio and video types, OR "audio/.*" for all audio types).

       ATOM_FILTER_LANG="language"
              If  an Atom feed supports multiple languages for enclosures, then you can use this option to filter to only those you desire.  You can limit to one language (example: "en" for just English)
              or combine several supported languages to get them all (example: "(en|es|fr)" to download files in English, Spanish and French.  How the languages are defined may vary from feed to feed.

       Note:  If you do not enable any of the ATOM_FILTER options on a feed with multiple enclosures per item, when you run podget it will tell you the count per type or language to help  you  decide  if
       you should enable the filters to reduce the number of files to be downloaded.

       Examples:
        http://somesite.com/feed CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_SIMPLE
        http://somesite.com/feed CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="audio/mpeg"
        http://somesite.com/feed CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="(audio|video)/.*"
        http://somesite.com/feed CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_LANG="en"
        http://somesite.com/feed CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_LANG="(en|es|fr)"
        http://somesite.com/feed CATEGORY Feed Name ATOM_FILTER_TYPE="audio/mpeg" ATOM_FILTER_LANG="en"

   HANDLING UTF-16 FEEDS
       Some servers provide their feeds in UTF-16 format rather than the more common UTF-8.

       To automatically convert these files, create a secondary serverlist in your configuration directory:

               serverlist.utf16

       Remember to change the name of the serverlist to match what you set it to with config_serverlist if you changed it.

EXAMPLE CRON JOB
       Once  podget is  running correctly, it's most useful if you run it from a cron job so that the new episodes are available to play or load onto a portable player and you don't have to wait for them
       to download.

       To edit your crontab, do:

         $ crontab -e

       Then add one line similar to this example:

         15 04 * * * /usr/bin/podget -s

       This will run podget at 4:15 AM every day.

       In some cases, you might need to add a few directories to your PATH variable so that Podget can find everything it needs.

       Then the job might look like:

         15 04 * * * PATH=/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH /usr/bin/podget -s

INFORMATION AND DEBUG MESSAGES
       Sometimes when you are running Podget, it is nice to get a bit more information about what is happening to pinpoint what is causing a problem.  With that in mind, Podget makes it possible to  dis‐
       play more of what is happening behind the scenes.

       For informational messages:

         $ INFO= podget

       INFO can be set to any value or none.  It just matters that the variable is set.

       By default any informational message line will be prefixed with 'INFO  --'.

       Debug messages get deeper into what is happening and are available in 5 levels.

       By default Debug messages are disabled and are the equivalent of running:

         $ DEBUG=0 podget

       Higher Debug levels can be enabled and include these options.

         $ DEBUG=1 podget

       Level 1 Debug includes:
       - Informational messages.
       - Debugging messages (by default prefixed with 'DEBUG --').

         $ DEBUG=2 podget

       Level 2 Debug includes:
       - Informational messages.
       - Debugging messages.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for xtrace.  The shell will print the expanded version of each command and arguments as they are run.

         $ DEBUG=3 podget

       Level 3 Debug includes:
       - Informational messages.
       - Debugging messages.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for xtrace.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for verbose.  This will cause the script to print each line as they are read without expanding anything.

         $ DEBUG=4 podget

       Level 4 Debug includes:
       - Informational messages.
       - Debugging messages.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for xtrace.
       - Enable Bash Shell option for functrace.  When enabled any traps on DEBUG and RETURN are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions and subshells.
       - Enable Bash shell debug trap.  Podget uses a very simple debug trap that causes each line as it is read to be printed with the line number it is on.  This is effectively a slightly improved ver‐
       sion of what the verbose option tells us.

   Special Handling for Debug messages.
       The  majority  of  the  output from Podget is set to the STDOUT stream.  However, when using Debug modes at level 2 or above, the additional messages are sent to the STDERR stream.  For most uses,
       this is just fine.  However if you wish to pipe the output to another command then it may be necessary to merge the two streams back together so they are displayed in the expected order.

       For example to pipe the output of Podget to less, you could run:

         $ DEBUG=2 podget 2>&1 | less
