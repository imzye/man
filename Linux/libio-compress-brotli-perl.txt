NAME
       IO::Compress::Brotli - Write Brotli buffers/streams

SYNOPSIS
         use IO::Compress::Brotli;

         # compress a buffer
         my $encoded = bro $encoded;

         # compress a stream
         my $bro = IO::Compress::Brotli->create;
         while(have_input()) {
            my $block = get_input_block();
            my $encoded_block = $bro->compress($block);
            handle_output_block($encoded_block);
         }
         # Need to finish the steam
         handle_output_block($bro->finish());

DESCRIPTION
       IO::Compress::Brotli is a module that compressed Brotli buffers and streams. Despite its name, it is not a subclass of IO::Compress::Base and does not implement its interface. This will be
       rectified in a future release.

   One-shot interface
       If you have the whole buffer in a Perl scalar use the bro function.

       bro($input)
           Takes a whole uncompressed buffer as input and returns the compressed data.

           Exported by default.

   Streaming interface
       If you want to process the data in blocks use the object oriented interface. The available methods are:

       IO::Compress::Brotli->create
           Returns a IO::Compress::Brotli instance. Please note that a single instance cannot be used to decompress multiple streams.

       $bro->window($window)
           Sets the window parameter on the brotli encoder.  Defaults to BROTLI_DEFAULT_WINDOW (22).

       $bro->quality($quality)
           Sets the quality paremeter on the brotli encoder.  Defaults to BROTLI_DEFAULT_QUALITY (11).

       $bro->mode($mode)
           Sets the brotli encoder mode, which can be any of "generic", "text" or "font". Defaults to "generic".

       $bro->compress($block)
           Takes the a block of uncompressed data and returns a block of compressed data. Dies on error.

       $bro->flush()
           Flushes any pending output from the encoder.

       $bro->finish()
           Tells the encoder to start the finish operation, and flushes any remaining compressed output.

           Once finish is called, the encoder cannot be used to compress any more content.

           NOTE: Calling finish is required, or the output might remain unflushed, and the be missing termination marks.
