FASTJET-CONFIG(1)                                                                              User Commands                                                                              FASTJET-CONFIG(1)

NAME
       fastjet-config - fastjet-config

DESCRIPTION
       This is FastJet configuration tool.  Usage:

              fastjet-config [--help] [--version] [--prefix] [--cxxflags] [--libs]

              [--shared[=yes|no]] [--plugins[=yes|no]] [--rpath[=yes|no]] [--runpath] [--list-plugins] [--config]

       The arguments can be either queries (one must be present):

       --help prints this message and exits

       --version
              prints FastJet version and exits

       --prefix
              gets the FastJet installation directory

       --cxxflags
              returns the compilation flags to be used with C++ programs

       --libs returns the flags to pass to the linker

       or flags (optional):

       --shared
              controls whether you want to use the static or shared lib (default=yes)

       --plugins
              controls whether you also want to link the FastJet plugins (default=no)

       --rpath
              adds  a  -rpath argument at link-time that points to the directory where FastJet libraries are installed. This avoid having to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime when using shared libs in a non
              standard location (but may cause the program to inadvertently pick up other shared libraries that happen to be in the FastJet installation directory).  (default=yes)

       --runpath
              at link-time, adds info about the directory where FastJet libraries are installed to the runpath (ELF systens only). This avoids having to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime when  using  shared
              libs in a non standard location but gives priority to an existing LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

       --list-plugins
              list all the available plugins

       --config
              shows a summary of how FastJet was configured
