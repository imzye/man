NAME
       faxcover - generate a POSTSCRIPT cover page for an outgoing facsimile

SYNOPSIS
       faxcover [ options ] -f from-name -n fax-number

DESCRIPTION
       faxcover generates a POSTSCRIPT® cover page document on the standard output.  The cover page fills the entire area of a default page and is created according to the information supplied on the command
       line and a cover sheet template file.

       faxcover is normally invoked by the sendfax(1) program to generate a cover page for each outgoing facsimile.

       faxcover works by creating a POSTSCRIPT dictionary that contains definitions for the variable information that is to be placed on the facsimile cover page.  Specifically, a dictionary with the follow‐
       ing symbols are defined:
       Symbol             Description                        Symbol               Description
       to                 destination person                 from                 sending person
       to-company         destination company                from-company         sender's company
       to-location        destination geographic location    from-location        sender geographic location
       to-voice-number    person's voice phone number        from-voice-number    sender's voice phone number
       to-fax-number      destination fax phone number       from-fax-number      sender's fax phone number
                                                             from-mail-address    sender's e-mail address
       comments           unbroken comment string            commentsX            X'th line of comments
       regarding          Re: subject                        CommentX             similar to commentsX
       pageWidth          page width in millimeters          page-count           # pages other than cover page
       pageLength         page length in millimeters         todays-date          current date and time

       If  the  comments  string is longer than maxlencomments characters, it is broken, on word boundaries or instances of ``\n´´, into multiple POSTSCRIPT strings commentsX where X is the line number; e.g.
       comments2 for the second line of comments.  Long substrings without whitespace which exceed maxlencomments are also broken. By default faxcover will generate 20 commentsX strings, emitting null string
       values for empty lines.  This number can be changed with the -m option; see below.  maxlencomments is changed with the -z option; see below.

       Note  that use of commentsX with non-fixed-width fonts can lead to spatial problems where characters run off the edge of the generated cover page.  In such cases, use of BreakIntoLines (see below) may
       be a more suitable approach.

       CommentX is similar to commentsX except that its values are created only by breaking comments on instances of ``\n´´ and not otherwise.  maxlines does not affect CommentX

       faxcover also emits a POSTSCRIPT procedure for breaking comment strings into multiple lines using the POSTSCRIPT font metric information.  This procedure is named BreakIntoLines and has the  following
       usage convention:

       %<line-width> <line-height> <x> <y> <string> BreakIntoLines -

       eg
              /rule (_____________________________________________) def
              /lw rule stringwidth pop def /lh 30 def
              /y 191.4 def /x 0 def
              y -30 0 { x exch moveto rule show } for
              lw lh x y comments BreakIntoLines
       where  the  width of the rule controls the length of each line of comments (note that it is made slightly shorter here for the purpose of presentation), x and y are initialized to coordinate locations
       on the page where the comment string should be imaged, and the number 30 is the inter-line spacing appropriate for the font used to image the comment lines.

       If information is unavailable for an item, the associated POSTSCRIPT symbol is defined to be a null string.

       Following the definition prologue, a cover sheet template file is copied.  This file is expected to be a POSTSCRIPT program that uses the generated strings to create a cover page.  The  template  must
       include  a  showpage operator to cause the page to be imaged.  The above symbols will be defined in the current dictionary.  A trailing end operator is supplied by faxcover, so any manipulation of the
       dictionary stack should leave the current dictionary on the top of the stack on completion.

OPTIONS
       -c comments Use comments for the comment string. You may use '\n' to break it into several lines on generated the cover page.

       -C file     Use file as the template file.  The default template file is named faxcover.ps.  The template file can also be specified by setting the FAXCOVER  environment  variable.   If  the  template
                   filename is not an absolute pathname, then faxcover looks first for this file in the home directory of the sender.  If no such file is present, then it looks in the library directory where
                   the HylaFAX client application data are installed.  If no template file is located, faxcover will terminate without generating a cover page.

       -D format   Use format as the formatting specification passed to strftime(3) when generating the time and date placed on the cover page.

       -f name     Use name for the sender's identity.

       -l location Use location for the geographic location of the destination company.

       -L location Use location for the geographic location of the sender's company.

       -m maxlines indicates the maximum number of commentsX lines to generate.

       -M address  Use address for the sender's e-mail address.

       -n number   Use number for the destination fax machine number.

       -N number   Use number for the sender's fax machine number.

       -p count    Use count for the count of pages to follow the cover page.

       -r regarding
                   Use regarding for the ``Re:'' field.

       -s size     Set the page size to use for the transmitted facsimile.  Facsimile are normally imaged with a system-default page size (usually letter-size pages, 8.5" by 11", for sites in North America).
                   Alternate page sizes are specified symbolically using either the name or abbreviation of an entry in the pagesizes(5) database; e.g.  a3 (ISO A3), a4 (ISO A4), a5 (ISO A5), a6 (ISO A6), b4
                   (ISO B4), na-let (North American Letter), us-leg (American Legal), us-led (American Ledger), us-exe (American Executive), jp-let (Japanese Letter), and jp-leg  (Japanese  Legal).   Compar‐
                   isons are case-insensitive and any match of a substring of the full page-size name is sufficient; e.g. ``legal'' would match ``American Legal''.

                   Note  that  it  may  not be permissible to image into the full page area; the guaranteed reproducible area for a page is typically inset.  Also, note that while arbitrary page sizes can be
                   specified through the page size database, only a limited set of page dimensions are supported by the Group 3 facsimile protocol.  Thus if an odd-size facsimile is submitted  for  transmis‐
                   sion it may not be possible to determine if it can be sent until the fax server establishes communication with the remote facsimile machine.

       -t name     Use name for the receiver's identity.

       -v number   Use number for the receiver's voice phone number.

       -V number   Use number for the sender's voice phone number.

       -x company  Use company for the destination company name.

       -X company  Use company for the sender's company name.

       -z maxlencomments
                   indicates the maximum length in number of characters allowed in a commentsX string.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Complaints about not being able to locate a template file.
