NAME
       aubiotrack  -  a  command line tool to extract musical beats from audio
       signals

SYNOPSIS
       aubiotrack source
       aubiotrack [[-i] source] [-o sink]
                  [-r rate] [-B win] [-H hop]
                  [-T time-format]
                  [-s sil] [-m]
                  [-j] [-N miditap-note] [-V miditap-velo]
                  [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       aubiotrack attempts to detect beats, the time  where  one  would  intu‐
       itively be tapping his foot.

       When  started with an input source (-i/--input), the detected beats are
       given on the console, in seconds.

       When  started  without  an  input  source,  or  with  the  jack  option
       (-j/--jack), aubiotrack starts in jack mode.

OPTIONS
       This  program  follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long op‐
       tions starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options  is  included
       below.

       -i, --input source
              Run  analysis  on  this  audio  file. Most uncompressed and com‐
              pressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

       -o, --output sink
              Save results in this file. The file will be created on the model
              of  the  input file. Beats are marked by a short wood-block like
              sound.

       -r, --samplerate rate
              Fetch the input source, resampled at the  given  sampling  rate.
              The  rate  should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0, the
              sampling rate of the original source will be used.  Defaults  to
              0.

       -B, --bufsize win
              The  size  of  the  buffer to analyze, that is the length of the
              window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults  to
              512.

       -H, --hopsize hop
              The  number  of  samples  between two consecutive analysis.  De‐
              faults to 256.

       -s, --silence sil
              Set the silence threshold, in dB, under which the pitch will not
              be  detected.  A  value of -20.0 would eliminate most onsets but
              the loudest ones. A value of -90.0 would select all onsets.  De‐
              faults to -90.0.

       -m, --mix-input
              Mix source signal to the output signal before writing to sink.

       -f, --force-overwrite
              Overwrite output file if it already exists.

       -j, --jack
              Use  Jack  input/output.  You  will  need a Jack connection con‐
              troller to feed aubio some signal and listen to its output.

       -N, --miditap-note
              Override note value for MIDI tap. Defaults to 69.

       -V, --miditap-velop
              Override velocity value for MIDI tap. Defaults to 65.

       -T, --timeformat format
              Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to seconds.

       -h, --help
              Print a short help message and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose.
