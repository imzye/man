NAME
       gamgi - general atomistic modelling graphic interface

SYNOPSIS
       gamgi [file_1.xml] ...  [file_n.xml]

DESCRIPTION
       gamgi is a computer package to construct, view and analyse atomic structures.

OPTIONS
       file_n.xml is a fullname such as:

           ../dat/molecule/flavors/garlic.xml
           ~/gamgi/dat/molecule/flavors/garlic.xml
           http://www.gamgi.org/dat/molecule/flavors/garlic.xml
           ftp://ftp.gamgi.org/gamgi/dat/molecule/flavors/garlic.xml

       Object and config data can be mixed, so file_1.xml might be a preferences file, loaded before the other object files. To automate the procedure, just add a line as this to ~/.bashrc:

              alias gamgi='gamgi ~/gamgi/my_defaults.xml'

ENVIRONMENT
       GAMGI_HELP
              Set this variable to let GAMGI know where the Help documentation files are.  For example, add a line as this to ~/.bashrc :

              GAMGI_HELP=~/gamgi/gamgi/doc; export GAMGI_HELP

       GAMGI_TEXT
              Set this variable to let GAMGI know where are the .ttf DejaVu files, to render solid fonts. For example, add a line as this to ~/.bashrc:

              GAMGI_TEXT=~/gamgi/gamgi/src/io/fonts; export GAMGI_TEXT

       BROWSER
              Set this variable to let GAMGI know which browser to launch, in case this is chosen to read Help. For example, add a line as this to ~/.bashrc:

              BROWSER=firefox; export BROWSER

HELP
       Read introductory information with Help->Start. Browse the documentation at http://www.gamgi.org/ or its local copy at gamgi/doc/. Use the help mechanisms reunited under the Help button. Sub‐
       scribe the mailling list <gamgi-users@gamgi.org>.

       Throughout  all  interfaces  and  formats, lengths are in angstrom, angles in degrees and decimal numbers are represented with dots. Every parameter that can be defined in an interface can be
       also defined in a file and vice-versa.

INTERFACES
       Rotate, move, scale the selected object pressing the left, middle, right mouse button. Export the selected object choosing File->Export. The statusbar shows the  selected  object  (left)  and
       layer (right).

       To  select  an  object,  choose  Object->Select  and press over the object. Or choose the object class on the menu above, with the middle button, before pressing on the object. Or press twice
       Layer, Window or GAMGI on the menu above. When the object has no visual representation, press the mouse over the graphic area, to pop up a menu.

       To select a layer, choose Layer->Select and press the mouse over the graphic area, to pop up a menu. Or choose the layer class on the menu above, with the middle button, before  pressing  the
       mouse over the graphic area, to pop up a menu.

       Solid  objects  usually require lights with diffuse and specular components to be properly represented in 3D space, otherwise they look flat. Wired objects do not have a 3D representation, so
       diffuse and specular lights are not reflected, becoming poorly visible when using lights, unless a significant ambient component is used. Often it is worth to draw solid and wired objects  in
       different layers, with and without lights.

       When a task dialog is open, to learn how it works, just select Help->Current and another dialog will pop up, explaining the meaning of all the parameters in the task dialog.

       To see detailed explanations of GAMGI interfaces, consult the reference manual at http://www.gamgi.org/interfaces/reference.html, doc/interfaces/reference.html or Help->Topic->Interfaces.

FORMATS
       GAMGI can import files in .xyz and .xml native format, selected automatically by the file extension. GAMGI can export files in .ps, .ppm, .jp[e]g, .png, .tif[f], .x3d and native .xml formats,
       selected automatically by the file extension.

       In GAMGI native XML format, a water molecule can be described as:

       <gml>
         <molecule>
           <atom element="O"  x="0.000" y="0.000" z="0.000" id="O1"/>
           <atom element="H"  x="0.776" y="0.540" z="0.000" id="H1"/>
           <atom element="H" x="-0.776" y="0.540" z="0.000" id="H2"/>

           <bond parent1="O1" parent2="H1"/>
           <bond parent1="O1" parent2="H2"/>
         </molecule>
       </gml>

       To see detailed explanations of GAMGI formats, consult the reference manual at http://www.gamgi.org/formats/reference.html, doc/formats/reference.html or Help->Topic->Formats.
