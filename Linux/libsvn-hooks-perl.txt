NAME
       SVN::Hooks::CheckLog - Check log messages in commits.

VERSION
       version 1.36

SYNOPSIS
       This SVN::Hooks plugin allows one to check if the log message in a 'svn commit' conforms to a Regexp.

       It's active in the "pre-commit" hook.

       It's configured by the following directive.

   CHECK_LOG(REGEXP[, MESSAGE])
       The REGEXP argument must be a qr/quoted regexp/ which must match the commit log messages. If it doesn't, then the commit is aborted.

       The MESSAGE argument is an optional error message that is shown to the user in case the check fails.

               CHECK_LOG(qr/.../ => "The log message cannot be empty!");
               CHECK_LOG(qr/^\[(prj1|prj2|prj3)\]/
                         => "The log message must start with a project tag.");
