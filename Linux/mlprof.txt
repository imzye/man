NAME
       mlprof - display profiling information for a MLton-compiled executable

SYNOPSIS
       mlprof [option ...] a.out [mlmon.out ...]

DESCRIPTION
       mlprof extracts information from an executable compiled by MLton with -profile alloc or -profile time and the resulting mlmon.out file produced by running the executable.

       The  output of mlprof consists of an initial line indicating the total amount of CPU time or bytes allocated.  After this, source functions are listed along with the percentage of this total that they
       used, in decreasing order.  If the program was compiled with -profile-stack true, mlprof will display the time spent or bytes allocated while the function was on the stack and in GC in addition to the
       time or bytes that the function is directly responsible for.

       With multiple mlmon.out files, mlprof will sum the profiling information.

OPTIONS
       -call-graph file
              Write a call graph containing the table data to a dot file.  See the MLton User Guide for details.

       -graph-title string
              Set the call-graph title.

       -gray {false|true}
              Gray call-graph nodes according to stack %.  This only makes sense if the executable was compiled -profile-stack true.

       -keep exp
              Only show functions specified by exp.  For details on the allowed expressions, see the MLton User Guide.  Multiple -keep expressions are not allowed.

       -mlmon file
              Process the list of whitespace-separated mlmon.out files found in the specified file.

       -raw {false|true}
              Show the raw counts in addition to the percentages.

       -show-line {false|true}
              Show the file and line for each function.

       -split regexp
              Treat duplicates of functions whose name matches regexp as different functions.

       -thresh x
              An abbreviation for -keep '(thresh x)', which only prints information about functions whose percentage is greater than or equal to x, where 0 <= x <= 100.0.

       -tolerant {false|true}
              Print a warning about broken mlmon.out files, but do not exit.
