NAME
       ml-yacc - a parser generator for ML

SYNOPSIS
       ml-yacc file

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the ml-yacc command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  The ml-yacc pro‐
       gram generates a parser for an LALR language from the specification in file. Two files are generated, file.sig and file.sml.

SEE ALSO
       sml(1), ml-lex(1), ml-makedepend(1), ml-build(1).
       The programs are documented fully by The ML-Yacc User's Manual, David R. Tarditi and Andrew W. Appel, which is available in /usr/share/doc/smlnj-doc/mlyacc.pdf.gz.
