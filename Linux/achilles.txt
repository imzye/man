NAME
       achilles - OpenGL simulation of artificial life and evolution

SYNOPSIS
       achilles [-x <num of blocks in x axis> ] [-z <num of blocks in z axis> ] [-f <num of initial foods> ] [ <num of initial creatures> ] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly  the  achilles commands.  It is an artificial evolution simulation based on Hebbian neural networks and ideas set forth in Larry Yaeger's PolyWorld.  Run the
       achilles -h command to find out the default values for the options.

OPTIONS
       -x <num of blocks in the x axis>

       -z <num of blocks in the z axis>
              How big the world should be, along the z axis.

       -f <num of initial foods>
              How many food items there should be at the start.

       <num of initial creatures>
