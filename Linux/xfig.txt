NAME
       xfig - Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11
       Version 3.2.9a

SYNOPSIS
       xfig [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       Xfig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects interactively under the X Window System.  If file is given, it specifies the name of a file to be edited.

       The  bulk  of  the  documentation for xfig is in an HTML-based reference guide.  See the Help menu in xfig or point your browser at /usr/share/doc/xfig/html/index.html.  There are both English and
       Japanese versions.

       When using a two-button mouse instead of a three-button mouse, use the <Meta> key and the right button at the same time to effect the action of the middle button.

       Xfig is available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcj/.

       The Fig2dev package is used when printing or exporting the output from xfig.  The fig2dev program is automatically called by xfig as a back-end processor to produce various types of output:

       LaTeX, Metafont, PDF, PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript, CGM and EMF (mostyl used under Windows), tk (tcl/tk tool command language/tool kit package), SVG, GIF, JPEG, PCX, PNG, PPM, TIFF,  XBM,
       XPM, Gerber, AutoCAD Slide, IBM-GL (HP/GL), Pic and PiCTeX.  For use with TeX/LaTeX: box, epic, eepic, eepicemu, pict2e, pstricks, tikz.

       See man fig2dev for all options.

       The Fig2dev package is available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcj/.

OPTIONS
       -help
              Print all command-line options for xfig and quit.

       -a[llownegcoords]
              Allow panning into the negative region of the canvas.  This is the default

       -au[torefresh]
              Make xfig look at the timestamp on the .fig file and automatically load it and display it every time it changes.

       -bal[loon_delay] msec
              Cause popup information balloons to be delayed by msec milliseconds.  The default is 500 milliseconds.

       -butt[on] font
              Cause the font used for most buttons to be font (default = 6x13).

       -but_[per_row] number
              Specify the number of buttons wide the mode panel should be.  This is useful in conjunction with the -pheight parameter to reduce the canvas height for small screens.

       -cbg color
              Use color as the background color for the canvas.  If you want to set the background of everything in xfig (e.g. menus, etc.) use the general -bg option.

       -center
              Set the print option to print the figure centered on the page.  This is the default.

       -centim[ers]
              Make centimeters the unit of choice.  See also -metric.

       -cfg color
              Use color as the default color for objects.  If you want to set the foreground of everything in xfig (e.g. menus, etc.) use the general -fg option.

       -correct_font_size
              Normally,  fig2dev  uses  1/80 inch for font size increments (for historical reasons), instead of the more proper ``points'' (1/72 inch) that xfig uses.  This option makes xfig call fig2dev
              with the -F option to make it use points (1/72 inch).

       -deb[ug]
              Turn on debugging mode.  Prints various debugging messages like font names etc.

       -dep[th]
              Choose depth of visual desired.  Your server must support the desired visual and depth chosen.  Use xdpyinfo to see what visuals and depths are supported.  See also the -visual option.

       -donta[llownegcoords]
              Don't allow panning into the negative region of the canvas.  The default is to allow panning in the negative region.

       -dontshowb[alloons]
              Prevents xfig from popping up the information balloons.  See also -showballoons.

       -dontshowl[engths]
              Don't show lengths of lines as they are being drawn.  This is the default.

       -dontshowz[erolines]
              Don't show axis zero lines on the canvas.  The default is to show them.

       -dontsw[itchcmap]
              Prevents xfig from switching to a private colormap if there aren't enough colors available in the default colormap.  See also -max_image_colors.

       -exportL[anguage] language
              Specifies the default language to be used for when exporting a fig file.  Choices are:

              xpm     X11 Pixmap
              ---------------------------------------------------------------

       -export_m[argin] width
              Set the size of the border margin around the figure for exporting to bitmap, PostScript, Encapsulated PostScript, or HTML MAP formats.  This is in units of points (1/72th  inch).   The  de‐
              fault is 0.

       -fli[pvisualhints]
              Flip left/right mouse indicator messages for mice whose buttons have been switched.  The default is to NOT flip the messages.

       -flu[shleft]
              Set the print option to print the figure flush left.  The default is to center the figure on the page.

       -free[hand_resolution] resolution
              Set the resolution of the freehand drawing mode to resolution pixels.  This is the number of pixels the mouse must move before xfig adds another point to the object being drawn.

       -geom[etry] [WxH][+X+Y]
              You may use the -geometry option or resource to size and/or position the xfig window, or you may use -pwidth and/or -pheight to specify the canvas size in inches or centimeters.  If you use
              the -geom option to make the xfig window smaller than the default, you may have to use the -but_per_row option to tell xfig to put 3 or 4 buttons per row on the left mode panel.

       -gh[ostscript] ghostscript executable
              Specify  the  name or path to the ghostscript executable.  The default is gs.  This version of xfig links into the ghostscript library.  The ghostscript executable is not needed, it is only
              called as a fallback-solution.

       -grid_c[olor] color
              Draw the grid on the canvas in this color (default: red).

       -grid_u[nit] unit
              Only used when in inches mode to choose between showing fractions or decimal inches in the rulers and grid.  Any of the following may be used to force decimal inches: "ten",  "tenth",  "10,
              "1/10".  If any other value is used for this option, the rulers will show 1/16 inch divisions.

       -hidd[entext]
              Start  xfig with the hidden text mode for text objects.  The Hidden attribute is used for figures that will be used with LaTeX and is applicable only to the display of the document in xfig.
              It means that the text itself is not shown onscreen, but only the string ``<text>''.  This is to keep long sequences of LaTeX formatting commands from making the screen messy  and  hard  to
              read.  The default for the Hidden flag is off.

       -dontshowd[epthmanager]
              Hide the depth manager panel.  The default is to show the panel.

       -icon_[view]
              Show the library objects as icons.  This is the default.  The other mode is -list_view.

       -iconG[eometry] +X+Y
              Specifies the position for the icon.

       -ima[ge_editor] editor
              Specify bitmap editor to use when ``Edit Image'' button is pressed in Picture Object panel.

       -inc[hes] (or -imp[erial])
              Make inches the unit of choice.  This is the default.

       -ins[tallowncmap]
              Install own colormap. Normally, xfig uses the current colormap.

       -internalBW width
              Use lines of width width between all buttons and panels (default 1).

       -jpeg[_quality] quality
              Set the quality factor for exporting to the jpeg format.  The default is 75.

       -k[eyFile] compose-key-file
              Use  compose-key-file  instead  of  CompKeyDB  for compose (meta) key database.  If there are no ``/''s in the name, the file must reside in the xfig library directory, $XFIGLIBDIR, usually
              /usr/local/lib/X11/xfig.  If there are any ``/''s in the name it is taken as is (not relative to $XFIGLIBDIR).  If there is a leading ``~/'' in the string then the ``~'' is expanded to  the
              user's home directory.

       -lan[dscape]
              Make  xfig  come  up  in  landscape mode (10.5" x 8").  This is the default; however as the orientation is stored with Fig files, when you load a Fig file the orientation will change as re‐
              quired.  This is only true for files of version 3.0 or higher.
              See also -portrait.

       -lat[exfonts]
              Start xfig with LaTeX font selection.  Normally, the PostScript fonts are available as the default.  This flag selects the LaTeX fonts to start.

       -le[ft]
              Change the position of the side panel window to the left of the canvas window.  This is the default.

       -library_d[ir] [directory | file]
              Specify directory or file containing directory names where Fig object libraries are located.  There may be sub-directories there and sub-sub-directories, etc.

       -library_i[con_size] size
              Specify the size of the icons shown for library objects.  The default is 60 pixels, with the minimum being 40 and the maximum being 120.

       -lis[t_view]
              Show the library objects as a list of names. The default mode is -icon_view.

       -mag[nification] mag
              Set export and print magnification in %.

       -max[_image_colors] numcols
              Limit the number of colors used for imported images to numcols (default 64).

       -me[tric]
              Make centimeters the unit of choice.  The option -centimeters may also be used.  Fig files saved in metric mode are, due to rounding issues, scaled down by about 5% when saved,  and  scaled
              up when read in. Using -inches or -imperial avoids the scaling.

              After xfig is started you may change the units from metric to imperial or vice versa from a popup menu available by pressing mouse button 3 in the units box where the two rulers meet.

       -mo[nochrome]
              Use black and white only.

       -mu[ltiple]
              Sets multiple page mode for print or export. See also -single.

       -nointernational
              Switch  off  international  support. This can be done if text objects only contain ASCII characters.  (Characters beyond ASCII are interpreted as Latin 1).  If there are error messages when
              starting xfig regarding "missing charsets in string to fontset conversion", setting this option avoids the error.

       -noo[verlap]
              When exporting in multiple page mode, causes no overlap from page to page.  This is the default.  See also -overlap.

       -nor[mal] font
              Cause the font used for the message window to be font.  This font is also used on the canvas when the global settings "Show line lengths" or "Show vertex numbers" are true (default = 6x13).

       -nosp[lash]
              Don't show the startup splash screen.  The default is to show it ( -splash ).

       -not[rack]
              Turn off cursor (mouse) tracking arrows.

       -nowrite_bak
              When saving a drawing into an existing .fig file xfig will first rename that file by appending ".bak" to the name.  This option disables this feature.

       -ov[erlap]
              When exporting in multiple page mode, causes overlap from page to page of about 10%.  See also -nooverlap.

       -pag[eborder] color
              Draw the page border on the canvas in this color (default light blue).  The page border is turned on by the -showpageborder option (resource Fig.showpageborder), and shows the edges of  the
              current export paper size.

       -pap[er_size] size
              Set the initial paper size for Export and Print.  Choices are

              ---------------------------------

              Note that this doesn't affect the size of the drawing canvas.  Use the -pheight and -pwidth options for that.

       -ph[eight] height
              Make the xfig canvas height high (where height is either cm or in, depending on the -metric setting).

       -po[rtrait]
              Make xfig come up in portrait mode (8.5" x 9").  See note about landscape mode.

       -pw[idth] width
              Make the xfig canvas width wide (where width is either cm or in, depending on the -metric setting).

       -righ[t]
              Change the position of the side panel window to the right of the canvas window (default: left).

       -rigi[d]
              Start  xfig  with  the rigid text mode for text objects.  The Rigid attribute forces text to remain the same size even if inside a compound object that is scaled up or down.  The default is
              off.

       -ru[lerthick]
              Set the height(width) of the top(side) rulers in pixels.  The default (and minimum) is 24.

       -scale_factor scale
              Scale every figure read in by this value.  This is useful in conjunction with the -update option to do batch scaling of figures.

       -showa[llbuttons]
              Show all the xfig indicator buttons instead of only those relevant to the current drawing mode.  Normally, the buttons line width, area-fill, grid mode, text size,  etc.  are  only  visible
              when  they  are relevant to the current drawing mode.  The -showallbuttons option makes all of the indicator buttons visible at all times.  This takes up more screen real estate, but allows
              the user to see all settable parameters.

       -showb[alloons]
              Forces xfig to pop up the information balloons when the mouse passws over a button. This is the default. See also -dontshowballoons .

       -showd[epthmanager]
              Show the depth manager panel.  This panel lets one show or hide objects at various depths.  This is the default.

       -showl[engths]
              Makes xfig show the lengths of lines being drawn, in red text near the line itself.  Also, when points are moved or added.  In addition, imagine a triangle formed with the line  segment  as
              the  hypotenuse,  and  a vertical and horizontal line forming the other two sides.  These lines and their lengths are also drawn in red as the point is moved or added.  This mode is ignored
              when drawing in freehand mode.
              This flag may be toggled by pressing <Meta>i (default).

       -shown[ums]
              With this option, xfig will draw all objects with a red number next to each vertex.  This is generally only useful for debugging.

       -showp[ageborder]
              Makes xfig show the border of the current paper size in the color specified by the -pageborder option (default: light blue).

       -showz[erolines]
              Show axis zero lines on the canvas.  This is the default

       -si[ngle]
              Sets single page mode for print or export.  This is the default.  See also -multiple.

       -sm[ooth_factor] factor
              Enable smoothing when exporting to the bitmap formats (e.g. GIF, PNG, etc.). The allowed values are 0 (no smoothing), 2 or 4 (most smoothing).  This parameter is passed  to  ghostscript  in
              the -dTextAlphaBits -dGraphicsAlphaBits options to smooth the figure.

       -spec[ialtext]
              Start  xfig  with  the  TeX text mode for text objects.  This means that characters that have a special meaning to TeX/LaTeX, e.g., '$' or '\', are not quoted but left untouched in the text
              string.  This is most useful for writing LaTeX equations.  If this flag is not set, then the backslash character '\' is changed to the \backslash command, a brace '{' is turned into a brace
              command \{, etc.

       -spel[lcheckcommand] command
              Use command for the external spell checking program when using the spell check/search/replace popup.  The string command should include the string ``%s'' which is replaced  by  a  temporary
              filename.  Default is ``spell %s''.

       -spinner_d[elay] msec
              The  delay  (in  milliseconds)  before the spinner will automatically count up or down when the button is pressed.  Spinners are the (numeric) text widgets with an up- and down-arrow, which
              when clicked, cause the value to be incremented/decremented.  The default is 500 milliseconds.

       -spinner_r[rate] msec
              The rate (in milliseconds) at which the spinner will count when the up- or down-arrow is pressed.

       -startfi[llstyle] stylenumber
              Set the starting fill style for area fill (-1 to 21).

       -startfo[ntsize] pointsize
              Set the default font size for text objects (default = 12pt).

       -startg[ridmode] modenumber
              Set the starting grid mode (0 to 3).  Mode 0 is no grid.  In imperial (inches) mode, grid mode 1 is 1/4 inch, mode 2 is 1/2 inch and mode 3 is 1 inch.  In metric mode, grid mode 1  is  2mm,
              mode 2 is 5mm and mode 3 is 1cm.

       -startla[texFont] font
              Set the starting font name for LaTeX fonts.

       -startli[newidth] width
              Set the starting line width.

       -startpo[snmode] modenumber
              Set  the starting point positioning mode (0 to 4) In imperial (inches) mode, positioning mode 0 is ``any'', mode 1 is 1/16 inch, mode 2 is 1/4 inch, mode 3 is 1/2 inch and mode 4 is 1 inch.
              In metric mode, mode 0 is ``any'', mode 1 is 1mm, mode 2 is 5mm, mode 3 is 10mm and mode 4 is 20mm.

       -startp[sFont] font
              Set the starting font name for PostScript fonts.

       -startt[extstep] stepsize
              Set the starting text step.

       -ta[blet]
              Specifies that xfig should use the input tablet instead of the mouse for drawing.  You must have the XInputExtension in your X server and an input tablet for this to work.

       -track
              Turn on cursor (mouse) tracking arrows (default).

       -tran[sparent_color] color_number
              Make the transparent color for GIF export color_number.  This number is the color number according to the xfig color panel, starting at 0 (black) and ending at 31 (gold), or may be a  user-
              defined color number, which is 32 or higher.

       -update file [ file ... ]
              Run  xfig in an "update" mode, where it will read each Fig file specified on the command line and write it out to the original file, in the current file format for the version of xfig being
              run.  The original Fig file will be preserved with the suffix .bak attached to the name.  In this mode, xfig exits when finished, and no window is opened.

       -users[cale] scale
              Set the multiplier for displayed line lengths etc.  This factor is multiplied by the actual length, radius or diameter of the object currently being drawn on the canvas.  It is  useful  for
              making scale drawings, where e.g. 1 inch = 1 foot (userscale = 12.0) or 1cm = 1m (userscale = 100.0).

       -useru[nit] units
              The  units  string  is  printed  with the length information when drawing objects.  For example if the userscale = 1.0 and the userunit = ft then a line which is 3 inches long on the canvas
              would be displayed as ``length = 3 ft'' when it is being drawn.

              After xfig is started you may change the userscale and the userunit from a popup menu available by pressing mouse button 3 in the units box where the two rulers meet.

       -visual visualname
              Use visualname as the visual for xfig.  The names are TrueColor (case is not important), StaticColor, DirectColor, StaticGray, GrayScale and PseudoColor.  xfig uses the default  visual  un‐
              less this is specified.  Your server must support the desired visual.  Use xdpyinfo to see what visuals and depths are supported.  See also the -depth option.

       -write_bak
              When saving a drawing into an existing .fig file xfig will first rename that file by appending

       -zoom zoomscale
              Set the starting zoom scale.

BUGS and RESTRICTIONS
       Please send bug reports, fixes, new features etc. to:
       thomas.loimer@tuwien.ac.at

       Because of the difference of the fonts shown on the canvas and the PostScript fonts on printers, text alignment can be problematic.

       Not all operations employ smart redrawing of objects which are altered as a by product of the operation.  You may need to use Redraw in these cases.

       If  the image is panned or the xfig window iconified and de-iconified during the middle of an operation (e.g. while drawing a line), the picture will be distorted.  This can be corrected using Re‐
       draw after the operation is complete.

       When zoomed very large, the length of dashes in dashed lines will top out at 255 pixels long.  This is due to a restriction in X that the dash list is defined by char (255  pixels  maximum  for  a
       dash).  The figure will print correctly, however.

       When you do a copy/rotate with multiple copies, only the creation of the last object can be undone with the Undo button.

       Modifications to text using the popup search/update/replace/spell check panel cannot be undone.

       Version 3.1:

           The only difference between protocol version 3.0 and version 3.1 is that the position of the ``magnet'' has been shifted by 14 fig units.  In the 2.1 and older versions of xfig the grid was in
           multiples of 5 fig units, but they were on intervals 4, 9, 14, 19, etc.  When version 3.0 was created, coordinates were simply multiplied by the ratio of the resolutions (1200/80 = 15) so val‐
           ues like 4 became 60 instead of 74 ((4+1)*15 - 1).

       Version 3.2:

           The  changes to the version 3.2 file protocol are the addition of the paper size, print/export magnification, single/multiple page indicator and a transparent color name used for GIF export to
           the header of the file.
           The other difference in the version 3.2 protocol is the mathematical model used for splines. The new version uses X-splines which allows the user to mix interpolation and approximation  points
           in  a same curve. More precisely, it means that an X-spline curve is neither an interpolated spline nor an approximated one, it is BOTH (the behaviour of each point is controlled by one single
           parameter called ``shape factor''). For additional information about X-splines, see:

             "X-Splines: A Spline Model Designed for the End User"
             by C. Blanc and C. Schlick, Proceedings of SIGGRAPH'95
             http://dept-info.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~schlick/DOC/sig1.html

           Caveat: Because previous spline models (quadratic B-splines and Bezier with hidden points) are no longer supported, curves that are present in version 3.1 and  older  files  are  automatically
           converted  to  X-splines.   This  translation  is  only an approximation process. It means that the converted curves are not exactly the same as the original ones. Though they are usually very
           close, some hand-fitting may be needed in some pathological cases.

           Note: the initial implementation was done by C. Feuille, S. Grosbois, L.  Maziere and L. Minihot as a student practice (Universite Bordeaux, France).
