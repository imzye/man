RECOLL.CONF(5)                                                                              File Formats Manual                                                                              RECOLL.CONF(5)

NAME
       recoll.conf - main personal configuration file for Recoll

DESCRIPTION
       This file defines the index configuration for the Recoll full-text search system.

       The system-wide configuration file is normally located inside /usr/[local]/share/recoll/examples. Any parameter set in the common file may be overridden by setting it in the specific index config‐
       uration file, by default: $HOME/.recoll/recoll.conf

       All recoll commands will accept a -c option or use the $RECOLL_CONFDIR environment variable to specify a non-default index configuration directory.

       A short extract of the file might look as follows:

       # Space-separated list of directories to index.
       topdirs =  ~/docs /usr/share/doc

       [~/somedirectory-with-utf8-txt-files]
       defaultcharset = utf-8

       There are three kinds of lines:

       •      Comment or empty.

       •      Parameter affectation.

       •      Section definition.

       Empty lines or lines beginning with # are ignored.

       Affectation  lines  are in the form 'name = value'. In the following description, they also have a type, which is mostly indicative. The two non-obvious ones are 'fn': file path, and 'dfn': direc‐
       tory path.

       Section lines allow redefining a parameter for a directory subtree. Some of the parameters used for indexing are looked up hierarchically from the more to the less specific. Not all parameters can
       be meaningfully redefined, this is specified for each in the next section.

       The tilde character (~) is expanded in file names to the name of the user's home directory.

       Some 'string' values are lists, which is only indicated by their description. In this case white space is used for separation, and elements with embedded spaces can be quoted with double-quotes.

OPTIONS
       topdirs = string
              Space-separated list of files or directories to recursively index. You can use symbolic links in the list, they will be followed, independently of the value of the followLinks variable. The
              default value is ~ : recursively index $HOME.

       monitordirs = string
              Space-separated list of files or directories to monitor for updates. When running the real-time indexer, this allows monitoring only a subset of the whole indexed area. The elements must be
              included in the tree defined by the 'topdirs' members.

       skippedNames = string
              File and directory names which should be ignored.  White space separated list of wildcard patterns (simple ones, not paths, must contain no

              Have a look at the default configuration for the initial value, some entries may not suit your situation. The easiest way to see it is through the GUI Index configuration "local parameters"
              panel.

              The list in the default configuration does not exclude hidden directories (names beginning with a dot), which means that it may index quite a few things that you do not want. On  the  other
              hand,  email  user agents like Thunderbird usually store messages in hidden directories, and you probably want this indexed. One possible solution is to have ".*" in "skippedNames", and add
              things like "~/.thunderbird" "~/.evolution" to "topdirs".

              Not even the file names are indexed for patterns in this list, see the "noContentSuffixes" variable for an alternative approach which indexes the file names. Can be redefined for  any  sub‐
              tree.

       skippedNames- = string
              List of name patterns to remove from the default skippedNames list. Allows modifying the list in the local configuration without copying it.

       skippedNames+ = string
              List of name patterns to add to the default skippedNames list. Allows modifying the list in the local configuration without copying it.

       onlyNames = string
              Regular file name filter patterns. This is normally empty. If set, only the file names not in skippedNames and matching one of the patterns will be considered for indexing. Can be redefined
              per subtree. Does not apply to directories.

       noContentSuffixes = string
              List  of  name  endings (not necessarily dot-separated suffixes) for which we don't try MIME type identification, and don't uncompress or index content. Only the names will be indexed. This
              complements the now obsoleted recoll_noindex list from the mimemap file, which will go away in a future release (the move from mimemap to recoll.conf allows editing  the  list  through  the
              GUI).  This is different from skippedNames because these are name ending matches only (not wildcard patterns), and the file name itself gets indexed normally. This can be redefined for sub‐
              directories.

       noContentSuffixes- = string
              List of name endings to remove from the default noContentSuffixes list.

       noContentSuffixes+ = string
              List of name endings to add to the default noContentSuffixes list.

       skippedPaths = string
              Absolute paths we should not go into. Space-separated list of wildcard expressions for absolute filesystem paths (for files or directories). The variable must be defined at the top level of
              the configuration file, not in a subsection.

              Any value in the list must be textually consistent with the values in topdirs, no attempts are made to resolve symbolic links. In practise, if, as is frequently the case, /home is a link to
              /usr/home, your default topdirs will have a single entry "~" which will be translated to "/home/yourlogin". In this case, any skippedPaths entry should start  with  "/home/yourlogin"  *not*
              with "/usr/home/yourlogin".

              The index and configuration directories will automatically be added to the list.

              The expressions are matched using "fnmatch(3)" with the FNM_PATHNAME flag set by default. This means that "/" characters must be matched explicitly. You can set "skippedPathsFnmPathname" to
              0 to disable the use of FNM_PATHNAME (meaning that "/*/dir3" will match "/dir1/dir2/dir3").

              The  default  value  contains the usual mount point for removable media to remind you that it is in most cases a bad idea to have Recoll work on these. Explicitly adding "/media/xxx" to the
              "topdirs" variable will override this.

       skippedPathsFnmPathname = bool
              Set to 0 to override use of FNM_PATHNAME for matching skipped paths.

       nowalkfn = string
              File name which will cause its parent directory to be skipped. Any directory containing a file with this name will be skipped as if it was part of the skippedPaths list. Ex: .recoll-noindex

       daemSkippedPaths = string
              skippedPaths equivalent specific to real time indexing. This enables having parts of the tree which are initially indexed but not monitored. If daemSkippedPaths is not set, the daemon  uses
              skippedPaths.

       followLinks = bool
              Follow  symbolic links during indexing. The default is to ignore symbolic links to avoid multiple indexing of linked files. No effort is made to avoid duplication when this option is set to
              true. This option can be set individually for each of the "topdirs" members by using sections. It can not be changed below the "topdirs" level. Links in the "topdirs" list itself are always
              followed.

       indexedmimetypes = string
              Restrictive list of indexed MIME types. Normally not set (in which case all supported types are indexed). If it is set, only the types from the list will have their  contents  indexed.  The
              names  will  be  indexed  anyway if indexallfilenames is set (default). MIME type names should be taken from the mimemap file (the values may be different from xdg-mime or file -i output in
              some cases). Can be redefined for subtrees.

       excludedmimetypes = string
              List of excluded MIME types. Lets you exclude some types from indexing. MIME type names should be taken from the mimemap file (the values may be different from xdg-mime or file -i output in
              some cases) Can be redefined for subtrees.

       nomd5types = string
              MIME types for which we don't compute a md5 hash. md5 checksums are used only for deduplicating results, and can be very expensive to compute on multimedia or other  big  files.  This  list
              lets  you  turn  off  md5  computation for selected types. It is global (no redefinition for subtrees). At the moment, it only has an effect for external handlers (exec and execm). The file
              types can be specified by listing either MIME types (e.g. audio/mpeg) or handler names (e.g. rclaudio.py).

       compressedfilemaxkbs = int
              Size limit for compressed files. We need to decompress these in a temporary directory for identification, which can be wasteful in some cases. Limit the waste. Negative means  no  limit.  0
              results in no processing of any compressed file. Default 100 MB.

       textfilemaxmbs = int
              Size limit for text files. Mostly for skipping monster logs. Also used for max mail msg body size. Default 20 MB. Use a value of -1 to disable.

       textfilepagekbs = int
              Page  size for text files. If this is set, text/plain files will be divided into documents of approximately this size. This will reduce memory usage at index time and help with loading data
              in the preview window at query time. Particularly useful with very big files, such as application or system logs. Also see textfilemaxmbs and compressedfilemaxkbs.

       textunknownasplain = bool
              Process unknown text/xxx files as text/plain Allows indexing misc. text files identified as text/whatever by "file" or "xdg-mime" without having to explicitely set config entries for  them.
              This  works  fine for indexing (also will cause processing of a lot of useless files), but the documents indexed this way will be opened by the desktop viewer, even if text/plain has a spe‐
              cific editor.

       indexallfilenames = bool
              Index the file names of unprocessed files. Index the names of files the contents of which we don't index because of an excluded or unsupported MIME type.

       usesystemfilecommand = bool
              Use a system mechanism as last resort to guess a MIME type. Depending on platform and version, a compile-time configuration will decide if this actually executes a command or uses libmagic.
              This last-resort identification (if the suffix-based one failed) is generally useful, but will cause the indexing of many bogus extension-less "text" files. Also see "systemfilecommand".

       systemfilecommand = string
              Command to use for guessing the MIME type if the internal methods fail. This is ignored on Windows or with Recoll 1.38+ if compiled with libmagic  enabled  (the  default).  Otherwise,  this
              should be a "file -i" workalike.  The file path will be added as a last parameter to the command line. "xdg-mime" works better than the traditional "file" command, and is now the configured
              default (with a hard-coded fallback to "file")

       processwebqueue = bool
              Decide if we process the Web queue. The queue is a directory where the Recoll Web browser plugins create the copies of visited pages.

       membermaxkbs = int
              Size limit for archive members. This is passed to the MIME handlers in the environment as RECOLL_FILTER_MAXMEMBERKB.

       indexStripChars = bool
              Decide  if  we store character case and diacritics in the index. If we do, searches sensitive to case and diacritics can be performed, but the index will be bigger, and some marginal weird‐
              ness may sometimes occur. The default is a stripped index. When using multiple indexes for a search, this parameter must be defined identically for all. Changing the value implies an  index
              reset.

       indexStoreDocText = bool
              Decide if we store the documents' text content in the index. Storing the text allows extracting snippets from it at query time, instead of building them from index position data.

              Newer  Xapian index formats have rendered our use of positions list unacceptably slow in some cases. The last Xapian index format with good performance for the old method is Chert, which is
              default for 1.2, still supported but not default in 1.4 and will be dropped in 1.6.

              The stored document text is translated from its original format to UTF-8 plain text, but not stripped of upper-case, diacritics, or punctuation signs. Storing it increases the index size by
              10-20% typically, but also allows for nicer snippets, so it may be worth enabling it even if not strictly needed for performance if you can afford the space.

              The variable only has an effect when creating an index, meaning that the xapiandb directory must not exist yet. Its exact effect depends on the Xapian version.

              For Xapian 1.4, if the variable is set to 0, we used to use the Chert format and not store the text. If the variable was 1, Glass was used, and the text stored. We don't do this  any  more:
              storing the text has proved to be the much better option, and dropping this possibility simplifies the code.

              So  now, the index format for a new index is always the default, but the variable still controls if the text is stored or not, and the abstract generation method. With Xapian 1.4 and later,
              and the variable set to 0, abstract generation may be very slow, but this setting may still be useful to save space if you do not use abstract generation at all, by  using  the  appropriate
              setting in the GUI, and/or avoiding the Python API or recollq options which would trigger it.

       nonumbers = bool
              Decides if terms will be generated for numbers. For example "123", "1.5e6", 192.168.1.4, would not be indexed if nonumbers is set ("value123" would still be). Numbers are often quite inter‐
              esting  to  search for, and this should probably not be set except for special situations, ie, scientific documents with huge amounts of numbers in them, where setting nonumbers will reduce
              the index size. This can only be set for a whole index, not for a subtree.

       notermpositions = bool
              Do not store term positions. Term positions allow for phrase and proximity searches, but make the index much bigger.  In some special circumstances, you may want to dispense with them.

       dehyphenate = bool
              Determines if we index "coworker" also when the input is "co-worker". This is new in version 1.22, and on by default. Setting the variable to off allows restoring the previous behaviour.

       indexedpunctuation = string
              String of UTF-8 punctuation characters to be indexed as words. The resulting terms will then be searchable and, for example, by setting the parameter to "%€" (without  the  double  quotes),
              you would be able to search separately for "100%" or "100€" Note that "100%" or "100 %" would be indexed in the same way, the characters are their own word separators.

       backslashasletter = bool
              Process backslash as a normal letter. This may make sense for people wanting to index TeX commands as such but is not of much general use.

       underscoreasletter = bool
              Process underscore as normal letter. This makes sense in so many cases that one wonders if it should not be the default.

       maxtermlength = int
              Maximum term length in Unicode characters. Words longer than this will be discarded.  The default is 40 and used to be hard-coded, but it can now be adjusted. You may need an index reset if
              you change the value.

       maxdbdatarecordkbs = int
              Maximum  binary  size  of a Xapian document data record. The data record holds "stored" document metadata fields. A very big size usually indicates a document parse error. Xapian has a hard
              limit of around 100MB for this.

       maxdbstoredtextmbs = int
              Maximum binary size of a document stored text. Xapian has a hard limit of around 100MB for the compressed value, but our limit is before compression, so there may be some wiggle room.

       nocjk = bool
              Decides if specific East Asian (Chinese Korean Japanese) characters/word splitting is turned off. This will save a small amount of CPU if you have no CJK documents. If  your  document  base
              does include such text but you are not interested in searching it, setting nocjk may be a significant time and space saver.

       cjkngramlen = int
              This  lets you adjust the size of n-grams used for indexing CJK text. The default value of 2 is probably appropriate in most cases. A value of 3 would allow more precision and efficiency on
              longer words, but the index will be approximately twice as large.

       hangultagger = string
              External tokenizer for Korean Hangul. This allows using an language specific processor for  extracting  terms  from  Korean  text,  instead  of  the  generic  n-gram  term  generator.   See
              https://www.recoll.org/pages/recoll-korean.html for instructions.

       chinesetagger = string
              External tokenizer for Chinese. This allows using the language specific Jieba tokenizer for extracting meaningful terms from Chinese text, instead of the generic n-gram term generator.  See
              https://www.recoll.org/pages/recoll-chinese.html for instructions.

       indexstemminglanguages = string
              Languages for which to create stemming expansion data. Stemmer names can be found by executing "recollindex -l", or this can also be set from a list in the GUI. The values are full language
              names, e.g. english, french...

       defaultcharset = string
              Default  character  set.  This  is used for files which do not contain a character set definition (e.g.: text/plain). Values found inside files, e.g. a "charset" tag in HTML documents, will
              override it. If this is not set, the default character set is the one defined by the NLS environment ($LC_ALL, $LC_CTYPE, $LANG), or ultimately iso-8859-1 (cp-1252 in fact).   If  for  some
              reason you want a general default which does not match your LANG and is not 8859-1, use this variable. This can be redefined for any sub-directory.

       unac_except_trans = string
              A  list of characters, encoded in UTF-8, which should be handled specially when converting text to unaccented lowercase. For example, in Swedish, the letter a with diaeresis has full alpha‐
              bet citizenship and should not be turned into an a.  Each element in the space-separated list has the special character as first element and the translation following. The handling of  both
              the lowercase and upper-case versions of a character should be specified, as appartenance to the list will turn-off both standard accent and case processing. The value is global and affects
              both indexing and querying.  We also convert a few confusing Unicode characters (quotes, hyphen) to their ASCII equivalent to avoid "invisible" search failures.

              Examples:  Swedish: unac_except_trans = ää Ää öö Öö üü Üü ßss œoe Œoe æae Æae ﬀff ﬁfi ﬂfl åå Åå ’' ❜' ʼ' ‐- unac_except_trans = ää Ää öö Öö üü Üü ßss œoe Œoe æae Æae ﬀff ﬁfi ﬂfl ’' ❜' ʼ' ‐-
              a German ß unac_except_trans = ßss œoe Œoe æae Æae ﬀff ﬁfi ﬂfl ’' ❜' ʼ' ‐- are not performed by unac, but it is unlikely that someone would type the composed forms in  a  search.   unac_ex‐
              cept_trans = ßss œoe Œoe æae Æae ﬀff ﬁfi ﬂfl ’' ❜' ʼ' ‐-

       maildefcharset = string
              Overrides the default character set for email messages which don't specify one. This is mainly useful for readpst (libpst) dumps, which are utf-8 but do not say so.

       localfields = string
              Set  fields on all files (usually of a specific fs area). Syntax is the usual: name = value ; attr1 = val1 ; [...]  value is empty so this needs an initial semi-colon. This is useful, e.g.,
              for setting the rclaptg field for application selection inside mimeview.

       testmodifusemtime = bool
              Use mtime instead of ctime to test if a file has been modified. The time is used in addition to the size, which is always used.  Setting this can reduce re-indexing  on  systems  where  ex‐
              tended attributes are used (by some other application), but not indexed, because changing extended attributes only affects ctime.  Notes: - This may prevent detection of change in some mar‐
              ginal file rename cases (the target would need to have the same size and mtime).  - You should probably also set noxattrfields to 1 in this case, except if you still prefer to perform xattr
              indexing,  for  example  if the local file update pattern makes it of value (as in general, there is a risk for pure extended attributes updates without file modification to go undetected).
              Perform a full index reset after changing this.

       noxattrfields = bool
              Disable extended attributes conversion to metadata fields. This probably needs to be set if testmodifusemtime is set.

       metadatacmds = string
              Define commands to gather external metadata, e.g. tmsu tags.  There can be several entries, separated by semi-colons, each defining which field name the data goes into and  the  command  to
              use. Don't forget the initial semi-colon. All the field names must be different. You can use aliases in the "field" file if necessary.  As a not too pretty hack conceded to convenience, any
              field  name beginning with "rclmulti" will be taken as an indication that the command returns multiple field values inside a text blob formatted as a recoll configuration file ("fieldname =
              fieldvalue" lines). The rclmultixx name will be ignored, and field names and values will be parsed from the data.  Example: metadatacmds = ; tags = tmsu tags %f; rclmulti1 =  cmdOutputsConf
              %f

       cachedir = dfn
              Top directory for Recoll data. Recoll data directories are normally located relative to the configuration directory (e.g. ~/.recoll/xapiandb, ~/.recoll/mboxcache). If "cachedir" is set, the
              directories  are stored under the specified value instead (e.g. if cachedir is ~/.cache/recoll, the default dbdir would be ~/.cache/recoll/xapiandb).  This affects dbdir, webcachedir, mbox‐
              cachedir, aspellDicDir, which can still be individually specified to override cachedir.  Note that if you have multiple configurations, each must have a different cachedir, there is no  au‐
              tomatic computation of a subpath under cachedir.

       maxfsoccuppc = int
              Maximum file system occupation over which we stop indexing. The value is a percentage, corresponding to what the "Capacity" df output column shows. The default value is 0, meaning no check‐
              ing. This parameter is only checked when the indexer starts, it will not change the behaviour or a running process.

       dbdir = dfn
              Xapian database directory location. This will be created on first indexing. If the value is not an absolute path, it will be interpreted as relative to cachedir if set, or the configuration
              directory (-c argument or $RECOLL_CONFDIR).  If nothing is specified, the default is then ~/.recoll/xapiandb/

       idxstatusfile = fn
              Name of the scratch file where the indexer process updates its status. Default: idxstatus.txt inside the configuration directory.

       mboxcachedir = dfn
              Directory location for storing mbox message offsets cache files. This is normally "mboxcache" under cachedir if set, or else under the configuration directory, but it may be useful to share
              a directory between different configurations.

       mboxcacheminmbs = int
              Minimum mbox file size over which we cache the offsets. There is really no sense in caching offsets for small files. The default is 5 MB.

       mboxmaxmsgmbs = int
              Maximum mbox member message size in megabytes. Size over which we assume that the mbox format is bad or we misinterpreted it, at which point we just stop processing the file.

       webcachedir = dfn
              Directory  where  we  store the archived web pages after they are processed. This is only used by the Web history indexing code. Note that this is different from webdownloadsdir which tells
              the indexer where the web pages are stored by the browser, before they are indexed and stored into webcachedir.  Default: cachedir/webcache if cachedir is set, else $RECOLL_CONFDIR/webcache

       webcachemaxmbs = int
              Maximum size in MB of the Web archive. This is only used by the web history indexing code.  Default: 40 MB.  Reducing the size will not physically truncate the file.

       webqueuedir = fn
              The path to the Web indexing queue. This used to be hard-coded in the old plugin as ~/.recollweb/ToIndex so there would be no need or possibility to change it, but the WebExtensions  plugin
              now downloads the files to the user Downloads directory, and a script moves them to webqueuedir. The script reads this value from the config so it has become possible to change it.

       webdownloadsdir = fn
              The  path  to  the  browser  add-on download directory. This tells the indexer where the Web browser add-on stores the web page data. The data is then moved by a script to webqueuedir, then
              processed, and finally stored in webcachedir for future previews.

       webcachekeepinterval = string
              Page recycle interval By default, only one instance of an URL is kept in the cache. This can be changed by setting this to a value determining at what frequency we keep  multiple  instances
              ("day", "week", "month", "year"). Note that increasing the interval will not erase existing entries.

       aspellDicDir = dfn
              Aspell  dictionary storage directory location. The aspell dictionary (aspdict.(lang).rws) is normally stored in the directory specified by cachedir if set, or under the configuration direc‐
              tory.

       filtersdir = dfn
              Directory location for executable input handlers. If RECOLL_FILTERSDIR is set in the environment, we use it instead. Defaults to $prefix/share/recoll/filters. Can be redefined for subdirec‐
              tories.

       iconsdir = dfn
              Directory location for icons. The only reason to change this would be if you want to change the icons displayed in the result list. Defaults to $prefix/share/recoll/images

       idxflushmb = int
              Threshold (megabytes of new data) where we flush from memory to disk index. Setting this allows some control over memory usage by the indexer process. A value of 0 means no explicit  flush‐
              ing,  which  lets  Xapian perform its own thing, meaning flushing every $XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD documents created, modified or deleted: as memory usage depends on average document size, not
              only document count, the Xapian approach is is not very useful, and you should let Recoll manage the flushes. The program compiled value is 0. The configured default value (from this  file)
              is  now  50  MB, and should be ok in many cases.  You can set it as low as 10 to conserve memory, but if you are looking for maximum speed, you may want to experiment with values between 20
              and 200. In my experience, values beyond this are always counterproductive. If you find otherwise, please drop me a note.

       filtermaxseconds = int
              Maximum external filter execution time in seconds. Default 1200 (20mn). Set to 0 for no limit. This is mainly to avoid infinite loops in postscript files (loop.ps)

       filtermaxmbytes = int
              Maximum virtual memory space for filter processes (setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS)), in megabytes. Note that this includes any mapped libs (there is no reliable Linux  way  to  limit  the  data  space
              only),  so  we  need to be a bit generous here. Anything over 2000 will be ignored on 32 bits machines.  The high default value is needed because of java-based handlers (pdftk) which need a
              lot of VM (most of it text), esp. pdftk when executed from Python rclpdf.py. You can use a much lower value if you don't need Java.

       thrQSizes = string
              Task queue depths for each stage and threading configuration control. There are three internal queues in the indexing pipeline stages (file data extraction, terms generation, index update).
              This parameter defines the queue depths for each stage (three integer values). In practise, deep queues have not been shown to increase performance. The first value is also used to  control
              threading  autoconfiguration  or disabling multithreading.  If the first queue depth is set to 0 Recoll will set the queue depths and thread counts based on the detected number of CPUs. The
              arbitrarily chosen values are as follows (depth,nthread). 1 CPU -> no threading. Less than 4 CPUs: (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 1). Less than 6: (2, 4), (2, 2), (2, 1). Else (2, 5), (2,  3),  (2,  1).
              If the first queue depth is set to -1, multithreading will be disabled entirely. The second and third values are ignored in both these cases.

       thrTCounts = string
              Number  of  threads  used for each indexing stage. If the first entry in thrQSizes is not 0 or -1, these three values define the number of threads used for each stage (file data extraction,
              term generation, index update).  It makes no sense to use a value other than 1 for the last stage because updating the Xapian index is necessarily single-threaded (and protected  by  a  mu‐
              tex).

       thrTmpDbCnt = int
              Number of temporary indexes used during incremental or full indexing. If not set to zero, this defines how many temporary indexes we use during indexing.  These temporary indexes are merged
              into  the main one at the end of the operation.  Using multiple indexes and a final merge can significantly improve indexing performance when the single-threaded Xapian index updates become
              a bottleneck. How useful this is depends on the type of input and CPU. See the manual for more details.

       suspendonbattery = bool
              Suspend the real time indexing when the system runs on battery. The indexer will wait for a return on AC and reexec itself when it happens.

       loglevel = int
              Log file verbosity 1-6. A value of 2 will print only errors and warnings. 3 will print information like document updates, 4 is quite verbose and 6 very verbose.

       logfilename = fn
              Log file destination. Use "stderr" (default) to write to the console.

       idxloglevel = int
              Override loglevel for the indexer.

       idxlogfilename = fn
              Override logfilename for the indexer.

       helperlogfilename = fn
              Destination file for external helpers standard error output. The external program error output is left alone by default, e.g. going to the terminal when the recoll[index]  program  is  exe‐
              cuted from the command line. Use /dev/null or a file inside a non-existent directory to completely suppress the output.

       daemloglevel = int
              Override loglevel for the indexer in real time mode. The default is to use the idx... values if set, else the log... values.

       daemlogfilename = fn
              Override logfilename for the indexer in real time mode. The default is to use the idx... values if set, else the log... values.

       pyloglevel = int
              Override loglevel for the python module.

       pylogfilename = fn
              Override logfilename for the python module.

       idxnoautopurge = bool
              Do  not  purge data for deleted or inaccessible files This can be overridden by recollindex command line options and may be useful if some parts of the document set may predictably be inac‐
              cessible at times, so that you would only run the purge after making sure that everything is there.

       orgidxconfdir = dfn
              Original location of the configuration directory. This is used exclusively for movable datasets. Locating the configuration directory inside the directory tree makes it possible to  provide
              automatic query time path translations once the data set has moved (for example, because it has been mounted on another location).

       curidxconfdir = dfn
              Current  location  of  the configuration directory. Complement orgidxconfdir for movable datasets. This should be used if the configuration directory has been copied from the dataset to an‐
              other location, either because the dataset is readonly and an r/w copy is desired, or for performance reasons. This records the original moved location before copy, to allow  path  transla‐
              tion  computations.   For  example  if  a  dataset originally indexed as "/home/me/mydata/config" has been mounted to "/media/me/mydata", and the GUI is running from a copied configuration,
              orgidxconfdir would be "/home/me/mydata/config", and curidxconfdir (as set in the copied configuration) would be "/media/me/mydata/config".

       idxrundir = dfn
              Indexing process current directory. The input handlers sometimes leave temporary files in the current directory, so it makes sense to have recollindex chdir to some temporary directory.  If
              the  value  is empty, the current directory is not changed. If the value is (literal) tmp, we use the temporary directory as set by the environment (RECOLL_TMPDIR else TMPDIR else /tmp). If
              the value is an absolute path to a directory, we go there.

       checkneedretryindexscript = fn
              Script used to heuristically check if we need to retry indexing files which previously failed.  The default script checks the modified dates on /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin. A relative  path
              will be looked up in the filters dirs, then in the path. Use an absolute path to do otherwise.

       recollhelperpath = string
              Additional  places to search for helper executables. This is used, e.g., on Windows by the Python code, and on Mac OS by the bundled recoll.app (because I could find no reliable way to tell
              launchd to set the PATH). The example below is for Windows. Use ":" as entry separator for Mac and Ux-like systems, ";" is for Windows only.

       idxabsmlen = int
              Length of abstracts we store while indexing. Recoll stores an abstract for each indexed file.  The text can come from an actual "abstract" section in the document or will just be the begin‐
              ning of the document. It is stored in the index so that it can be displayed inside the result lists without decoding the original file. The idxabsmlen parameter  defines  the  size  of  the
              stored  abstract.  The  default  value is 250 bytes. The search interface gives you the choice to display this stored text or a synthetic abstract built by extracting text around the search
              terms. If you always prefer the synthetic abstract, you can reduce this value and save a little space.

       idxmetastoredlen = int
              Truncation length of stored metadata fields. This does not affect indexing (the whole field is processed anyway), just the amount of data stored in the index for the purpose  of  displaying
              fields inside result lists or previews. The default value is 150 bytes which may be too low if you have custom fields.

       idxtexttruncatelen = int
              Truncation  length for all document texts. Only index the beginning of documents. This is not recommended except if you are sure that the interesting keywords are at the top and have severe
              disk space issues.

       idxsynonyms = fn
              Name of the index-time synonyms file. This is only used to issue multi-word single terms for multi-word synonyms so that phrase and proximity searches work for them  (ex:  applejack  "apple
              jack"). The feature will only have an effect for querying if the query-time and index-time synonym files are the same.

       idxniceprio = int
              "nice" process priority for the indexing processes. Default: 19 (lowest) Appeared with 1.26.5. Prior versions were fixed at 19.

       noaspell = bool
              Disable  aspell  use. The aspell dictionary generation takes time, and some combinations of aspell version, language, and local terms, result in aspell crashing, so it sometimes makes sense
              to just disable the thing.

       aspellLanguage = string
              Language definitions to use when creating the aspell dictionary. The value must match a set of aspell language definition files. You can type "aspell dicts" to see a  list  The  default  if
              this is not set is to use the NLS environment to guess the value. The values are the 2-letter language codes (e.g. "en", "fr"...)

       aspellAddCreateParam = string
              Additional  option and parameter to aspell dictionary creation command. Some aspell packages may need an additional option (e.g. on Debian Jessie: --local-data-dir=/usr/lib/aspell). See De‐
              bian bug 772415.

       aspellKeepStderr = bool
              Set this to have a look at aspell dictionary creation errors. There are always many, so this is mostly for debugging.

       monauxinterval = int
              Auxiliary database update interval. The real time indexer only updates the auxiliary databases (stemdb, aspell) periodically, because it would be too costly to  do  it  for  every  document
              change. The default period is one hour.

       monixinterval = int
              Minimum interval (seconds) between processings of the indexing queue. The real time indexer does not process each event when it comes in, but lets the queue accumulate, to diminish overhead
              and to aggregate multiple events affecting the same file. Default 30 S.

       mondelaypatterns = string
              Timing  parameters  for  the  real time indexing. Definitions for files which get a longer delay before reindexing is allowed. This is for fast-changing files, that should only be reindexed
              once in a while. A list of wildcardPattern:seconds pairs. The patterns are matched with fnmatch(pattern, path, 0) You can quote entries containing white space with double quotes (quote  the
              whole entry, not the pattern). The default is empty.  Example: mondelaypatterns = *.log:20 "*with spaces.*:30"

       monioniceclass = int
              ionice  class  for  the indexing process. Despite the misleading name, and on platforms where this is supported, this affects all indexing processes, not only the real time/monitoring ones.
              The default value is 3 (use lowest "Idle" priority).

       monioniceclassdata = string
              ionice class level parameter if the class supports it. The default is empty, as the default "Idle" class has no levels.

       idxlocalguisettings = bool
              Store some GUI parameters locally to the index. GUI settings are normally stored in a global file, valid for all indexes. Setting this parameter will make some settings, such as the  result
              table setup, specific to the index.

       autodiacsens = bool
              auto-trigger diacritics sensitivity (raw index only). IF the index is not stripped, decide if we automatically trigger diacritics sensitivity if the search term has accented characters (not
              in unac_except_trans). Else you need to use the query language and the "D" modifier to specify diacritics sensitivity. Default is no.

       autocasesens = bool
              auto-trigger  case sensitivity (raw index only). IF the index is not stripped (see indexStripChars), decide if we automatically trigger character case sensitivity if the search term has up‐
              per-case characters in any but the first position. Else you need to use the query language and the "C" modifier to specify character-case sensitivity. Default is yes.

       maxTermExpand = int
              Maximum query expansion count for a single term (e.g.: when using wildcards). This only affects queries, not indexing. We used to not limit this at all (except for filenames where the limit
              was too low at 1000), but it is unreasonable with a big index. Default 10000.

       maxXapianClauses = int
              Maximum number of clauses we add to a single Xapian query. This only affects queries, not indexing. In some cases, the result of term expansion can be multiplicative, and we want  to  avoid
              eating all the memory. Default 50000.

       snippetMaxPosWalk = int
              Maximum  number  of  positions we walk while populating a snippet for the result list. The default of 1,000,000 may be insufficient for very big documents, the consequence would be snippets
              with possibly meaning-altering missing words.

       thumbnailercmd = string
              Command to use for generating thumbnails.  If set, this should be a path to a command or script followed by its constant arguments. Four arguments will be  appended  before  execution:  the
              document  URL,  MIME  type, target icon SIZE (e.g. 128), and output file PATH. The command should generate a thumbnail from these values. E.g. if the MIME is video, a script could use: ffm‐
              pegthumbnailer -iURL -oPATH -sSIZE.

       stemexpandphrases = bool
              Default to applying stem expansion to phrase terms. Recoll normally does not apply stem expansion to terms inside phrase searches.  Setting this parameter will change the default  behaviour
              to expanding terms inside phrases. If set, you can use a "l" modifier to disable expansion for a specific instance.

       autoSpellRarityThreshold = int
              Inverse  of  the  ratio  of  term  occurrence to total db terms over which we look for spell neighbours for automatic query expansion When a term is very uncommon, we may (depending on user
              choice) look for spelling variations which would be more common and possibly add them to the query.

       autoSpellSelectionThreshold = int
              Ratio of spell neighbour frequency over user input term frequency beyond which we include the neighbour in the query. When a term has been selected for spelling  expansion  because  of  its
              rarity, we only include spelling neighbours which are more common by this ratio.

       kioshowsubdocs = bool
              Show  embedded  document results in KDE dolphin/kio and krunner Embedded documents may clutter the results and are not always easily usable from the kio or krunner environment. Setting this
              variable will restrict the results to standalone documents.

       pdfocr = bool
              Attempt OCR of PDF files with no text content. This can be defined in subdirectories. The default is off because OCR is so very slow.

       pdfoutline = bool
              Extract outlines and bookmarks from PDF documents (needs pdftohtml). This is not enabled by default because it is rarely needed, and the extra command takes a little time.

       pdfattach = bool
              Enable PDF attachment extraction by executing pdfdetach (if available). This used to be disabled by default because it used pdftk. We now use pdfdetach, which is part of  poppler-utils  and
              fast.

       pdfextrameta = string
              Extract  text  from selected XMP metadata tags. This is a space-separated list of qualified XMP tag names. Each element can also include a translation to a Recoll field name, separated by a
              "|" character. If the second element is absent, the tag name is used as the Recoll field names. You will also need to add specifications to the "fields" file to direct processing of the ex‐
              tracted data.

       pdfextrametafix = fn
              Define name of XMP field editing script. This defines the name of a script to be loaded for editing XMP field values. The script should define a "MetaFixer" class with  a  metafix()  method
              which  will  be  called  with the qualified tag name and value of each selected field, for editing or erasing. A new instance is created for each document, so that the object can keep state
              for, e.g. eliminating duplicate values.

       zipUseSkippedNames = bool
              Use skippedNames inside Zip archives. Fetched directly by the rclzip.py handler. Skip the patterns defined by skippedNames inside Zip archives. Can be  redefined  for  subdirectories.   See
              https://www.recoll.org/faqsandhowtos/FilteringOutZipArchiveMembers.html

       zipSkippedNames = string
              Space-separated  list  of  wildcard expressions for names that should be ignored inside zip archives. This is used directly by the zip handler. If zipUseSkippedNames is not set, zipSkipped‐
              Names defines the patterns to be skipped inside archives. If zipUseSkippedNames is set, the two lists are concatenated and used. Can be redefined for subdirectories.   See  https://www.rec‐
              oll.org/faqsandhowtos/FilteringOutZipArchiveMembers.html

       zipMetaEncoding = string
              File  path  encoding.  Needs  Python  3.11+. Set to "detect" for using chardet. This is useful for non-standard zip files where the metadata is neither UTF-8 (indicated by a file flag), nor
              CP437 (default). The parameter can be set for specific subtrees. You need to install the Python3 "chardet" package if the value is set to "detect".

       orgmodesubdocs = bool
              Index org-mode level 1 sections as separate sub-documents This is the default. If set to false, org-mode files will be indexed as plain text

       mhmboxquirks = string
              Enable thunderbird/mozilla-seamonkey mbox format quirks Set this for the directory(ies) where the email mbox files are stored.

       imgocr = bool
              Tell the non-default Python image handler to run OCR. See the PDF section for PDF OCR. The image OCR also needs mimeconf changes. See the manual. imgocr can be defined for subdirectories.

       ocrprogs = string
              OCR modules to try. The top OCR script will try to load the corresponding modules in order and use the first which reports being capable of performing OCR on the  input  file.  Modules  for
              tesseract (tesseract) and ABBYY FineReader (abbyy) are present in the standard distribution. For compatibility with the previous version, if this is not defined at all, the default value is
              "tesseract". Use an explicit empty value if needed. A value of "abbyy tesseract" will try everything.

       ocrcachedir = dfn
              Location for caching OCR data. The default if this is empty or undefined is to store the cached OCR data under $RECOLL_CONFDIR/ocrcache.

       tesseractlang = string
              Language  to  assume  for  tesseract  OCR.  Important  for  improving  the  OCR  accuracy.  This can also be set through the contents of a file in the currently processed directory. See the
              rclocrtesseract.py script. Example values: eng, fra... See the tesseract documentation.

       tesseractcmd = fn
              Path for the tesseract command. Do not quote. This is mostly useful on  Windows,  or  for  specifying  a  non-default  tesseract  command.  E.g.  on  Windows.   tesseractcmd  =  C:/Program‐
              Files(x86)/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe

       abbyylang = string
              Language  to assume for abbyy OCR. Important for improving the OCR accuracy. This can also be set through the contents of a file in the currently processed directory. See the rclocrabbyy.py
              script. Typical values: English, French... See the ABBYY documentation.

       abbyyocrcmd = fn
              Path for the abbyy command The ABBY directory is usually not in the path, so you should set this.

       speechtotext = string
              Activate speech to text conversion The only possible value at the moment is "whisper" for using the OpenAI whisper program.

       sttmodel = string
              Name of the whisper model

       sttdevice = string
              Name of the device to be used by for whisper
