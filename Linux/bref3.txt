NAME
       Bref - Tool for compressing diploid reference VCF files for the Beagle program.

SYNOPSIS
       java -jar /usr/share/beagle/bref.jar [vcf]
       or
       java -jar /usr/share/beagle/bref.jar [bref]

DESCRIPTION
       Bref is a tool for compressing diploid reference VCF files.
       Beagle  performs  genotype  calling,  genotype  phasing,  imputation  of  ungenotyped markers, and identity-by-descent segment detection. Genotypic imputation works on phased haplotypes using a Li and
       Stephens haplotype frequency model.  Beagle also implements the Refined IBD algorithm for detecting homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) and identity-by-descent (IBD) segments.

OPTIONS
       vcf=filename
              Creates a .bref file.
              Specifies a VCF file with phase, non-missing genotype data.  If the VCF file is a text file, its filename should end in ".vcf".  If the VCF file is GZIP-compressed, its filename should  end  in
              ".vcf.gz".

       bref=filename
              Prints a .vcf file to standard out.
              Specifies a binary reference file.  The filename should end in ".bref".
