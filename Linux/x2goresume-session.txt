DESCRIPTION
       x2goresume-session resumes the suspended session with session ID <session_id>.

       This command is normally issued by an X2Go client application with X2Go user privileges.

ARGUMENTS
       <session_id>
              The session ID (or session name) of the suspend session that is to be resumed.

       <geometry>
              Session window size on screen (allowed values: <width>x<height> or fullscreen).

       <link_quality>
              Any value out of: modem, isdn, adsl, wan or lan.

       <nx_pack_method>
              NX compression method (see below for possible values).

       <cache_type+dpi>
              Cache type and color depth for X2Go session window. The most common value is: unix-kde-depth_24 where ,,24'' is the color depth in bit.

       <kblayout>
              Keyboard layout (e.g. us, de, etc.).

       <kbtype>
              Keyboard type/model (e.g. pc105/us).

       <setkbd>
              Force setting keyboard layout and type within the X2Go session on startup. Values: 0 or 1.

       <clipboardmode>
              The session's clipboard mode. Possible values: both, server, client, none. Allows one to configure clipboard security per session via the connecting X2Go client. If the clipboard parameter is
              set server-side in /etc/x2go/x2goagent.options, then that value will override client-side settings.

RETURN VALUES
       x2goresume-session reports to stderr if resuming of session <session_id> failed. This very probably means that the session's X agent has died, so the session <session_id> will be marked as finished in
       the X2Go session database.

       If everything works out well, a list of session attributes is returned after successful session resumption.  Session attributes will be presented on a line-by-line basis:

           field 01: <graphics_port>
           field 02: <sound_port>
           field 03: <sshfs_port>
           field 04: <tekictrl_port> (if Telekinesis is available/enabled)
           field 04: <tekidata_port> (if Telekinesis is available/enabled)

       As exitcode x2goresume-session always returns 0.
