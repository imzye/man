NAME
       lircmd - Translate infrared signals into mouse events.

SYNOPSIS
       lircmd [options] [config-file]

DESCRIPTION
       lircmd  reads  decoded buttonpress events from a lircd(8) output socket
       and converts them to mouse events.  These  events  are  made  available
       either  on  the lircmd output socket (by default /var/run/lirc/lircmd )
       or,  using  the  --uinput  option,  on   a   /dev/input   device   like
       /dev/input/event12 .

       This  daemon  can  simulate a MouseSystems, IntelliMouse or IMPS/2 type
       mouse.  The function  depends  on  a  configuration  file,  by  default
       /etc/lirc/lircmd.conf  .   This file determines which button from which
       remote causes a mouse move or a mouse  button  click.   Special  button
       which activates or deactivates the mouse mode can also be defined.

       The normal usage is to configure X11 to use the events produced by lir‐
       cmd as an input source.  See  SEE ALSO.

       Using the --uinput option the user device created by the kernel  has  a
       dynamic  name which typically changes after a reboot.  The lirc distri‐
       bution contains a udev rule which, if installed, creates a  fixed  link
       named /dev/lircmd which always can be used.

       By  default,  using  the --uinput option requires lircmd to run as root
       since the /dev/uinput device can be accessed only by  root.   The  lirc
       distribution  contains example udev rules and lircd-setup(8) configura‐
       tions which can be used to make the device accessible by  other  users.
       In this way, lircmd can be run as a regular user.

OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Display help  message.

       -v --version
              Display version.

       -n --nodaemon
              Don't fork to background.

       -s --socket <socket path>
              Use  alternate  lircd  socket  path  (the  lircmd input source).
              Defaults to the  output  key  in  the  [lircd]  section  of  the
              lirc_options.conf     config     file,     falling    back    to
              /var/run/lirc/lircd.

       -O --options-file=file
              Alternative  default   options   file,   usually   defaults   to
              /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf.

       -u --uinput
              On  Linux systems the --uinput option will enable automatic gen‐
              eration of Linux input events. lircmd will open  /dev/input/uin‐
              put  and inject the simulated mouse events into the Linux kernel
              rather than creating the /dev/lircm device.   The  kernel  makes
              these   events  available  to other applications on a /dev/input
              device, just like any other kernel input device.

       -D --loglevel=[level]
              Determine the amount of logging information. [level]  can  be  a
              symbolic  syslog  level:  'error','warning,  'info', 'notice' or
              'debug'. lircd also defines  three  additional  levels  'trace',
              'trace1'  and  'trace2' which gives even more messages ('trace2'
              bringing the most). However,  in  the  log  these  messages  are
              marked as 'debug'.

SOCKET PROTOCOL
       The socket protocol contains undocumented parts. The data on the output
       socket is

       MouseSystems
           5 byte packets:

           ·   Byte 1: Button information.

           ·   Byte 2: X-axis change.

           ·   Byte 3: Y-axis change.

           ·   Byte 4 and 5: 0.

       IMPS/2
           4 byte packets. Please refer to the lircmd source code for details.

       IntelliMouse
           4 byte packets. Please refer to the lircmd source code for details.

FILES
       lircmd will use syslogd to output error messages. It  depends  on  your
       system configuration where they will show up.

       The options file is by default /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf; lircmd han‐
       dles the values under the [lircmd] section in this file.  The  location
       can be changed using the -O/--options-file command-line option or using
       the environment variable LIRC_OPTIONS_PATH.  The values here  are  used
       as defaults for any option not present on command line.

DAEMONS
       lircmd  is  a   daemon.   It should be started in some system-dependent
       init script.  Besides the systemd setup which is installed  by  default
       there  are  also  example scripts for other distros and init systems in
       the contrib directory.  lircmd has to be started after lircd as it con‐
       nects to the socket lircd provides.

BUGS
       Since  the  device  name  used when registrating the --uinput device is
       fixed, only one instance of lircmd using this option can run on a given
       system.

       The socket protocol is a documentation-wise mess.
