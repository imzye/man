NAME
       setconf - change settings in configuration textfiles

SYNOPSIS
       setconf filename key value [end string for a multiline value]

DESCRIPTION
       If there's a textfile with fields like these:

       CC=gcc

       lights := on

       compileToday: true

       anumber = 42

       cabal ==1.2.3

       Setconf can change the values to something else.  The value related to the first key found will be changed to the given value.

       For example, CC is a key and gcc is a value.

EXAMPLES
       setconf
         Exits with error code 1

       setconf Makefile.defaults NETSURF_USE_HARU_PDF NO
         In Makefile.defaults, set NETSURF_USE_HARU_PDF to NO

       setconf Makefile CC gcc
         Sets CC=gcc in Makefile

       setconf PKGBUILD sha256sums "('123abc' 'abc123')" ')'
         In the PKGBUILD file, set the value for the sha256sums keys to
         ('123abc' 'abc123') regardless of how many lines the previous value
         spans, since the end string ')' is given.

       setconf app.py NUMS "[1, 2, 3]" ']'
         Multiline replacement, replacing the text from the value belonging
         to the key NUMS to the endstring ] with the value [1, 2, 3],
         regardless of how many lines the previous value spans.

       setconf my.conf x=1
         Sets x to 1 in my.conf, even if my.conf uses a different assignment,
         like x := 42, x : 42, x == 42, x :: 42 or x => 42.

       setconf -a server.ini 'Z => 99'
         Adds Z => 99 to server.ini

       setconf --add rolling.conf N 1000
         Adds N=1000. Creates the file if needed.

       setconf test.file y-=0.1
         Decreases y with 0.1.

       setconf values.conf x+=2
         Increases x with 2.

       setconf -d linux/printk.h CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT=4
         Changes #define CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT to 4

       setconf -u kernel_config CONFIG_ULTRIX_PARTITION=y
         Uncomment and set CONFIG_ULTRIX_PARTITION=y, even if the original
         value is suffixed by "is not set". Intended for use with Linux kernel
         configuration.

OPTIONS
       -v or--version
              displays the current version number

       -h or --help
              displays brief usage information

       -t or --test
              performs internal self testing

       -a or --add
              adds an option, if not already present.  Must be followed by a filename and a key/value pair.

       -d or --define
              changes a single-line #define value

       -u or --uncomment
              uncomments a key before changing the value

WHY
       Aims to solve a tiny problem properly instead of a thousand problems halfway, in true UNIX-spirit

       Creates a line that is very easy to read, as opposed to using sed for the same task

       It should be clear from the syntax what is being done

       Only one small executable, not a big package

SEE ALSO
       sed(1) make(1)
