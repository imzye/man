NAME
       firstprimes - primality certification for the first primes

SYNOPSIS
       firstprimes [-o filename] -base maxindex
       firstprimes [-o filename] minindex maxindex

DESCRIPTION
       This tool outputs in the file filename (default: FirstPrimes.v) the proof of primality for the primes between the minimum and the maximum indexes.

       It contains a rather large list (thousands) of the first primes, and is able to output a proof of primality for each of them ; the indexes are relative to this list.

OPTIONS
       -o <filename> Prints the proof script in the file named <filename> (otherwise: FirstPrimes.v)

       -base <maxindex>
              Gives proofs for the primes from 0 (included) to <maxindex> (excluded)

       <minindex> <maxindex>
              Gives proofs for the primes from <minindex> (included) to <maxindexoo> (excluded)

                                                                                              July 15th, 2022                                                                                FIRSTPRIMES(1)
