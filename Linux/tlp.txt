NAME
       tlp - apply laptop power saving settings

SYNOPSIS
       tlp command [parameters] [-- CONFIG_PARAM=value ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       tlp applies power saving settings manually and controls battery care features.

COMMANDS
       start  Start tlp and apply power saving profile for the actual power source.  Also use to apply a changed configuration or to leave manual mode.

       bat    Apply battery profile and enter manual mode.  Manual mode means that changes to the power source will be ignored until the next reboot or tlp start is issued to resume automatic mode.

       true   Alias for bat.

       ac     Apply AC profile and enter manual mode.  Manual mode means that changes to the power source will be ignored until the next reboot or tlp start is issued to resume automatic mode.

       false  Alias for ac.

       usb    Enable autosuspend for all USB devices except those excluded by default or via configuration.

       bayoff Turn off optical drive in UltraBay/MediaBay.  The drive may be re-enabled by pulling the eject lever or pushing the media eject button on newer models.

       setcharge [start_threshold stop_threshold] [battery]
              Change  battery charge thresholds temporarily.  If your hardware supports only a stop threshold, set the start value to 0.  Configured charge thresholds will be restored at the next boot or
              by using tlp setcharge again but without the threshold arguments.

       fullcharge [battery]
              Charge battery to full capacity.  This is done by applying vendor presets to the charge thresholds temporarily.  Configured charge thresholds will be restored at the next boot or  by  using
              tlp setcharge without the threshold arguments.

       chargeonce [battery]
              Charge  battery  to the stop charge threshold once.  This is done by temporarily lifting the start charge threshold.  The configured start charge threshold will be restored at the next boot
              or by using tlp setcharge without the threshold arguments.

       discharge [battery] [target_charge_level]
              Force a complete or partial discharge of the battery while on AC power.

       recalibrate [battery]
              Perform a battery recalibration while on AC power: completely discharge the battery and recharge to 100%. The latter is done by temporarily applying vendor presets to the  thresholds.  Con‐
              figured thresholds will be restored at the next boot or by using tlp setcharge.

       diskid Print disk ids for configured drives.

       --version
              Print TLP version.

       -- CONFIG_PARAM=value ...
              Append  configuration  parameters to a command. These temporarily override the system configuration during execution of that command only and are not kept afterwards.  Disclaimer: this fea‐
              ture exists for the sole purpose of test automation during TLP's development. It is provided as is and there is no support whatsoever.

NOTES
       Availability of the above battery care commands and the possible charge threshold values always depend on laptop vendor or brand, Linux kernel version and TLP version. Check for actual  availabil‐
       ity, threshold ranges and battery names with tlp-stat -b. Follow the link in the SEE ALSO section for details.

       For  laptops with two batteries, the secondary battery must be specified as a command parameter in order to select it. In many cases the main battery will be BAT0, the secondary battery BAT1. When
       in doubt, the output of tlp-stat -b, which lists all batteries, can help.

EXAMPLES
       Change thresholds of the main battery to 70 / 90% temporarily:

              tlp setcharge 70 90

       Charge the secondary battery to full capacity:

              tlp fullcharge BAT1

       Recalibrate the main battery:

              tlp recalibrate

FILES
       /etc/tlp.conf
              System-wide user configuration file, uncomment parameters here to override default settings and customization files below.

       /etc/tlp.d/*.conf
              System-wide drop-in customization files, overriding defaults below.

       /usr/share/tlp/defaults.conf
              Intrinsic default settings. DO NOT EDIT this file, instead use one of the above alternatives.

       /run/tlp/run.conf
              Effective settings consolidated from all above files. DO NOT CHANGE this file, it is for reference only and regenerated on every invocation of TLP.

       /etc/default/tlp
              Obsolete system-wide configuration file. DO NOT USE this file, it is evaluated only when /etc/tlp.conf is non-existent.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
