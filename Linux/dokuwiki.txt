NAME
       dokuwiki-delsite - Remove and existing site driven by DokuWiki

SYNOPSIS

       dokuwiki-delsite {SITE_NAME}

DESCRIPTION
       DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use wiki mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind.

       dokuwiki-delsite creates the file hierarchy and configuration required to define a new site driven by the installed DokuWiki engine.

OPTIONS
       SITE_NAME

BUGS
       No check is done against the SITE_NAME, just avoid names like ../../../etc.

       Please report any bug to the Debian BTS.
