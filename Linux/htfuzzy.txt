NAME
       htfuzzy - fuzzy command-line search utility for the ht://Dig search engine

SYNOPSIS
       htfuzzy [-c configfile] [-v] algorithm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Description to follow here

OPTIONS
       -c configfile
              Use the specified configfile instead of the default.

       -v     Verbose mode , -vvv
               etc ). Specifying more than two v's is probably only useful for debugging purposes.

Supported Algorithms
       Different algoritms are supported for searching:
              soundex  Creates  a slightly modified soundex key database. Differences with the standard soundex algorithm are: Keys are 6 digits and the first letter is also encoded.        metaphone Creates
              a metaphone key database. This algorithm is more specific to English, but  will  get  fewer  "weird" matches than the soundex algorithm.

              accents (No description of the algorithm at the moment)

              endings Creates  two  databases  which  can  be  used  to match common word endings. The creation of these databases requires a list of affix rules and  a  dictionary  which  uses  those  affix
              rules.  The  format of the affix  rules and  dictionary  files are the ones used by the ispell program. Included with the distribution are the affix rules for English and a fairly small English
              dictionary.  Other languages can be supported  by  getting  the appropriate affix rules and dictionaries. These are available for many languages; check the ispell distribu- tion  for  more  de‐
              tails.

              synonyms  Creates  a database of synonyms for words. It reads a text database of synonyms and creates a  database  that htsearch  can  then use. Each line of the text database consists of words
              where the first word will have the other words on that line as synonyms.

Notes on searching
       Please consult specialised literature to find out how the different algorithms work or simply try another
              search stragegy you do not get the intended search results.
