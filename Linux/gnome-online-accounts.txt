NAME
       goa-daemon - GNOME Online Accounts Daemon

SYNOPSIS

       goa-daemon [--help] [--replace] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       The goa-daemon program provides the org.gnome.OnlineAccounts name on the session message bus. Users or administrators should never need to start this daemon as it will be automatically started by
       dbus-daemon(1) whenever an application sends a D-Bus message to the org.gnome.OnlineAccounts name on the session bus.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The goa-daemon program stores configuration in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goa-1.0/accounts.conf (typically ~/.config/goa-1.0/accounts.conf) file. The format of this file is private and 3rd party
       programs or libraries should never read it. This file does not contain any passwords or secrets.

       See the XDG Base Directory Specification[1] for more information about $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

SECRETS
       The goa-daemon program stores secrets (such as OAuth tokens) in GNOME Keyring[2]. The format of the stored secrets is private and 3rd party programs or libraries should never read, modify or
       delete these secrets.
