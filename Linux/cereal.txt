NAME
       cereal - client program to attach to cereal session

SYNOPSIS
       cereal command [args]

DESCRIPTION
       cereal is the client program to attach to a running cereal session.

SUBCOMMANDS
       cereal takes various subcommands:

       attach SESSION
              Attach to (take control of) cereal session SESSION.  This puts the user into a cereal console, provided by a command-restricted screen session.  To detach from an attached session, use
              "C-\  d".   For help on other available commands, use "C-\ ?".  Cereal uses a limited instance of screen to provide the console.  See screen(1) for more info on the available commands.
              `a' may be used in place of `attach'.

       follow [options] SESSION
              Follow (watch, without being able to intervene) a cereal session SESSION.  The options are: -c [--cat] to cat log instead of follow; -p [--path] to output just the path to the log file
              and exit.  `f' may be used in place of `follow'.

       list [SESSION]...
              List session(s).  With no arguments, will list all sessions.  The leading three characters in the list indicate: whether the session is running (+) or not (-) or in some unknown  state
              (?),  whether  the user can attach to the session (a) or not (-), whether the user can follow the session (f) or not (-).  If the session state is unknown (?), it's usually because the
              user asking for information about the session can't read the session stat file.  `l' may be used in place of `list'.

       help   Output a brief usage summary.  `h' or `?' may be used in place of `help'.

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if OK, 1 if minor problems, 2 if serious trouble.

BUGS
       If the invoking user does not have read and execute access to the cereal session's supervise directory, `cereal list' may not always indicate that session's status accurately.

REPORTING BUGS
