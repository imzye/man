NAME
       pyroman - a firewall configuration utility

SYNOPSIS
       pyroman
              [ -hvnspP ] [ -r RULESDIR ] [ -t SECONDS ]
              [ --help ] [ --version ] [ --safe ] [ --no-act ]
              [ --print ] [ --print-verbose ] [ --rules=RULESDIR ]
              [ --timeout=SECONDS ] [ safe ]

DESCRIPTION
       pyroman is a firewall configuration utility.

       It will compile a set of configuration files to iptables statements to setup IP packet filtering for you.

       While  it is not necessary for operating and using Pyroman, you should have understood how IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP and the other commonly used Internet protocols work and interact. You should also have
       understood the basics of iptables in order to make use of the full functionality.

       pyroman does not try to hide all the iptables complexity from you, but tries to provide you with a convenient way of managing a complex networks firewall.  For this it offers a compact  syntax  to
       add new firewall rules, while still exposing access to add arbitrary iptables rules.

OPTIONS
       -r RULESDIR,--rules=RULES
              Load the rules from directory RULESDIR instead of the default directory (usually /etc/pyroman )
       -t SECONDS,--timeout=SECONDS
              Wait SECONDS seconds after applying the changes for the user to type OK to confirm he can still access the firewall. This implies --safe but allows you to use a different timeout.
       -h, --help
              Print a summary of the command line options and exit.
       -V, --version
              Print the version number of pyroman and exit.
       -s, --safe, safe
              When  the  firewall  was  committed,  wait 30 seconds for the user to type OK to confirm, that he can still access the firewall (i.e. the network connection wasn't blocked by the firewall).
              Otherwise, the firewall changes will be undone, and the firewall will be restored to the previous state.  Use the --timeout=SECONDS option to change the timeout.
       -n, --no-act
              Don't actually run iptables. This can be used to check if pyroman accepts the configuration files.
       -p, --print
              Instead of running iptables, output the generated rules.
       -P, --print-verbose
              Instead of running iptables, output the generated rules. Each statement will have one comment line explaining how this rules was generated. This will usually include the filename  and  line
              number, and is useful for debugging.
CONFIGURATION
       Configuration  of  pyroman  consists  of  a number of files in the directory /etc/pyroman.  These files are in python syntax, although you do not need to be a python programmer to use these rules.
       There is only a small number of statements you need to know:
       add_host
              Define a new host or network
       add_interface
              Define a new interface (group)
       add_service
              Add a new service alias (note that you can always use e.g. www/tcp to reference the www tcp service as defined in /etc/services)
       add_nat
              Define a new NAT (Network Address Translation) rule
       allow  Allow a service, client, server combination
       reject Reject access for this service, client, server combination
       drop   Drop packets for this service, client, server combination
       add_rule
              Add a rule for this service, client, server and target combination
       iptables
              Add an arbitrary iptables statement to be executed at beginning
       iptables_end
              Add an arbitrary iptables statement to be executed at the end
       Detailed parameters for these functions can be looked up by caling
              cd /usr/share/pyroman
              pydoc ./commands.py
