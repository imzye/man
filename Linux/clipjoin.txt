CLIPJOIN(1)           User Contributed Perl Documentation          CLIPJOIN(1)

NAME
       clipjoin - Remove superfluous spaces from the clipboard.

VERSION
       version 0.26

MOTIVATION
       Often you'll copy some stuff, like this:

         <ingy> hey rking, you should use YBFOD: http://search.cpan
           | .org/~ingy/Acme-YBFOD-0.11/

       Getting that URL to a browser is tedious.

       Another IRC example is longer quotes:

         <strunk> Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the
             conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities
             exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with enate capacity but
             that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably
             be taken into account. I returned, and saw under the sun, that the
             race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither
             yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor
             yet favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all.

       If you wanted to quote that to someone, you'd have \n's and "   "'s
       everywhere, unless you ran "clipjoin" first.

       An example from mutt:

       ,-------------------------------------------.  |  xterm
       (X) | +-------------------------------------------+ |
       http://www.thisisalink.com/that/wrapped/ar|
       |+ound/a/line/and/its/a/pain/without/the/joi| |+inclip/script
       | `-------------------------------------------'

       Becomes:
       http://www.thisisalink.com/that/wrapped/around/a/line/and/its/a/pain/without/the/clipjoin/script
