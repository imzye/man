NAME
       moe - My Own (text) Editor

SYNOPSIS
       moe [global_options] [[+line[,col]] file_name [file_options]]...

DESCRIPTION
       GNU moe is a powerful, 8-bit clean, console text editor for ISO-8859 and ASCII character encodings. It has a modeless, user-friendly interface, online help, multiple windows, unlimited undo/redo capa‐
       bility, unlimited line length, unlimited buffers, global search/replace (on all buffers at once), block operations, automatic indentation, word wrapping, file name completion, directory  browser,  du‐
       plicate removal from prompt histories, delimiter matching, text conversion from/to UTF-8, romanization, etc.

       Moe respects your work. By default it won't automatically add, change, or remove not even one byte in your files. Moe is a WYTIWYG (what you type is what you get) editor.

       Moe can easily edit thousands of files at the same time.

       Moe uses ISO-8859-15 instead of UTF-8 because an 8-bit character set (combined with romanization if needed) can convey meaning safely and more efficiently than UTF-8 can.

       'global_options' are a mix of editor options and default 'file_options'.  Most long option names have a negative form '--backup' '--no-backup'.

       Each file name may be preceded by '+line[,column]' to start the cursor at the line, and optionally column, specified. 'line' and 'column' are applied to subsequent files until new values are specified
       for them.

       '-' used as a file name argument means standard input.  Directories are recursively descended into.

       caused moe to panic.
