NAME
       wmtime - Window Maker dockapp that displays the time and date

SYNOPSIS
       wmtime [ OPTION ]

DESCRIPTION
       WMTime displays the time and date and gives you some nice additional features too. It is intended for docking in Window Maker.

       It currently provides:

       •   the time and date;

       •   a realtime morphing interface (analog <> digital mode);

       •   auto-scaled and anti-aliased hands;

       •   localization, displaying the day and date in various languages;

       •   three user-defined commands to launch.

OPTIONS
       -d, -digital
              Display the digital clock on startup, instead of the analog clock.

       -display display
              This option specifies the X server to contact; see X(7x).

       -geometry geometry
              This option specifies the preferred position of clock; see X(7x).

       -n, -noseconds
              Disables the second hand.

       -l locale
              Specify locale.

       -h     Show help information.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -c     Set color.

USAGE
       The WMTime window is separated into top and bottom sections.  The top section contains a clock and the bottom section contains the date.

       The clock can be toggled between analog and digital modes.  To do this, click in the bottom section of the window.

       WMTime  can  also be used to launch programs.  You may click either left, middle, or right mouse buttons in the top section of the window.  The pre-configured program will be launched according to
       the mouse button clicked.  (see CONFIGURATION FILE below.)

       In order to move WMTime, drag on the outer edges.  These are not sensitive to mouse clicks.

DOCKING IN WINDOW MANAGERS
       Window Maker

              Window Maker users should drag and drop the WMTime window on the Dock.  Then, right-click on the border of the window and select “Settings...”.  Check “Start when Window Maker is started”.

       AfterStep

              AfterStep users should put the following in their $HOME/.steprc

                       Wharf wmtime - MaxSwallow "wmtime" wmtime &

       Other window managers

              WMTime runs nicely as a 64x64 shaped icon on your desktop.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       WMTime can launch three user-defined commands, triggered by left, middle and right mouse button clicks.  You can define the commands to launch in $HOME/.wmtimerc

              left: xterm
              middle: xload
              right: xcalc
       If WMTime detects a $HOME/.wmtimerc file, it will launch the appropriate command when you click on the clock.

       The system administrator can define default commands in /etc/wmtimerc.  The administrator may also choose to “fix” particular commands, making it impossible for users to  change.   These  commands
       can be defined in /etc/wmtimerc.fixed, although this isn't a nice thing to do.

FILES
       /etc/wmtimerc
       $HOME/.wmtimerc
       /etc/wmtimerc.fixed
