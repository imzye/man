NAME
       PDL::IO::Dicom - a module for reading DICOM images.

DESCRIPTION
       The PDL::IO::Dicom module enables reading 16-bit gray level Dicom images into PDL. As Dicom is an extremely complex format, this module can unfortunately not handle all different image types
       included in the DICOM standard. One common format that is currently not supported is the Papyrus format.

USAGE
           use PDL;
           use PDL::IO::Dicom;

           $img = rdcm("image.dcm");
