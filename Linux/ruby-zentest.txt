NAME
       zentest - scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing code

SYNOPSIS
       zentest MyProject.rb TestMyProject.rb > missing.rb

DESCRIPTION
       zentest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing code based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker pace.  zentest only works with Ruby and Minitest or
       Test::Unit. There is enough evidence to show that this is still proving useful to users, so it stays.

       See /usr/share/doc/ruby-zentest/ for more details.
