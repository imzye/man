NAME
       SalmID - rapid Kmer based Salmonella identifier from sequence data

SYNOPSIS
       SalmID [-h] [-v] [-i your_fastqgz] [-e file_extension] [-d directory] [-r percentage, coverage or taxonomy] [-m quick or thorough]

DESCRIPTION
       SalmID  enables  rapid  confirmation of Salmonella spp. and subspp. from sequence data.  This is done by checking taxonomic ID of single isolate samples.  Currently only IDs Salmonella species and
       subspecies, and some common contaminants (Listeria, Escherichia).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -i your_fastqgz, --input_file your_fastqgz
              Single fastq.gz file input, include path to file if file is not in same directory

       -e file_extension, --extension file_extension
              File extension, if specified without "--input_dir", SalmID will attempt to ID all files with this extension in current directory, otherwise files in input directory

       -d directory, --input_dir directory
              Directory which contains data for identification, when not specified files in current directory will be analyzed.

       -r percentage, coverage or taxonomy, --report percentage, coverage or taxonomy
              Report either percentage ("percentage") of clade specific kmers recovered, average kmer-coverage ("cov"), or taxonomy (taxonomic species ID, plus observed mean k-mer coverages and  expected
              coverage).

       -m quick or thorough, --mode quick or thorough
              Quick [quick] or thorough [thorough] mode
