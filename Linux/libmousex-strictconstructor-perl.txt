NAME
       MouseX::StrictConstructor - Make your object constructors blow up on unknown attributes

SYNOPSIS
         use Mouse;
         use MouseX::StrictConstructor;

DESCRIPTION
       Simply loading this module makes your constructors "strict". If your constructor is called with an attribute argument that your class does not declare, then it dies. This is a great way to catch
       small typos.

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to cpan-RT.
