NAME
       Catalyst::View::GD - A Catalyst View for GD images

SYNOPSIS
         # lib/MyApp/View/GD.pm
         package MyApp::View::GD;
         use base 'Catalyst::View::GD';
         1;

         # configure in lib/MyApp.pm
         MyApp->config({
             ...
             'View::GD' => {
                 gd_image_type         => 'png',        # defaults to 'gif'
                 gd_image_content_type => 'images/png', # defaults to 'image/$gd_image_type'
                 gd_image_render_args  => [ 5 ],        # defaults to []
             },
         });

         sub foo : Local {
             my($self, $c) = @_;
             $c->stash->{gd_image} = $self->create_foo_image();
             $c->forward('MyApp::View::GD');
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Catalyst View subclass which can handle rendering GD based image content.

CONFIG OPTIONS
       gd_image_type
           This defaults to "gif" but should be the name of the method to call on the GD::Image instance in order to render the images.

       gd_image_render_args
           This is an array ref of values to be passed as an argument to the GD::Image render method.

       gd_image_content_type
           The  default for this is built from the "gd_image_type" parameter, which in most cases will just work, but in some more specific rendering methods in GD::Image it will not and you will need to
           assign this explicitly.

METHODS
       new This really just handles consuming the configuration parameters.

       process
           This method will always look in the "gd_image" stash for an instance of GD::Image and it will then render and serve it according to the configuration setup.

           It is also possible to override the global configuration on a per-request basis by assigning values in the stash using the same keys as used in the configuration.

BUGS
