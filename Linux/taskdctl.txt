NAME
       taskdctl - Taskserver control program

SYNOPSIS
       taskdctl [start|stop|restart|graceful|status]

DESCRIPTION
       The  taskdctl  program  allows you to start and stop Taskserver. The TASKDDATA environment variable is used to locate the root data structure, and query the configuration to obtain the location of the
       pid file.

COMMANDS
       Taskdctl supports several commands:

       taskdctl start
              Starts the server as a daemon, if it is not already running.  It is harmless to run this command if the server is already running.

       taskdctl stop
              Stops the server, if it is running.  It is harmless to run this command if the server is not running.

       taskdctl restart
              Stops the server, if it is running, then starts the server again.  This is done by killing the server process.  This will interrupt any current sync sessions, probably causing an error.  It  is
              harmless to run this command if the server is not running.

       taskdctl graceful
              Stops the server, if it is running, by waiting for the server to go idle, then restarts the server again.  This is done by sending SIGHUP signal to the server.  This will not interrupt any cur‐
              rent sync sessions.  It is harmless to run this command if the server is not running.

       taskdctl status
              Shows the status of the Taskserver, whether it is running or not.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Taskdctl requires that the TAKSDDATA environment variable be properly set. This is because the root data structure is accessed.
