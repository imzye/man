NAME
       pagein - a tool to force swapped out pages back into memory

SYNOPSIS
       pagein [-a] [-h] [-p pid] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Pagein is a tool that forces pages that are in swap to be paged in back to memory.  The main usecase for pagein is to exercise the VM and swap subsystems for testing purposes.

OPTIONS
       pagein options are as follow:

       -a     try to page in all processes. This needs to be run with root privilege to allow pagein to access all the processes. Cannot be used with the -p option.

       -h     show help information.

       -p pid page in process with process ID pid. Cannot be used with the -a option.  Processes not owned by the user need to be paged in by running pagein with root privilege.

       -v     verbose mode, shows progress and paging in statistics, useful with the -a option.

EXAMPLES
       Page in all processes and show progress:
               sudo pagein -a -v

       Page in the Xorg process:
               sudo pagein -p $(pidof Xorg)
