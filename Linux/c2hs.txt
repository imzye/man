NAME
       c2hs - C->Haskell Interface Generator

SYNOPSIS
       c2hs [OPTIONS]...  header-file binding-file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly describes the c2hs command.  For more details, refer to the main documentation, which is available in various other formats, including SGML and HTML; see below.

OPTIONS
       The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options are included below. For a complete description, see the other documen‐
       tation.

       c2hs accepts the following options:

       -h, -?, --help
              brief help

       -v, --version
              show version information

       --numeric-version
              show version number

       -c CPP, --cpp=CPP
              use executable CPP to invoke C preprocessor

       -C CPPOPTS, --cppopts=CPPOPTS
              pass CPPOPTS to the C preprocessor

       -o FILE, --output=FILE
              output result to FILE (should end in .hs)

       -t PATH, --output-dir=PATH
              place generated files in PATH

       -p  PLATFORM, --platform=PLATFORM
              platform to use for cross compilation

       -k, --keep
              keep pre-processed C header

       -l, --copy-library
              copy `C2HS' library module to the current directory

       -d TYPE, --dump=TYPE
              dump internal information (for debugging), where TYPE is one of:

              • trace   trace compiler phases

              • genbind trace binding generation

              • ctrav   trace C declaration traversal

              • chs     dump the binding file (adds .dump to the name)

       header-file is the header file belonging to the marshalled library. It must end with suffix .h.

       binding-file is the corresponding Haskell binding file, which must end with suffix .chs.

       PLATFORM The platform name can be one of: x86_64-linux.  i686-linux.  m68k-palmos.  This allows for cross-compilation, assuming the rest of your toolchain supports that. The default is the current
       host platform.

       The most useful of these options is probably --cppopts (or -C).  If the C header file needs any special options (like -D or -I) to go through the C pre-processor, here is the place to pass them.

EXAMPLES
       The easiest way to use the C->Haskell Interface Generator is via Cabal.  Cabal knows about .chs files and will run c2hs automatically, passing the appropriate flags.

       When used directly, c2hs is usually called as:

       c2hs lib.h Lib.chs

       where  lib.h  is  the  header  file  and  Lib.chs the Haskell binding module, which define the C- and Haskell-side interface, respectively.  If no errors occur, the result is a pure Haskell module
       Lib.hs, which implements the Haskell API of the library.

       A more advanced call may look like this:

       c2hs --cppopts=-I/some/obscure/dir --cppopts=-DEXTRA lib.h Lib.chs

       Often, lib.h will not be in the current directory, but in one of the header file directories.  Apart from the current directory, C->Haskell looks in two places for the header: first, in the  stan‐
       dard  include  directory of the used system, this is usually /usr/include and /usr/local/include; and second, it will look in every directory that is mentioned in a -IDIR option passed to the pre-
       processor via --cppopts.

CAVEATS
       If you have more than one option that you want to give to the pre-processor, use multiple --cppopts= flags.
