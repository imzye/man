HTMLMIN(1)                                                                                     User Commands                                                                                     HTMLMIN(1)

NAME
       htmlmin - htmlmin is a configurable HTML Minifier with safety features.

DESCRIPTION
       usage: htmlmin [-h] [-c] [-s] [--remove-all-empty-space]

              [--keep-optional-attribute-quotes] [-H] [-k] [-a PRE_ATTR] [-p [TAG ...]] [-e ENCODING] [INPUT] [OUTPUT]

       Minify HTML

   positional arguments:
       INPUT  File path to html file to minify. Defaults to stdin.

       OUTPUT File path to output to. Defaults to stdout.

   options:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -c, --remove-comments
              When  set, comments will be removed. They can be kept on an individual basis by starting them with a '!': <!--! comment -->. The '!' will be removed from the final output. If you want a '!'
              as the leading character of your comment, put two of them: <!--!! comment -->.

       -s, --remove-empty-space
              When set, this removes empty space betwen tags in certain cases.  Specifically, it will remove empty space if and only if there a newline character occurs within the space. Thus, code  like
              '<span>x</span> <span>y</span>' will be left alone, but code such as '   ...

       </head>
              <body>

       ...'   will become '...</head><body>...'. Note that this CAN break your html if you spread two inline tags over two lines. Use with caution.

       --remove-all-empty-space
              When  set,  this  removes  ALL  empty  space  betwen tags. WARNING: this can and likely will cause unintended consequences. For instance, '<i>X</i> <i>Y</i>' will become '<i>X</i><i>Y</i>'.
              Putting whitespace along with other text will avoid this problem. Only use if you are confident in the result. Whitespace is not removed from inside of tags, thus '<span> </span>'  will  be
              left alone.

       --keep-optional-attribute-quotes
              When set, this keeps all attribute quotes, even if they are optional.

       -H, --in-head
              If you are parsing only a fragment of HTML, and the fragment occurs in the head of the document, setting this will remove some extra whitespace.

       -k, --keep-pre-attr
              HTMLMin  supports  the  propietary attribute 'pre' that can be added to elements to prevent minification. This attribute is removed by default. Set this flag to keep the 'pre' attributes in
              place.

       -a PRE_ATTR, --pre-attr PRE_ATTR
              The attribute htmlmin looks for to find blocks of HTML that it should not minify. This attribute will be removed from the HTML unless '-k' is specified. Defaults to 'pre'.

       -p [TAG ...], --pre-tags [TAG ...]
              By default, the contents of 'pre', and 'textarea' tags are left unminified.  You can specify different tags using the --pre-tags option. 'script' and 'style' tags are always  left  unminin‐
              fied.

       -e ENCODING, --encoding ENCODING
              Encoding to read and write with. Default 'utf-8'. When reading from stdin, attempts to use the system's encoding before defaulting to utf-8.
