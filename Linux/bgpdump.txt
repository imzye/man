       -H
           multi-line, human-readable (the default)

       -m
           one-line per entry with unix timestamps

       -M
           one-line per entry with human readable timestamps in the form MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS (there are other differences between -m and -M)

       Common options:

       -O file

       -s
           log to syslog (the default)

       -t change
           timestamps for RIB dumps reflect the last route modification

       Special options:

       -T
           run internal tests and exit

INPUT FORMATS
       •   MRT routing table dump entries in TABLE_DUMP or TABLE_DUMP_V2 types
       •   Zebra/Quagga BGP records:
           •   BGP messages (OPEN, UPDATE, NOTIFY, KEEPALIVE)
           •   BGP state changes
       •   File may be gzipped or bzip2'd and/or passed in through stdin

       The file format is described in the Internet Draft grow-mrt-13: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-grow-mrt-13>

BUGS
       If a single update message contains more than 8192 added or withdrawn prefixes, all those above that number are ignored.

       Files with a name longer than 999 characters cannot be processed.

       The bgpdump program is not y2038 compliant. This is inherited from the file format.

DEBIAN
       Besides bug fixes, the following changes were done in the packaging for the Debian distribution:

       •   The maximum number of prefixes processed from a single update
             messages was raised from 2050 to 8192.
