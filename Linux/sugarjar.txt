NAME
       sj - SugarJar, a Git/GitHub helper

SYNOPSIS
       sj <command> [<args>] [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
       Command, args, and options, can appear in any order.

   OPTIONS:
       --feature-prefix
              Prefix to use for feature branches

       --github-host HOST
              The  host  for  "hub". Note that we will set this in the local repo config so there is no need to have multiple config files for multiple github servers. Put your default one in your config
              file, and simply specify this option the first time you clone or touch a repo and it will be part of that repo until changed.

       --github-user USER
              Github username

       -h, --help
              Print this help message

       --ignore-dirty
              Tell command that check for a dirty repo to carry on anyway. [default: false]

       --ignore-prerun-failure
              Ignore preprun failure on *push commands. [default: false]

       --log-level LEVEL
              Set logging level (fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace). This can also be set via the SUGARJAR_LOGLEVEL environment variable. [default: info]

       --[no-]pr-autofill
              When creating a PR, auto fill the title & description from the top commit if we are using "gh". [default: true]

       --[no-]pr-autostack
              When creating a PR, if this is a subfeature, should we make it a PR on the PR for the parent feature. If not specified, we prompt when this happens, when true always  do  this,  when  false
              never do this. Only applicable when usiing "gh" and on branch-based PRs.

       --[no-]color
              Enable color. [default: true]

       --version

   COMMANDS:
              amend

              Amend the current commit. Alias for "git commit --amend".  Accepts other arguments such as "-a" or files.

              amendq, qamend

              Same as "amend" but without changing the message. Alias for "git commit --amend --no-edit".

              bclean [<branch>]

              If safe, delete the current branch (or the specified branch).  Unlike "git branch -d", bclean can handle squash-merged branches.  Think of it as a smarter "git branch -d".

              bcleanall

              Walk all branches, and try to delete them if it's safe. See "bclean" for details.

              binfo

              Verbose information about the current branch.

              br

              Verbose branch list. An alias for "git branch -v".

              debuginfo

              Prints out a bunch of version and config information useful for including in bug reports.

              feature, f <branch_name>

              Create  a "feature" branch. It's morally equivalent to "git checkout -b" except it defaults to creating it based on some form of 'master' instead of your current branch. In order of prefer‐
              ence it will be upstream/master, origin/master, master, depending upon what remotes are available.

              Note that you can specify "--feature-prefix" (or add "feature_prefix" to your config) to have all features created with a prefix. This is useful for branch-based workflows where  developers
              are expected to create branches names that, for example, start with their username.

              forcepush, fpush

              The  same  as  "smartpush", but uses "--force-with-lease". This is a "safer" way of doing force-pushes and is the recommended way to push after rebasing or amending. Never do this to shared
              branches. Very convenient for keeping the branch behind a pullrequest clean.

              lint

              Run any linters configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

              pullsuggestions, ps

              Pull any suggestions *that have been committed* in the GitHub UI.  This will show the diff and prompt for confirmation before merging. Note that a fast-forward merge will be used.

              smartclone, sclone

              A smart wrapper to "git clone" that handles forking and managing remotes for you.  It will clone a git repository using hub-style short name ("$org/$repo"). If the org of the repository  is
              not the same as your github-user then it will fork the repo for you to your account (if not already done) and then setup your remotes so that "origin" is your fork and "upstream" is the up‐
              stream.

              smartlog, sl

              Inspired by Facebook's "sl" extension to Mercurial, this command will show you a tree of all your local branches relative to your upstream.

              smartpullrequest, smartpr, spr

              A smart wrapper to "hub pull-request" that checks if your repo is dirty before creating the pull request.

              smartpush, spush

              A smart wrapper to "git push" that runs whatever is defined in "on_push" in .sugarjar.yml, and only pushes if they succeed.

              subfeature, sf <feature>

              An alias for 'sj feature <feature> <current_branch>'

              unit

              Run any unitests configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

              up [<branch>]

              Rebase  the  current  branch (or specified branch) intelligently.  In most causes this will check for a main (or master) branch on upstream, then origin. If a branch explicitly tracks some‐
              thing else, then that will be used, instead.

              upall

              Same as "up", but for all branches.

FATAL: No such subcommand: version                                                                May 2025                                                                                            SJ(1)
