NAME
       coq-planif-transition - planification of a transition

SYNOPSIS
       coq-planif-transition [--org-mode] srcpkg1 ... srcpkgN

DESCRIPTION
       This script can be used when new versions of Coq packages get released, to check everything is ok with the rest of the stack.

       You're  supposed to call it with a space-separated list of packages with a new version, and the result is generally several lines of space-separated package names corresponding to what needs to be
       rebuilt, where packages on the same line can be compiled at the same time.

       To make this planning on package compilation and testing easier, the --org-mode option gives an output suitable for insertion in an Emacs org-mode file.

       If you use sbuild to compile the packages, with sbuild configured with a local repo, you can then put the packages in the repo step by step and check that the new versions don't break anything.

EXAMPLES
