NAME
       tovrmlx3d - Convert 3D models to X3D, format VRML / X3D to have nice indentation.

SYNOPSIS
       tovrmlx3d [file] [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       tovrmlx3d Convert 3D models to X3D, format VRML / X3D to have nice indentation. The output model will be written on standard output.

USAGE
       tovrmlx3d takes the following arguments:

       file   The 3D model file to open.

       -h / --help
              Print the help message and exit.

       -v / --version
              Print the version number and exit.

       --encoding classic|xml
              Choose X3D encoding. Default is "classic".

       --force-x3d
              Force  conversion  from  VRML to X3D. Note that if you choose XML encoding (by --encoding=xml), this is automatic. Note that this works sensibly only for VRML 2.0 (not for older Inven‐
              tor/VRML 1.0, we cannot convert them to valid X3D for now).
