NAME
       vfu - VFU is console (text-mode) file manager for UNIX/Linux

SYNOPSIS
       vfu [options]

DESCRIPTION
       vfu has following features:

        - Fast one-key commands
        - Extended completion and wildcard expansion
        - Directory tree with sizes (incl. sizes cache)
        - File-type colorization (extension and type)
        - Archives support (TAR, TGZ, BZ2, and many more)
        - Simple FTP support through archive-like interface
        - Internal text/hex file viewer and editor (optional)
        - Extensive user-defined external support/utils
        - Regular expressions selection and search
        - Multiple file masks
        - and much more...

OPTIONS
        -h
       prints help for command line options

        -i
       runs vfu in interactive mode (can be used with \-d)

        -d path
       changes working directory to `path'

        -r
       rebuild directory tree

        -t
       view directory tree only

       These options are for using vfu in partial non-interactive mode.

        example: vfu -d /usr/local -i

CONFIGURATION
       vfu configuration is divided in two parts (files):

       vfu.conf

       This file contains configuration for external editor and pager, favorite directories, file-type colorization. This is plain text file which format is described below. vfu only reads vfu.conf, it
       never writes in it!

       vfu.options

       This file contains all Options/Toggles which can be changed from inside vfu -- Options menu. vfu.options is binary file and is overwritten on vfu exit or on change option event! Deleting this file
       will reset vfu toggles to default values. vfu.options is not portable between vfu versions!

   Location of vfu.conf
       vfu.conf can be placed as any of:

        $HOME/.vfu/vfu.conf

        $HOME/$RC_PREFIX/vfu/vfu.conf  (if $RC_PREFIX is exported)

        /etc/vfu.conf

        /usr/local/etc/vfu.conf

        /usr/local/vfu.conf

   Other files location
       All other files including vfu.options are placed in:

        $HOME/.vfu/

        $HOME/$RC_PREFIX/vfu/

       What is $RC_PREFIX and why to use it? Some more information for this can be found in the CONFIG file which is supplied with vfu package.

VFU.CONF
       This is a sample copy of vfu.conf with appropriate comments:

DISTRIBUTION
       It is supposed that only source packages will be distributed.  However sometimes binary packages will be released, but not often.  VFU packages are named in this way:

        vfu-X.xx.src.tgz

       source package for version X.xx

        vfu-X.xx.bin.platform.tgz

       binary package for version X.xx for `platform' platform

       examples:

        vfu-4.22.src.tgz

        vfu-4.22.bin.linux.glibc.tgz

        vfu-4.22.bin.linux.libc5.tgz

        vfu-4.22.bin.dos.tgz

       All packages are TAR+GZIP .tgz, bz2 and zip are available on request.

       NOTE: Always check HISTORY document -- it often contains some useful notes!
