NAME
       gphelp - GP-PARI online help script

SYNOPSIS
       gphelp [-to_pod file] [-raw] [-detex] [-noskip] [-utf8] [-k] [-ch c1] [-cb c2] [-cu c3] [keyword [ @{1,2,3,4,5} ]] [tutorial] [refcard]...

DESCRIPTION
       Invokes  the  PARI-GP  online  help script. By default, keyword is understood as a section heading (a GP function name), and gphelp looks for it in Chapter 3 of PARI User's Manual. If it is found, the
       corresponding section is copied to a temporary file in /tmp (or $GPTMPDIR), TeX is run then the corresponding section is displayed in a separate window, using xdvi (or $GPXDVI).

       If more than one keyword is given on a single command line, the outputs are concatenated. If keyword is omitted, open the whole manual users.dvi.  The keywords tutorial and refcard open the  GP  tuto‐
       rial and reference card respectively.

       GP defaults, help sections (1 to 11) as well as some keywords (readline, bnf, ell, all operators...) are recognized and treated in a special way to make sure they match a section heading. For instance
       && is translated to Comparison and boolean operators which isn't that obvious to guess.  Make sure to enclose keyword between quotes if it contains dangerous characters (e.g spaces). For instance, you
       need to type

              gphelp -k "elliptic curves"

       and not

              gphelp -k elliptic curves

       which would look for "elliptic" then for "curves" and output e.g.  ploth among the relevant sections.

FULL SEARCH: @ MARKERS
       The  pattern  @x (where x is a chapter number between 1 and 5) at the end of keyword conducts the search in the corresponding chapter instead of the default Chapter 3. If the number is omitted, search
       the whole manual. For instance
              gphelp -k gerepile@4
       will look for gerepile in Chapter 4 of users manual.
              gphelp -k gerepile@
       will search the whole manual. All chapters of the manual (usersch[1-5].tex) are assumed to be in $GPDOCDIR (defaultvaluesetby Configure). You are allowed to gzip (or compress) them, this won't  affect
       the search.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are available:

       -cb, -color_bold c2
              color used for bold. See -color_help.

       -ch, -color_help c1
              color (between 1 and 16) used for general printing. Only significant in detex mode.

       -cu, -color_underline c3
              color used for underline. See -color_help.

       -detex Use detex mode. The TeX file is converted to readable screen output that is directly written to the terminal; don't use tex or xdvi.

       -noskip
              By default, the help text is continued when a new section is tagged with a %GPHELPskip marker (on the same line). If this option is set, do not honor markers: end the help text as soon as a new
              section is started.

       -utf8  In detex mode, use UTF-8 encoding for characters, .e.g. use é (&eacute;) instead of 'e.

       -k     Switch to apropos mode. Only write to standard output the list of section headings in manual which contain keyword.

              You can then choose an element in the list and use it as argument for gphelp (surround it by quotes if it includes spaces), possibly followed by a trailing @ marker (see above).

       -raw   use internal format for output (using @x markers). For debugging only.

       -to_pod file
              try to convert file from TeX to POD format. Will only work on some subset of PARI User's Manual (Chapter 3, reference card). This should be the only arguments on the command line.

ENVIRONMENT
       COLUMNS
              number of columns available on screen (for detex mode)

       DISPLAY
              where to launch the dvi previewer. If unset, detex mode is assumed automatically.

       GPDOCDIR
              directory where PARI help files are located. Default value set at Configure time.

       GPTEX
              TeX typesetting program to use

       GPTMPDIR
              directory where temporary files are written

       GPXDVI
              dvi previewer to use. You may use this to specify options for vanilla xdvi, for instance "xdvi -s 7" to select a shrink factor.

FILES
       gp     the gp calculator

       gphelp the gphelp script

       users.dvi
              PARI/GP User's Manual

       tutorial.dvi
              PARI/GP tutorial

       refcard.dvi
              GP reference card

       refcard.ps
              GP reference card, printer ready

BUGS
       The search algorithm is rather crude and the data searched rather unstructured. Hence, searching outside of Chapter 3 may not yield useful results, except in apropos mode (sections  may  be  truncated
       too soon for instance).

       Multiword search patterns have a tendency to fail due to various TeX constructs in the source.
