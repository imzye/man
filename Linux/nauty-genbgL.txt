NAME
       nauty-genbgL - (L1 flavour)

SYNOPSIS
       genbg [-c -ugs -vq -lzF] [-Z#] [-D#] [-A] [-d#|-d#:#] [-D#|-D#:#] n1 n2 [mine[:maxe]] [res/mod] [file]

DESCRIPTION
              Find all bicoloured graphs of a specified class.

       n1     : the number of vertices in the first class

       n2     : the number of vertices in the second class

              mine:maxe : a range for the number of edges

              #:0 means '# or more' except in the case 0:0

              res/mod : only generate subset res out of subsets 0..mod-1

              file : the name of the output file (default stdout)

       -c     : only write connected graphs

       -z     : all the vertices in the second class must have

              different neighbourhoods

       -F     : the vertices in the second class must have at least two

              neighbours of degree at least 2

       -L     : there is no vertex in the first class whose removal leaves

              the vertices in the second class unreachable from each other

       -Y#    : two vertices in the second class must have at least # common nbrs

       -Z#    : two vertices in the second class must have at most # common nbrs

       -A     : no vertex in the second class has a neighbourhood which is a

              subset of another vertex's neighbourhood in the second class

       -D#    : specify an upper bound for the maximum degree

       Example: -D6.
              You can also give separate maxima for the

              two parts, for example: -D5:6

       -d#    : specify a lower bound for the minimum degree.

              Again, you can specify it separately for the two parts: -d1:2

       -g     : use graph6 format for output (default)

       -s     : use sparse6 format for output

       -a     : use Greechie diagram format for output

       -u     : do not output any graphs, just generate and count them

       -v     : display counts by number of edges to stderr

       -l     : canonically label output graphs (using the 2-part colouring)

       -q     : suppress auxiliary output

              See program text for much more information.
