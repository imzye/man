NAME
       mpgrafic - MPI version of N-body initial conditions grafic package

SYNOPSIS
       mpgrafic [OPTION...] [[<] INPUT_FILE] [> OUTPUT_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       mpgrafic  produces  initial conditions files for N-body simulations of cosmological large-scale structure formation. It is a free-licensed, MPI-parallelised, rewritten version of Ed Bertschinger's
       grafic-1 program, producing output files in the grafic format. It includes options for an Eisenstein and Hu baryonic wiggles power spectrum, for using a low-resolution map for large-scale modes in
       the  spirit  of  grafic-2,  and  together  with  constrfield,  can  be  used  for  generating  constrained  initial  conditions.  Details  are   given   in   Prunet   et   al   (2008)   http://cd‐
       sads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2008ApJS..178..179P.
