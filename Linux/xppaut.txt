DESCRIPTION
       xppaut is a tool for solving:

       •   differential equations
       •   difference equations
       •   delay equations
       •   functional equations
       •   differential-algebraic equation
       •   boundary value problems
       •   stochastic equations

       The  code  brings  together  a  number  of  useful  algorithms  and  is  written  in  C.  All  the  graphics  and  interface  are  created  using  the  X Window System protocol client library Xlib
       <http://www.xfree86.org>.

       xppaut capabilities:
       •   Handles up to 1950 differential equations.
       •   There are over a dozen solvers including several for stiff systems, a solver for integral equations and a symplectic solver
       •   Up to 10 graphics windows can be visible at once and a variety of color combinations is supported
       •   PostScript output is supported as well as GIF and animated GIF movies
       •   Post processing is easy and includes the ability to make histograms, FFTs and applying functions to columns of data
       •   Equilibria and linear stability as well as one-dimensional invariant sets can be computed
       •   Nullclines and flow fields aid in the qualitative understanding of two-dimensional models
       •   Poincare maps and equations on cylinders and tori are also supported
       •   Some useful averaging theory tricks and various methods for dealing with coupled oscillators
       •   Equations with Dirac delta functions are allowable
       •   Animations of simulations such as a little pendulum moving back and forth or lamprey swimming
       •   A curve-fitter based on the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm which lets you fit dynamical systems to data
       •   Generate "movies" of three-dimensional views of attractors or parametric changes in the attractor as some parameters vary
       •   Dynamically link to external subroutines
       •   From the command line type /dev/stdin as the file and you can write the ODE on the fly

ENVIRONMENT
       XPPSTART
              File browser will open to the specified path. This may be useful in an instructional setting to point to a mapped drive containing course materials.

       XPPHELP
              Path to the XPPAUT documentation file <xpphelp.html> (e.g. /usr/share/doc/xppaut/html/xpphelp.html)

       XPPBROWSER
              Web browser to view documentation (e.g. /usr/bin/firefox)

FILES
       Each  user can customize the behavior and appearance of Xppaut via the file “$HOME/.xpprc”. Where the environment variable $HOME points to the user's home directory. On most systems $HOME will al‐
       ready be set.  Each option line in .xpprc begins with the “@” symbol followed by a comma-separated list of options. Comment lines begin with the “#” symbol and are ignored.

              # Example .xpprc file
              @ maxstor=50000
              @ meth=qualrk,tol=1e-6,atol=1e-6
              #Set up a customized look
              @ but=quit:fq,bell=1
              @ bigfont=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-14,grads=1
              # thats it

HELP
       Note: On typical X Window installations the command xlsfonts lists available fonts.  For example, the following command lists only the available fixed width fonts:

              xlsfonts | grep -i -e "typewriter" \
                     -e "mono" -e "^[0-9]x[0-9]" \
                     -e "fixed" -e "-c-" -e "-m-" | sort
