NAME
       beacon - transmit periodic messages on an AX.25 port.

SYNOPSIS
       beacon  [-c  <src_call>]  [-d <dest_call>[digi ..]] [-f] [-H] [-l] [-m]
       [-s] [-t interval] [-v] port “message”

DESCRIPTION
       Beacon transmits the message text on an AX.25 port  every  thirty  min‐
       utes.  The  message is addressed to “IDENT” and is sent using the AX.25
       callsign of the port specified on the command line. Typically the  mes‐
       sage  text  will  contain spaces and/or other characters, therefore the
       message text should be enclosed in quotes to ensure they are passed  to
       the beacon program untranslated.

OPTIONS
       -c              Configure  the source callsign for beacons. The default
                       is to use the interface callsign.

       -d              Configure the destination callsign for beacons. The de‐
                       fault  is  “IDENT”.   Optional: Digipeaters may follow,
                       separated with spaces. Use -d "DEST DIGI1 DIGI2 .."

       -f              Do not fork into the background.

       -l              Enables the logging of errors to the  system  log,  the
                       default is off.

       -H              Start interval relative to the hour.

       -m              Changes the destination address to “MAIL” and sends the
                       message text once only. This option overrides any  des‐
                       tination callsign given with the -d option.

       -s              Sends the message text once only.

       -t interval     The  time  interval  between  messages, the interval is
                       given in minutes and the default is thirty minutes.
