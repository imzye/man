NAME
       tpmtoken_protect - encrypt or decrypt data using a symmetric key stored in the user's TPM PKCS#11 data store

SYNOPSIS
       tpmtoken_protect [ OPTION ]

DESCRIPTION
       tpmtoken_protect will encrypt or decrypt data using a symmetric key that is stored in the user's data store.  The key used to protect the data is a 256-bit AES key stored as a private Secret Key
       PKCS#11 object.  The object has the PKCS#11 label attribute of ´User Data Protection Key´.  The key is generated by the TPM PKCS#11 implementation when it is needed the first time.  Since it is
       generated as a private object, it is protected by the TPM on the platform.

       This command requires the ´-i´ and ´-o´ command options to be specified.
