NAME
       glide - Glide video driver

SYNOPSIS

         Driver "glide"

DESCRIPTION
       glide  is an Xorg driver for Glide capable video boards (such as 3Dfx Voodoo boards). This driver is mainly for Voodoo 1 and Voodoo 2 boards, later boards from 3Dfx have 2D built-in and you should
       preferably use a driver separate for those boards or the fbdev(4) driver.  This driver is a bit special because Voodoo 1 and 2 boards are very much NOT made for  running  2D  graphics.  Therefore,
       this driver uses no hardware acceleration (since there is no acceleration for 2D, only 3D). Instead it is implemented with the help of a "shadow" framebuffer that resides entirely in RAM. Selected
       portions  of this shadow framebuffer are then copied out to the Voodoo board at the right time. Because of this, the speed of the driver is very dependent on the CPU. But since the CPU is nowadays
       actually rather fast at moving data, we get very good speed anyway, especially since the whole shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM.

       This driver supports 16 and 24 bit color modes. The 24 bit color mode uses a 32 bit framebuffer (it has no support for 24 bit packed-pixel framebuffers). Notice that the  Voodoo  boards  can  only
       display 16 bit color, but the shadow framebuffer can be run in 24 bit color. The point of supporting 24 bit mode is that this enables you to run in a multihead configuration with Xinerama together
       with another board that runs in real 24 bit color mode. (All boards must run the same color depth when you use Xinerama).

       Resolutions  supported  are:  640x480,  800x600, 960x720, 1024x768, 1280x1024 and 1600x1200. Note that not all modes will work on all Voodoo boards. It seems that Voodoo 2 boards support no higher
       than 1024x768 and Voodoo 1 boards can go to 800x600. If you see a message like this in the output from the server:

         (EE) GLIDE(0): grSstWinOpen returned ...

       Then you are probably trying to use a resolution that is supported by the driver but not supported by the hardware.

       Refresh rates supported are: 60Hz, 75Hz and 85Hz. The refresh rate used is derived from the normal mode line according to the following table:

       Mode-line refresh rate      Used refresh rate

          0-74 Hz
                                     60 Hz

         74-84 Hz
                                     75 Hz

         84-   Hz
                                     85 Hz

       Thus, if you use a modeline that for example has a 70Hz refresh rate you will only get a 60Hz refresh rate in actuality.

       Selecting which Voodoo board to use with the driver is done by using an option called "GlideDevice" in the "Device" section. (If you don't have this option present then the first board found  will
       be selected for that Device section). For example: To use the first Voodoo board, use a "Device" section like this, for example:

       Section "Device"
          Identifier  "Voodoo"
          Driver      "glide"
          Option      "dpms" "on"
          Option      "GlideDevice" "0"
       EndSection

       And  if you have more than one Voodoo board, add another "Device" section with a GlideDevice option with value 1, and so on. (You can use more than one Voodoo board, but SLI configured boards will
       be treated as a single board.)

       Multihead and Xinerama configurations are supported.

       Limited support for DPMS screen saving is available. The "standby" and "suspend" modes are just painting the screen black. The "off" mode turns the Voodoo board off and thus works correctly.

       This driver does not support a virtual screen size different from the display size.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The glide driver supports any board that can be used with Glide (such as 3Dfx Voodoo boards)

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "OnAtExit" "boolean"
              If true, will leave the Voodoo board on when the server exits. Useful in a multihead setup when only the Voodoo board is connected to a second monitor and you don't  want  that  monitor  to
              lose signal when you quit the server. Put this option in the Device section.  Default: off.

       Option "GlideDevice" "integer"
              Selects  which  Voodoo  board  to  use. (Or boards, in an SLI configuration).  The value should be 0 for the first board, 1 for the second and so on.  If it is not present, the first Voodoo
              board found will be selected.  Put this option in the Device section.

EXAMPLE
       Here is an example of a part of an xorg.conf file that uses a multihead configuration with two monitors. The first monitor is driven by the fbdev video driver and the second monitor is  driven  by
       the glide driver.

       Section "Monitor"
          Identifier      "Monitor 1"

          # My video card is on the AGP bus which is usually
          # located as PCI bus 1, device 0, function 0.
          BusID       "PCI:1:0:0"
       EndSection

       Section "Device"

          # The next line says I want to use the first board.
          Option      "GlideDevice" "0"
       EndSection

       Section "Screen"
         Identifier     "Screen 1"
         Device    "fb"
         Monitor   "Monitor 1"
         DefaultDepth   16
         Subsection "Display"
           Depth     16
           Modes     "1024x768"
         EndSubSection
       EndSection

       Section "Screen"
         Identifier     "Screen 2"
         Device    "Voodoo"
         Monitor   "Monitor 2"

         Subsection "Display"
           Depth     16
           Modes     "1024x768"
         EndSubSection
       EndSection

       Section "ServerLayout"
         Identifier     "Main Layout"
         # Screen 1 is to the right and screen 2 is to the left
         Screen    "Screen 2"
         Screen    "Screen 1" "" "" "Screen 2" ""
       EndSection

       If you use this configuration file and start the server with the +xinerama command line option, the two monitors will be showing a single large area where windows can be moved between monitors and
       overlap from one monitor to the other. Starting the X server with the Xinerama extension can be done for example like this:

       $ xinit -- +xinerama
