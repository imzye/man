NAME
       publicfile-installer - get, build and install publicfile

SYNOPSIS
       get-publicfile [go]
       build-publicfile [go]

DESCRIPTION
       get-publicfile
              get-publicfile downloads and verifies publicfile sources.

       build-publicfile
              build-publicfile builds the publicfile package from its sources, and optionally installs it.

       The scripts get-publicfile and build-publicfile are pretty verbose.  Both scripts are interactive (but see below).

OPTIONS
       When get-publicfile or build-publicfile are passed the argument go, they run in non-interactive mode.  This is useful when calling these scripts from within a package installer.

FILES
       The scripts install files, and search for files in $HOME/.publicfile-installer/ and /usr/src/publicfile-installer/.  The scripts are configured using /etc/publicfile-installer.conf and $HOME/.pub‐
       licfile-installer.conf.

BUGS
       get-publicfile  runs  dscverify;  this  command  needs  the  public PGP key of the scripts author in the users GnuPG keyring.   Therefore, before running get-publicfile, do run e.g. gpg --recv-key
       B8FAC2E250475B8CE940A91957930DAB0B86B067 in order to download or update this key.
