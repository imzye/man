NAME
       openpgp-tool - utility for accessing visible data OpenPGP smart cards and compatible tokens

SYNOPSIS
       openpgp-tool [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The openpgp-tool utility is used for accessing data from the OpenPGP v1.1 and v2.0 smart cards and compatible tokens like e.g. GPF CryptoStick v1.x, which might not be present in PKCS#15 objects but
       available in custom files on the card. The data can be printed on screen or used by other programs via environment variables.

OPTIONS
       --card-info, -C
           Show card information.

       --del-key arg
           Delete key indicated by arg.  arg can be 1, 2, 3, or all.

       --do arg, -d arg
           Dump private data object (DO) indicated by arg.  arg can be in the form x, 10x, or 010x to access DO 010x, where x is 1, 2, 3, or 4.

       --erase, -E
           Erase (i.e. reset) the card.

       --exec prog, -x prog
           Execute the given program with data in environment variables.

       --gen-key arg, -G arg
           Generate key with the ID given as arg.  arg can be one of 1, 2, or 3.

       --help, -h
           Print help message on screen.

       --key-info, -K
           Show information of keys on the card.

       --key-type keytype, -t keytype
           Specify the type of the key to be generated. Supported values for keytype are rsa for RSA with 2048 bits, rsaLENGTH for RSA with a bit length of LENGTH. If not given, it defaults to rsa2048.

       --pin pin
           This option can be used to specify the PIN value on the command line. If the value is set to env:VARIABLE, the value of the specified environment variable is used. By default, the code is prompted
           on the command line if needed.

           Note that on most operation systems, any user can display the command line of any process on the system using utilities such as ps(1). Therefore, you should prefer passing the codes via an
           environment variable on an unsecured system.

       --pretty
           Print values in pretty format.

       --raw
           Print values in raw format, as they are stored on the card.

       --reader arg, -r arg
           Number of the reader to use. By default, the first reader with a present card is used. If arg is an ATR, the reader with a matching card will be chosen.

       --user-info, -U
           Show card holder information.

       --verify pintype
           Verify PIN (CHV1, CHV2 or CHV3).

       --version, -V
           Print the version of the utility and exit.

       --verbose, -v
           Verbose operation. Use several times to enable debug output.

       --wait, -w
           Wait for a card to be inserted.
