NAME
       ciwiki - simple wiki implementation with built-in webserver

SYNOPSIS
       ciwiki [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ciwiki  is  aimed  at  those  who  need a quick and lightweight wiki for personal use, such as notes, "to do" lists, etc. It is written in C, and has a low system requirements (binary size of ~73k
       stripped with
        ./configure CFLAGS='-s -Os'). This makes it particularly useful for low-power systems (Raspberry Pi).

       ciwiki does not require installation of a separate webserver, scripting language, or database.

       The appearance of the wiki pages may be altered by placing a styles.css in ~/.ciwiki or in the directory specified using the --home option.

OPTIONS
       --log-less
              Suppress non-critical syslog output (like logging page visits).

       -d, --debug
              Start in debug mode. In this case, ciwiki will not bind to any IP address or port: it will only read the requests from standard input (stdin)

       -h directory, --home=directory
              By default ciwiki stores its pages in ~/.ciwiki. You can override this by specifying an alternative directory.

       -l ipaddr, --listen=ipaddr
              By default ciwiki binds to "0.0.0.0". You can override this by specifying an alternative IP address.

       -p port, --port=port
              By default ciwiki will listen on port 8000. You can override this by specifying an alternative port.

       -a --autologin
              The localhost is logged automaticcally.

       -n --nologin
              No login, all user can modify the wiki.

       -s --sendmail
              Runs notifynewuser.sh. Validation code, login and password are sent via email.  ssmtp must be installed.

       -i length --index=length
              Number of links to display in each box of the index page.

       -u --unmasked
              Default: The password is masked. --unmasked allows to show it.

       -v --version
              Ciwiki version number.

       --help Display the help message

       To notify new users via email of their validation code, login and password, you need ssmpt and the script notifynewuser.sh .  (notifynewuser.sh is included in the package and should be located  in
       the folder /usr/local/libexec .  If you do not use the default port 8000, you will have to edit notifynewuser.sh line #25 to provide the actual port #.

EXAMPLES
       ciwiki uses syslog to log when it is launched or stopped, and when a page is accessed or modified. Here an example to list Ciwiki logs:

              $ grep Ciwiki /var/log/syslog

       In order to launch ciwiki on a specific IP and port:

              $ ciwiki -l 127.0.0.1 -p 8080
