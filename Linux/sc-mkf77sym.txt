NAME
       sc-mkf77sym - The sc-mkf77sym program is used to generate symbols for linking FORTRAN subroutines into MPQC.

Synopsis
       sc-mkf77sym input output

Description
       sc-mkf77sym requires two arguments: the name of the input file and the name of the output file. The input file contains C preprocessor definitions of the form '#define F77_FUNC' where FUNC is the name
       of a FORTRAN 77 function. The output file assigns these definitions to the C symbol that will link with the FORTRAN 77 function. For example, if FORTRAN symbols are formed from the routine name by
       converting to lowercase and have appending an underscore, then the following input file:

       #define F77_DGEMM

       will result in the following ouput file:

       #define F77_DGEMM dgemm_
