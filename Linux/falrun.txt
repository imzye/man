NAME
       flcrun - The Falcon command line execution tool

SYNOPSIS
       falrun [options] [main_script] [script_options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  falrun command line tool is a subset of the falcon(1) command line
       interpreter which only executes pre-compiled falcon scripts  in  ".fam"
       module  files.  This  is meant to launch Falcon based application which
       were compiled on a different system, and whose source is not shipped.

OPTIONS
       -e <enc>
              Set given encoding as default for VM I/O. Unless the scripts se‐
              lect  a different I/O encoding, the streams that are provided to
              the falcon VM (like the output stream for  printf)  are  encoded
              using  the given ISO encoding. This overrides the default encod‐
              ing that is detected by reading the environment settings. In ex‐
              ample,  if  your system uses iso-8859-1 encoding by default, but
              you want your script to read and write utf-8 files, use the  op‐
              tion -e utf-8

       -h or -?
              Prints a brief help on stdout and exits.

       -L <path>
              Changes  the default load path. This overrides both the internal
              built in settings and the contents of environment variable  FAL‐
              CON_LOAD_PATH. Each directory in the path should be separated by
              ";" and use forward slashes, like this:

                   falrun -L ./;/usr/share/falcon_mod;./myapp

       -p <module>
              Preloads the given module as if  it  were  loaded  by  the  main
              script.

       -P     Ignore default load paths and uses only the paths set via the -L
              switch.

       -v     Prints copyright notice and version and exits.

FILES
       /usr/lib/libfalcon_engine.so
              Default location of the Falcon Engine loadable module.

       /usr/lib/falcon
              Default directory containing Falcon binary modules.

ENVIRONMENT
       FALCON_LOAD_PATH
              Default search path for modules loaded by the scripts.

       FALCON_SRC_ENCODING
              Default encoding for the source scripts loaded by  falcon  (when
              different from the system default).

       FALCON_VM_ENCODING
              Default  encoding  for  the  VM I/O streams (when different from
              system default).
