NAME
       clangd - manual page for clangd 11

DESCRIPTION
       OVERVIEW: clangd is a language server that provides IDE-like features to editors.

   It should be used via an editor plugin rather than invoked directly. For more information, see:
              https://clangd.llvm.org/ https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/

       clangd accepts flags on the commandline, and in the CLANGD_FLAGS environment variable.

       USAGE: clangd [options]

       OPTIONS:

       Generic Options:

       --help                          - Display available options (--help-hidden for more)

       --help-list                     - Display list of available options (--help-list-hidden for more)

       --version                       - Display the version of this program

       clangd compilation flags options:

       --compile-commands-dir=<string>  - Specify a path to look for compile_commands.json. If path is invalid, clangd will look in the current directory and parent
              paths of each source file

       --query-driver=<string>         - Comma separated list of globs for white-listing gcc-compatible drivers that are safe to execute. Drivers  matching  any  of
              these globs will be used to extract system includes. e.g. /usr/bin/**/clang-*,/path/to/repo/**/g++-*

       clangd feature options:

       --all-scopes-completion          -  If  set  to true, code completion will include index symbols that are not defined in the scopes (e.g. namespaces) visible
              from the code completion point. Such completions can insert scope qualifiers

       --background-index              - Index project code in the background and persist index on disk.

       --clang-tidy                    - Enable clang-tidy diagnostics

       --clang-tidy-checks=<string>    - List of clang-tidy checks to run (this will override .clang-tidy files). Only meaningful when -clang-tidy flag is on

       --completion-style=<value>      - Granularity of code completion suggestions

       =detailed
              -   One completion item for each semantically distinct completion, with full type information

       =bundled
              -   Similar completion items (e.g. function overloads) are combined. Type information shown where possible

       --cross-file-rename             - Enable cross-file rename feature.

       --fallback-style=<string>       - clang-format style to apply by default when no .clang-format file is found

       --header-insertion=<value>      - Add #include directives when accepting code completions

       =iwyu  -   Include what you use. Insert the owning header for top-level symbols, unless the header is already directly included or the symbol is  forward-de‐
              clared

       =never -   Never insert #include directives as part of code completion

       --header-insertion-decorators   - Prepend a circular dot or space before the completion label, depending on whether an include line will be inserted or not

       --limit-results=<int>           - Limit the number of results returned by clangd. 0 means no limit (default=100)

       --recovery-ast                  - Preserve expressions in AST for broken code (C++ only).

       --suggest-missing-includes      - Attempts to fix diagnostic errors caused by missing includes using index

       clangd miscellaneous options:

       --enable-config                 - Read user and project configuration from YAML files.
              Project config is from a .clangd file in the project directory.  User config is from clangd/config.yaml in the following directories:

       Windows: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local
              Mac OS: ~/Library/Preferences/ Others: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, usually ~/.config

              Configuration is documented at https://clangd.llvm.org/config.html

       -j=<uint>                       - Number of async workers used by clangd. Background index also uses this many workers.

       --pch-storage=<value>           - Storing PCHs in memory increases memory usages, but may improve performance

       =disk  -   store PCHs on disk

       =memory
              -   store PCHs in memory

       clangd protocol and logging options:

       --log=<value>                   - Verbosity of log messages written to stderr

       =error
              -   Error messages only

       =info  -   High level execution tracing

       =verbose
              -   Low level details

       --offset-encoding=<value>       - Force the offsetEncoding used for character positions. This bypasses negotiation via client capabilities

       =utf-8
              -   Offsets are in UTF-8 bytes

       =utf-16
              -   Offsets are in UTF-16 code units

       =utf-32
              -   Offsets are in unicode codepoints

       --path-mappings=<string>        - Translates between client paths (as seen by a remote editor) and server paths (where clangd sees files on disk). Comma sep‐
              arated  list  of  '<client_path>=<server_path>'  pairs,  the  first  entry  matching  a  given  path   is   used.   e.g.   /home/project/incl=/opt/in‐
              clude,/home/project=/workarea/project

       --pretty                        - Pretty-print JSON output
