NAME
       updmap.cfg - configuration of font mapping/inclusion for dvips and friends.

DESCRIPTION
       The  file updmap.cfg is the central font configuration file of a teTeX system and is read by updmap(1). It describes if and how fonts should be included (or not included) into PS/PDF output files.
       This works for outline (Postscript Type1) and bitmap fonts (Postscript Type3) mostly coming from Metafont.

       updmap is a utility that creates font configuration files for dvips(1), pdftex(1), xdvi(1), ps2pk(1), gsftopk(1), and dvipdfmx(1).  In an ideal world, updmap would  be  unnecessary,  and  each  of
       these programs would read the same configuration file to learn what fonts are available and how they should be treated.  As things stand, however, each of these tools has subtly different require‐
       ments and thereby needs its own font configuration file.  updmap creates font configuration files for all of these programs from several sources, namely all updmap.cfg, allowing you to easily keep
       all the different configuration files in sync.

       Running "updmap --help" will output the main documentation for using updmap.

       dvipsPreferOutline
       Configures  if dvips (by default) should prefer bitmap fonts or outline fonts if both are available. Independent of this setting, outlines can be forced by putting "p psfonts_t1.map" into a config
       file that dvips reads. Bitmaps can be forced by putting "p psfonts_pk.map" into a config file. We provide such config files which can be enabled via dvips -Poutline (resp. dvips -Ppk).
       Valid settings for dvipsPreferOutline are true / false.

       LW35
       Which fonts of the "Basic 35 Laserwriter Fonts" do you want to use and how are the filenames chosen? Valid settings:
       URW:     URW fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. n019064l.pfb)
       URWkb:   URW fonts with "berry" filenames (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)
       ADOBE:   Adobe fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. hvnbo___.pfb)
       ADOBEkb: Adobe fonts with  "berry" filenames (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)

       dvipsDownloadBase35
       Configures if dvips (by default) should download the 35 base PostScript fonts into the document (set true) or should these fonts be used from the PostScript interpreter or printer (set false).
       The user can override the default by specifying dvips -Pdownload35 (resp. dvips -Pbuiltin35) to download the LW35 fonts (resp. use the built-in fonts).
       Valid settings are true / false.

       pdftexDownloadBase14
       Should pdftex download the 14 base PDF fonts? Since some configurations (ps / pdf tools / printers) use bad default fonts, it is safer to download the fonts. The pdf files get bigger, but that  is
       the cost.
       Valid settings are true (download the fonts) or false (don't download the fonts). Adobe recommends embedding all fonts.

       pxdviUse
       Should special map files for pxdvi be created? pxdvi is an adaption of xdvi with support for reading and displaying files generated by the ptex family of engines.
       Valid settings are true (generate configuration) or false. See http://www.tug.org/texlive/updmap-kanji.html for detailed discussion.

       kanjiEmbed
       kanjiVariant
       The  options  kanjiEmbed and kanjiVariant specify special replacements in the map lines.  In a map, the string "@kanjiEmbed@" will be replaced by the value of that option; similarly for kanjiVari‐
       ant.  In this way, users of Japanese TeX can select different fonts to be included in the final output.

       Map
       Points to a map file, which describes a mapping from a font (called in the TeX document) to the pfb file containing the Postscript code.
       Usage: Map filename.map

       The syntax of map files is the same as dvips(1) uses, see the section "psfonts.map" in the manual of dvips(1).

       MixedMap
       Similar to Map. It should be used when there is Type1 and a bitmap implementation of the font (the latter mostly coming from Metafont). These entries will not be used in the default map  of  dvips
       if dvipsPreferOutline is set to false.
       Usage: MixedMap filename.map

       KanjiMap
       Similar to Map. This should be used for kanji fonts.
       Usage: KanjiMap filename.map

       The sign # precedes a comment.

       Map  files not to be used should be commented out using the string #! at the beginning of the line. Such entries can be (de-)activated using updmap with the options --enable and --disable, respec‐
       tively.
