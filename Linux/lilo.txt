NAME
       lilo.conf - configuration file for lilo

DESCRIPTION
       This file, by default /etc/lilo.conf, is read by the boot loader installer 'lilo' (see lilo(8)).

       It might look as follows:

              # /etc/lilo.conf
              #
              #  global options:
              boot=/dev/hda
              prompt

              read-only
              menu-title=" John's Computer "
              #
              ### bootable kernel images ###
              image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.29-1-i386
                   label=try
                   initrd=/boot/initrd.img-2.6.29-1-i386
              image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.33-1-i386

                   initrd=/tamu/initrd.img
                   root=/dev/hdb2
                   vga=ask
              #
              ### other operating systems ###
              other=/dev/hda3
                   label=PCDOS
                   boot-as=0x80    # must be C:
              other=/dev/hdb1
                   label=WinXP
                   boot-as=0x80    # must be C:
              other=/dev/hdb5
                   label=oldDOS
                   loader=chain
                   table=/dev/hdb5

       This  configuration  file  specifies  that  lilo  uses  the Master Boot Record on /dev/hda. (For a discussion of the various ways to use lilo, and the interaction with other operating systems, see
       html/user_21-5.html inside the old documentation.)

       When booting, the boot loader will issue its boot: prompt and wait for you to enter the label of the kernel (and any options) which you wish to boot. At any time you may hit [Tab] to see a list of
       kernel/other labels.  Alternately, if the menu boot loader is installed, a menu of boot options will be presented for your selection.  The title of this menu is  overridden  with  the  menu  title
       specification  in this configuration file.  If you enter nothing, then the default kernel image, the first mentioned, (in the example /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.29-1-i386) will be booted after a timeout of
       15 seconds (150 deciseconds). There may be at least 16 images mentioned in lilo.conf. (The exact number depends upon compilation options.)

       As can be seen above, a configuration file starts with a number of global options (the top 9 lines in the example), followed by descriptions of the options for the various images.  An option in an
       image description will override a global option.

       Comment lines may appear anywhere, and begin with the "#" character.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       There are many possible keywords. The description below is almost literally from html/user_21-5.html inside the old documentation (just slightly abbreviated).

       backup=<backup-file>
              Specifies the location where a copy of any modified boot sector will be saved in a file. 'backup=' may specify this location in one of three ways: a directory where the default backup  file
              'boot.NNNN'  will be created; a file pathname template to which the '.NNNN' suffix will be added; or the full file pathname, which must include the correct '.NNNN' suffix.  All RAID instal‐
              lations should use only the first two alternatives, as multiple backups may be created.  The '.NNNN' suffix is the hexadecimal representation of the major and minor device  numbers  of  the
              device  or  partition. If this option is not specified, the default name of boot sector backups is '/boot/boot.NNNN'. If a backup already exists, it will be preserved, rather than overwrit‐
              ten.  C.f., force-backup= below.

       bios-passes-dl=<option>
              The option is indicated as yes, no, or unknown.  If not specified, a value of "unknown" is assumed, unless additional information is available to the boot installer. When "no" is specified,
              it indicates that the BIOS is known not to pass the current boot device code to the boot loader in the DL register.  Its only function at this point is experimental, as certain RAID instal‐
              lations may benefit from knowing that the BIOS is 100% reliable.  Its use should be considered experimental.

              This option may be specified on the command line with the '-Z' switch: yes=1, no=0.

       bitmap=<bitmap-file>
              Specifies use of a 640x480x16 (VGA BIOS) or 640x480x256 (VGA/VESA BIOS) bitmap file as the background on which a boot menu is displayed.  May not be used if 'message=' is specified.  Use of
              this option will select a bitmap-capable boot loader, unless overridden with "install=" (see below).

              When a bitmap file is specified as a background screen during the boot process, the color selection and layout of the text which overlays the graphic image must be specified in one  of  two
              ways.

              One  way  is  the use of header information in the bitmap image (*.bmp) file: From a text file with all the information about 'bmp-colors', 'bmp-table' and 'bmp-timer' options together with
              the 'bitmap' option are stored in the special LILO header of the bitmap image file by the lilo -E command. Another way works without these special header information:  All  the  information
              about  'bmp-colors', 'bmp-table' and 'bmp-timer' options together with the 'bitmap' option are stored in the configuration file.  Any use of the 'bmp-' options within the configuration file
              overrides the options stored in the bitmap file header. If lilo cannot find any of the 'bmp-' options, then default values are used.

       bmp-colors=<fg>,<bg>,<sh>,<hfg>,<hbg>,<hsh>
              Specifies the decimal values of the colors to be used for the menu display on a 'bitmap=' background.  The list consists of 6 entries, 3 for normal text followed by 3 for highlighted  text.
              The  order  of  each  triple  is:  foreground color, background color, shadow color.  If background color is not specified, "transparent" is assumed.  If shadow color is not specified, then
              "none" is assumed.  The list entries are separated by commas, with no spaces.

       bmp-retain
              Option applies to all 'image=' and 'other=' sections.  (See COMMON OPTIONS, below.)

       bmp-table=<x>,<y>,<ncol>,<nrow>,<xsep>,<spill>
              Specifies the location and layout of the menu table.  <x>,<y> specify the starting x- and y-position of the upper left corner of the table in character  coordinates:  x  in  [1..80],  y  in
              [1..30].  <ncol>  is the number of columns in the menu (1..5); and <nrow> is the number of rows (entries) in each column.  If more than one column is specified, then <xsep> is the number of
              character columns between the leftmost characters in each column: (18..40), and <spill> is the number of entries in one column which must be filled before entries spill into the  next  col‐
              umn. <spill> must be .le. <nrow>. If pixel addressing is used, instead of character addressing, then any of <x>, <y>, or <xsep> may be specified with a 'p' suffix on the decimal value.

       bmp-timer=<x>,<y>,<fg>,<bg>,<sh>
              Optional  specification  of the 'timeout=' countdown timer.  <x>,<y> specifies the character (or pixel) coordinate of the location of the timer the same as 'bmp-table=' above; and the color
              triple specifies the character color attributes the same as 'bmp-colors=' above, with the exception that the background color must be specified.  If used to override the timer specification
              in a bitmap file, then the form 'bmp-timer = none' is acceptable.  This will disable the timer display entirely.

       boot=<boot-device>
              Sets the name of the device (e.g. hard disk or partition) that contains the boot sector and where the new boot sector should be written to. Notice: The boot-device should be the device with
              the currently mounted root partition.

              A raid installation is initiated by specifying a RAID1 device as the boot device; e.g., "boot=/dev/md0".

              On newer systems you need an unique ID for the boot device. If the boot sector should write to a partition you can use its UUID in the same manner is for the root options.

              If your boot device is a hard disk you need a special ID, which is supported by udev. You find the right ID in the directory /dev/disk/by-id, i.e.:

                  boot = /dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_SV1604N_S01FJ10X999999

       change-rules
              Defines boot-time changes to partition type numbers (`hiding').

              change-rules
                 reset
                 type=DOS12
                    normal=1
                    hidden=0x11
                 type=DOS16_small
                    normal=4
                    hidden=0x14
                 type=DOS16_big
                    normal=0x06
                    hidden=0x16

              The above excerpt from a configuration file specifies that all default change-rules are removed ("reset"), and the change-rules for three partition types are specified.  Without the  reset,
              the  three types specified would have been added to the existing default change-rules.  Normally, the default rules are sufficient.  The strings which define the partition types are used in
              a change section (see below), with the suffixes "_normal" or "_hidden" appended.  See section "Partition type change rules" of html/user_21-5.html inside the old documentation for more  de‐
              tails.

       compact
              Tries  to  merge  read requests for adjacent sectors into a single read request. This drastically reduces load time and keeps the map file smaller. Using `compact' is especially recommended
              when booting using a map file on a floppy disk.

       default=<name>
              Uses the specified image as the default boot image. If `default' is omitted, the image appearing first in the configuration file is used. See also, vmdefault below.

       delay=<tsecs>
              Specifies the number of tenths of a second the boot loader should wait before automatically booting a locked command line, a command line pre-stored by "lilo -R", or the default `image=' or
              `other='.  When `delay' is non-zero, the boot loader will wait for an interrupt for the specified interval. If an interrupt is received, or is already waiting, the boot: prompt will be  is‐
              sued, and no automatic boot will take place. The setting of CAPS LOCK or SCROLL LOCK, or any of the keys ALT, CTRL, or SHIFT, when held down, are taken as interrupts.

              This action is modified by specifying `prompt' (see below).

       disk=<device-name>
              Defines non-standard parameters for the specified disk. See section "Disk geometry" of html/user_21-5.html inside the old documentation for details.  For versions of LILO prior to 22.5, the
              `bios=' parameter is quite useful for specifying how the BIOS has assigned device codes to your disks.  For example,

                     disk=/dev/sda
                          bios=0x80
                     disk=/dev/hda
                          bios=0x81
                     disk=/dev/sdb
                          inaccessible

              would  say  that  your SCSI disk is the first BIOS disk (0x80), that your (primary master) IDE disk is the second BIOS disk (0x81), and that your second SCSI disk (perhaps a USB device) re‐
              ceives no device code, and is therefore inaccessible at boot time.

              NOTE: Use of the 'bios=' option is largely obsolete beginning with LILO version 22.5, as the boot loader now identifies disks by 32-bit Volume-ID, and defers BIOS device code  determination
              until boot time.

              Other options include the specification of disk geometry; e.g.,

                     disk=/dev/fd0
                          sectors=18
                          heads=2
                          cylinders=80

              probably only useful for floppy disks and loopback devices, because for hard disks the lba32 disk addressing option ignores disk geometry.

              Developers who have implemented a disk driver for a new block storage device will have to indicate to LILO the maximum number of partitions on the device.  This is in addition to making all
              of the necessary entries for the device in the "/dev" directory (with 'mknod').  The maximum number of partitions must be one of 63 (like an IDE disk), 31 (uncommon), 15 (like SCSI disks --
              most common value), or 7 (like one array controller). An example specification would be:

                   disk=/dev/userd0
                        max-partitions=15

              In cases where there is no kernel partition information available, such as on loopback devices, the 'disk=' specification may include partition start information; viz.,

                     disk=/dev/loop0
                          bios=0x80           # use this BIOS code
                          max-partitions=7         # declare partitionable
                          partition=/dev/loop1
                               start=63       # offset from sector 0
                          partition=/dev/loop2
                               start=102400        # offset from sector 0

       disktab=<disktab-file>
              Specifies the name of the disk parameter table.  The map installer looks for /etc/disktab if `disktab' is omitted. The use of disktabs is discouraged.

       el-torito-bootable-CD
              Flag second stage loader to terminate disk emulation when booting from an El Torito Bootable CD. This option is used by the mkrescue utility when the "--iso" switch is specified.

       fix-table
              This  allows  lilo  to adjust 3D addresses in partition tables. Each partition entry contains a 3D (cylinder/head/sector) and a linear address of the first and the last sector of the parti‐
              tion. If a partition is not track-aligned and if certain other operating systems (e.g. PC/MS-DOS) are using the same disk, they may change the 3D address. lilo can  store  its  boot  sector
              only on partitions where both address types correspond. lilo re-adjusts incorrect 3D start addresses if `fix-table' is set.

              WARNING:  This  does not guarantee that other operating systems may not attempt to reset the address later. It is also possible that this change has other, unexpected side-effects. The cor‐
              rect fix is to re-partition the drive with a program that does align partitions to tracks. Also, with some disks (e.g. some large EIDE disks with address translation  enabled),  under  some
              circumstances, it may even be unavoidable to have conflicting partition table entries.

       force-backup=<backup-file>
              Operation is identical to backup= above, except an existing backup file is unconditionally overwritten if it exists.

       geometric
              Force disk addressing which is compatible with older versions of LILO.  Geometric addressing uses cylinder/head/sector addresses, and is limited to disk cylinders up to 1023.  If inaccessi‐
              ble cylinders are referenced, diagnostics will be issued at boot-install time, rather than boot-time.  With a newer BIOS, use of 'lba32' is recommended.

       ignore-table
              tells lilo to ignore corrupt partition tables.

       install=<user-interface>
              Selects the user interface which will be seen at boot time.  One of the following three options may be specified: text, menu, or bmp. The traditional LILO interface is `text'; but `menu' is
              now  the  default,  unless  the configuration file contains the `bitmap=' specification.  The text interface is strictly a command-line interface as though the console were a dumb terminal.
              The menu interface is a text-based screen of the boot choices, with the option to enter additional command line parameters.  And the bmp interface is a  menu  presented  against  a  graphic
              screen, specified as a 640x480 BitMaP file of 16 or 256 colors.  (See the 'lilo -E' switch for editing options).

              (Prior to LILO version 22.3, `install=' specified the user interface as a file in the `/boot' directory.)

       large-memory
              Normally any initial ramdisk (initrd) loaded with a kernel is loaded as high in memory as possible, but never above 15 MB.  This is due to a BIOS limitation on older systems.  On newer sys‐
              tems,  this  option  enables  using memory above 15 MB (up to a kernel imposed limit, around 768 MB) for passing the initrd to the kernel.  The presence of this option merely indicates that
              your system does not have the old BIOS limitation.

              This switch (or its absence) is not passed to the kernel, and does not in any way affect the amount of physical memory which it will use.  (See the kernel documentation for the kernel  com‐
              mand line parameter "mem=" for limiting the memory used by the kernel.)

       lba32  Generate  32-bit  Logical  Block  Addresses instead of cylinder/head/sector addresses. If the BIOS supports packet addressing, then packet calls will be used to access the disk. This allows
              booting from any partition on disks with more than 1024 cylinders.  If the BIOS does not support packet addressing, then 'lba32' addresses are translated to  cylinder/head/sector  ('geomet‐
              ric'), just as for 'linear'.  All floppy disk references are retained in C:H:S form.  Use of 'lba32' is recommended on all post-1998 systems.  Beginning with LILO version 22, 'lba32' is the
              default disk addressing scheme.

       linear Generate  24-bit linear sector addresses instead of cylinder/head/sector (geometric) addresses. Linear addresses are translated at run time to geometric addresses, and are limited to cylin‐
              ders <= 1023. When using `linear' with large disks, /sbin/lilo may generate references to inaccessible disk cylinders. 'lba32' avoids many of these pitfalls with its use of packet  address‐
              ing, but requires a recent BIOS (post-1998).  The 'linear' option is considered obsolete, and its use is strongly discouraged.

       lock   Enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the defaults for the following boots. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden.

       mandatory
              The per-image password option `mandatory' (see below) applies to all images.

       map=<map-file>
              Specifies the location of the map file. If `map' is omitted, the file /boot/map is used.

              On machines with a pre-1998 BIOS, the EDD bios extensions which are required to support "lba32" disk sector addressing may not be present. In this case, the boot-loader will fall back auto‐
              matically  to  "geometric"  addressing;  this  fall  back situation, or the specific use of "geometric" or "linear" addressing, will require the map file to be located within the first 1024
              cylinders of the disk drive. This BIOS limitation is not present on post-1998 systems, most of which support the newer EDD disk BIOS calls.

       menu-title=<title-string>
              Specifies the title line (up to 37 characters) for the boot menu. This title replaces the default "LILO Boot Menu" title string. If menu is not installed as the boot  loader  (see  install=
              option), then this line has no effect.

       menu-scheme=<color-scheme>
              The default color scheme of the boot menu may be overridden on VGA displays using this option. (The color scheme of MDA displays is fixed.)  The general color-scheme string is of the form:

                   <text>:<highlight>:<border>:<title>

              where each entry is two characters which specify a foreground color and a background color. Only the first entry is required. The default highlight is the reverse of the text color; and the
              default  border  and  title colors are the text color.  Colors are specified using the characters kbgcrmyw, for blacK, Blue, Green, Cyan, Red, Magenta, Yellow, and White: upper case for in‐
              tense (fg only), lower case for dim.  Valid color-scheme strings would be

                  menu-scheme=Wm     intense white on magenta
                  menu-scheme=wr:bw:wr:Yr    the LILO default
                  menu-scheme=Yk:kw    bright yellow on black

              If menu is not installed as the boot loader, then this line has no effect.

       message=<message-file>
              specifies a file containing a message that is displayed before the boot prompt. No message is displayed while waiting for a shifting key after printing "LILO ". In the message, the FF char‐
              acter ([Ctrl L]) clears the local screen. This is undesirable when the menu boot loader is installed.  The size of the message file is limited to 65535 bytes. The map file has to be rebuilt
              if the message file is changed or moved.  'message=' and 'bitmap=' are mutually exclusive.

       nodevcache
              (22.8) Disables pre-loading of the internal device cache. May be needed for Linux distributions which use non-standard device naming conventions; e.g.,  when  the  first  IDE  disk  is  not
              `/dev/hda'.

       nokbdefault=<name>
              (22.7.2)  The  named descriptor is taken to be the default boot image if no IBM-PC keyboard is present. If no serial interface ("serial=") is in use, then any "prompt" keyword and "timeout"
              value are bypassed, and default booting occurs as specified by "delay=".  The keyboard detection codes cannot detect the presence or absence of a newer USB keyboard.

       noraid Disables the automatic marking of disk volumes which are components of RAID arrays as inaccessible.  This allows the user to edit the disk= / inaccessible declarations into  the  configura‐
              tion file himself.  Without such declarations, duplicate Volume IDs will be overwritten, leading to confusing situations at boot-time, and possible failure to boot.  The use of this keyword
              is generally not necessary.

       nowarn Disables warnings about possible future dangers.

       optional
              The per-image option `optional' (see below) applies to all images.

       password=<password>
              The  per-image  option  `password=...'  (see  below)  applies  to all images.  This option may prevent unattended booting, if the default image is `password=' protected at the default level
              `mandatory', which is a level higher than `restricted'.

       prompt Automatic booting (see `delay' above) will not take place unless a locked or pre-stored ("lilo -R") command line is present. Instead, the boot loader will issue the boot:  prompt  and  wait
              for user input before proceeding (see timeout below).  Unattended default image reboots are impossible if `prompt' is set and `timeout' is not, or the default image is password protected at
              a higher level than `restricted'.

       raid-extra-boot=<option>
              This  option only has meaning for RAID1 installations.  The <option> may be specified as none, auto, mbr, mbr-only, or a comma-separated list of devices; e.g., "/dev/hda,/dev/hdc6".  Start‐
              ing with LILO version 22.0, the boot record is normally written to the first sector of the RAID1 partition.  On PARALLEL raid sets, no other boot records are needed.  The default action  is
              auto, meaning, automatically generate auxiliary boot records as needed on SKEWED raid sets.  none means suppress generation of all auxiliary boot records.  mbr-only suppresses generation of
              a  boot record on the raid device, and forces compatibility with versions of LILO earlier than version 22.0 by writing boot records to all Master Boot Records (MBRs) of all disks which have
              partitions in the raid set. mbr is like mbr-only except the boot record on the RAID partition is not suppressed.  Use of an explicit list  of  devices,  forces  writing  of  auxiliary  boot
              records only on those devices enumerated, in addition to the boot record on the RAID1 device. Since the version 22 RAID1 codes will never automatically write a boot record on the MBR of de‐
              vice 0x80, if such a boot record is desired, this is one way to have it written. Use of mbr is the other way to force writing to the MBR of device 0x80.

       restricted
              The per-image password option `restricted' (see below) applies to all images.

       serial=<parameters>
              enables  control  from  a serial line. The specified serial port is initialized and the boot loader is accepting input from it and from the PC's keyboard. Sending a break on the serial line
              corresponds to pressing a shift key on the console in order to get the boot loader's attention.  All boot images should be password-protected if the serial access is less secure than access
              to the console, e.g. if the line is connected to a modem. The parameter string has the following syntax:

                  <port>[,<bps>[<parity>[<bits>]]]

              <port>: the number of the serial port, zero-based. Zero (0) corresponds to COM1 alias /dev/ttyS0, etc. All four ports can be used (if present).

              <bps>: the baud rate of the serial port. The following baud rates are supported: 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400 (default), 4800, 9600, plus  the  extended  rates  19200,  38400,  and  57600
              (56000).  The rate 115200 is allowed, but may not work with all COMx port hardware.

              <parity>:  the  parity  used on the serial line. The boot loader ignores input parity and strips the 8th bit. The following (upper or lower case) characters are used to describe the parity:
              "n" for no parity, "e" for even parity and "o" for odd parity.

              <bits>: the number of bits in a character. Only 7 and 8 bits are supported. Default is 8 if parity is "none", 7 if parity is "even" or "odd".

              If `serial' is set, the value of `delay' is automatically raised to 20.

              Example: "serial=0,2400n8" initializes COM1 with the default parameters.

       single-key
              This option specifies that boot images or 'other's are to be selected and launched with a single keystroke.  Selection is based upon the first character of each name, which must be  unique.
              This option should not be used with the menu or bitmap user interface ("install=").

       static-BIOS-codes
              Causes  the  operation  of  the boot installer and boot loader to bypass the use of Volume-ID information, and to revert to a mode of operation of versions of LILO from 22.4 backward.  With
              Volume-ID booting (22.5 and later), the BIOS codes of disks are determined at boot time, not install time; hence they may be switched around, either by adding or removing disk(s)  from  the
              hardware configuration, or by using a BIOS menu to select the boot device.

              With  the  use of this option, BIOS codes of disks MUST be correctly specified at install time; either guessed correctly by LILO (which often fails on mixed IDE/SCSI systems), or explicitly
              specified with 'disk=/dev/XXX bios=0xYY' statements.  The use of this option precludes any activity which may switch around the BIOS codes assigned to  particular  disk  devices,  as  noted
              above.

              In general, this option should never be used, except as a bug workaround.

       suppress-boot-time-BIOS-data
              This global option suppresses the boot-time real mode collection of BIOS data on systems which hang on certain BIOS calls.  It is equivalent to using the boot-time switch 'nobd'.

              This  option  defeats  the disk volume recognition and BIOS device code detection features of LILO on systems with more than one disk. Thus the use of this option will produce a strong cau‐
              tionary message, which cannot be suppressed.

       timeout=<tsecs>
              sets a timeout (in tenths of a second) for keyboard input at the boot: prompt.  "timeout" only has meaning if "prompt" is mentioned.  If no key is pressed for the specified  time,  the  de‐
              fault image is automatically booted. The default timeout is infinite.

       unattended
              (22.6)  Alters  the  operation of the "timeout" parameter in a manner which is useful on noisy serial lines.  Each typed (or noise) character restarts the "timeout" timer and a timeout will
              always boot the default descriptor, even if noise characters have appeared on the input line.

       verbose=<number>
              Turns on lots of progress reporting. Higher numbers give more verbose output.  If -v is additionally specified on the lilo command line, the level is increased accordingly. The maximum ver‐
              bosity level is 5.

       vmdefault=<name>
              The named boot image is used as the default boot if booting in "virtual" mode with a virtual monitor, such as VMware(tm).  Thus a real mode boot and a virtual mode boot can be made to  have
              different default boot images.

       Additionally,  the kernel configuration parameters append, ramdisk, read-only, read-write, root and vga can be set in the global options section. They are used as defaults if they aren't specified
       in the configuration sections of the respective kernel images.

PER-IMAGE SECTION
       A per-image section starts with either a line

           image=<pathname>

       to indicate a file or device containing the boot image of a Linux kernel, or a line

           other=<device>

       to indicate an arbitrary system to boot.

       In the former case, if an image line specifies booting from a device, then one has to indicate the range of sectors to be mapped using

           range=<start>-<end>
           range=<start>+<nsec>
           range=<sector>

       In the third case, 'nsec=1' is assumed.

KERNEL OPTIONS (image=)
       If the booted image is a Linux kernel, then one may pass command line parameters to this kernel.

       addappend=<string>
              The kernel parameters of this string are concatenated to the parameter(s) from an append= option (see below).  The string of addappend must be enclosed within double quotes.   Usually,  the
              previous  append= will set parameters common to all kernels by appearing in the global section of the configuration file and addappend= will be used to add local parameter(s) to an individ‐
              ual image.  The addappend option may be used only once per "image=" section.

              If the string is a very long line, this line can be divided in more lines using "\" as last character of a line, e.g.,

                  addappend="noapic acpi=off pci=usepirqmask \
                          pnpbios=off pnpacpi=off noisapnp"

       append=<string>
              Appends the options specified to the parameter line passed to the kernel.  This is typically used to specify hardware parameters that can't be entirely auto-detected or  for  which  probing
              may  be dangerous. Multiple kernel parameters are separated by a blank space, and the string must be enclosed in double quotes.  A local append= appearing within an image= section overrides
              any global append= appearing in the global section of the configuration file.  The append option may be used only once per "image=" section. To concatenate parameter  strings,  use  "addap‐
              pend=". Example:

                   append="mem=96M hd=576,64,32 console=ttyS1,9600"

              If the string is a very long line, this line can be divided in more lines using "\" as last character of a line. See example of addappend option.

       initrd=<name>
              Specifies the initial ramdisk image to be loaded with the kernel.  The image will contain modules needed at boot time, such as network and scsi drivers. See man pages for mkinitrd(8).

       literal=<string>
              Like  `append', but removes all other options (e.g. setting of the root device). 'literal' overrides all 'append' and 'addappend' options.  Because vital options can be removed unintention‐
              ally with `literal', this option cannot be set in the global options section.

       ramdisk=<size>
              This specifies the size (e.g. "4096k") of the optional RAM disk. A value of zero indicates that no RAM disk should be created. If this variable is omitted, the RAM disk size configured into
              the boot image is used.

       read-only
              This specifies that the root file system should be mounted read-only.  It may be specified as a global option.  Typically, the system startup procedure re-mounts the root file system  read-
              write later (e.g. after fsck'ing it).

       read-write
              This specifies that the root file system should be mounted read-write.  It may be specified as a global option.

       root=<root-device>
              This  specifies  the  device that should be mounted as root.  It may be specified as a global option.  If the special name current is used, the root device is set to the device on which the
              root file system is currently mounted. If the root has been changed with -r, the respective device is used. If the variable `root' is omitted, the root device setting contained in the  run‐
              ning kernel image is used.  Warning: This can induce to an unbootable system!

              The root filesystem may also be specified by a LABEL= or UUID= directive, as in '/etc/fstab'.  In this case, the argument to root= must be enclosed in quotation marks, to avoid a syntax er‐
              ror on the second equal sign, e.g.:

                   root="LABEL=MyDisk"
                   root="UUID=5472fd8e-9089-4256-bcaa-ceab4f01a439"

              Note:  The  command  line  root=  parameter  passed  to the kernel will be: 'root=LABEL=MyDisk'; i.e., without the quotation marks. If the root= parameter is passed from the boot time boot:
              prompt, no quotes are used.  The quotes are only there to satisfy the requirements of the boot-installer parser, which treats an equal sign as an operator.  The kernel command  line  parser
              is very much simpler, and must not see any quotation marks.  Simply stated, only use the quotation marks within /etc/lilo.conf.

       vga=<mode>
              This specifies the VGA text mode that should be selected when booting.  It may be specified as a global option.  The following values are recognized (case is ignored):

              normal: select normal 80x25 text mode.

              extended (or ext): select 80x50 text mode.

              ask: stop and ask for user input (at boot time).

              <number>:  use  the  corresponding text mode (can specify the number in decimal or in hex with the usual '0x' convention).  A list of available modes can be obtained by booting with vga=ask
              and pressing [Enter].

              If this variable is omitted, the VGA mode setting contained in the kernel image is used. (And that is set at compile time using the SVGA_MODE variable in the kernel Makefile, and can  later
              be changed with the rdev(8) program.)

ALTERNATE SYSTEM (other=)
       Used  to load systems other than Linux. The `other = <device>' specifies the boot sector of an alternate system contained on a device or disk partition; e.g., DOS on, say, `/dev/hda2', or a floppy
       on `/dev/fd0'.  In the case of booting another system there are these options:

       loader=<chain-loader>
              This specifies the chain loader that should be used.  It may also be specified as a global option.  By default chain is used.  This chain loader passes partition and  drive  information  in
              the boot sector it loads only to DOS on FAT12 or FAT16, Windows on FAT16 or FAT32. (see also table=<letter> below).

       table=<device>
              This specifies the device that contains the partition table.  The boot loader will pass default partition information to the booted operating system if this variable is omitted. (Some oper‐
              ating  systems  have  other means to determine from which partition they have been booted.  E.g., MS-DOS usually stores the geometry of the boot disk or partition in its boot sector.)  Note
              that /sbin/lilo must be re-run if a partition table mapped referenced with `table' is modified.

       change This keyword starts a section which describes how primary partition IDs are changed, and how primary partitions are activated and deactivated.  If change is omitted, change rules are gener‐
              ated as though the automatic keyword were specified. The keyword change alone, without any rules following, will suppress automatic change-rules.  For example,

                 other=/dev/hda2
                    label=dos
                    table=/dev/hda
                    change
                      automatic
                      partition=/dev/hda1
                         set=DOS12_hidden
                         deactivate
                      partition=/dev/hda2
                         set=DOS16_big_normal
                         activate

              specifies that when primary partition /dev/hda2 is booted, automatic change-rules will be in effect; plus, partition 1, a DOS12 partition, will be set hidden, and deactivated.  In addition,
              partition 2, will be set normal, and activated.  Activation sets the boot-flag in the partition table.  The automatic keyword may conflict with default change rules, so the set= lines above
              may be redundant.

       boot-as=<bios>
              This option (LILO version 22.5.1) indicates the BIOS device code which must be assigned to the specified drive in order for the "other=" operating system to boot.  If the chain  loader  de‐
              tects that another BIOS device code is assigned to this disk, then it will dynamically swap the assigned device code with the specified device code.

              This  option is easier to specify than "map-drive=" and more general than "master-boot" in that any device code may be specified.  Unlike "map-drive=", the determination whether to swap de‐
              vice codes is made at boot time, not install time.  This is advantageous on systems where the BIOS presents a boot menu of devices, and will map disks to devices in different ways,  depend‐
              ing upon the BIOS boot selection.

              This  option may be specified as a global option, in which case it applies to all "other=" sections unless overridden with a specific "master-boot" option.  If one of "boot-as=" or "master-
              boot" is specified as a global option, it is better to specify "master-boot" as the global option, as it will not interfere with floppy disk BIOS device codes; "boot-as=" is then used as  a
              local option to override "master-boot" as necessary.

       master-boot
              This  flag  (LILO  version 22.5) indicates a DOS/Windows or other system which will only boot from BIOS device 0x80, the "C:" drive, or BIOS device 0, the A: drive. When this flag is speci‐
              fied, if this drive is not assigned device code 0x80 or 0 by the BIOS, then the chain loader will dynamically swap the device code actually assigned with device code 0x80 or 0 to make  this
              drive appear to be the first hard or floppy drive, "C:" or "A:".

              This  flag is easier to use than "map-drive=" (see below), and is preferred, if simple forcing of device code 0x80 is all that is required. It is also more general, in that the necessity to
              swap BIOS device codes is determined dynamically at boot-time, not at boot install-time, as with "map-drive=".  It is slightly more powerful than "boot-as=", in that the device  code  which
              is assigned, 0 or 0x80, is determined dynamically.

              This option may be specified as a global option, in which case it applies to all "other=" sections unless overridden with a specific "boot-as=" option.

       map-drive=<num>
              Maps  BIOS  calls for the specified drive to the device code specified on the next line as to=<num>.  This mapping is useful for booting operating systems, such as DOS, from the second hard
              drive.  The following, swaps the C: and D: drives,

                 map-drive=0x80
                    to=0x81
                 map-drive=0x81
                    to=0x80

              This option is largely rendered obsolete by "boot-as=", introduced with LILO version 22.5.

       unsafe Do not access the boot sector at map creation time. This disables some sanity checks, including a partition table check. If the boot sector is on a fixed-format floppy  disk  device,  using
              UNSAFE  avoids the need to put a readable disk into the drive when running the map installer. If the boot sector is on a hard drive, the BIOS device code of the drive will have to be speci‐
              fied explicitly with "disk=/dev/XXXX bios=0x8X inaccessible" in the configuration file.  `unsafe' and `table' (explicit or implicit) are mutually incompatible.

COMMON DESCRIPTOR OPTIONS (image= & other=)
       In both the image= and other= cases, the following options apply.

       bypass No password is required to boot this image. Used to indicate that the global password does not apply to this `image=' or `other='.  See 'password=' below.

       label=<name>
              The boot loader uses the main file name (without its path) of each image specification to identify that image.  A different name can be used by setting the variable `label'.

       alias=<name>
              A second name for the same entry can be used by specifying an alias.

       bmp-retain
              The bitmap graphic (install=bmp) is retained when control is passed to the loaded kernel image, or other= bootloader; i.e., the screen is not blanked to alphanumeric  mode  before  starting
              the kernel.  This feature is considered EXPERIMENTAL, for those users working with startup splash screens.

       fallback=<command-line>
              Specifies a string that is stored as the default command line if the current image is booted. This is useful when experimenting with kernels which may crash before allowing interaction with
              the  system.  If  using  the  fallback  option, the next reboot (e.g.  triggered by a manual reset or by a watchdog timer) will load a different (supposedly stable) kernel. The command line
              stored by the fallback mechanism is cleared by removing or changing the default command line with the -R option, which should be a part of the boot startup scripts.

       lock   (See above.)

       optional
              Omit the image if it is not available at map creation time.  It may be specified as a global option.  This is useful to specify test kernels that are not always present.

       password=<password>
              Protect the `image=' or `other=' with a password (or passphrase).  It may be specified as a global option.  The interpretation of the `password=' setting is modified by  the  words  `manda‐
              tory', `restricted', and `bypass' (see below).
              The  password  may  be  specified in the config-file (less secure) or entered at the time the boot loader is installed. To request interactive entry of the password, it should be specified:
              password="".  Passwords entered interactively are not required to be entered again if the boot installer is re-run. They are cached, in hashed form, in a companion file to the  config-file,
              default name: /etc/lilo.conf.crc. If the config-file is updated, a warning message will be issued telling you to re-run lilo -p to force re-creation of the password cache file.

       mandatory
              A password is required to boot this image. This is the default. May be used on a single `image=' or `other=' to override a different global setting.

       nokbdisable
              (22.7.2)  The specified descriptor is not bootable if the IBM-PC keyboard is not present.  This option is really only useful if the "serial=" boot terminal is in use.  With no keyboard (and
              no serial terminal) attached, selecting a boot descriptor other than the default is impossible.  See nokbdefault above.

       restricted
              A password is only required to boot the image if kernel parameters are specified on the command line (e.g. 'single').  May be used on a single `image=' or `other=' to override  a  different
              global setting.

       vmwarn If  booting  under  a virtual monitor such as VMware(tm), the image with this label will cause a cautionary warning to be issued at boot time, and user intervention will be required to con‐
              tinue or to abort the boot process.

       vmdisable
              If booting under a virtual monitor, the image with this label will not be displayed as a boot option.  The image is only bootable in real mode.  See vmdefault above.
