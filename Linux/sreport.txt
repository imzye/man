NAME
       sreport - Generate reports from the slurm accounting data.

SYNOPSIS
       sreport [OPTIONS...] [COMMAND...]

DESCRIPTION
       sreport is used to generate reports of job usage and cluster utilization for Slurm jobs saved to the Slurm Database, slurmdbd.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all_clusters
              Use all clusters instead of only the cluster from which the command was executed.

       --federation
              Generate a report for the federation if a member of one.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message describing the usage of sreport.

       --local
              Generate a report for the local cluster, even if part of a federation.  Overrides --federation

       -M, --cluster
              The  cluster(s)  to generate reports for. Default is local cluster, unless the local cluster is currently part of a federation and in that case generate a report for all clusters in the current
              federation. If the clusters included in a federation vary through time, use this option to identify the clusters to be included in report. Implies --local.

       -n, --noheader
              Don't display header when listing results.

       -p, --parsable
              Output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end.

       -P, --parsable2
              Output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end.

       -Q, --quiet
              Print no warning or informational messages, only error messages.

       -t <format>
              Specify the output time format. Time format options are case insensitive and may be abbreviated. The default format is Minutes.  Supported time format options are listed  in  the  time  command
              section below.

       -T,  --tres <tres_names>
              Trackable  resource  (TRES) to report values for.  By default CPU resource use is reported (except for reservation reports. All TRES types reserved by a reservation will be shown by default un‐
              less overridden with this option).  Multiple TRES names may be separated using a comma separated list for all reports except the job reports, which can only support a single TRES name, or "ALL"
              for all TRES.

              The "Reported" Billing TRES is calculated from the largest Billing TRES of each node multiplied by the time frame. For example, if a node is part of multiple partitions and each has a different
              TRESBillingWeights defined the Billing TRES for the node will be the highest of the partitions.  If TRESBillingWeights is not defined on any partition for a node then the Billing TRES  will  be
              equal to the number of CPUs on the node.

              TRES node usage is no longer reported in percent format or in Cluster Utilization.  Please use TRES CPU instead.  The main issue with using node is in most configurations multiple jobs are able
              to run on the same node.  This makes TRES node accounting count the same node multiple times in the same period.  In exclusive node configurations, CPU accounting returns the  same  usage  node
              accounting would.

       -v, --verbose
              Print detailed event logging.

       -V , --version
              Print version information and exit.

COMMANDS
       <keyword> may be omitted from the execute line and sreport will
              execute in interactive mode. sreport will process commands as entered until explicitly terminated.

       exit   Terminate the execution of sreport.  Identical to the quit command.

       help   Display a description of sreport options and commands.

       nonparsable
              Return output to normal after parsable or parsable2 has been set.

       parsable
              Output will be | delimited with an ending '|'.

       parsable2
              Output will be | delimited without an ending '|'.

       quiet  Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.

       quit   Terminate the execution of sreport.  Identical to the exit command.

       time <time_format>

REPORT TYPES
       Valid report types are:
              cluster <REPORT> <OPTIONS>

              job <REPORT> <OPTIONS>

              reservation <REPORT> <OPTIONS>

              user <REPORT> <OPTIONS>

       <REPORT> options for each type include:

              cluster - AccountUtilizationByUser, UserUtilizationByAccount, UserUtilizationByWckey, Utilization, WCKeyUtilizationByUser

              job - SizesByAccount, SizesByAccountAndWcKey, SizesByWckey

              reservation - Utilization

              user - TopUsage

       NOTE:  If  OverSubscribe is configured to FORCE or YES in your slurm.conf and the system is not configured to use preemption (PreemptMode=OFF) accounting can easily grow to values greater than the ac‐
       tual utilization. It may be common on such systems to get error messages in the slurmdbd log stating: "We have more allocated time than is possible."

REPORT DESCRIPTION
       cluster AccountUtilizationByUser
              This report will display account utilization as it appears on the hierarchical tree.  Starting with the specified account or the root account by default this report will list the underlying us‐
              age with a sum on each level.  Use the 'tree' option to span the tree for better visibility.

              NOTE:  Idle  reservation time will be split evenly among accounts/users given access to it. When a reservation is assigned to whole accounts, the time will be counted in the association for the
              accounts, not the user associations in the accounts. In this case, the usage of a parent account can be larger than the sum of its children.

       cluster UserUtilizationByAccount
              This report will display users by account in order of utilization without grouping multiple accounts by user into one, but displaying them on separate lines.

       cluster UserUtilizationByWCKey
              This report will display users by wckey in order of utilization without grouping multiple wckey by user into one, but displaying them on separate lines.

       cluster Utilization
              This report will display total usage divided amongst Allocated, Down, Planned Down, Idle, and Reserved time for selected clusters.

              Allocated     Time that nodes were in use with active jobs or an active reservation.  This does not include reservations created with the MAINT or IGNORE_JOBS flags.

              Down          Time that nodes were marked as Down or time that slurmctld was not responding (assuming TrackSlurmctldDown is set in slurmdbd.conf).

              Idle          Time where nodes had no active jobs or reservations.

              OverCommitted Time of eligible jobs waiting in the queue over the Reserved time. Unlike Reserved, this has no limit. It is typically useful to determine whether your system is overloaded and by
                            how much.

              PlannedDown   Time that nodes were in use by a reservation created with the MAINT flag but not the IGNORE_JOBS flag.

              Reserved      Time  that  a node spent idle with eligible jobs in the queue that were unable to start due to time or size constraints. The maximum time is limited to the amount of time possible
                            on the system. If this value is not of importance for you then the number can be grouped with idle time.

              TresCount     Configured number of TRES' on the reported nodes. See also the TresName field.

              Note: Reservations created with the IGNORE_JOBS flag are not tracked in the Cluster Utilization report due to the fact that allowing any current/active jobs to continue to run in  the  reserva‐
              tion introduces the possibility for them to be accounted for incorrectly.

              Note:  The  default  view  for the "Cluster Utilization" report includes the following fields: Cluster, Allocated, Down, PlannedDown, Idle, Reserved, Reported. You can include additional fields
              like OverCommitted and TresCount fields with the Format option. The TresName will also be included if using the -T,  --tres <tres_names> option.

       cluster WCKeyUtilizationByUser
              This report will display wckey utilization sorted by WCKey name for each user on each cluster.

       job SizesByAccount
              This report will display the amount of time used for job ranges specified by the 'grouping=' option.  Only a single level in the tree is displayed defaulting to the root dir.   If  you  specify
              other accounts with the 'account=' option sreport will use those accounts as the root account and you will receive the aggregated totals of each listed account plus their sub accounts.

       job SizesByAccountAndWckey
              This  report is very similar to SizesByAccount with the difference being each account is pair with wckeys so the identifier is account:wckey instead of just account so there will most likely be
              multiple accounts listed depending on the number of wckeys used.

       job SizesByWckey
              This report will display the amount of time for each wckey for job ranges specified by the 'grouping=' option.

       reservation Utilization
              This report will display total usage for reservations on the systems.  Note: Time requests on this report will not truncate the time the reservation used, only the reservations that ran at  any
              time during the period requested.

       user TopUsage
              Displays the top users on a cluster, i.e. users with the highest CPUTime.  Use the group option to group accounts together.  The default is to have a different line for each user account combi‐
              nation.

              NOTE: TopUsage is always based on CPUTime. The -T, --tres option will show the TRES usage of the top users, but the users are always sorted by their CPUTime, not by the specified TRES.

       Each report type has various options...

       OPTIONS FOR ALL REPORT TYPES

       All_Clusters

PERFORMANCE
       Executing sreport sends a remote procedure call to slurmdbd. If enough calls from sreport or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the slurmdbd daemon come in at once, it can
       result in a degradation of performance of the slurmdbd daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do  not run sreport or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to slurmdbd from loops in shell scripts or other programs.  Ensure that programs limit calls to sreport to the mini‐
       mum necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Some sreport options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.  (Note: Command  line  options  will  always  override
       these settings.)

       SREPORT_CLUSTER     Same as -M, --cluster

       SREPORT_FEDERATION  Same as --federation

       SREPORT_LOCAL       Same as --local

       SREPORT_TRES        Same as -t, --tres

       SLURM_CONF          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

EXAMPLES
       Report number of jobs per account according to different job size bins:

              $ sreport job sizesbyaccount

       Report cluster utilization:

              $ sreport cluster utilization

       Report top usage:

              $ sreport user top

       Report number of jobs by user gore1 within the environ account:

              $ sreport job sizesbyaccount All_Clusters users=gore1 account=environ PrintJobCount

       Report cluster account utilization with the specified fields during the specified 24 hour day of February 23, 2009, by user gore1:

              $ sreport cluster AccountUtilizationByUser cluster=zeus user=gore1 start=2/23/09 end=2/24/09 format=Accounts,Cluster,TresCount,Login,Proper,Used

       Report cluster account utilization by user in the LC account on cluster zeus:

              $ sreport cluster AccountUtilizationByUser cluster=zeus accounts=lc start=2/23/09 end=2/24/09

       Report top usage in percent of the lc account during the specified week:

              $ sreport user topusage start=2/16/09 end=2/23/09 -t percent account=lc
