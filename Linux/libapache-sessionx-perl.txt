NAME
       Apache::Session::Generate::MD5 - Use MD5 to create random object IDs

SYNOPSIS
        use Apache::SessionX::Generate::MD5;

        $id = Apache::SessionX::Generate::MD5::generate($string);

DESCRIPTION
       This module fulfills the ID generation interface of Apache::SessionX.  If you don't give the argument $string, the IDs are generated using a two-round MD5 of a random number, the time since
       the epoch, the process ID, and the address of an anonymous hash.  The resultant ID number is highly entropic on Linux and other platforms that have good random number generators.  You are
       encouraged to investigate the quality of your system's random number generator if you are using the generated ID numbers in a secure environment.  If you give $string the ID is the MD5 hash
       of that string.

       This module can also examine session IDs to ensure that they are, indeed, session ID numbers and not evil attacks.  The reader is encouraged to consider the effect of bogus session ID numbers
       in a system which uses these ID numbers to access disks and databases.

       This modules takes one argument in the usual Apache::Session style.  The argument is IDLength, and the value, between 0 and 32, tells this module where to truncate the session ID.  Without
       this argument, the session ID will be 32 hexadecimal characters long, equivalent to a 128-bit key.
