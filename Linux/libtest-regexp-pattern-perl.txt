CONTRIBUTING
       To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on GitHub.

       Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can simply modify the code, then test via:

        % prove -l

       If  you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla, Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two other
       Dist::Zilla plugin and/or Pod::Weaver::Plugin. Any additional steps required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
