NAME
       Xalan - Process XML documents with XSLT stylesheets

SYNOPSIS
       Xalan [options] source stylesheet

DESCRIPTION
       Xalan-C++  (named  after a rare musical instrument) implements the W3C Recommendation 16 November 1999 XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0 and the XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0. XSLT is
       the first part of the XSL stylesheet language for XML. It includes the XSL Transformation vocabulary and XPath, a language for addressing parts of XML documents. For links to background materials,
       discussion groups, frequently asked questions, and tutorials on XSLT, see Getting up to speed with XSLT.

       You use the XSLT language to compose XSL stylesheets. An XSL stylesheet contains instructions for transforming XML documents from one document type to another document type (XML, HTML, or  other).
       In structural terms, an XSL stylesheet specifies the transformation of one tree of nodes (the XML input) into another tree of nodes (the output or transformation result).

OPTIONS
       -a     Use xml-stylesheet PI, not the 'stylesheet' argument

       -e encoding
              Force the specified encoding for the output.

       -i integer
              Indent the specified amount.

       -m     Omit the META tag in HTML output.

       -o filename
              Write output to the specified file.

       -p name expression
              Sets a stylesheet parameter.

       -t     Display timing information.

       -u     Disable escaping of URLs in HTML output.

       -?     Display this message.

       -v     Validates source documents.

       -      A dash as the 'source' argument reads from stdin.  ('-' cannot be used for both arguments.)
