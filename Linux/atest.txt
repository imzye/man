NAME
       atest - Decode AX.25 frames from an audio file.

SYNOPSIS
       atest [ options ] wav-file-in

              wav-file-in is a WAV format audio file.

DESCRIPTION
       atest  is  a  test application which decodes AX.25 frames from an audio
       recording.  This provides an easy way to test Dire Wolf  decoding  per‐
       formance much quicker than normal real-time.

OPTIONS
       -B n   Data  rate  in  bits/sec.   Standard values are 300, 1200, 2400,
              4800, 9600.
                     300 bps defaults to AFSK tones of 1600 & 1800.
                     1200 bps uses AFSK tones of 1200 & 2200.
                     2400 bps uses QPSK based on V.26 standard.
                     4800 bps uses 8PSK based on V.27 standard.
                     9600 bps and up uses K9NG/G3RUH standard.

       -g     Force G3RUH modem regardless of data rate.

       -j     2400 bps QPSK compatible with Dire Wolf <= 1.5.

       -J     2400 bps QPSK compatible with MFJ-2400.

       -D n   Divide audio sample rate by n.

       -h     Print frame contents as hexadecimal bytes.

       -F n   Amount of effort to try fixing frames with an  invalid  CRC.   0
              (default) = consider only correct frames.  1 = Try to fix only a
              single bit.  more = Try modifying more bits to get a good CRC.

       -L     Error if Less than this number decoded.

       -G     Error if Greater than this number decoded.

       -P m   Select the demodulator type such as D (default for 300 bps),  E+
              (default for 1200 bps), PQRS for 2400 bps, etc.

EXAMPLES
       gen_packets -o test1.wav
       atest test1.wav

       gen_packets -B 300 -o test3.wav
       atest -B 300 test3.wav

       gen_packets -B 9600 -o test9.wav
       atest -B 9600 test9.wav

              This generates and decodes 3 test files with 1200, 300, and 9600
              bits per second.

       atest 02_Track_2.wav
       atest -P E- 02_Track_2.wav
       atest -F 1 02_Track_2.wav
       atest -P E- -F 1 02_Track_2.wav

              Try different combinations of options to compare  decoding  per‐
              formance.
