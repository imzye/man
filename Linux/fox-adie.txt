NAME
       adie - The ADvanced Interactive Editor

INTRODUCTION
       Adie  is an extremely fast and convenient programming text editor writ‐
       ten using the FOX Toolkit.  Besides being a nice text editor,  Adie  is
       also  an  extremely  convenient  file  viewer, supporting a plethora of
       methods to move from one file to the next.

       For each visited file, Adie remembers where in that file you were  last
       looking, and which special places in that file have been bookmarked, so
       you can quickly return to frequently visited places.

       Project browsing is made easy by optionally displaying a File/Directory
       browser  side by side with the text so files may be visited by means of
       a single click.  Files may also be opened simply by highlighting a file
       name,  compiler  warning  message,  or #include directive and hitting a
       single button; Adie will search for the file in the same  directory  as
       an  already loaded file, or in a number of predefined directories (like
       for example include directories).
