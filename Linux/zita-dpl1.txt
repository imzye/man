NAME
       zita-dpl1 - digital peak level limiter

SYNOPSIS
       zita-dpl1 [options]

DESCRIPTION
       DPL1  is  an  look-ahead  digital  peak limiter, the kind you would use as the final step to avoid clipping when mastering or mixing. It can be used as an effect on individual instrument tracks as
       well.

       Latency is 1.2 ms rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8, 16 or 32 samples depending on sampling frequency. This amounts to 56 samples at 44.1 kHz, 64 samples at 48 kHz, and  twice  those  values
       for 88.2 or 96 kHz.

       In most cases you only need -k number_of_channels, which can be 1 to 16.  The same gain reduction is applied to all channels.

OPTIONS
