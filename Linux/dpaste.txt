NAME
       dpaste - A simple pastebin for light values (max 64KB) using OpenDHT distributed hash table.

SYNOPSIS
       dpaste -h

       dpaste -v

       dpaste [options...]

       dpaste -g code [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       By default, dpaste will read its standard input for a file to paste on OpenDHT.  For fetching a file, you have to provide the code associated to it using the flag -g.

OPTIONS
       -h     Prints some help.

       -v     Shows the version of the program.

       -g code, --get code
              Specifies the code code used to recover the file on the DHT.

       --aes-encrypt
              Use AES scheme for encryption. Password is automatically saved in the returned code ("dpaste:XXXXXX").

       --gpg-encrypt
              Use GPG scheme for encryption.

       -r recipient, --recipients recipient
              Specify the list of recipients to use for GPG encryption (--gpg--encrypt). Use -r multiple times to specify a list of recipients.

       -s, --sign
              Tells wether message should be signed using the user's GPG key. The key has to be configured through the configuration file ($XDG_CONFIG_DIR/dpaste.conf, keyword: pgp_key_id).

       --no-decrypt
              Tells dpaste not to decrypt PGP data and rather output it on stdout.

       --self-recipient
              Include self as recipient. Self refers to the key id configured for signing (see --sign description). This only takes effect if option -e is also used.

RETURN CODE
       The program returns 0 on success. Otherwise 1 is returned.

FILES
       $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/dpaste.conf
              Main configuration file where. dpaste will look for this file to recover complementary information.
