NXT-PYTHON.CONF(5)                                                                               NXT-Python                                                                              NXT-PYTHON.CONF(5)

NAME
       nxt-python.conf - NXT-Python configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The NXT-Python configuration files allow you to define the NXT bricks you want to connect to, so that you do not need to give the needed argument for every scripts.

       You can place a .nxt-python.conf in your home directory, or in the current directory. You can also explicitly give configuration file name to the invoked script or function.

FORMAT
       The  configuration  format is a INI-style format. It consists of several sections introduced by the section name in square brackets on its line. Each section contains a set of key/value pairs. The
       key and value are separated by a equal sign (‘=’).

       Configuration may include comments which are introduced by a ‘#’ character.

       When looking for a brick, you can request NXT-Python to use a specific section, or [default] if not specified. If the section is missing, or if a value is missing, the [DEFAULT] section (note  the
       uppercase) is used as a fallback.

       The following values can be defined:

       backends
              This is the space separated list of backends to use to find and connect to the brick. When not specified, a default list of backends is used:

              • devfile if filename is given,

              • socket if server_host or server_port is given,

              • usb and,

              • bluetooth.

       name   Brick name which is used to find the brick (for example: NXT). The brick name can be configured using the NXT brick menus.

       host   Bluetooth  address  which is used to find the brick (for example: 00:16:53:01:02:03). When using Bluetooth backend, this allows a direct connection without having to scan to find the brick.
              For other backends, it can be used to select the right brick when several bricks are found.

              The address can be found in the “Settings” menu, under “NXT Version” screen, it is the last line labeled “ID”. Add the colon to separated each pair of digits.

       server_host
              Server address or name (example: 192.168.1.3, or localhost).

              This is used by the socket backend.

              The server is provided by the nxt-server(1) command.

       server_port
              Server connection port (default: 2727).

              This is used by the socket backend.

              The server is provided by the nxt-server(1) command.

       filename
              Device file name (default is platform specific).

              This is used by the devfile backend to locate the RFCOMM device file.

              Please see NXT-Python documentation for more details on how to use this.

       Other values
              Other values are passed as-is to backends.

EXAMPLE
       Given the following configuration file:

          [DEFAULT]
          # Defines a fallback for every configuration name.
          backends = usb

          [default]
          # My default NXT, sitting on my desk.
          host = 00:16:53:01:02:03
          name = NXT

          [lab]
          # When working at the lab, use my second NXT.
          name = NXT2

          [robot]
          # Use Bluetooth for my third NXT, which is embedded in a robot, but try USB
          # first as this is faster.
          backends = usb bluetooth
          host = 00:16:53:aa:bb:cc
          name = ROBOT

       When using the command line, NXT-Python will connect to my default NXT if I do not give more options:

          $ nxt-test
          Finding brick...
          NXT brick name: NXT
          ...

       I can request to connect to my robot NXT brick like this:

          $ nxt-test --config robot
          Finding brick...
          NXT brick name: ROBOT
          ...

       Or when using a script:

          import nxt.locator
          b = nxt.locator.find(config="robot")

FILES
       $HOME/.nxt-python.conf
              Per user configuration file.

       .nxt-python.conf
              Configuration file in current directory.
