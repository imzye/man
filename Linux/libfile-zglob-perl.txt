File::Zglob(3pm)                                                                    User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                    File::Zglob(3pm)

NAME
       File::Zglob - Extended globs.

SYNOPSIS
           use File::Zglob;

           my @files = zglob('**/*.{pm,pl}');

DESCRIPTION
       WARNINGS: THIS IS ALPHA VERSION. API MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE

       Provides a traditional Unix glob(3) functionality; returns a list of pathnames that matches the given pattern.

       File::Zglob provides extended glob. It supports "**/*.pm" form.

FUNCTIONS
       zglob($pattern) # => list of matched files
               my @files = zglob('**/*.[ch]');

           Unlike shell's glob, if there's no matching pathnames, () is returned.

Special chars
       A glob pattern also consists of components and separator characters. In a component, following characters/syntax have special meanings.

       "*" When it appears at the beginning of a component, it matches zero or more characters except a period (.). And it won't match if the component of the input string begins with a period.

           Otherwise, it matches zero or more sequence of any characters.

       "**"
           If a component is just **, it matches zero or more number of components that match *. For example, src/**/*.h matches all of the following patterns.

               src/*.h
               src/*/*.h
               src/*/*/*.h
               src/*/*/*/*.h
               ...

       "?" When it appears at the beginning of a component, it matches a character except a period (.). Otherwise, it matches any single character.

       "[chars]"
           Specifies a character set. Matches any one of the set. The syntax of chars is the same as perl's character set syntax.

       "{pm,pl}"
           There is alternation.

           "example.{foo,bar,baz}" matches "example.foo", "example.bar", and "example.baz"

zglob and deep recursion
       "**/*" form makes deep recursion by soft link. zglob throw exception if it's deep recursion.

PORTABILITY
       Win32
           Zglob supports Win32. zglob() only uses '/' as a path separator. Since zglob() accepts non-utf8 strings. CP932 contains '\' character as a second byte of multibyte chars.

LIMITATIONS
       File order is not compatible with shells.
