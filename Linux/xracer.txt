DESCRIPTION
       xracer is a 3D arcade game in the style of the Psygnosis game WipeOut. You have to fly around the track without crashing, shooting opposing craft where necessary, and arriving in first place.

       xracer requires a supported 3D hardware accelerator card and OpenGL or a compatible library such as Brian Paul's Mesa.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display the options and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the current version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Print verbose messages to stdout about the progress of the game. This can be a useful aid to debugging.

       -s, --size WIDTHxHEIGHT
              Set the initial screen size.

       -p, --position LEFTxTOP
              Set the position for the initial window placement.

       -f, --fullscreen
              This option puts the game into full screen mode. In this mode, the game takes over the screen and keyboard.

       -j, --joystick DEVICE
              Set joystick device name.

       -L, --nomipmap
              Disable mipmapping.

BUGS
       The fullscreen option is currently broken on 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 accelerator cards. Set the MESA_FX_GLX environment to get fullscreen on those boards.
