NAME
       lircd - Decode infrared signals and provide them on a socket.

SYNOPSIS
       lircd [options] [config file]

DESCRIPTION
       The main task of lircd is to decode the infrared signals and provide an
       uniform interface for client applications. Clients can connect to lircd
       through  a  Unix  domain socket, by default /var/run/lirc/lircd.  Using
       this socket they will get the infrared codes received by lircd and they
       can send commands to lircd.

ARGUMENTS
       config file
           The configuration file, by default /etc/lirc/lircd.conf. A relative
           path is interpreted from /etc/lirc. The default configuration  file
           includes all files in /etc/lircd.conf.d.

           Each  remote which should be decoded by lircd usually requires that
           a   specific   file   is   used   e.   g.,   by   copying   it   to
           /etc/lirc/lirc.conf.d/.   The format is described in lircd.conf(5).
           Configuration files could be found using irdb-get(1)  or  lirc-set‐
           up(1).   It's  also  possible  to  generate  a  config  file  using
           irrecord(1)

OPTIONS
       Common options:

       -d, --device <device>
           Select the character device  which  lircd  should  read  from.  The
           default is currently /dev/lirc0 on most systems.

           Some  drivers,  including the default devinput driver, supports the
           auto device which picks the  first  usable  device  found  for  the
           actual driver.

           When  using  the  devinput driver name=STRING or phys=STRING can be
           used to select the device; lircd will look in /dev/input to find  a
           device  with  a  matching  description.  This is useful in case the
           device name isn't fixed. STRING may contain the '*' and  '?'  wild‐
           cards and '\' to mark them as literal.  Use mode2 --driver devinput
           --list-devices to list the actual devices.

       -H, --driver <driver>
           The driver to use.  Using --driver help lists all  available  driv‐
           ers, see DRIVER LOADING below.

       -h, --help
           Displays short help message.

       Other options:

       -a, --allow-simulate
           Enable  the SIMULATE command which can be issued using irsend(1) or
           the client API. This will allow simulating arbitrary IR events from
           the command line. Use this option with caution because it will give
           all users with access to the lircd socket  wide  control  over  the
           system.  E.g., if you have configured your system to shut down by a
           button press on your remote control, everybody will be able to shut
           down your system from the command line.

       -c, --connect [host[:port]][,[host[:port]]]
           Connects  to  other  lircd servers that provide a network socket at
           the given host and port number (see --listen). The number  of  such
           connections  is  currently  limited  to  100.  The connecting lircd
           instance will receive IR events from the lircd instance it connects
           to.  To  connect to multiple servers, add them as a comma separated
           list.

       -e, --effective-user <uid>
           If started as user root, lircd drops it privileges and runs as user
           <uid> after opening files etc.

       -i, --immediate-init
           Lircd  normally  initializes  the driver when the first client con‐
           nects. If this option is selected, the driver is  instead  initial‐
           ized immediately at start.

       -A, --driver-options key:value[|key:value...]
           Set  one  or more options for the driver. The argument is a list of
           key:value pairs delimited by '|'. The key can not  contain  spaces,
           but  such are allowed in the value part. Certain characters includ‐
           ing '#' and ';' are used as comment markers in the config file  and
           are not allowed anywhere.

       -Y, --dynamic-codes  [EXPERIMENTAL]
           Allows  use of codes which have been decoded for one remote but are
           not defined in lircd.conf.  New codes are dynamically created  with
           a  default  name.  This  feature is experimental and subject to all
           sorts of changes. It has not ben tested thoroughly.

       -l, --listen [[address:]port]]
           Let lircd listen for network connections on the given address/port.
           The default address is 0.0.0.0, which means that connections on all
           network interfaces will be accepted.  The address must be given  in
           dotted  numerical  form.   Port  defaults  to  8765.  The listening
           lircd instance will send all IR  events  to  the  connecting  lircd
           instances without any security checks.

           On  non-glibc platforms the address:port argument is mandatory, but
           can be given as an empty string e. g. --listen= which then defaults
           to 0.0.0.0:8765.

       -L, --logfile <logfile path>
           Select  the  lircd  daemon  log  file. logfile is either the string
           'syslog' indicating that syslog(1) should be used  or  a  log  file
           path. The default is to use syslog.

       -D, --loglevel [level]
           Determine  the  amount  of logging information. level can be a sym‐
           bolic syslog level: 'error','warning, 'info', 'notice' or  'debug'.
           lircd  also  defines  three additional levels 'trace', 'trace1' and
           'trace2' which gives even  more  messages  ('trace2'  bringing  the
           most).  However, in the log these messages are marked as 'debug'.

           On  non-glibc platforms the level argument is mandatory, but can be
           given as an empty string e. g. --loglevel= which then  defaults  to
           debug.

           The  level  can  also  be an integer in the range 3 (almost no mes‐
           sages) to 10.

       -O, --options-file <path>
           File containing default values for all options. A relative path  is
           interpreted from current directory. See [FILES] below.

       -o, --output <output socket>
           Select  Unix domain socket, which lircd will write remote key codes
           to.  The default currently is /var/run/lirc/lircd.

       -p, --permission <perm>
           Gives the file permission of the output socket if it has to be cre‐
           ated  in  octal  representation.  See chmod(1).  If no --permission
           option is given when the socket is initially created the default is
           to  give all users read and write permissions (0666 in octal repre‐
           sentation). If the socket already exists this option has no effect.

       -p, --pidfile <path>
           Select    the    lircd    daemon    pid    file,    defaults     to
           /var/run/lirc/lircd.pid.

       -U --plugindir <path>
           Sets  the  directory from which lircd loads it's userspace drivers.
           These are *.so files, by default found as  described  under  DRIVER
           LOADING. The argument is a :-separated search path.

       -r, --release [suffix]
           This  option  is  deprecated  and  will  be  removed in an upcoming
           release. See lircd-uinput(8) for a replacement.

           Enables automatic generation of  release  events  for  each  button
           press.   lircd  will append the given suffix to the button name for
           each release event. If no suffix is given  the  default  suffix  is
           '_EVUP'.

           Note  the  suffix  _UP, which was used by lircd prior to 0.10.0, is
           used by the linux kernel for other purposes since 4.7.

       -R, --repeat-max <limit>
           Sets an upper limit to the number of repeats when sending a signal.
           The  current  default  is 600. A SEND_START request will repeat the
           signal this many times.  Also,  if  the  number  of  repeats  in  a
           SEND_ONCE  request exceeds this number, it will be replaced by this
           number.

SOCKET BROADCAST MESSAGES FORMAT
       When decoding a button press or receiving a  SIGHUP  signal  lircd.conf
       lircd broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

       For  each  decoded  button  press  a  package  is made available on the
       socket. This is printable data formatted as:
               <code> <repeat count> <button name> <remote control name>

       e.g.,
               0000000000f40bf0 00 KEY_UP ANIMAX

       The fields are:

       code
           A 16 hexadecimal digits number encoding of  the  IR  signal.   It's
           usage in applications is deprecated and it should be ignored.

       repeat count
           shows how long the user has been holding down a button. The counter
           will start at 0 and increment each time a new IR  signal  has  been
           received.

       button name
           is the name of a key defined in the lircd.conf file.

       remote control name
           is the mandatory name attribute in the lircd.conf config file.

       These  packets are broadcasted to all clients. The only other situation
       when lircd broadcasts to all clients is when  it  receives  the  SIGHUP
       signal  and  successfully re-reads its config file. Then it will send a
       SIGHUP packet to its clients indicating that  its  configuration  might
       have changed.  The sighup packet is three lines

               BEGIN
               SIGHUP
               END

SOCKET COMMAND INTERFACE
       Applications can also send commands to lircd over the socket interface.
       The most common task is sending data, but there  are  also  other  com‐
       mands.  Each command is a single printable line, terminated with a new‐
       line. For each command, lircd replies with a reply package.

       Supported commands:

       SEND_ONCE <remote control> <button name> [repeats]
           Tell lircd to send the IR signal associated with the  given  remote
           control and button name, and then repeat it repeats times.  repeats
           is a decimal number between 0 and repeat_max.  The  latter  can  be
           given  as  a  --repeat-max  command  line  argument  to  lircd, and
           defaults to 600.  If repeats is not specified or is less  than  the
           minimum number of repeats for the selected remote control, the min‐
           imum value will be used.

       SEND_START <remote control name> <button name>
           Tell lircd to start repeating the given button until it receives  a
           SEND_STOP  command.   However,  the number of repeats is limited to
           repeat_max. lircd won't accept any new send commands  while  it  is
           repeating.

       SEND_STOP <remote control name> <button name>
           Tell lircd to abort a SEND_START command.

       LIST [remote control]
           Without  arguments  lircd replies with a list of all defined remote
           controls.  Given a remote control argument, lircd  replies  with  a
           list of all keys defined in the given remote.

       SET_INPUTLOG [path]
           Given  a  path,  lircd will start logging all received data on that
           file.  The log is printable lines as defined in mode2(1) describing
           pulse/space  durations.   Without a path, current logfile is closed
           and the logging is stopped.

       DRV_OPTION key value
           Make lircd invoke the drvctl_func(DRVCTL_SET_OPTION,  option)  with
           option being made up by the parsed key and value.  The return pack‐
           age reflects the outcome of the drvctl_func call.

       SIMULATE key data
           Given key data, instructs lircd to send this to all clients i.  e.,
           to  simulate  that this key has been decoded.  The key data must be
           formatted exactly as the packet described in [SOCKET BROADCAST MES‐
           SAGES  FORMAT],  notably is the number of digits in code and repeat
           count hardcoded.  This command is only accepted if the --allow-sim‐
           ulate command line option is active.

       SET_TRANSMITTERS transmitter mask
           Make lircd invoke the drvctl_func(LIRC_SET_TRANSMITTER_MASK, &chan‐
           nels), where channels is the decoded value of transmitter mask. See
           lirc(4) for more information.

       VERSION
           Tell lircd to send a version packet response.

       The  protocol guarantees that broadcasted messages won't interfere with
       reply packets. But broadcasts may appear at any point between  packets.
       The only exception are SIGHUP packages. These may appear just after you
       have sent a command to lircd, so you have to make sure you  don't  con‐
       fuse them with replies.

       The format of the reply packet is

         BEGIN
         <command>
         [SUCCESS|ERROR]
         [DATA
         n
         n lines of data]
         END

       If  the command was successful, data is only sent for the commands that
       return some information. Note that a packet containing 0 lines of  data
       can be a valid reply.

RUNNING AS REGULAR USER
       Traditionally  lircd  has  been  running as root since accessing kernel
       devices like /dev/lirc0 by default requires root privileges.   However,
       running a long-running service like this is a major security issue.

       The   lirc   distribution  contains  example  udev  rules  which  makes
       /dev/lirc[0-9] , USB and serial devices accessible by  the  lirc  user.
       Using  these  rules,  it is possible to run lircd as a regular user and
       group such as lirc.

FILES
       /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
           Main config file, see lircd.conf(5).

       /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf
           The options file. lircd handles the values under the  [lircd]  sec‐
           tion   in  this  file.  The  location  can  be  changed  using  the
           -O/--options-file command-line  option  or  using  the  environment
           variable  LIRC_OPTIONS_PATH.   The values here are used as defaults
           for any option not present on command line.

ENVIRONMENT
       LIRC_OPTIONS_PATH
           Options file path, see FILES.

       LIRC_PLUGINDIR
           Plugin load path, se DRIVER LOADING.

       LIRC_DEBUG_OPTIONS
           If set, enables debugging in early stages when the  --debug  option
           is yet not parsed.

DRIVER LOADING
       Drivers  are  loaded  dynamically.  This is done from a traditional *ux
       ´:´-separated path where each component in the path is searched  (lead‐
       ing part first, trailing last).

       The path used for this is determined by (falling priority):

       - The --plugindir option.

       - The    'plugindir'   entry   in    the   [lircd]   section   of   the
         lirc_options.conf file.

       - The environment variable LIRC_PLUGINDIR.

       - A hardcoded default (/usr/lib64/lirc/plugins).

SIGNALS
       HUP On receiving SIGHUP lircd  re-reads  the  lircd.conf  configuration
           file (but not lirc_options.conf) and adjusts itself if the file has
           changed.

       USR1
           On receiving SIGUSR1 lircd makes a clean exit.

DAEMONS
       lircd  is a daemon.  It should be started in some system-dependent init
       script.   By  default,  lirc  ships with systemd files enabling user to
       control the lircd service.
