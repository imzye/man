NAME
       paf - Pod Abstract Filter. Transform Pod documents from the command line.

SYNOPSIS
        sh$>
         paf summary /usr/bin/paf
         paf add_podcmds SomeModule.pm
         paf sort -heading=METHODS Pod/Abstract/Node.pm # METHODS is default
         paf sort summary Pod/Abstract/Node.pm

         # See Pod::Abstract::Filter::overlay
         paf overlay sort cut clear_podcmds SomeClass.pm

         # -p will emit pod source, instead of spawning perldoc.
         paf -p sort Pod::Abstract::Node
         paf -p find hoist Pod::Abstract::Node

DESCRIPTION
       Paf is a small but powerful, modular Pod filter and transformation tool. It allows full round-trip transformation of Pod documents using the Pod::Abstract library, with multiple filter chains without
       having to serialise/re-parse the document at each step.

       Paf comes with a small set of useful filters, but can be extended by simply writing new classes in the "Pod::Abstract::Filter" namespace.

FILTERS
   add_podcmds
       Add explicit =pod commands at the end of each cut section, so that all pod sections are started with an =pod command.

   clear_podcmds
       Remove all =pod commands that are not ending cut blocks. This will clean up documents that have been reduced using the "cut" filter too.

   cut
       Remove all cut nodes, so that only the pod remains.

   overlay
        paf overlay Source.pm

       For overlay to work, there must be a "begin :overlay/end :overlay" section in the Source file, with "=overlay SECTION Module" definitions inside. The net effect is that any missing subheadings in
       SECTION are added from the same section in the specified Modules.

       Note that this will overlay the whole subheading, INCLUDING CUT NODES, so it can add code to the source document. Use "cut" if you don't want this.

       Each overlaid section will include a "=for overlay from" marker, so that it can be replaced by a subsequent overlay from the same file/module. These sections will be replaced in-place, so ordering of
       sections once first overlaid will be preserved.

   unoverlay
        paf unoverlay Source.pm

       Strips all sections marked as overlaid and matching the overlay spec from the source.

   sort
        paf sort [-heading=METHODS] Source.pm

       Sort all of the subheadings in the named heading (METHODS if not provided).

       This will move cut nodes around with their headings, so your code will mutate. Use "cut" if you only want pod in the output.

       Alternatively, you can also cause sorting of headings to occur by including "=for sorting" at the start of your section (before the first subheading).

   summary
       Provide an abbreviated summary of the document. If there is a verbatim node in the body of a heading containing the heading name, it will be considered an example and expanded as part of the summary.

   find
        paf find [-f=]name Source.pm

       Find specific sub-sections or list items mentioning name. Used to restrict a larger document down to a smaller set that you're interested in. If no -f is specified, then the word following find will
       be the search term.

   uncut
        paf uncut Source.pm

       Convert cut nodes in the source into verbatim text. Not the inverse of cut!

   number_sections
        paf number_sections Source.pm

       Applies simple multipart (3.1.2) section numbering to head1 through head4 headings.

       Note that number_sections will currently stuff up some of the cleverness in things like summary, as the section names won't match function names any more.
