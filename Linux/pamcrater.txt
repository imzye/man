DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamcrater  creates  a  PAM  image  which is a terrain map (not a visual
       image) of cratered terrain.  The terrain is as if  a  given  number  of
       impacts into a surface create craters with random position and size.

       The  size  distribution  of  the  craters is based on a power law which
       results in many more small craters than  large  ones.   The  number  of
       craters  of  a  given  size  varies  as  the  reciprocal of the area as
       described on pages 31 and 32 of Peitgen and Saupe[1];  cratered  bodies
       in  the  Solar System are observed to obey this relationship.  The for‐
       mula used to obtain crater radii governed by this law from a  uniformly
       distributed pseudorandom sequence was developed by Rudy Rucker.

       A  terrain map is a two dimensional map of terrain elevations.  the PAM
       image that pamcrater produces is therefore not a  visual  image  but  a
       depth-one  image of tuple type "elevation", with the sample value being
       proportional to an elevation.

       You can visualize the terrain map by generating a shaded  relief  image
       of it with pamshadedrelief.

       High resolution images with large numbers of craters often benefit from
       being piped through pnmsmooth.  The averaging performed by this process
       eliminates  some  of  the jagged pixels and lends a mellow ``telescopic
       image'' feel to the overall picture.

       pamcrater generates only small  craters,  which  are  hemispherical  in
       shape (regardless of the incidence angle of the impacting body, as long
       as the velocity is sufficiently high).  Large craters, such as Coperni‐
       cus  and Tycho on the Moon, have a ``walled plain'' shape with a cross-
       section more like:

                       /\                            /\
                 _____/  \____________/\____________/  \_____

       Larger craters should really use this profile,  including  the  central
       peak, and totally obliterate the pre-existing terrain.

       The maxval of the PAM image is always 65535.

       The  randomness  in  the image is limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December
       2006) -- if you run the program twice in the same second, you  may  get
       identical output.

OPTIONS
       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

       -number n
              This  causes  pamcrater  to  generate  n craters.  If you do not
              specify -number, it generates 50000 craters.   Don't  expect  to
              see  them all!  For every large crater there are many, many more
              tiny ones which tend simply to erode the landscape.  In general,
              the  more  craters  you  specify, the more realistic the result;
              ideally you want the entire terrain  to  have  been  extensively
              turned  over  again  and  again  by  cratering.  High resolution
              images containing five to ten million craters are  stunning  but
              take longer to create.

       -height height
              This  sets  the  height of the generated image to height pixels.
              The default height is 256 pixels.

       -width width
              This sets the width of the generated image to width pixels.  The
              default width is 256 pixels.

       -randomseed=integer
              This  is the seed for the random number generator that generates
              the pixels.

              Use this to ensure you get the same image  on  separate  invoca‐
              tions.

              By  default,  pamcrater uses a seed derived from the time of day
              and process ID, which gives you fairly uncorrelated  results  in
              multiple invocations.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).

       -verbose
              This causes pamcrater to issue additional messages about what it
              is doing.

              This option was new in Neptbm 10.69 (December 2014).

DESIGN NOTES
       Real craters have two distinct morphologies.

HISTORY
       John Walker wrote pgmcrater in 1991 and it  was  included  in  Pbmplus.
       pgmcrater did the equivalent of pamcrater | pamshadedrelief.  In Netpbm
       10.68 (September 2014), Bryan Henderson split  the  functions  of  pgm‐
       crater  into  two  programs, one (pamcrater) to compute elevations, and
       the other (pamshadedrelief) to generate a shaded  relief  visual  image
       showing those elevations.  Bryan did this because it is more in keeping
       with Netpbm's modular architecture,  and  because  the  pamshadedrelief
       might be useful with other inputs.

       (Like  all  Netpbm  programs,  pgmcrater was not static between the two
       events described above; minor changes, including replacement of most of
       the code, happened in between).

       The original 1991 pgmcrater manual contains the following:
