NAME
       mm-common-prepare - Prepare a C++ binding module to use mm-common and Autotools

SYNOPSIS
       mm-common-prepare [OPTION]... [SOURCE-DIR]

DESCRIPTION
       Run mm-common-prepare to copy the mm-common build support files into the source tree of a C++ binding module.  The exact location these files will be copied to can be influenced through special macros
       in the configure.ac file.

       AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([AUX-DIR])
              The Automake include files are placed into the AUX-DIR subdirectory of the top-level source directory.  If AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR is not specified, the files are placed at the top-level of the  mod‐
              ule's source tree.

       MM_CONFIG_DOCTOOL_DIR([DOCTOOL-DIR])
              If the MM_CONFIG_DOCTOOL_DIR macro is called with an explicit DOCTOOL-DIR argument, the common utilities required for generating and installing the reference documentation of a C++ binding mod‐
              ule will be copied to the named subdirectory.  If MM_CONFIG_DOCTOOL_DIR is not used or does not specify a DOCTOOL-DIR argument, mm-common-prepare will not copy the documentation  utility  files
              into the module's source tree.  Instead, it is assumed that the module depends on mm-common and can use the installed documentation utilities that come with it.

       If no SOURCE-DIR argument has been specified on the command line, the current working directory will be used.

OPTIONS
       -c, --copy
              copy files instead of creating symbolic links to them

       -f, --force
              forcefully replace existing files or symbolic links

       --help display a help message and exit

       --version
              show version information and exit

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is 0 if OK, or 1 if an error occurred.
