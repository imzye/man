NAME
       dmrg - The main DMRG++ driver

SYNOPSIS
       ./dmrg [-b] [--threads=n] [--wft=yes|no] [--no-finite-loops] [--logfile=logfile] [-v] [-h] [-f input-file]

DESCRIPTION
       If  no  -f  input-file is given, DMRG++ prints the version details and exits.  Else it uses the input-file as input for the main driver.  Command line options override input file options, which in
       turn override defaults.

OPTIONS
       -b     Run in the background. Requires the --logfile option.

       -f input-file
              Use input-file as the input for the main driver. If input-file is - then read standard input.

       -h     Print this message and exit.

       --logfile=logfile
              Do not print progress to the terminal. Close standard output and error and redirect both to logfile.

       --no-finite-loops
              Do not perform finite loops, that is, exit after the infinite algorithm has finished.

       --threads=n
              Use n pthreads. It is an error to specify this option unless the code was compiled with pthread support.

       -v     Turn on verbose mode.

       --wft=yes|no
              Perform or do not perform the wave-function transformation for guessing the ground state.
