HISTORY
       matrix.conf is the configuration file from matrix.pl and is a joint work of Hugo Santos, Sebastien Chaumontet and Mickael Hoerdt. It has been done in the early days of the m6bone, when nobody knew
       if the SPTs or RPTs were being used between hosts and also to evaluate the performance and deployment of SSM.
