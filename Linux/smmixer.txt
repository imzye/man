NAME
       smmixer - get/set Linux soundcard packet radio modem driver mixer

SYNOPSIS
       smmixer [-i device] [ params ]

DESCRIPTION
       smmixer displays and/or sets the input source and input and output lev‐
       els of a soundcard modem port.

OPTIONS
       smmixer accepts the following option:

       -i     The device argument specifies the soundcard modem  device  which
              should  be configured or interrogated.  It will usually have the
              following form: sm[0-3].

PARAMETERS
       The AD1848 (WSS) mixer accepts the following parameters:

       ol=val sets the level of the left output to the specified value.  Legal
              values are from -100..0dB.

       or=val sets the level of the right output to the specified value. Legal
              values are from -100..0dB.

       o=val  sets the level of both outputs to  the  specified  value.  Legal
              values are from -100..0dB.

       il=val sets  the  level of the left input to the specified value. Legal
              values are from 0..43dB.

       ir=val sets the level of the right input to the specified value.  Legal
              values are from 0..43dB.

       i=val  sets the level of both inputs to the specified value. Legal val‐
              ues are from 0..43dB.

       sl=val sets the source of the left input to the specified value.  Legal
              values are line, aux1, mic or dac.

       sr=val sets the source of the right input to the specified value. Legal
              values are line, aux1, mic or dac.

       s=val  sets the source of both inputs to  the  specified  value.  Legal
              values are line, aux1, mic or dac.

       The CT1335 (SB2.x) mixer accepts the following parameter:

       o=val  sets  the  output level to the specified value. Legal values are
              from -46..0dB.

       The CT1345 (SBPro) mixer accepts the following parameters:

       ol=val sets the level of the left output to the specified value.  Legal
              values are from -46..0dB.

       or=val sets the level of the right output to the specified value. Legal
              values are from -46..0dB.

       o=val  sets the level of both outputs to  the  specified  value.  Legal
              values are from -46..0dB.

       s=val  sets  the  input source to the specified value. Legal values are
              mic, cd or line.

       The CT1745 (SB16, SB32 AWE) mixer accepts the following parameters:

       ol=val sets the level of the left output to the specified value.  Legal
              values are from -62..18dB.

       or=val sets the level of the right output to the specified value. Legal
              values are from -62..18dB.

       o=val  sets the level of both outputs to  the  specified  value.  Legal
              values are from -62..18dB.

       il=val sets  the  level of the left input to the specified value. Legal
              values are from -62..18dB.

       ir=val sets the level of the right input to the specified value.  Legal
              values are from -62..18dB.

       i=val  sets the level of both inputs to the specified value. Legal val‐
              ues are from -62..18dB.

       s=val  enables the specified value as a source. Legal values are  line,
              line.l, line.r, midi, midi.l, midi.r, cd, cd.l, cd.r or mic.

CONSIDERATIONS
       It  is important that the audio levels of your radio match those of the
       soundcard. To help achieve this, use the smdiag utility.

       This utility can only be used after the interface is started  up,  i.e.
       after ifconfig sm? up.

       The sound driver and the soundcard modem driver are mutually exclusive,
       i.e. they cannot both access the same soundcard at the same time.  Even
       worse,  the  sound  driver  reserves  the  soundcard as soon as it gets
       loaded. The souncard modem driver however reserves the card  only  when
       the interface is started, i.e. during ifconfig if up.

       9600  baud  may not currently work on SoundBlaster cards with DSP revi‐
       sion 4.x, i.e.  SB16 and SB32 AWE. This is because they seem to not  be
       fully backwards compatible.
