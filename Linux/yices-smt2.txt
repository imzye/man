NAME
       yices-smt2 - the Yices SMT solver for the SMT-LIB 2 language

SYNOPSIS
       yices-smt2 [ option ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Runs the Yices SMT solver on an input problem written in SMT-LIB 2 language.  If no file is given, the problem is read from standard input.

       The SMT-LIB language and logical theories are documented at http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu.

OPTIONS
       --version, -V
              Display version and exit.

       --help, -h
              Display a short help summary.

       --verbosity=level, -v level
              Set the verbosity level (default = 0).

       --timeout=timeout,-t timeout
              Give a timeout in seconds. There is no timeout by default.

       --stats, -s
              Print a statistics summary before exiting.

       --incremental
              Enable support for the push/pop commands.

       --interactive
              Run in interactive mode.

              This option is ignored if an input file is given on the command line. Otherwise, yices-smt2 prints a prompt before every command. This also sets the SMT-LIB option :print-success to true.

       --mcsat
              Force use of the MCSAT solver.

       --smt2-model-format
              Print models in the SMT-LIB format (instead of the default Yices format)..

       --bvconst-in-decimal
              Print bitvector constants using the SMT-LIB decimal format, instead of the binary format.

       --delegate=solver
              Selects an third-party backend SAT solver for bit-vector problems.

              The solver must be either cadical or cryptominisat or y2sat.  This option has no effect unless the logic if QF_BV.

       --dimacs=filename
              Bit-blast then export the CNF to a file in the DIMACS format. This option is ignored unless the logic is QF_BV.

       --mcsat-help
              Display options used only by the MCSAT solver.
