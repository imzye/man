NAME
       x2gofm - X2Go wrapper for Browsing X2Go Shared Folders

SYNOPSIS
       x2gofm <shared-folder>

DESCRIPTION
       x2gofm is a component of the generic file manager bindings for X2Go's shared folders.  x2gofm uses XDG (namely x2go-open <dir>) to launch the default file browser on all client-side folders shared via
       X2Go.

       The default file browser is defined by the freedesktop.org specification of the running desktop environment.
