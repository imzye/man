DESCRIPTION
       h5ar is a HDF5 archiver, which can create an HDF5 archive, extract it and manipulate it in various ways. It does to by calling an executable jar file.

OPTIONS
       -B, --build
              prints out the build and environment information

       -C, --compress-all
              compresses all files

       -D, --suppress-directories
              suppresses output for directories itself for LIST and VERIFY (default: false)

       -E, --exclude-dirs REGEX
              excludes directories according to provided regex

       -F, --file-format N
              specifies the file format version when creating an archive (N=1 -> HDF51.8 (default), N=2 -> HDF51.10), N=99 -> LATEST (default: 1)

       -H, --help
              shows this help text

              stops on first error and gives detailed error report (default: false)

       -V, --version
              prints out the version information

       -a, --verify-attributes
              considers file attributes for VERIFY (default: false)

       -c, --compress REGEX
              compresses files according to provided regex

       -e, --exclude REGEX
              excludes files according to provided regex

       -i, --include REGEX
              includes files according to provided regex

       -m, --check-missing-files
              checks for files present on the filesystem but missing from the archive for VERIFY (default: false)

       -n, --numeric
              uses numeric values for mode, uid and gid for LIST and VERIFY (default: false)

       -nc, --no-compression REGEX does not compress files satisfying provided regex

       -q, --quiet
              quiet operation (only error output) (default: false)

       -r, --root-dir DIR
              root directory for archiving / extracting / verifying

       -t, --test-checksums
              tests CRC32 checksums of files in archive for LIST (default: false)

       -v, --verbose
              verbose output (all operations) (default: false)

   Modes (command capitalization ignored):
              ARCHIVE (AR, A): add files on the file system to an archive (always recursive)
              CAT (C): extract files from an archive to stdout
              EXTRACT (EX, E): extract files from an archive to the file system (always recursive)
              DELETE (REMOVE, RM, D): delete files from an archive
              LIST (LS, S): list files in an archive
              VERIFY (VF, V): verify the existence and integrity of files on the file system vs. the contents of an archive

EXAMPLES
              h5ar ar /tmp/home -r ~/ .

              - will create home.h5ar in /tmp containing all files of the user's home directory (note: ARCHIVE is always recursive).

              h5ar ls -v -R -t -S /tmp/home

              - will list the full content of archive /tmp/home.h5ar recursively, with full detail and verify the checksums; stop if there is a checksum mismatch.

              h5ar vf -r ~/ -v -R -m /tmp/home foo bar

              - will verify the contents of directories foo/ and bar/ in archive /tmp/home.h5ar recursively against the user's home directory, detecting any missing files.
