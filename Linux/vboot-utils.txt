NAME
       crossystem - Chrome OS firmware/system interface utility

DESCRIPTION
   Usage:
              crossystem [--all]

              Prints all parameters with descriptions and current values.  If --all is specified, prints even normally hidden fields.

              crossystem [param1 [param2 [...]]]

              Prints the current value(s) of the parameter(s).

              crossystem [param1=value1] [param2=value2 [...]]]

              Sets the parameter(s) to the specified value(s).

              crossystem [param1?value1] [param2?value2 [...]]]

              Checks if the parameter(s) all contain the specified value(s).

       Stops at the first error.  Valid parameters:
