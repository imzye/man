Pod::Elemental::PerlMunger(3pm)                                                     User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                     Pod::Elemental::PerlMunger(3pm)

NAME
       Pod::Elemental::PerlMunger - a thing that takes a string of Perl and rewrites its documentation

VERSION
       version 0.200007

OVERVIEW
       This role is to be included in classes that rewrite the documentation of a Perl document, stripping out all the Pod, munging it, and replacing it into the Perl.

       The only relevant method is "munge_perl_string", which must be implemented with a different interface than will be exposed.

       When calling the "munge_perl_string" method, arguments should be passed like this:

         $object->munge_perl_string($perl_string, \%arg);

       $perl_string should be a character string containing Perl source code.

       %arg may contain any input for the underlying procedure.  Defined keys for %arg are:

       filename
           the name of the file whose contents are being munged; optional, used for error messages

       no_strip_bom
           If given, the BOM character (U+FEFF) won't be stripped from the input.  Probably best to leave this one off.

       The method will return a character string containing the rewritten and combined document.

       Classes including this role must implement a "munge_perl_string" that expects to be called like this:

         $object->munge_perl_string(\%doc, \%arg);

       %doc will have two entries:

         ppi - a PPI::Document of the Perl document with all its Pod removed
         pod - a Pod::Elemental::Document with no transformations yet performed

       This "munge_perl_string" method should return a hashref in the same format as %doc.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although  it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

ATTRIBUTES
   replacer
       The replacer is either a method name or code reference used to produces PPI elements used to replace removed Pod.  By default, it is "replace_with_nothing", which just removes Pod tokens entirely.
       This means that the line numbers of the code in the newly-produced document are changed, if the Pod had been interleaved with the code.

       See also "replace_with_comment" and "replace_with_blank".

       If no further code follows the Pod being replaced, "post_code_replacer" is used instead.

   post_code_replacer
       This attribute is used just like "replacer", and defaults to its value, but is used for building replacements for Pod removed after the last hunk  of  code.   The  idea  is  that  if  you're  only
       concerned about altering your code's line numbers, you can stop replacing stuff after there's no more code to be affected.

METHODS
   replace_with_nothing
       This method returns nothing.  It's the default "replacer".  It's not very interesting.

   replace_with_comment
       This replacer replaces removed Pod elements with a comment containing their text.  In other words:

         =head1 A header!

         This is great!

         =cut

       ...is replaced with:

         # =head1 A header!
         #
         # This is great!
         #
         # =cut

   replace_with_blank
       This replacer replaces removed Pod elements with vertical whitespace of equal line count.  In other words:

         =head1 A header!

         This is great!

         =cut

       ...is replaced with five blank lines.
