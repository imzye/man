NAME
       Run::Parts::Perl - Pure Perl implementation of Debian's run-parts tool

VERSION
       version 0.09

SYNOPSIS
       Pure Perl reimplementation of basic functionality of Debian's run-parts(8) tool.

       run-parts(8) runs all the executable files named within constraints described below, found in the given directory.  Other files and directories are silently ignored.

       Additionally it can just print the names of the all matching files (not limited to executables, but ignores blacklisted files like e.g. backup files), but don't actually run them.

       This is useful when functionality or configuration is split over multiple files in one directory.

       This module is not thought to be used directly and its interface may change. See Run::Parts for a stable user interface.

FILE NAME CONSTRAINTS
       On unix-ish operating systems, the file name (but not the path) must match ^[-A-Za-z0-9_]+$, i.e. may not contain a dot.

       On dos-ish operating systems, the file name without suffix must match ^[-A-Za-z0-9_]+$, i.e. may not contain a dot. The suffix may contain alphanumeric characters and is not mandatory. The full
       regular expression the file name including the suffix must match is ^[-A-Za-z0-9_]+(\.[A-Za-z0-9]+)?$.

       Debian's run-parts(8) tool also offers to use alternative regular expressions as file name constraints. This is not yet implemented in Run::Parts::Perl.

METHODS
   new (Constructor)
       Creates a new Run::Parts object. Takes one parameter, the directory on which run-parts should work.

   run_parts_command
       Executes the given action with the given parameters

   list
       Lists all relevant files in the given directory. Equivalent to "run-parts --list". Returns an array.

   test
       Lists all relevant executables in the given directory. Equivalent to "run-parts --tests". Returns an array.

   run
       Executes all relevant executables in the given directory. Equivalent to "run-parts --tests". Returns an array.

INTERNAL FUNCTIONS
   dosish
       Returns true if ran on a dos-ish platform, i.e. MS-DOS, Windows or OS/2.
