NAME
       ch-docker2tar - Flatten a Docker image into a Charliecloud image tarball

SYNOPSIS
          $ ch-docker2tar IMAGE OUTDIR

DESCRIPTION
       Flattens the Docker image tagged IMAGE into a Charliecloud tarball in directory OUTDIR.

       The Docker environment (e.g., ENV statements) is placed in a file in the tarball at ./environment, in a form suitable for ch-run --set-env.

       Sudo privileges are required to run docker export.

       Additional arguments:

          --help print help and exit

          --version
                 print version and exit

EXAMPLE
          $ ch-docker2tar hello /var/tmp
          57M /var/tmp/hello.tar.gz
          $ ls -lh /var/tmp
          -rw-r-----  1 reidpr reidpr  57M Feb 13 16:14 hello.tar.gz

REPORTING BUGS
       If Charliecloud was obtained from your Linux distribution, use your distribution’s bug reporting procedures.

       Otherwise, report bugs to: <https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/issues>

DOCKER TIPS
       Docker is a convenient way to build Charliecloud images. While installing Docker is beyond the scope of this documentation, here are a few tips.

   Understand the security implications of Docker
       Because  Docker  (a)  makes installing random crap from the internet really easy and (b) is easy to deploy insecurely, you should take care. Some of the implications are below. This list should not be
       considered comprehensive nor a substitute for appropriate expertise; adhere to your moral and institutional responsibilities.

   docker equals root
       Anyone who can run the docker command or interact with the Docker daemon can trivially escalate to root.  This is considered a feature.

       For this reason, don’t create the docker group, as this will allow passwordless, unlogged escalation for anyone in the group.

   Images can contain bad stuff
       Standard hygiene for “installing stuff from the internet” applies. Only work with images you trust. The official Docker Hub repositories can help.

   Containers run as root
       By default, Docker runs container processes as root. In addition to being poor hygiene, this can be an escalation path, e.g. if you bind-mount host directories.

   Docker alters your network configuration
       To see what it did:

          $ ifconfig    # note docker0 interface
          $ brctl show  # note docker0 bridge
          $ route -n

   Docker installs services
       If you don’t want the service starting automatically at boot, e.g.:

          $ systemctl is-enabled docker
          enabled
          $ systemctl disable docker
          $ systemctl is-enabled docker
          disabled

   Configuring for a proxy
       By default, Docker does not work if you have a proxy, and it fails in two different ways.

       The first problem is that Docker itself must be told to use a proxy. This manifests as:

          $ sudo docker run hello-world
          Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
          Pulling repository hello-world
          Get https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/library/hello-world/images: dial tcp 54.152.161.54:443: connection refused

       If you have a systemd system, the Docker documentation explains how to configure this. If you don’t have a systemd system, then /etc/default/docker might be the place to go?

       The second problem is that Docker containers need to know about the proxy as well. This manifests as images failing to build because they can’t download stuff from the internet.

       The fix is to set the proxy variables in your environment, e.g.:

          export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8088
          export http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY
          export HTTPS_PROXY=$HTTP_PROXY
          export https_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY
          export ALL_PROXY=$HTTP_PROXY
          export all_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY
          export NO_PROXY='localhost,127.0.0.1,.example.com'
          export no_proxy=$NO_PROXY

       You also need to teach sudo to retain them. Add the following to /etc/sudoers:

          Defaults env_keep+="HTTP_PROXY http_proxy HTTPS_PROXY https_proxy ALL_PROXY all_proxy NO_PROXY no_proxy"

       Because different programs use different subsets of these variables, and to avoid a situation where some things work and others don’t, the Charliecloud test suite (see  below)  includes  a  test  that
       fails if some but not all of the above variables are set.
