NAME
       rubiks_optimal - optimal solver for 3x3x3 Rubik's cube

SYNOPSIS
       rubiks_optimal

DESCRIPTION
       Solves a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, entered at a prompt.

CUBE FORMAT
       A solved cube is represented as

            UF UR UB UL DF DR DB DL FR FL BR BL UFR URB UBL ULF DRF DFL DLB DBR

       where U,D,F,B,L,R stand for up,down,front,back,left,right and the two-colored cubies are listed before the three-colored corner cubies.

       To  input  a scrambled cube, first give the cubie that's in the  UF  location, then the cubie in the  UR  location, and so forth, according to this list above.  For example, "cube in a cube" would
       be

            UF UR RD RB LU LF DB DL FR UB DF BL UFR RFD RDB RBU LFU LUB DLB LDF

       This input should all be on one line.
