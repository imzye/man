NAME
     obconformer — generate conformer coordinates

SYNOPSIS
     obconformer #-of-conformers #-of-optimization-steps filename

DESCRIPTION
     The obconformer tool can be used as part of a conformational study by generating random conformers using a Monte Carlo search. The best conformer out of the batch of conformers will be output, after
     taking the supplied number of geometry optimization steps. By default, obconformer uses the MMFF94 force field.

EXAMPLES
           obconformer 250 100 baseconformer.sdf > rotamer1.sdf

     Generate the best conformer (out of 250) of baseconformer.sdf and write it to rotamer1.sdf after 100 geometry optimization steps
