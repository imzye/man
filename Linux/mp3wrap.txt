NAME
       mp3wrap — Utility for mp3 wrapping

SYNOPSIS
       mp3wrap [options]  OUTPUTFILE  f1.mp3  f2.mp3  [f3.mp3]...

DESCRIPTION
       Mp3Wrap  is a free command-line utility, which wraps two or more mp3 files in one large playable file, without losing filename and ID3 information. It's useful to make large files easy to download
       on internet and then easy to split again in few seconds. You can split original files using mp3splt: http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net

       Mp3Wrap will create a file named: OUTPUTFILE_MP3WRAP.mp3.  It's important you don't remove the MP3WRAP string, because this will tell the split program Mp3Splt that the file is wrapped and can  be
       split  just  with  -w  option.  There is also the possibility to specify a custom extension to created file (such as "OUTPUTFILE - MP3WRAP - wrapped by me.mp3"). This can be done using config file
       (see below), just adding the line "EXT=my ext.mp3" into it.  Note that your custom extension must contain MP3WRAP string anywhere, otherwise program will add it by itself.

       Mp3Wrap will also add to the file a ID3v2 containing information on how to split the file; you can change Title and Album tags but PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE COMMENT.

OPTIONS
       -a        Add specified files to an existing Mp3Wrap file. Files are appended and the index is updated.

       -l        List all files wrapped into a Mp3Wrap file. Doesn't extract anything

       -v        Verbose mode. Mp3Wrap will display additional information on process and, when using list option (-l) it will show many extra infos on wrapped files.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       For Linux version valid configuration files are:

              ~/.mp3wrap (in home directory)

              .mp3wrap (in the dir you are in that moment).

       For WIN32 version:

              PROG_DIR/mp3wrap.ini (dir where mp3wrap.exe is)

              mp3wrap.ini (in the dir you are in that moment).

       FILE FORMAT

       The file consists of key-value pairs in the form
              KEY=value
       where key contains no whitespace and no equal signs.  value will be all of the text after the equal sign until (but not including) the ending newline.  Beware of extra spaces at  the  end  of  the
       line!  They will probably be interpreted as part of the option value.

       Valid option keys are:

              EXT    The extension mp3wrap will append to created files.

       Here is an example:
              EXT=_MP3WRAP_wrapped by me.mp3

       mp3wrap album.mp3 file1.mp3 file2.mp3 file3.mp3 file4.mp3
