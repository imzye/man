NAME
       cephfs-mirror - Ceph daemon for mirroring CephFS snapshots

SYNOPSIS
       cephfs-mirror

DESCRIPTION
       cephfs-mirror is a daemon for asynchronous mirroring of Ceph Filesystem snapshots among Ceph clusters.

       It connects to remote clusters via libcephfs, relying on default search paths to find ceph.conf files, i.e. /etc/ceph/$cluster.conf where $cluster is the human-friendly name of the cluster.

OPTIONS
       --mon-host monaddress[:port]
              Connect to specified monitor (instead of looking through ceph.conf).

       --keyring=<path-to-keyring>
              Provide path to keyring; useful when it's absent in standard locations.

       --log-file=<logfile>
              file to log debug output

       --debug-cephfs-mirror=<log-level>/<memory-level>
              set cephfs-mirror debug level

       -c ceph.conf, --conf=ceph.conf
              Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.

       -i ID, --id ID
              Set the ID portion of name for cephfs-mirror

       -n TYPE.ID, --name TYPE.ID
              Set the rados user name (eg. client.mirror)

       --cluster NAME
              Set the cluster name (default: ceph)

       -d     Run in foreground, log to stderr

       -f     Run in foreground, log to usual location

AVAILABILITY
       cephfs-mirror is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph documentation at https://docs.ceph.com for more information.
