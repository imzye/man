NAME
       wp-setup - wordpress setup for Debian

SYNOPSIS
       wp-setup action

DESCRIPTION
       This script's purpose is to make it easier to manage Wordpress installations on Debian systems. For now, it's mainly for the package's internal usage though.

ACTIONS
       --sync-wp-content
           Update /var/lib/wordpress/wp-content/{plugins,themes}/ based on what's available in /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/{plugins,themes}. This command is run by the package's postinst script every
           time that dpkg installs a package that modifies something in /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/.

       --purge-wp-content
           Remove all symlinks from /var/lib/wordpress/wp-content/{plugins,themes}/ that point to corresponding directories in /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/{plugins,themes}. This command is run by the
           package's prerm script to ensure everything is properly removed.
