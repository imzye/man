NAME
       Test::NoTabs - Check the presence of tabs in your project

VERSION
       version 2.02

SYNOPSIS
       "Test::NoTabs" lets you check the presence of tabs in your perl code. It report its results in standard "Test::Simple" fashion:

         use Test::NoTabs tests => 1;
         notabs_ok( 'lib/Module.pm', 'Module is tab free');

       Module authors can include the following in a t/notabs.t and have "Test::NoTabs" automatically find and check all perl files in a module distribution:

         use Test::NoTabs;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       or

         use Test::NoTabs;
         all_perl_files_ok( @mydirs );

DESCRIPTION
       This module scans your project/distribution for any perl files (scripts, modules, etc) for the presence of tabs.

FUNCTIONS
   all_perl_files_ok( [ @directories ] )
       Applies "notabs_ok()" to all perl files found in @directories (and sub directories). If no <@directories> is given, the starting point is one level above the current running script, that should
       cover all the files of a typical CPAN distribution. A perl file is *.pl or *.pm or *.t or a file starting with "#!...perl"

       If the test plan is defined:

         use Test::NoTabs tests => 3;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       the total number of files tested must be specified.

   notabs_ok( $file [, $text] )
       Run a tab check on $file. For a module, the path (lib/My/Module.pm) or the name (My::Module) can be both used.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Inspired by some code written by Paul Lindner.

       Test::Strict was used as an example when creating this module and distribution.

       Rick Myers and Emanuele Zeppieri also provided valuable feedback.

       Patch to fix warnings provided by Florian Ragwitz (rafl)
