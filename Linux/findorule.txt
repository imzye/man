FINDORULE(1)                                                                          User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                          FINDORULE(1)

NAME
       findorule - command line wrapper to File::Find::Object::Rule

VERSION
       version 0.0313

DESCRIPTION
       "findorule" mostly borrows the interface from GNU find(1) to provide a command-line interface onto the File::Find::Object::Rule hierarchy of modules.

       The syntax for expressions is the rule name, preceded by a dash, followed by an optional argument.  If the argument is an opening parenthesis it is taken as a list of arguments, terminated by a
       closing parenthesis.

       Some examples:

        find -file -name ( foo bar )

       files named "foo" or "bar", below the current directory.

        find -file -name foo -bar

       files named "foo", that have pubs (for this is what our fictitious "bar" clause specifies), below the current directory.

        find -file -name ( -bar )

       files named "-bar", below the current directory.  In this case if we'd have omitted the parenthesis it would have parsed as a call to name with no arguments, followed by a call to -bar.

   Supported switches
       I'm very slack.  Please consult the File::Find::Object::Rule manpage for now, and prepend - to the commands that you want.

   Extra bonus switches
       findorule automatically loads all of your installed File::Find::Object::Rule::* extension modules, so check the documentation to see what those would be.

USAGE
         findorule [path...] [expression]
