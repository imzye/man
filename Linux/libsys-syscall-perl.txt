NAME
       Sys::Syscall - access system calls that Perl doesn't normally provide access to

SYNOPSIS
         use Sys::Syscall;

DESCRIPTION
       Use epoll, sendfile, from Perl.  Mostly Linux-only support now, but more syscalls/OSes planned for future.

Exports
       Nothing by default.

       May export: sendfile epoll_ctl epoll_create epoll_wait EPOLLIN EPOLLOUT EPOLLERR EPOLLHUP EPOLL_CTL_ADD  EPOLL_CTL_DEL EPOLL_CTL_MOD

       Export tags:  :epoll and :sendfile

Functions
   epoll support
       $ok = epoll_defined()
           Returns true if epoll might be available.  (caller must still test with epoll_create)

       $epfd = epoll_create([ $start_size ])
           Create a new epoll filedescriptor.  Returns -1 if epoll isn't available.

       $rv = epoll_ctl($epfd, $op, $fd, $events)
           See manpage for epoll_ctl

       $count = epoll_wait($epfd, $max_events, $timeout, $arrayref)
           See manpage for epoll_wait.  $arrayref is an arrayref to be modified with the items returned.  The values put into $arrayref are arrayrefs of [$fd, $state].

   sendfile support
       $ok = sendfile_defined()
           Returns true if sendfile should work on this operating system.

       $sent = sendfile($sock_fd, $file_fd, $max_send)
           Sends up to $max_send bytes from $file_fd to $sock_fd.  Returns bytes actually sent, or -1 on error.
