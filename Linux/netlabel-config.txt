NAME
       netlabel-config - NetLabel configuration utility

SYNOPSIS
       netlabelctl reset| load

DESCRIPTION
       The  NetLabel  configuration  utility,  netlabel-config,  is  a  script
       designed to make it easier for system administratiors to  create,  man‐
       age,  and  use  complex  NetLabel  configurations.  The netlabel-config
       script uses the netlabelctl(8) tool and /etc/netlabel.rules  configura‐
       tion  file  to  load a saved NetLabel configuration into the kernel and
       reset the kernel's NetLabel configuration to  the  default  state  when
       needed.

       reset  Removes  any  NetLabel  configuration loaded into the kernel and
              resets the kernel's NetLabel state to the default.

       load   Loads  the  NetLabel  configuration  specified  by   /etc/netla‐
              bel.rules into the kernel.

EXIT STATUS
       Returns zero on success, errno values on failure.
