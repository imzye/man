NAME
       pmcat - page through a module file

DESCRIPTION
       Given a module name, figure out the path name and send that to the
       user's pager.

           $ pmcat CGI

       This works also on alternate installed versions of Perl:

           $ oldperl -S pmcat strict

           $ filsperl -S pmcat Threads

       This command is mostly here for people too lazy to type

           $ more `pmpath CGI`
