ansi2txt(1)                 General Commands Manual                ansi2txt(1)

NAME
       ansi2txt - ansi to plain text converter

SYNOPSIS
       ansi2txt < log > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       ansi2txt  can be used to convert text containing ANSI color codes (such
       as MUD logs, text processed  by  syntax  highlighters,  colorgcc,  col‐
       ordiff,  ccze, loco, etc) into plain ASCII text.  It works as a filter,
       reading from stdin, removing all ANSI codes and sending the  output  to
       stdout.

CAVEATS
       All  ANSI  codes  are  simply ignored, including all cursor positioning
       ones.  Sometimes this is what you want, sometimes it isn't.

SEE ALSO
       ansi2html, ttyrec2ansi, pipetty.
