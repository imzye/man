NAME
       IO - load various IO modules

SYNOPSIS
          use IO qw(Handle File); # loads IO modules, here IO::Handle, IO::File
          use IO;                 # DEPRECATED

DESCRIPTION
       "IO" provides a simple mechanism to load several of the IO modules in one go.  The IO modules belonging to the core are:

             IO::Handle
             IO::Seekable
             IO::File
             IO::Pipe
             IO::Socket
             IO::Dir
             IO::Select
             IO::Poll

       Some other IO modules don't belong to the perl core but can be loaded as well if they have been installed from CPAN.  You can discover which ones exist with this query:
       <https://metacpan.org/search?q=IO%3A%3A>.

       For more information on any of these modules, please see its respective documentation.

DEPRECATED
           use IO;                # loads all the modules listed below

       The loaded modules are IO::Handle, IO::Seekable, IO::File, IO::Pipe, IO::Socket, IO::Dir.  You should instead explicitly import the IO modules you want.
