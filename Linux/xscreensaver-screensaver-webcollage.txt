NAME
       webcollage - a collage of random images from the World Wide Web

SYNOPSIS
       webcollage  [--display  host:display.screen]  [--root]  [--window-id  number] [--window-id id] [--verbose] [--timeout secs] [--delay secs] [--background bg] [--no-output] [--urls-only] [--imagemap
       filename-base] [--size WxH] [--opacity ratio] [--filter command] [--filter2 command] [--http-proxy host[:port]] [--dictionary dictionary-file] [--directory dir] [--fps]

DESCRIPTION
       This screen saver creates collages out of random images from the World Wide Web.  It finds the images by feeding random words into various search engines, then pulling images (or sections  of  im‐
       ages) out of the pages returned.  One satisfied customer described it as "a nonstop pop culture brainbath".

       You can also see it in action at https://www.jwz.org/webcollage/

OPTIONS
       webcollage accepts the following options:

       --root or --window-id number
               Draw on the specified window.  Images are placed on the root window using the xscreensaver-getimage(6x) program.

       --verbose or --v
               Print  diagnostics  to  stderr.  Multiple -v switches increase the amount of output.  -v will print out the URLs of the images, and where they were placed; -vv will print out any warnings,
               and all URLs being loaded; -vvv will print information on what URLs were rejected; and so on.

       --timeout seconds
               How long to wait for a URL to complete before giving up on it and moving on to the next one.  Default 30 seconds.

       --delay seconds
               How long to sleep between images.  Default 2 seconds.  (Remember that this program probably spends a lot of time waiting for the network.)

       --background color-or-file
               What to use for the background onto which images are pasted.  This may be a color name, a hexadecimal RGB specification in the form '#rrggbb', or the name of an image file.

       --size WxH
               Normally, the output image will be made to be the size of the screen (or target window).  This lets you specify the desired size.

       --opacity ratio
               How transparently to paste the images together, with 0.0 meaning "completely transparent" and 1.0 meaning "opaque."  Default 0.85.  A value of around  0.3  will  produce  an  interestingly
               blurry image after a while.

       --no-output
               If this option is specified, then no composite output image will be generated.  This is only useful when used in conjunction with --verbose.

       --urls-only
               If this option is specified, then no composite output image will be generated: instead, a list of image URLs will be printed on stdout.

       --imagemap filename-base
               If  this  option is specified, then instead of writing an image to the root window, two files will be created: "base.html" and "base.jpg".  The JPEG will be the collage; the HTML file will
               include that image, and a series of clickable rectangles linking the sub-images to the pages on which they were found, as seen on the web version of WebCollage at  https://www.jwz.org/web‐
               collage/

       --filter command
               Filter all source images through this command.  The command must take a PPM file on stdin, and write a new PPM file to stdout.  One good choice for a filter would be:

                    webcollage -root -filter 'vidwhacker -stdin -stdout'

       --filter2 command
               Filter the composite image through this command.  The -filter option applies to the sub-images; the -filter2 applies to the final, full-screen image.

       --http-proxy host:port
               If you must go through a proxy to connect to the web, you can specify it with this option, or with the $http_proxy or $HTTP_PROXY environment variables.

       --dictionary file
               Webcollage normally looks at the system's default spell-check dictionary to generate words to feed into the search engines.  You can specify an alternate dictionary with this option.

               Note  that  by default, webcollage searches for images using several different methods, not all of which involve dictionary words, so using a "topical" dictionary file will not, in itself,
               be as effective as you might be hoping.

       --directory dir
               Instead of searching the web for images, use the contents of the given directory.

       --fps   Display the current frame rate and CPU load (MacOS only).

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

       XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW
               The window ID to use with --root.

       http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY
               to get the default HTTP proxy host and port.

FILES AND URLS
       /usr/dict/words, /usr/share/lib/dict/words, or /usr/share/dict/words to find the random words to feed into to various search fields, including Google, Bing, Flickr, Imgur and Tumblr.

BOOBIES
       The Internet being what it is, absolutely anything might show up in the collage including -- quite possibly -- pornography, or even nudity.

BUGS
       Animating GIFs are not supported: only the first frame will be used.
