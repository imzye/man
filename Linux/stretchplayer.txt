NAME
       stretchplayer - Audio player with time stretch and pitch shift

SYNOPSIS
       stretchplayer [file]

DESCRIPTION
       StretchPlayer  is  an audio file player that allows you to change the speed of the song without changing the pitch. It will also allow you to transpose the song to another key (while also changing
       the speed). This is a very powerful tool for musicians who are learning to play a pre-recorded song. Its features include:

       •      Time Stretch (50% to 150% of song speed, without changing pitch)

       •      Pitch shift (up or down 1 octave)

       •      A/B repeat

       •      Lots of keyboard accelerators

       The player supports all the audio formats that libsndfile supports, which currently includes OGG/Vorbis, WAV, W64, AIFF, SND, and FLAC. Note that neither libsndfile nor StretchPlayer supports  MP3
       files for patent liability reasons.

BUGS
       StretchPlayer will not work if you have a small buffer size (<= 256 frames).  Bug reports can be sent to gabriel@teuton.org.
