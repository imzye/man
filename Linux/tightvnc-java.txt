NAME
       jtightvncviewer - Command line starter of the Java TightVNC viewer

SYNOPSIS
       jtightvncviewer host | host:display | host::port

DESCRIPTION
       jtightvncviewer  is  a  wrapper  script to start up the Java TightVNC Viewer to do the real work. Depending on the update-alternatives configuration one can invoke this script also as vncviewer or
       xvncviewer.

       When called just with a host name it tries to connect to this host's display 0 / port 5900. To connect to a different display or port append its number to the host name separated by a single colon
       for a display or by two consecutive colons for a port without any blanks in between.

EXAMPLES
       jtightvncviewer somehost.org
              Connect to display 0 (= port 5900) of host somehost.org.

       jtightvncviewer somehost.org:1
              Connect to display 1 (= port 5901) of host somehost.org.

       jtightvncviewer somehost.org::5902
              Connect to port 5902 (= display 2) of host somehost.org.
