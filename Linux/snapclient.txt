NAME
       snapclient - Snapcast client

SYNOPSIS
       snapclient [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Snapcast  is  a  multiroom  client-server  audio player, where all clients are time synchronized with the server to play perfectly synced audio. It's not a standalone player, but an extension that
       turns your existing audio player into a Sonos-like multiroom solution.
       The server's audio input is a named pipe `/tmp/snapfifo`. All data that is fed into this file will be send to the connected clients. One of the most generic ways to use Snapcast is in  conjunction
       with the music player daemon or Mopidy, which can be configured to use a named pipe as audio output.
