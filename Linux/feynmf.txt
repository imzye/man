NAME
       feynmf - Process LaTeX files using FeynMF

SYNOPSIS
       feynmf [-hvqncfT] [-t tfm [-t tfm ...]] [-m mode]
              file [file ...]

       feynmf [--help] [--version] [--quiet] [--noexec] [--clean]
              [--force] [--notfm] [--tfm tfm [--tfm tfm ...]]
              [--mode mode] file [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The most complicated part of using the FeynMF style appears to be the proper invocation of Metafont.  The feynmf script provides a convenient front end and will automagically invoke Metafont with
       the proper mode and magnification.  It will also avoid cluttering system font directories and offers an option to clean them.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Print a short help text.

       -v, --version
           Print the version of feynmf.

       -q, --quiet
           Don't echo the commands being executed.

       -n, --noexec
           Don't execute LaTeX or Metafont.

       -c, --clean
           Offer  to delete font files that have accidentally been placed in a system directory by the MakeTeXTFM and MakeTeXPK scripts (these scripts are run by tex (and latex) in the background).  This
           option has only been tested with recent versions of UNIX TeX.

       -f, --force
           Don't ask any questions.

       -T, --notfm
           Don't try to prepare fake ".tfm" files for the first run.

       -t, --tfm tfm
           Don't try guess the names of the ".tfm" files to fake for the first run and use the given name(s) instead.  This option can be useful if our incomplete parsing of the LaTeX input files fails.

       -m mode, --mode mode
           Select the METAFONT mode mode.  The default is guessed or "localfont" if the guess fails.

       file
           Main LaTeX input files.

       file ...
           Other LaTeX input files that are included by the main file.

BUGS
       The preparation of ".tfm" files is not foolproof yet, because we can parse TeX files only superficially.

       This script has only been tested for recent teTeX distributions of UNIX TeX, though it will probably work with other versions of UNIX TeX.  The author will be grateful for portability suggestions,
       even concerning Borg operating systems, for the benefit of those users that are forced to live with DOS or Windows.
