NAME
       clp - linear program solver

SYNOPSIS
       clp filename [ options ] solutionfile

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the clp command.

       clp -- interface to the coin linear programming solver. clp solves the following linear optimization program:

           minimize      c^t x
           such that:    row_lb <= Ax <= row_ub
                         column_lb <= x <= column_ub

OPTIONS
       When  no  options are given clp enters the interactive command line mode.  Otherwise the program enters a batch mode, for which a summary of options is included below.  For a complete description,
       see /usr/share/doc/coinor-libclp-doc.

       -help  Show summary of options.

       -primalsimplex
              solve the problem using the primal simplex method

       -dualsimplex
              solve the problem using the dual simplex method

       -maximize
              maximize the problem
