NAME
       pfsoutrgbe - Write images or frames in Radiance RGBE format

SYNOPSIS
       pfsoutrgbe [--verbose] [--radiance] [--quiet] (<file> [--frames <range>])  [<file>...]

DESCRIPTION
       Use this command to the incoming pfs frames (piped to standard input) to Radiance RGBE files (with .hdr extension).

       Each file name can contain a %d pattern, which is substituted with frame numbers. The pattern has the same syntax as C printf command. For example, you can use %04d to make the frame number four digit
       with proceedings zeros. You can select the frames using --frames option (see below).

OPTIONS
       --frames <range>
              The range of frames is given in a format similar to matlab or octave:

              startframe:step:endframe

              Frame numbers start with startframe (default 0), are increased by step (default 1) and stop at endframe You can skip one of those values, for example 1:100 for frames 1,2,...,100 and  0:2:  for
              frame 0,2,4,... up to the last file that exists. Note that --frames option must be specified after the file name containing %d string.  higher bit depths.

       --radiance, -r
              Correct stored values so that the luminance is reported the same in pfsview and radiance tools (xview or Photospheare). See IMPORTANT NOTE below.

       --quiet, -q
              Disable warning message about the change in handling absolute values in RGBE files. See IMPORTANT NOTE below.

EXAMPLES
        pfsin memorial.tiff | pfsoutrgbe memorial.hdr
              Converts from one HDR format to another

       pfsin test.jpg | pfsout test.png
              Convert from one image format to another.

SEE ALSO
       pfsout(1) pfsinppm(1)

IMPORTANT NOTE
       There  is  an incompatibility between viewers of RGBE format in terms of absolute luminance values. The ximage viewer from Radiance package expects radiance values in RGBE files and multiplies the re‐
       sulting luminance by the WHITE_EFFICACY constant equal to 179.0f to convert from radiance to luminance.

       To remain compatible with Radiance (xview and Photospheare), pfstools prior to 1.9.0 divided red, green and blue values by 179 on writing and multiplied by that constant on reading RGBE files. This in
       turn  caused incompatibility with other software, such as Photoshop or HDR toolbox. Starting from pfstools 1.9.0 this division / multiplication step was removed to make pfstools compatible in terms of
       absolute values with the majority of the software. The downside is that this change made luminance units) with the pfstools 1.9.0 or later. To avoid any mistakes because of that change, a long warning
       messages is shown each time pfsinrgbe or pfsoutrgbe is called. The message can be suppressed with --quiet option.

       To enable the old functionality and read or write RGBE files with the correction for WHITE_EFFICACY, add --radiance option to the command line.
