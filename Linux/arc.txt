NAME
       marc - archive merger

SYNOPSIS
       marc tgtarc srcarc [ files ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads files from the arc archive srcarc and add them to the arc archive tgtarc.

HISTORY
       Arc  has  been in use in the CP/M and MSDOS world for many years.  Thom Henderson developed the original version, but it is important to note that arc is based on the file compression theories de‐
       veloped by Huffman, Welch, Knott, Knuth, and many other scientists. This implementation is based on version 5.21 of the MSDOS program.

BUGS
       Arc behaves just like the PC version of the program; all functions of the "usage" display are working.  Full compatibility with PC ARC files is maintained, the price for which is that arc  doesn't
       like long filenames, and can only archive files with names of up to 12 characters.  It will *sometimes* do The Right Thing with them, but I suggest you put long-winded filenames in a "shar" before
       arcing them.

       There shouldn't be any problems, (hah!) but if you find any, please send them to me at:
