MEMTEST-SETUP(8)            Memtest86+ User Manual            MEMTEST-SETUP(8)

NAME
       memtest-setup - Install Memtest86+ into your GRUB boot loader menu

SYNOPSIS
       memtest-setup [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       memtest-setup installs Memtest86+ into your GRUB boot loader menu. It
       supports both GRUB 2 and GRUB Legacy (i.e. GRUB 0.9x). In case of
       GRUB 2 it installs GRUB 2 template into /etc/grub.d and GRUB 2 config
       needs to be regenerated manually by running
       grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg under root.  This is not done
       automatically because it could overwrite any custom changes in
       /boot/grub2/grub.cfg.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Shows help.
