NAME
       npth-config - nPth library build utility

VERSION
       GNU nPth 0.91

SYNOPSIS
       npth-config [--help] [--version] [--all] [--prefix] [--exec-prefix] [--bindir] [--libdir] [--includedir] [--mandir] [--datadir] [--acdir] [--cflags] [--ldflags] [--libs]

DESCRIPTION
       The npth-config program is a little helper utility for easy configuring and building applications based on the npth(3) library.  It can be used to query the C compiler and linker flags which are re‐
       quired to correctly compile and link the application against the npth(3) library.

OPTIONS
       npth-config accepts the following options:

       --thread
           Specify thread module to use.

       --prefix
           Prints the installation prefix of architecture independent files

       --exec-prefix
           Prints the installation prefix of architecture dependent files.

       --version
           Prints the version number and date of the installed npth(3) library.  nPth specific.

       --api-version
           Prints the API version of the installed npth(3) library.

       --host
           Prints host triplet.

       --libs
           Prints the library flags ("-l") which are needed to link the application with the npth(3) library. The output is usually added to the "LIBS" variable of the applications "Makefile".

       --cflags
           Prints the C compiler flags which are needed to compile the npth(3)-based application. The output is usually added to the "CFLAGS" variable of the applications "Makefile".

EXAMPLE
        CC      = cc
        CFLAGS  = -O `npth-config --cflags`
        LIBS    = -lm `npth-config --libs`

        all: foo
        foo: foo.o
            $(CC) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
        foo.o: foo.c
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
