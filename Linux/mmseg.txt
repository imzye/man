NAME
       mmseg - maximum matching segment Chinese text.

SYNOPSIS
       mmseg -d dict_file [option]... [corpus_file]...

DESCRIPTION
       mmseg is a tool for segmenting Chinese text into words using maximum matching algorithm. mmseg segments corpus_file, or standard input if no filename is specified, and write the segmented result to
       standard output.

OPTIONS
       -d dict_file
           Use dict_file as lexicon. A default lexicon can be found at /usr/share/sunpinyin-slm/dict.utf8.

       -f,--format (text|bin)
           Output Format, can be 'text' or 'bin'. default 'bin'.  Normally, in text mode, word text are output, while in binary mode, binary short integer of the word-ids are written to stdout.

       -s, --stok STOK_ID
           Sentence token id. Default 10.  It will be written to output in binary mode after every sentence.

       -i, --show-id
           Show Id info. Under text output format mode, attach id after known words.  If under binary mode, print id(s) in text.

       -a, --ambiguious-id AMBI-ID
           Ambiguious means ABC => A BC or AB C. If specified (AMBI-ID != 0), The sequence ABC will not be segmented, in binary mode, the AMBI-ID is written out; in text mode, "<ambi>ABC</ambi>" will be
           output. Default is 0.

NOTES
       Under binary mode, consecutive id of 0 are merged into one 0.  Under text mode, no space are inserted between unknown-words.
