NAME
       Crypt::SSLeay - OpenSSL support for LWP

HEARTBLEED WARNING
       "perl Makefile.PL" will display a warning if it thinks your OpenSSL might be vulnerable to the  Heartbleed Bug <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160>. You can, of course,
       go ahead and install the module, but you should be aware that your system might be exposed to an extremely serious vulnerability. This is just a heuristic based on the version reported by OpenSSL.
       It is entirely possible that your distrbution actually pushed a patched library, so if you have concerns, you should investigate further.

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::SSL;
           use LWP::UserAgent;

           my $ua  = LWP::UserAgent->new(
               ssl_opts => { verify_hostname => 0 },
           );

           my $response = $ua->get('https://www.example.com/');
           print $response->content, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This Perl module provides support for the HTTPS protocol under LWP, to allow an LWP::UserAgent object to perform GET, HEAD, and POST requests over encrypted socket connections. Please see LWP for
       more information on POST requests.

       The "Crypt::SSLeay" package provides "Net::SSL", which, if requested, is loaded by "LWP::Protocol::https" for https requests and provides the necessary SSL glue.

       This distribution also makes following deprecated modules available:

           Crypt::SSLeay::CTX
           Crypt::SSLeay::Conn
           Crypt::SSLeay::X509

DO YOU NEED Crypt::SSLeay?
       Starting with version 6.02 of LWP, "https" support was unbundled into LWP::Protocol::https. This module specifies as one of its prerequisites IO::Socket::SSL which is automatically used by
       LWP::UserAgent unless this preference is overridden separately. "IO::Socket::SSL" is a more complete implementation, and, crucially, it allows hostname verification.  "Crypt::SSLeay" does not
       support this. At this point, "Crypt::SSLeay" is maintained to support existing software that already depends on it.  However, it is possible that your software does not really depend on
       "Crypt::SSLeay", only on the ability of "LWP::UserAgent" class to communicate with sites over SSL/TLS.

       If are using version "LWP" 6.02 or later, and therefore have installed "LWP::Protocol::https" and its dependencies, and do not explicitly "use" "Net::SSL" before loading "LWP::UserAgent", or
       override the default socket class, you are probably using "IO::Socket::SSL" and do not really need "Crypt::SSLeay".

       If you have both "Crypt::SSLeay" and "IO::Socket::SSL" installed, and would like to force "LWP::UserAgent" to use "Crypt::SSLeay", you can use:

           use Net::HTTPS;
           $Net::HTTPS::SSL_SOCKET_CLASS = 'Net::SSL';
           use LWP::UserAgent;

       or

           local $ENV{PERL_NET_HTTPS_SSL_SOCKET_CLASS} = 'Net::SSL';
           use LWP::UserAgent;

       or

           use Net::SSL;
           use LWP::UserAgent;

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Specify SSL Socket Class
           $ENV{PERL_NET_HTTPS_SSL_SOCKET_CLASS} can be used to instruct "LWP::UserAgent" to use "Net::SSL" for HTTPS support rather than "IO::Socket::SSL".

       Proxy Support
               $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY} = 'http://proxy_hostname_or_ip:port';

       Proxy Basic Authentication
               $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY_USERNAME} = 'username';
               $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY_PASSWORD} = 'password';

       SSL diagnostics and Debugging
               $ENV{HTTPS_DEBUG} = 1;

       Default SSL Version
               $ENV{HTTPS_VERSION} = '3';

       Client Certificate Support
               $ENV{HTTPS_CERT_FILE} = 'certs/notacacert.pem';
               $ENV{HTTPS_KEY_FILE}  = 'certs/notacakeynopass.pem';

       CA cert Peer Verification
               $ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE}   = 'certs/ca-bundle.crt';
               $ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR}    = 'certs/';

       Client PKCS12 cert support
               $ENV{HTTPS_PKCS12_FILE}     = 'certs/pkcs12.pkcs12';
               $ENV{HTTPS_PKCS12_PASSWORD} = 'PKCS12_PASSWORD';

INSTALL
   OpenSSL
       You must have OpenSSL installed before compiling this module. You can get the latest OpenSSL package from <https://www.openssl.org/source/>. We no longer support pre-2000 versions of OpenSSL.

       If you are building OpenSSL from source, please follow the directions included in the source package.

   Crypt::SSLeay via Makefile.PL
       "Makefile.PL" accepts the following command line arguments:

       "incpath"
           Path  to  OpenSSL headers. Can also be specified via $ENV{OPENSSL_INCLUDE}.  If the command line argument is provided, it overrides any value specified via the environment variable. Of course,
           you can ignore both the command line argument and the environment variable, and just add the path to your compiler specific environment variable such as "CPATH" or "INCLUDE" etc.

       "libpath"
           Path to OpenSSL libraries. Can also be specified via $ENV{OPENSSL_LIB}.  If the command line argument is provided, it overrides any value specified by the environment variable. Of course,  you
           can ignore both the command line argument and the environment variable and just add the path to your compiler specific environment variable such as "LIBRARY_PATH" or "LIB" etc.

       "live-tests"
           Use  "--live-tests"  to  request  tests  that try to connect to an external web site, and "--no-live_tests" to prevent such tests from running. If you run "Makefile.PL" interactively, and this
           argument is not specified on the command line, you will be prompted for a value.

           Default is false.

       "static"
           Boolean. Default is false. TODO: Does it work?

       "verbose"
           Boolean. Default is false. If you pass "--verbose" on the command line, both "Devel::CheckLib" and "ExtUtils::CBuilder" instances will be configured to echo what they are doing.

       If everything builds OK, but you get failures when during tests, ensure that "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" points to the location where the correct shared libraries are located.

       If you are using a custom OpenSSL build, please keep in mind that "Crypt::SSLeay" must be built using the same compiler and build tools used to build "perl" and OpenSSL. This can  be  more  of  an
       issue  on  Windows.  If  you are using Active State Perl, install the MinGW package distributed by them, and build OpenSSL using that before trying to build this module. If you have built your own
       Perl using Microsoft SDK tools or IDEs, make sure you build OpenSSL using the same tools.

       Depending on your OS, pre-built OpenSSL packages may be available. To get the require headers and import libraries, you may need to install a development version of your operating system's OpenSSL
       library package. The key is that "Crypt::SSLeay" makes calls to the OpenSSL library, and how to do so is specified in the C header files that come with the library.  Some  systems  break  out  the
       header files into a separate package from that of the libraries. Once the program has been built, you don't need the headers any more.

   Crypt::SSLeay
       The latest Crypt::SSLeay can be found at your nearest CPAN mirror, as well as <https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::SSLeay>.

       Once you have downloaded it, "Crypt::SSLeay" installs easily using the standard build process:

           $ perl Makefile.PL
           $ make
           $ make test
           $ make install

       or

           $ cpanm Crypt::SSLeay

       If you have OpenSSL headers and libraries in nonstandard locations, you can use

           $ perl Makefile.PL --incpath=... --libpath=...

       If you would like to use "cpanm" with such custom locations, you can do

           $ OPENSSL_INCLUDE=... OPENSSL_LIB=... cpanm Crypt::SSLeay

       For example, on OS X (Mac) with Homebrew:

           $ brew install openssl
           $ OPENSSL_INCLUDE=$(brew --prefix openssl)/include OPENSSL_LIB=$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib cpanm Crypt::SSLeay

       or, on Windows,

           > set OPENSSL_INCLUDE=...
           > set OPENSSL_LIB=...
           > cpanm Crypt::SSLeay

       If  you  are  on  Windows,  and using a MinGW distribution bundled with ActiveState Perl or Strawberry Perl, you would use "dmake" rather than "make". If you are using Microsoft's build tools, you
       would use "nmake".

       For unattended (batch) installations, to be absolutely certain that Makefile.PL does not prompt for questions on STDIN, set the environment variable "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1" as with any CPAN module
       built using ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

       VMS

       I do not have any experience with VMS. If OpenSSL headers and libraries are not in standard locations searched by your build system by default, please set things up so that they are. If  you  have
       generic instructions on how to do it, please open a ticket on RT with the information so I can add it to this document.

PROXY SUPPORT
       LWP::UserAgent and Crypt::SSLeay have their own versions of proxy support. Please read these sections to see which one is appropriate.

   LWP::UserAgent proxy support
       "LWP::UserAgent"  has  its own methods of proxying which may work for you and is likely to be incompatible with "Crypt::SSLeay" proxy support.  To use "LWP::UserAgent" proxy support, try something
       like:

           my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
           $ua->proxy([qw( https http )], "$proxy_ip:$proxy_port");

       At the time of this writing, libwww v5.6 seems to proxy https requests fine with an Apache mod_proxy server.  It sends a line like:

           GET https://www.example.com HTTP/1.1

       to the proxy server, which is not the "CONNECT" request that some proxies would expect, so this  may  not  work  with  other  proxy  servers  than  mod_proxy.  The  "CONNECT"  method  is  used  by
       "Crypt::SSLeay"'s internal proxy support.

   Crypt::SSLeay proxy support
       For native "Crypt::SSLeay" proxy support of https requests, you need to set the environment variable "HTTPS_PROXY" to your proxy server and port, as in:

           # proxy support
           $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY} = 'http://proxy_hostname_or_ip:port';
           $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY} = '127.0.0.1:8080';

       Use  of  the "HTTPS_PROXY" environment variable in this way is similar to "LWP::UserAgent-"env_proxy()> usage, but calling that method will likely override or break the "Crypt::SSLeay" support, so
       do not mix the two.

       Basic auth credentials to the proxy server can be provided this way:

           # proxy_basic_auth
           $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY_USERNAME} = 'username';
           $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY_PASSWORD} = 'password';

       For an example of LWP scripting with "Crypt::SSLeay" native proxy support, please look at the eg/lwp-ssl-test script in the "Crypt::SSLeay" distribution.

CLIENT CERTIFICATE SUPPORT
       Client certificates are supported. PEM encoded certificate and private key files may be used like this:

           $ENV{HTTPS_CERT_FILE} = 'certs/notacacert.pem';
           $ENV{HTTPS_KEY_FILE}  = 'certs/notacakeynopass.pem';

       You may test your files with the eg/net-ssl-test program, bundled with the distribution, by issuing a command like:

           perl eg/net-ssl-test -cert=certs/notacacert.pem \
               -key=certs/notacakeynopass.pem -d GET $HOST_NAME

       Additionally, if you would like to tell the client where the CA file is, you may set these.

           $ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE} = "some_file";
           $ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR}  = "some_dir";

       Note that, if specified, $ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE} must point to the actual certificate file. That is, $ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR} is *not* the path were $ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE} is located.

       For certificates in $ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR} to be picked up, follow the instructions on <http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html>

       There is no sample CA cert file at this time for testing, but you may configure eg/net-ssl-test to use your CA cert with the -CAfile option.

       (TODO: then what is the ./certs directory in the distribution?)

   Creating a test certificate
       To create simple test certificates with OpenSSL, you may run the following command:

           openssl req -config /usr/local/openssl/openssl.cnf \
               -new -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -x509 \
               -keyout notacakey.pem -out notacacert.pem

       To remove the pass phrase from the key file, run:

           openssl rsa -in notacakey.pem -out notacakeynopass.pem

   PKCS12 support
       The directives for enabling use of PKCS12 certificates is:

           $ENV{HTTPS_PKCS12_FILE}     = 'certs/pkcs12.pkcs12';
           $ENV{HTTPS_PKCS12_PASSWORD} = 'PKCS12_PASSWORD';

       Use of this type of certificate takes precedence over previous certificate settings described.

       (TODO: unclear? Meaning "the presence of this type of certificate"?)

SSL versions
       "Crypt::SSLeay" tries very hard to connect to any SSL web server accommodating servers that are buggy, old or simply not standards-compliant.  To this effect, this module will try SSL  connections
       in this order:

       SSL v23
           should allow v2 and v3 servers to pick their best type

       SSL v3
           best connection type

       SSL v2
           old connection type

       Unfortunately, some servers seem not to handle a reconnect to SSL v3 after a failed connect of SSL v23 is tried, so you may set before using LWP or Net::SSL:

           $ENV{HTTPS_VERSION} = 3;

       to force a version 3 SSL connection first. At this time only a version 2 SSL connection will be tried after this, as the connection attempt order remains unchanged by this setting.
