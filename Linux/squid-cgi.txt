NAME
       cachemgr.cgi - Squid HTTP proxy manager CGI web interface

SYNOPSIS
       http://your.server/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi

DESCRIPTION
       The cache manager ( cachemgr.cgi ) is a CGI utility for displaying statistics about the Squid HTTP proxy process as it runs. The cache manager is a convenient way to manage the cache and view sta‐
       tistics without logging into the server.

CONFIGURATION
       Configuration examples for many common web servers can be found in the Squid FAQ wiki.  https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq

       ./cachemgr.conf
       /etc/squid/cachemgr.conf
              The access configuration file defining which Squid servers may be managed via this cachemgr.cgi program. Each line specifies a server:port followed by an optional description

              The server name may contain shell wildcard characters such as *, [] etc.  A quick selection dropdown menu is automatically constructed from the simple server names.

              Specifying :port is optional. If not specified then the default proxy port is assumed. :* or :any matches any port on the target server.

SECURITY
       cachemgr.cgi  calls the requested server on the requested port using HTTP and returns a formatted version of the response. To avoid abuse it is recommended to configure your web server to restrict
       access to the cachemgr.cgi program.
