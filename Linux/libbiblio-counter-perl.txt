NAME
       counterproc - process a COUNTER report

SYNOPSIS
       counterproc [option...] [file...]

       counterproc -h|--help

       counterproc -V|--version

DESCRIPTION
       counterproc performs common operations on electronic resource reports that conform (more or less) to the COUNTER Codes of Practice, Release 2.  These include report validation, correction of many
       common errors, and extraction of raw usage data.

       The action to take is specified as an option, and the file to process is the sole non-option argument.  Standard input is processed if no file is specified.

       Output includes the (corrected) report, which is printed to standard output, and whatever other output is appropriate for the desired action, which is printed to standard error.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The exit status of counterproc will be 0 if the report is valid, or -1 if the report is not valid.

OPTIONS
       Note: If none of -c, --validate, -A, or --atomize is specified, the report will be processed using Biblio::COUNTER::Processor::Simple, which prints verbose diagnostic information to standard error
       and the (corrected) report to standard output.

       -c, --validate
           Validate the input.

           Biblio::COUNTER::Processor::Validate will be used to check the report, printing a count of errors and warnings to standard error and the (corrected) output to standard output.

       -A, --atomize
           Extract data from the report, producing a single tab-delimited line for each datum.  The data lines are preceded by a single line containing column headers.

           Each line of output has the following elements, which appear in the order listed:

           code
               The short code that indicates the type of the report (e.g., "JR1" or "DB3").

           file
               The name of the file containing the report.  Set to "-" if processing standard input.

           processor
               The <Biblio::COUNTER::Processor::Atomize|Biblio::COUNTER::Processor::Atomize> instance.  (Just ignore this.)

           report
               The instance of the appropriate subclass of <Biblio::COUNTER::Report|Biblio::COUNTER::Report>.  (Ignore this, too.)

           period
               A string of the form YYYY-mm denoting the period in question.

           metric
               The type of event counted ("requests", "sessions", "searches", or "turnaways").

           count
               The count itself.

           platform
               The platform on which the resource was provided.

           title
               The resource title.

           publisher
               The resource's publisher.  May be the empty string.

           print_issn (journal reports only)
               The journal's print ISSN.

           online_issn (journal reports only)
               The journal's online ISSN.

           isbn (book reports only)
               The book's ISBN.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.  The effect of this depends on the action to be taken.

       -h, --help
           Print help information and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print the version number and exit.  If the -v or --verbose option is specified, print out additional information.

       -M, --manual
           View the manual page for counterproc.
