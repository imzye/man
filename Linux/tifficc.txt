EXAMPLES
       To color correct from scanner to sRGB:
            tifficc -iscanner.icm in.tif out.tif

       To convert from monitor1 to monitor2:
            tifficc -imon1.icm -omon2.icm in.tif out.tif

       To make a CMYK separation:
            tifficc -oprinter.icm inrgb.tif outcmyk.tif

       To recover sRGB from a CMYK separation:
            tifficc -iprinter.icm incmyk.tif outrgb.tif

       To convert from CIELab TIFF to sRGB
