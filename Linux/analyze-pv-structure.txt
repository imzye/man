DESCRIPTION
       Analyze PV Structure analyzes photos and videos to help determine how much of a file needs to be read to extract its metadata, embedded thumbnail or render a thumbnail. It is associated with Rapid
       Photo Downloader.

       It uses exiv2 to extract photo metadata,and ExifTool to extract video metadata.

       To work, this program requires that the scanned photos and videos not be in the Linux kernel's disk cache. To ensure this, the program provides option, specified by the command line argument
       '--clear', to instruct the kernel to sync and then drop clean caches, as well as reclaimable slab objects like dentries and inodes. This is a non-destructive operation and will not free any dirty
       objects. See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt

       Specify an outfile if you want to share the analysis of your files with others.

REQUIREMENTS
       To run this program, you need to install vmtouch. Get it at http://hoytech.com/vmtouch/

       To see an optional but helpful progress bar, install pyprind: https://github.com/rasbt/pyprind

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Show help message and exit.

       source
           Directory in which to recursively scan for photos and videos, or a previously saved outfile.

       outfile
           Optional file in which to save the analysis.

       --clear, -c
           Clear the sync and drop clean caches (see note above). The script will prompt for super user permission to execute this.

       -v, --verbose
           Displays program information on the command line as the program runs.

       -l, --load
           Don't scan. Instead use previously generated outfile as input.

       -k, --keep-names
           If saving the analysis to file, don't first remove the file names and paths from the analysis.  Don't specify this option if you want to keep this information private when sharing the analysis
           with others.

       -d, --no-dng
           Don't scan DNG files.

       --video
           Scan videos.

       --only-video
           Scan only videos, ignoring photos.

       -j, --include-jpeg
           Scan jpeg images.

       -J, --only-jpeg
           Scan only jpeg images.

       -e, --show-errors
           Don't show progress bar while scanning, and instead show all errors output by exiv2 (useful if exiv2 crashes, which takes down this  script too).

EXAMPLES
       sudo analyze-pv-structure -c /home/user/Pictures/ pv_analysis

           Analyze photos found in the user's Pictures folder, clear the system caches prior to analysis, and save the analysis in the file pv_analysis without any filename or path information.

       analyze-pv-structure -v pv_analysis

           Output verbose analysis of the previously saved outfile pv_analysis.

       analyze-pv-structure --video /home/user/Videos/

           Analyze videos (and any photos) found in the user's Videos folder.
