NAME
       muplot -  plot a multi-curve figure from multiple data by using Gnuplot

SYNOPSIS
       muplot [OPTION]... [STYLE] [FILE] [AXES] [FILE] [AXES] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Muplot is a simple, non-interactive gnuplot-wrapper to plot a multi-curve figure from multiple data (files). It can produce PostScript, PDF, PNG or JPEG output file formats.

OPTIONS
       --help|-H
              display help

       -h     display short help

       -V     print program version number

       -s     create PostScript-file

       -S     send PostScript output to STDOUT (the same as '-s -o -')

       -q     quiet mode (all messages except errors to be suppressed)

       -F <str>
              input-data field separator (default is a single space character)

       -i     ignore local command file './.muplotset'

       -I <file>
              specify an alternative command file instead of './.muplotset'

       -U     do not sort the file list

       -T <dir>
              use this directory for temporary/working output files

   Styles/Settings:
       lp     lines and points

       l      lines

       p      points

       pp     circle points

       nn     various points (types)

       d      dots

       b      boxes

       g      grid

       nk     do not plot keys (skip file names lables)

       e      errorbars - default used columns are 1:2:3 (x:y:yerror)

       a      fields with arrows; The data file has a special format in this case. Use 'prefield' to prepare such data files.

       dt=<fmt>
              date/time series with the specified format; For example: dt="%H:%M.%S@%H:%M" where the first part, in front of "@", defines the data format, and the second part defines the format that will
              be used for tic labels. Here, hours and minutes are separated by `:', respectively minutes and seconds by `.'  Another example is date and time stamp: dt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

       3d     plot 3-d data using 1:2:3

       u=<fmt>
              user  specified  plot  style format (as defined in Gnuplot); For example: u="points pointtype 2 pointsize 3"; To see the present terminal and palette capabilities of gnuplot use the command
              'muplot -c test'.

       s=<opt>
              user specified setting (as defined in Gnuplot); For example: s="logscale x"

   Axes:
       x:y,x:y-z
              columns in the file defining the x/y-axes of the curve(s); Default are 1:2 or 1:2:3 for data with errors. In case that only one column is provided the default axes are 0:1 - the x-axis will
              be a simple index then.

       File(s) could be a single file name whereas '-' means <stdin>, many files enclosed in '' or "" like "file1 file2 file3", or any valid shell pattern as for example "*.dat".  The  files  '$HOME/.mu‐
       plotset'  and  './.muplotset',  if  existing, will be included at the beginning of the gnuplot script. The command block between "#BEGIN" and "#END" in those files will be pasted to the end of the
       script. If you want that the global '$HOME/.muplotset' is ignored, create in your local directory a file named '.muplotset.noglobal'. In case you want to view the output, define the  env  variable
       MUPLOT_VIEWER and export it, for example:

              MUPLOT_VIEWER="xpdf -z page"; export MUPLOT_VIEWER

       Then  the program will prompt you to view the plot, and after confirmation the viewer will present the graphics. If the postscript file format is chosen ('-s' option), and MUPLOT_VIEWER is not de‐
       fined, the viewer is preset to 'gv', and per default you are prompted to view the output. To disable this behavior use the command "unset MUPLOT_VIEWER".

EXAMPLES
       1) On X-terminal view a multi-curve plot of all data-files with extension 'dat'

              muplot "*.dat"

       2) Print a sinus curve in black-and-white color on a PostScript-printer

              muplot -m -S -c "set title 'Function f(x)=sin(x)'; plot sin(x);" | lpr

       3) Plot data from file "example.dat" using columns 1:2, 3:4, and 3:5 as x/y-axes in the multi-curve plot; a PostScript-file with the name "example.ps" is automatically created.

              muplot -s example.dat 1:2,3:4-5

       4) Create graphics in PDF-format reading data from file "example.1.dat" (columns 1:2), and from file "example.2.dat" (columns 3:4)

              muplot -p lp example.1.dat 1:2 example.2.dat 3:4

       5) View file where the first column is data, and the third and forth columns are date of the form 'yyyy-mm-dd' and time in the form 'hh:mm:ss'

              cat example_counts_per_second.dat | muplot dt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" - 3:1

       6) Plot 3-dimensional data from file "example_3d.dat" using the 1,3, and 5-th data columns with dots-plot-style, enabling grid, setting the xrange to [0:10], disabling keys and defining a plot-ti‐
       tle

              muplot nk g d 3d s="xrange [0:10]" s="title 'This is a 3-d plot'" example_3d.dat 1:3:5

       7) Replot data 1000 times every 5 seconds and write temporary created files in the '/tmp' directory; This scenario is useful in case of growing or otherwise changing over time data-file

              muplot -T /tmp -r 1000:5 example.dat
