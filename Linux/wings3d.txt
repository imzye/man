NAME
       wings3d - Polygon Mesh Modeler

SYNOPSIS
       wings3d [erlang options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the wings3d polygon mesh modeler.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution (based on the program's README file) because the original program
       does not have a manual page.

       Wings3d is a polygon mesh modeler inspired by Nendo and Mirai by Izware.  You can use it to create 3D models of objects, which can then be exported in a variety of formats for compositing or  ren‐
       dering in animation packages.

       The Wings3D home page is at http://www.wings3d.com.
