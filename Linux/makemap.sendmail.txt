MAKEMAP(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 MAKEMAP(8)

NAME
       makemap - create database maps for sendmail

SYNOPSIS
       makemap  [-C  file] [-N] [-c cachesize] [-d] [-D commentchar] [-e] [-f]
       [-l] [-o] [-r] [-s] [-t delim] [-u] [-v] maptype mapnam

DESCRIPTION
       Makemap creates the database maps used by  the  keyed  map  lookups  in
       sendmail(8).   It  reads input from the standard input and outputs them
       to the indicated mapname.

       Depending on how it is compiled, makemap handles up to three  different
       database formats, selected using the maptype parameter.  They may be

       btree  B-Tree format maps.  This requires the new Berkeley DB library.

       hash   Hash format maps.  This also requires the Berkeley DB library.

       In all cases, makemap reads lines from the standard input consisting of
       two words separated by white space.  The first is the database key, the
       second  is the value.  The value may contain ``%n'' strings to indicate
       parameter substitution.  Literal percents should be  doubled  (``%%'').
       Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

       Notice:  do  not  use  makemap  to  create  the  aliases data base, but
       newaliases which puts a special  token  into  the  data  base  that  is
       required by sendmail.

       If the TrustedUser option is set in the sendmail configuration file and
       makemap is invoked as root, the generated files will be  owned  by  the
       specified TrustedUser.

   Flags
       -C     Use the specified sendmail configuration file for looking up the
              TrustedUser option.

       -N     Include the null byte that terminates strings in the map.   This
              must match the -N flag in the sendmail.cf ``K'' line.

       -c     Use the specified hash and B-Tree cache size.

       -D     Use to specify the character to use to indicate a comment (which
              is ignored) instead of the default of '#'.

       -d     Allow duplicate keys in the map.  This is only allowed on B-Tree
              format  maps.  If two identical keys are read, they will both be
              inserted into the map.

       -e     Allow empty value (right hand side).

       -f     Normally all upper case letters in the key are folded  to  lower
              case.   This  flag disables that behaviour.  This is intended to
              mesh with the -f flag in the K line in sendmail.cf.   The  value
              is never case folded.

       -l     List supported map types.

       -o     Append  to  an old file.  This allows you to augment an existing
              file.

       -r     Allow replacement of existing keys.  Normally makemap  complains
              if you repeat a key, and does not do the insert.

       -s     Ignore  safety  checks  on  maps  being  created.  This includes
              checking for hard or symbolic links in world  writable  directo‐
              ries.

       -t     Use  the  specified  delimiter  instead of white space (also for
              dumping a map).

       -u     dump (unmap) the content of the database to standard output.

       -v     Verbosely print what it is doing.
