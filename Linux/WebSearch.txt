NAME
       WebSearch - a web-searching application demonstrating WWW::Search

SYNOPSIS
       WebSearch [-m MaxCount] [-e SearchEngine] [-o option] [-o option...] [-ardvV] query

DESCRIPTION
       This program is provides a command-line interface to web search engines, listing all URLs found for a given query.  This program also provides a simple demonstration of the WWW::Search Perl library
       for web searches.

       The program supports a number of search engines; use WebSearch --list to see which backends are installed.

       A more sophisticated client is AutoSearch which maintains a change list of found objects.

       For examples and hints about searches, see AutoSearch.

OPTIONS
       WebSearch uses Getopt::Long, so you can use double-minus with long option names, or single-minus with one-letter abbreviations.

       --engine e_name, -e e_name
               The string e_name is the name of (the module for) the desired search engine.  Capitalization matters.  See `perldoc WWW::Search` to find out what the default is (probably Null).

               Use --list to get a list of installed backends.

       --gui, -g
               Perform the search to mimic the default browser-based search.  Not implemented for all backends, see the documentation for each backend.

       --list  Prints to STDERR a \n-separated list of installed backends.

       --max max_count, -m max_count
               Specify the maximum number of hits to retrieve.

       --option o_string, -o o_string
               Specify a search-engine option in the form 'key=value' (or just 'key').  Can be repeated for as many options are needed.  Keys can be repeated.

       --count, -c
               As the first line of output, print the approximate hit count.  As the last line of output, print the actual hit count.

       --terse, -t
               Do not print any URLs.  Only useful if you also specify --count.  If you specify --terse but not --count, there will be no output no matter how many hits are found!

       --all, -a
               For each hit result, print all the URLs that the search engine indicated were equivalent to it.  (Some URLs may refer to the same object.)  Can be combined with --verbose; can not be combined
               with --raw.

       --raw, -r
               For each hit result, print the raw HTML.  Not implemented for all backends.

       --verbose, -v
               Verbose mode.  Enumerate the returned URLs and show the description, score, date, etc. for each.

       --VERSION, -V
               Print version information and exit immediately.

       --debug <i>, -d <i>
               Display back-end debugging information (with debug level <i>)

       --host <hostname.sub.domain>
               Set the _host option for the WWW::Search object (backend-dependent).

       --port <i>
               Set the _port option for the WWW::Search object (backend-dependent).

       --username <bbunny>
               Set the username with which to login to the backend.

       --password <c4rr0t5>
               Set the password with which to login to the backend.

       --lwpdebug, -l
               Display low-level libwww-perl debugging information

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The environment variable http_proxy (or HTTP_PROXY) specifies a proxy, if any.
