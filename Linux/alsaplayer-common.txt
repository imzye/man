NAME
       alsaplayer - plays various sound files

SYNOPSIS
       alsaplayer [options] [ filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the alsaplayer command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       alsaplayer is a generic music player that can play back a large amount of file formats.

       If files are specified on the command line, these files are played.  Otherwise alsaplayer plays its playlist from its last run, if any.

FILENAME
       Play the specified file(s). Can be a file or an URL.

       CD.cdda
              Special filename. Play a CD. /dev/cdrom will be used by default. Otherwise, AlsaPlayer will use the device specified in your config file (usually ~/.alsaplayer/config).

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -c, --config <file>
              Use the given config file for this session.

       -h, --help
              Print this help message.

       -i, --interface <interface>
              Use the specified interface instead of the default one.

       -I, --script <file>
              Specify the script to pass to the interface plugin.

       -l, --startvolume <vol>
              Start with this volume [default=1.0].

       -p, --path <path>
              Set the path alsaplayer looks for add-ons.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet operation, no output.

       -s, --session-name name
              Name this session "name"

       -v, --version
              Print version of this program.

       --verbose
              Be verbose about the output.

       --nosave
              Do not save playlist content at exit.

   Player control:
       -n, --session #
              Select session # [default=0]

       -e, --enqueue file(s)
              Enqueue file(s) in a running alsaplayer.

       -E, --replace file(s)
              Clears and queues file(s) in a running alsaplayer.

       --status
              Get some information about the session.

       --volume #
              Set software volume [0.0-1.0].

       --start
              Start playing.

       --stop Stop playing.

       --pause
              Pause/unpause playing.

       --prev Jump to the previous track.

       --next Jump to the next track.

       --seek <second>
              Jump to the specified second in the current track.

       --relative <second>
              Jump <second> seconds from current position.

       --speed <value>
              Set the playback speed with -10 <= <value> <= 10.  1.0 = normal speed, -1.0 = normal speed backwards.  Be aware that alsaplayer respect your LOCALE. That implies that the decimal point will
              vary accordingly. I.e., with french LOCALE, a valid speed value is 1,5 and not 1.5.

       --jump #
              Jump to the specified playlist track.

       --loopsong <on|off>
              Switch file looping on or off [default off].

       --looplist <on|off>
              Switch playlist looping on or off [default off].

       -S, --shuffle
              Shuffle the playlist

       --clear
              Clear the whole playlist

       --quit Quit the session.

   Sound driver options:
       -d, --device string
              Select the specific device for the output plugin.  For the ALSA plugin, the default is "default".  For the JACK plugin, the default is "alsa_pcm:playback_1,alsa_pcm:playback_2".

       -f, --fragsize #
              Set fragment size in bytes [default=4096].

       -F, --frequency #
              Set the output frequency [default=44100].

       -g, --fragcount #
              Fragment count [default=8].

       -r, --realtime
              Enable realtime scheduling.  To use this as a normal user, alsaplayer must be SUID root.

       -o, --output [alsa|esound|jack|nas|null|oss|sgi|sparc]
              Use the specified output driver.

   Experimental options:
       -x,--crossfade
              Crossfade playlist entries.

JACK OUTPUT PLUGIN
       For use with JACK, -F <sample_rate> is mandatory for best results. The value of sample rate must be the same as the one used by jackd.

       If you forget the -F parameter, the sound can be very bad. The only remedy at that time is to restart both jackd and AlsaPlayer.

DAEMON INTERFACE
       With the daemon interface, it is mandatory to add the -s option.  You must process in two steps to get sound with it. First launch the daemon:

       alsaplayer -i daemon -s <name>

       and then add some song:

       alsaplayer -e <some.song>

GTK+ INTERFACE
       The gtk+ interface provide some basic keyboard controls:

       v      Stop

       x      Play

       c      Pause

       b      Next Song

       z      Previous Song

       g      Seek Forward

       a      Seek Backward

       f      Forward Play

       s      Reverse Play

       t      Speed Up one musical semitone. (handy for changing the key the song is played back in)

       q      Speed Down one musical semitone.

       h      Speed Up one comma. (handy to tune the song instead of the guitar when playing at the same time as listening)

       i      Speed Down one comma.

       r      Volume Up

       w      Volume Down

       l      Loop
