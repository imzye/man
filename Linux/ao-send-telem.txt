NAME
       ao-send-telem - Re-transmit stored telemetry file

SYNOPSIS
       ao-send-telem [-T tty-device] [--tty tty-device] [-D altos-device] [--device altos-device] [-F frequency (kHz)] [--frequency frequency (kHz)] [-R] [--realtime] <flight.telem>

OPTIONS
       -T tty-device | --tty tty-device
              This selects which tty device ao-dumplog uses to communicate with the target device.

       -D AltOS-device | --device AltOS-device
              Search for a connected device. This requires an argument of one of the following forms:

              TeleDongle:2
              TeleDongle
              2

              Leaving out the product name will cause the tool to select a suitable product, leaving out the serial number will cause the tool to match one of the available devices.

       -F kHz | --frequency kHz
              This selects which frequency to send the specified packets on.

       -R | --realtime
              This makes the program delay between packets in pad mode. Normally, pad mode packets are sent as quickly as possible.

DESCRIPTION
       ao-send-telem reads the specified flight telemetry log and re-transmits it via the specified ground station device
