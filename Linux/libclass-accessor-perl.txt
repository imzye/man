NAME
       Class::Accessor::Fast - Faster, but less expandable, accessors

SYNOPSIS
         package Foo;
         use base qw(Class::Accessor::Fast);

         # The rest is the same as Class::Accessor but without set() and get().

DESCRIPTION
       This is a faster but less expandable version of Class::Accessor.  Class::Accessor's generated accessors require two method calls to accomplish their task (one for the accessor, another for get()
       or set()).  Class::Accessor::Fast eliminates calling set()/get() and does the access itself, resulting in a somewhat faster accessor.

       The downside is that you can't easily alter the behavior of your accessors, nor can your subclasses.  Of course, should you need this later, you can always swap out Class::Accessor::Fast for
       Class::Accessor.

       Read the documentation for Class::Accessor for more info.
