NAME
       ucommon-config - script to get information about ucommon library

SYNOPSIS
       ucommon-config [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ucommon-config  is  a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use the ucommon library.  Note: ucommon-config
       is provided for compatibility with legacy software only.  Current projects should use pkg-config instead!

OPTIONS
       --version
              Print the currently installed version of ucommon on the standard output.

       --secure
              Print additional libraries needed to link a program with ucommonsecurecrytographiclibrary

       --scripting
              Print additional linker flags needed to link a program with ucommonscriptlibrary

       --includes
              Print the include directory for ucommonheaders

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program with ucommon

       --plugins
              Print the directory for ucommonplugins

       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program with ucommon

       --prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that ucommon was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the  exec
              prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that ucommon was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option must be specified be‐
              fore any --libs or --cflags options.
