NAME
     dhcp6s — DHCPv6 server

SYNOPSIS
     dhcp6s [-c configfile] [-Ddf] [-k ctlkeyfile] [-p ctlport] [-P pid-file] interface

DESCRIPTION
     dhcp6s replies to DHCPv6 client as DHCPv6 server.  dhcp6s can give the following information to clients.
     ·   IPv6 prefixes for the requesting site
     ·   Non-temporary IPv6 addresses
     ·   A list of the DNS server addresses
     ·   DNS Domain Search List
     ·   A list of the NTP server addresses
     ·   A list of the SIP server addresses
     ·   SIP Server domain name
     ·   A list of the NIS server addresses
     ·   NIS domain name
     ·   A list of the NIS+ server addresses
     ·   NIS+ domain name
     ·   A list of the BCMCS server addresses
     ·   BCMCS Server domain name

     Command line options are as below:

     -c configfile
             Use configfile as the configuration file.

     -d      Print debugging messages.

     -D      Even more debugging information is printed.

     -f      Foreground mode (useful when debugging).  Although dhcp6s usually prints warning, debugging, or error messages to syslog(8), it prints the messages to standard error if this option is specified.

     -k ctlkeyfile
             Use ctlkeyfile to store the shared secret to authenticate the communication with dhcp6ctl.  The default file name used when unspecified is /etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6sctlkey.  The default name is
             intentionally same as that for dhcp6ctl so that the server and the control command can share the file when dhcp6ctl controls the server on the same node, which should be the typical case.

     -p ctlport
             Use ctlport as the port number listening on to communicate with dhcp6ctl.

     -P pid-file
             Use pid-file to dump the process ID of dhcp6s.

FILES
     /etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6s.conf  is the default configuration file.
     /var/lib/dhcpv6/dhcp6s_duid   is the default file to store the server's DUID.
     /etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6sctlkey
                                   is the default key file to communicate with the control command.  See dhcp6ctl(8) for the file format.
     /var/run/dhcp6s.pid           is the default file that contains pid of the currently running dhcp6s.

HISTORY
     The dhcp6s command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.

     The -n dnsserv command-line option was obsoleted by introducing a configuration file.

BUGS
     dhcp6s is incomplete and violates DHCPv6 protocol spec, in several aspects.  To name a few:

     1.   it does not assign temporary IPv6 addresses (nor will).
