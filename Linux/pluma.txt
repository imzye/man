NAME
       Pluma - The MATE Text Editor

SYNOPSIS
       pluma [OPTIONS...] [FILES...]

DESCRIPTION
       Pluma  is  the  official text editor of the MATE desktop environment. While aiming at simplicity and ease of use, Pluma is a powerful general purpose text editor. It can be used to create and edit
       all sorts of text files.

       Pluma features a flexible plugin system which can be used to dynamically add new advanced features to Pluma itself.

       This manual page briefly documents the pluma command.
