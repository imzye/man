DESCRIPTION
       keyring provides a way to store, lookup and delete passwords in various backends supported by Python-Keyring.

       Usage example:

       $ keyring set service username
       Password for 'username' in 'service':
       $ keyring get service username
       password

       How the SERVICE and USERNAME parameters are handled depends on the backend, with the default Secret Service backend they are stored as item lookup attributes.
