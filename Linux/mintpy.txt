NAME
       mintpy - The Miami INsar Time-series software in PYthon

DESCRIPTION
       usage: mintpy [-h] [--version]  ...

       Command  line interface for MintPy. The Miami INsar Time-series software in PYthon (MintPy as /mint pai/) is an open-source package for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series
       analysis. It reads the stack of interferograms (coregistered and unwrapped) in ISCE, ARIA, FRInGE, HyP3, GMTSAR, SNAP, GAMMA or ROI_PAC format, and produces three dimensional (2D in space  and  1D
       in time) ground surface displacement in line-of-sight direction.  It includes a routine time series analysis (`smallbaselineApp.py`) and some independent toolbox. This is research code provided to
       you "as is" with NO WARRANTIES OF CORRECTNESS. Use at your own risk.

   options:
       -h, --help
