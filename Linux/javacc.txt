NAME
       javacc — a java compiler compiler

SYNOPSIS
       javacc [option-settings]  [inputfile]

       jjtree [option-settings]  [inputfile]

       jjdoc [inputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the javacc, jjtree and jjdoc commands.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       javacc is a parser generator for use with Java

       jjtree is a tree builder for javacc

       jjdoc is a documentation generator javacc

OPTIONS
       javacc, jjtree or jjdoc without any argument prints a small help with the list of available options.

       "option-settings" is a sequence of settings separated by spaces. Each option setting must be of one of the following forms:

       -optionname=value (e.g. -STATIC=false)

       -optionname:value (e.g. -STATIC:false)

       -optionname       (equivalent to -optionname=true.  e.g., -STATIC)

       -NOoptionname     (equivalent to -optionname=false. e.g., -NOSTATIC)

       Option  settings  are  not case-sensitive, so one can say -nOsTaTiC instead of -NOSTATIC.  Option values must be appropriate for the corresponding option, and must be either an integer or a string
       value.

       For a list of available options, please refer to the command's internal help.

EXAMPLE
       % javacc -STATIC=false -LOOKAHEAD:2 -debug_parser mygrammar.jj

       % jjtree -STATIC=false mygrammar.jjt

       % jjdoc mygrammar.jj
