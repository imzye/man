NAME
       praat_nogui - doing phonetics by compute (no GUI tool)

SYNOPSIS
       praat_nogui [–run] script

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the praat_nogui command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       praat_nogui  is a program for speech analysis and synthesis.  Several speech analysis functionalities are available: spectrograms, cochleograms, and pitch and formant extraction.  Articulatory synthe‐
       sis, as well as synthesis from pitch, formant, and intensity are also available.  Other features are segmentation, labelling using the phonetic alphabet, and computation of statistics.

       This is a non-GUI version of the praat program, intended for running Praat script in batch mode, from the shell command line or called from other shell scripts.

SEE ALSO
       The GUI program praat has an on-line documentation; just launch praat and look at the Help menu entry.

       For further information, see the Praat website (http://www.praat.org).  A good Beginner’s Guide, written by Sidney Wood, is available at https://person2.sol.lu.se/SidneyWood/praate/frames.html
