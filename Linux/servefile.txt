NAME
       servefile - small HTTP-Server for temporary file transfer

SYNOPSIS
       servefile [-h] [--version] [-p PORT] [-u] [-s MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE] [-l]

              [--ssl] [--key KEY] [--cert CERT] [-a user:password] file/directory

DISCLAIMER
       Do not use this as a normal web server. This server is optimized for running a short time and to send files to other people, not for doing high-performance static file serving.

DESCRIPTION
       Servefile is a small HTTP-server intended for temporary file transfer mostly in the local network. It aims to make transferring single files as painless as possible and to replace tar/netcat solu‐
       tions.

       With just a file as argument servefile serves just that one file and redirects all HTTP requests to that file.

       Uploads  can be done with curl, wget (see EXAMPLES) or a normal browser.  In upload mode with -u servefile creates a directory and saves all uploaded files into that directory. When uploading with
       curl or wget the filename is extracted from the path part of the url used for the upload.

       For SSL support pyopenssl (python3-openssl) needs to be installed. If no key and cert is given, servefile will generate a key pair for you and display its fingerprint.

       In --tar mode the given file or directory will be packed on (each) request and piped to the client through the HTTP connection, thus serving always the latest content of the directory and prevent‐
       ing temporary file creaton. Tar files will be created containing only the lowest directory name from the full path, so using /path/to/dir/ as file/directory argument will create a tar file  start‐
       ing with the dir/ directory. When giving a file as argument, only the file without any path will be in the tarfile.  Symlinks will not be dereferenced.

COMMAND SUMMARY
   positional arguments:
       file/directory
              file or directory (with -l or  -u) which should be served or uploaded to

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              Show a help message and exit

       --version
              Show program's version number and exit

       -p PORT, --port PORT
              Port to listen on

       -u, --upload
              Enable uploads to a given directory

       -s MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE, --max-upload-size MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE
              Limit upload size in kB. Size modifiers are allowed, e.g. 2G, 12MB, 1B.

       -l, --list-dir
              Show directory indexes and allow access to all subdirectories

       --ssl  Enable SSL. If no key/cert is specified one will be generated.

       --key KEY
              Key file to use for SSL. If no cert is given with --cert the key file will also be searched for a cert

       --cert CERT
              Certfile to use for SSL

       -a user:password, --auth user:password
              Set user and password for HTTP basic authentication

       --realm REALM
              Set a realm for HTTP basic authentication. This is an arbitrary string which is displayed when doing HTTP basic authentication

       -t, --tar
              Enable on the fly tar creation for given file or directory. Note: Download continuation will not be available.

       -c method, --compression method
              Set compression method, only in combination with --tar. Can be one of none, gzip, bzip2, xz.

       -4, --ipv4-only
              Listen on IPv4 only

       -6, --ipv6-only
              Listen on IPv6 only

EXAMPLES
       Serving a single file with SSL and HTTP Basic auth:

              servefile --ssl --auth foo:bar the_file

       Enabling uploads to a directory:

              servefile -u dir/

       Uploading file foo as bar to servefile via command line:

              curl -X PUT http://ip:port/bar --data-binary @foo
              curl -X POST http://ip:port/bar --data-binary @foo
              wget http://ip:port/bar --post-file=foo

       Serving a on the fly generated tar.gz file of a directory:

              servefile --tar -c gzip path/to/dir
