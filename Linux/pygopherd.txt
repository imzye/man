NAME
       PyGopherd - Multiprotocol Information Server

SYNOPSIS
       pygopherd [ configfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Welcome  to  PyGopherd.   In  a nutshell, PyGopherd is a modern dynamic multi-protocol hierarchical information server with a pluggable modularized extension system, full flexible caching, virtual
       files and folders, and autodetection of file types -- all with support for standardized yet extensible per-document metadata. Whew! Read on for information on this what all these buzzwords mean.

QUICK START
       If you have already installed PyGopherd system-wide, or your administrator has done that for you, your task for setting up PyGopherd for the first time is quite simple.  You just need  to  set  up
       your configuration file, make your folder directory, and run it!

       You  can  quickly  set up your configuration file.  The distribution includes two files of interest: conf/pygopherd.conf and conf/mime.types.  Debian users will find the configuration file pre-in‐
       stalled in /etc/pygopherd/pygopherd.conf and the mime.types file provided by the system already.

       Open up pygopherd.conf in your editor and adjust to suit.  The file is heavily commented and you can refer to it for detailed information.  Some settings to take a look at  include:  detach,  pid‐
       file, port, usechroot, setuid, setgid, and root.  These may or may not work at their defaults for you.  The remaining ones should be fine for a basic setup.

       Invoke PyGopherd with pygopherd path/to/configfile (or /etc/init.d/pygopherd start on Debian).  Place some files in the location specified by the root directive in the config file and you're ready
       to run!

OPTIONS
       All PyGopherd configuratoin is done via the configuration file.  Therefore, the program has only one command-line option:

       configfile
              This option argument specifies the location of the configuration file that PyGopherd is to use.
