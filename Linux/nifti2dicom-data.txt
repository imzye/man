NAME
       qnifti2dicom - Convert 3D medical images to DICOM 2D series (GUI)

DESCRIPTION
       QNifti2Dicom is a conversion tool that converts 3D NIfTI files (and other formats supported by ITK) to DICOM.  Unlike other conversion tools, it can import a
       DICOM file that is used to import the patient and study DICOM tags, and allows you to edit the accession number and other DICOM tags, in order  to  create  a
       valid DICOM that can be imported in a PACS.
