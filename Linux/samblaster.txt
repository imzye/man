NAME
       samblaster: -  post processing on an aligner (eg. bwa mem):

SYNOPSIS
       bwa  mem  <idxbase>  samp.r1.fq  samp.r2.fq | samblaster [-e] [-d samp.disc.sam] [-s samp.split.sam] | samtools view -Sb - > samp.out.bam bwa mem -M <idxbase> samp.r1.fq samp.r2.fq | samblaster -M
       [-e] [-d samp.disc.sam] [-s samp.split.sam] | samtools view -Sb - > samp.out.bam

DESCRIPTION
       Tool to mark duplicates and optionally output split reads and/or discordant pairs.  Input sam file must contain paired end data, contain sequence header and be sorted by read ids.  Output will  be
       all alignments in the same order as input, with duplicates marked with FLAG 0x400.

   For use with a pre-existing bam file to pull split, discordant and/or unmapped reads:
              samtools view -h samp.bam | samblaster [-a] [-e] [-d samp.disc.sam] [-s samp.split.sam] [-u samp.umc.fasta] -o /dev/null

OPTIONS
       Input/Output  Options:  -i --input           FILE Input sam file [stdin].  -o --output          FILE Output sam file for all input alignments [stdout].  -d --discordantFile  FILE Output discordant
       read pairs to this file. [no discordant file output] -s --splitterFile    FILE Output split reads to this file abiding by parameters below. [no splitter file output] -u --unmappedFile    FILE Out‐
       put unmapped/clipped reads as FASTQ to this file abiding by parameters below. [no unmapped file output].

       Requires soft clipping in input file.
              Will output FASTQ if QUAL information available, otherwise FASTA.

       Other Options: -a --acceptDupMarks       Accept duplicate marks already in input file instead of looking for duplicates in the input.  -e --excludeDups          Exclude reads marked as  duplicates
       from discordant, splitter, and/or unmapped file.  -r --removeDups           Remove duplicates reads from all output files. (Implies --excludeDups).

       --addMateTags
              Add MC and MQ tags to all output paired-end SAM lines.

       --ignoreUnmated
              Suppress abort on unmated alignments. Use only when sure input is read-id grouped and alignments have been filtered.

       -M                        Run in compatibility mode; both 0x100 and 0x800 are considered chimeric. Similar to BWA MEM -M option.

       --maxSplitCount
              INT Maximum number of split alignments for a read to be included in splitter file. [2]

       --maxUnmappedBases INT Maximum number of un-aligned bases between two alignments to be included in splitter file. [50]

       --minIndelSize
              INT Minimum structural variant feature size for split alignments to be included in splitter file. [50]

       --minNonOverlap
              INT Minimum non-overlaping base pairs between two alignments for a read to be included in splitter file. [20]

       --minClipSize
              INT Minimum number of bases a mapped read must be clipped to be included in unmapped file. [20]

       -q --quiet                Output fewer statistics.
