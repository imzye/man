NAME
       JPEG Quant Smooth - JPEG artifacts removal

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  tries  to recover the lost precision of DCT coefficients based on a quantization table from a JPEG image. The result is saved as a JPEG image with quantization set to 1 (like a JPEG
       saved at 100% quality).

SYNOPSIS
       jpegqs [options] input.jpg output.jpg

OPTIONS
       -q, --quality n
              Quality setting (0-6, default is 3)/home/rainbow/Desktop/pngtest/jpegrestore/jpegqs.1

       -n, --niter n
              Number of iterations (default is 3)

              * More iterations can make the result look like CG art, can make the photos look unnatural.

       -t, --threads n
              Set the number of CPU threads to use

       -o, --optimize
              Option for libjpeg to produce smaller output file

       -v, --verbose n
              Print libjpeg debug output

       -i, --info n
              Print quantsmooth debug output (default is 15).
              Use the sum of flags:
                     0 - silent
                     1/2/4 - various information
                     8 - processing time
                     16 - SIMD type

              * The processing time includes only the smoothing algorithm, jpeg reading and writing time is not included.

       -p, --cpu n
              Use to lower the SIMD type if CPU detection fails:
                     0 - auto
                     1 - scalar
                     2 - SSE2
                     3 - AVX2
                     4 - AVX512

              * x86 build selects between modes 1-3, x86_64 from 2-4

QUALITY
       The quality setting sets a combination of flags for processing:

       3. default

       4. adds DIAGONALS flag
              smoother diagonal edges, ~1.5 times slower

       5. adds JOINT_YUV flag
              chroma channels will depend from luminance, better color consistency

       6. adds UPSAMPLE_UV flag
              non-blurring chroma upsampling, unlike fancy upsampling from libjpeg

       levels 0-2 is the same as 4-6, but with LOW_QUALITY flag
       ~10 times faster, but the quality is lower
       LOW_QUALITY implies DIAGONALS (always set)
