NAME
       mate-session-save - End or save the current MATE session

SYNOPSIS
       mate-session-save [--logout] [--force-logout] [--logout-dialog] [--shutdown-dialog] [--gui] [--kill [--silent]]

DESCRIPTION
       The mate-session-save program can be used from a MATE session to either end the current MATE session or save a snapshot of the currently running applications (but not both). This session will be later
       restored at your next MATE session.

USAGE
       The --gui option will report errors in dialog boxes instead of printing to stderr.

       If called with the --logout option, the current MATE session will be ended, unless logging out has been inhibited by an application. The --force-logout option can be used to end the session regardless
       of the inhibition state.

       When  the  --logout-dialog  option is given, the standard dialog displaying logout options is displayed. When --shutdown-dialog option is given, the standard dialog displaying shutdown options is dis‐
       played.

       The --kill and --silent options are deprecated. The --kill option is equivalent to the --logout-dialog option. If --silent is used with --kill, then it will behave as if --logout was used.

       The session is not saved when mate-session-save is called with any of the options ending the session.
