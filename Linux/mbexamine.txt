NAME
       mbexamine - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Examine a cyrus-format mailbox

SYNOPSIS
       mbexamine [ -C config-file ] [ -u uid ] mailbox...
       mbexamine [ -C config-file ] [ -s seqnum] mailbox...
       mbexamine [ -C config-file ] -q mailbox...
       mbexamine [ -C config-file ] -c mailbox...

DESCRIPTION
       mbexamine  will  examine  the header, index, and cache files of a cyrus
       format mailbox and dump the information contained therein.  It can also
       limit  its  output to a specific uid or sequence number, through use of
       the -s and -u switches.

       mbexamine reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file
       unless  specified  otherwise  by  -C.  It  uses <configdirectory>/mail‐
       boxes.db to locate the mailbox on disk.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -u uid Dump information for the given uid only.

       -s seqnum
              Dump information for the given sequence number only.

       -q     Compare  the  quota  usage  in cyrus.index to the actual message
              file sizes and report any differences.   If  there  are  differ‐
              ences, the mailbox SHOULD be reconstructed.

       -c     Compare  the  records in cyrus.index to the actual message files
              report any differences.  This can help detect issues if messages
              files were manipulated manually and/or restored incorrectly.

EXAMPLES
       mbexamine user.jsmith
          Examine the mailbox hierarchy rooted at user.jsmith.

       mbexamine -u 00000004 user.jsmith
          Examine the mailbox hierarchy rooted at user.jsmith looking for mes‐
          sages with UID = 00000004.

       mbexamine -q user.jsmith
          Examine the mailbox hierarchy rooted at user.jsmith checking quotas.

       mbexamine -c user.jsmith
          Examine the mailbox hierarchy rooted at user.jsmith comparing  index
          records to the actual message files in the mailbox directory.

FILES
       /etc/imapd.conf, <configdirectory>/mailboxes.db
