NAME
       flexd - flexnet routing daemon backend for URONode.

SYNOPSIS
       routing daemon

DESCRIPTION
       Flexd is a simple flexnet routing daemon back end. The purpose of this daemon is to import pc/FlexNet destinations into URONode for auto-ax25 routing. It's quite normal sometimes for flexd to generate
       an error upon bootup if it can't make a connect to the neighbor flex node in flexd.conf. When it can connect, it will do so automatically.

COMMANDS
       There are no commands for flexd. The runtime parameters are in flexd.conf

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/ax25/flexd.conf
            flexd configuration file.
