NAME
       sympa_msg, sympa_msg.pl - Daemon to handle incoming messages

SYNOPSIS
       "sympa_msg.pl" [ "-d", "--debug" ] [ "-f", "--file"=another.sympa.conf ] [ "-k", "--keepcopy"=directory ] [ "-l", "--lang"=lang ] [ "-m", "--mail" ] [ "-h", "--help" ] [ "-v", "--version" ]

DESCRIPTION
       Sympa_msg.pl is a program which scans permanently the incoming message spool and processes each message.

       Messages bound for the lists and authorized sending are modified as necessity and at last stored into digest spool, archive spool and outgoing spool.  Those bound for command addresses are interpreted
       and appropriate actions are taken.  Those bound for listmasters or list admins are forwarded to them.

OPTIONS
       Sympa_msg.pl follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ("--").  A summary of options is included below.

       "-d", "--debug"
           Enable debug mode.

       "-f", "--config="file
           Force Sympa to use an alternative configuration file instead of /etc/sympa/sympa.conf.

       "-l", "--lang="lang
           Set this option to use a language for Sympa. The corresponding gettext catalog file must be located in $LOCALEDIR directory.

       "--log_level="level
           Sets Sympa log level.

       sympa_msg.pl may run in daemon mode with following options.

       "--foreground"
           The process remains attached to the TTY.

       "-k", "--keepcopy="directory
           This option tells Sympa to keep a copy of every incoming message, instead of deleting them. `directory' is the directory to store messages.

       "-m", "--mail"
           Sympa will log calls to sendmail, including recipients. This option is useful for keeping track of each mail sent (log files may grow faster though).

       "--service="service
           Note: This option was deprecated.

           Process is dedicated to messages distribution ("process_message"), commands ("process_command") or to automatic lists creation ("process_creation", default three of them).

       With following options sympa_msg.pl will print some information and exit.

       "-h", "--help"
           Print this help message.

       "-v", "--version"
           Print the version number.
