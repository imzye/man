NAME
       atf-sh — interpreter for shell-based test programs

SYNOPSIS
       atf-sh [-s shell] script

DESCRIPTION
       atf-sh is an interpreter that runs the test program given in script after loading the atf-sh(3) library.

       atf-sh  is  not  a  real interpreter though: it is just a wrapper around the system-wide shell defined by ATF_SHELL.  atf-sh executes the interpreter, loads the atf-sh(3) library and then runs the
       script.  You must consider atf-sh to be a POSIX shell by default and thus should not use any non-standard extensions.

       The following options are available:

       -s shell     Specifies the shell to use instead of the value provided by ATF_SHELL.

ENVIRONMENT
       ATF_LIBEXECDIR    Overrides the builtin directory where atf-sh is located.  Should not be overridden other than for testing purposes.
       ATF_PKGDATADIR    Overrides the builtin directory where libatf-sh.subr is located.  Should not be overridden other than for testing purposes.
       ATF_SHELL         Path to the system shell to be used in the generated scripts.  Scripts must not rely on this variable being set to select a specific interpreter.

EXAMPLES
       Scripts using atf-sh(3) should start with:

             #! /usr/bin/env atf-sh

       Alternatively, if you want to explicitly choose a shell interpreter, you cannot rely on env(1) to find atf-sh.  Instead, you have to hardcode the path to atf-sh in the script and then use  the  -s
       option afterwards as a single parameter:

             #! /path/to/bin/atf-sh -s/bin/bash
