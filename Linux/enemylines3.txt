NAME
       enemylines3 — a game (shoot'em up)

SYNOPSIS
       enemylines3

DESCRIPTION
       single-player, semi-abstract first person 3d-shooter game.

       Shoot evil robots before they get too close or use your jetpack to escape.  The robos can't jump but they tear down walls.

       Unless started with the '-offline' parameter the game phones home on Gameover. It connects via HTTP to the     hiscore server (link to URL http://score.phk.at/) .

       This manual page documents briefly the enemylines3 command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU       Info format; see below.

       enemylines3 is a OpenGL video game.
