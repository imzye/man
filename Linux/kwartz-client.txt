NAME
       kwartz-cloud - program to make easier for one to enjoy the Cloud service of a Kwartz server

SYNOPSIS

       sudo kwartz-cloud

DESCRIPTION
       kwartz-cloud allows one to access remotely the Kwartz shares, by using the features of its Owncloud service. One just needs to enter a login, accept the server's certificate if it is not
       recognized automatically, and enter the password; then the shares are opened in Nemo (the favorite file browser in Cinnamon).
