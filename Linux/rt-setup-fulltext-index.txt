NAME
       rt-setup-fulltext-index - Create indexes for full text search

DESCRIPTION
       This script creates the appropriate tables, columns, functions, and / or views necessary for full-text searching for your database type.  It will drop any existing indexes in the process.

       Please read docs/full_text_indexing.pod for complete documentation on full-text indexing for your database type.

       If you have a non-standard database administrator user or password, you may use the "--dba" and "--dba-password" parameters to set them explicitly:

           rt-setup-fulltext-index --dba sysdba --dba-password 'secret'

       To test what will happen without running any DDL, pass the "--dryrun" flag.

       The Oracle index determines which content-types it will index at creation time. By default, textual message bodies and textual uploaded attachments (attachments with filenames) are indexed; to ignore
       textual attachments, pass the "--no-attachments" flag when the index is created.
