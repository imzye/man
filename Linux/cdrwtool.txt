DESCRIPTION
       The  cdwrtool  command can perform certain actions on a CD-R, CD-RW, or
       DVD-R device. Mainly these are blanking the media,  formatting  it  for
       use with the packet-cd device,  and applying an UDF filesystem.

       The most common usage is probably the `quick setup' option:

              cdrwtool -d device -q

       which  will blank the disc, format it as one large track, and write the
       UDF filesystem structures.

       Other options get and set various parameters of how the device  is  set
       up,  and  provide  for  different  offsets, modes and settings from the
       defaults.

       The usefulness of most of the options is not explained.

OPTIONS
       Main directives:

       -d device
              Specify the device to use. eg. /dev/sr0

       -i     Print disc track info.

       -g     Print write parameters.

       -u length
              Make a UDF filesystem using length number of blocks.

       -q     `Quick setup': blank the disc, format it as one large track  and
              write a UDF filesystem.

       -m offset
              Format the disc at offset number of blocks.

       -b mode
              Blank the disk using a mode of `full' or `fast'.

       -f filename
              Write file.

       -c track
              Close track.

       -r track
              Reserve track.

       -z length
              Fixed packet length.

       -s     Set  write  parameters  determined by -l, -w, and -p options for
              the disc.

       -v version
              Specify the udf revision to use.  Valid  revisions  are  0x0201,
              0x0200 and 0x0150.  If omitted, mkudffs udf-version is 0x0150.

       -h     Prints a sparse help message.

       Write parameters:

       -t speed
              Set write speed. (Defaults to 12x ?)

       -l type
              Set multi-session field. Either `0' (default), `1', or `3', cor‐
              responding to `No B0 pointer. Next  Session  not  allowed',  `B0
              pointer = FF:FF:FF. Next session not allowed', and `Next session
              allowed. B0 pointer = next possible program area' respectively.

       -w mode
              Set write mode. Either `mode1' or `mode2' (default).

       -p type
              Set packet type. Either `0' or `1' (default),  corresponding  to
              variable and fixed packet sizes respectively.

       -o offset
              Set write offset.

BUGS
       Many  modern  drives refuse on the preparations to format new, blanked,
       or appendable CD-RW media. This causes a message like

              Command failed: 55 ... - sense ...

       The remedy is to use a CD-capable burn program for  writing  a  session
       and  closing  the  medium.  For  example  by  using  any of "cdrecord",
       "wodim", "cdrskin", or "xorriso -as cdrecord" as  content  of  variable
       prog in:

           prog="xorriso -as cdrecord"
           drive="/dev/sr0"
           dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=10 | $prog -v -eject dev="$drive" -
