NAME
       enblend-mask - Wrapper around enblend for managing external masks

Synopsis
         enblend-mask [options] -o OUTPUT INPUTS

DESCRIPTION
       Wrapper around enblend.  Usage is exactly the same as for enblend, except that if files named '<prefix>_mask.tif' exist, they are inserted as alpha masks before blending.

       Some examples of valid image pairs:

         image0000.tif image0000_mask.tif
         foo.jpg foo_mask.tif

       Note masks can be any bit depth, but must have no alpha channel.  Black indicates areas to be ignored, any other colour indicates areas that may be blended.

       Note also that only masks need to be TIFF files, input images can be any filetype supported by ImageMagick.

       Requires enblend and ImageMagick.
