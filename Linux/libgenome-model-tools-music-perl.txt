DESCRIPTION
       The MuSiC suite is a set of tools aimed at discovering the significance of somatic mutations found within a given cohort of cancer samples, and with respect to a variety of external data sources.
       The standard inputs required are:

       1. mapped reads in BAM format
       2. predicted or validated SNVs or indels in mutation annotation format (MAF)
       3. a list of regions of interest (typically the boundaries of coding exons)
       4. any relevant numeric or categorical clinical data.

       The formats for inputs 3. and 4. are:

       3. Regions of Interest File:
           •   Do not use headers

           •   4 columns, which are [chromosome  start-position(1-based)  stop-position(1-based)  gene_name]

       4. Clinical Data Files:
           •   Headers are required

           •   At least 1 sample_id column and 1 attribute column, with the format being [sample_id  clinical_data_attribute  clinical_data_attribute  ...]

           •   The sample_id must match the sample_id listed in the MAF under "Tumor_Sample_Barcode" for relating the mutations of this sample.

           •   The header for each clinical_data_attribute will appear in the output file to denote relationships with the mutation data from the MAF.

       Descriptions for the usage of each tool (each sub-command) can be found separately.

       The play command runs all of the sub-commands serially on a selected input set.
