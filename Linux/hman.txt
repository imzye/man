hman(1)                     General Commands Manual                    hman(1)

NAME
       hman - browse the on-line manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       hman [ -P browser ] [ -H host ] [ section ] name
       hman [ -P browser ] [ -H host ] [ section ] [ index ]

DESCRIPTION
       The hman script is an interface to man2html(1) that allows you to enter
       man page requests at the command line  and  view  the  output  in  your
       favourite  browser.   The  behaviour  reminds of that of man(1) so that
       many people will be able to alias hman to man.  If the browser used  is
       netscape,  and an incarnation of netscape is running already, hman will
       pass the request to the existing browser.

OPTIONS
       -P  browser
              Specify which browser (like lynx, elinks, firefox, or  chromium-
              browser,  ...)   to use.  This option overrides the MANHTMLPAGER
              environment variable.  Otherwise, hman will  use  your  system's
              default browser via xdg-open(1).

       -H  host
              Specify  from what host to get the man pages.  This option over‐
              rides the MANHTMLHOST  environment  variable.   The  default  is
              localhost.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANHTMLPAGER
              The  default  browser  to use is selected using this environment
              variable.

       MANHTMLHOST
              The default host to use is selected using this environment vari‐
              able.
