DESCRIPTION
       QGIS  is a cross platform, Free and Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS). Supported platforms include Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. QGIS supports vector, raster, and data‐
       base formats. QGIS is licensed under the GNU General Public License.

       Some of the major features include:

       *Support for spatially enabled PostGIS tables
       *Support for shapefiles, ArcInfo coverages, Mapinfo, and other formats
         supported by OGR
       *Raster support for a large number of formats
       *Identify features
       *Display attribute tables
       *Select features
       *GRASS Digitizing
       *Feature labeling

OPTIONS
       --snapshot filename
              Create a snapshot image from the specified layers and save it to filename. The snapshot is saved in PNG format.

       --lang language
              Set the language used by QGIS. Language is specified using the locale string that matches one of the translations supported by QGIS. For example, to  use  the  German  translation,  specify
              --lang de

       --project filename
              Load the specified QGIS project file. The layers specified in the project file are loaded, the layers are symbolized, and the view extent is restored.

       --extent xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax
              Set initial map extent by passing coordinates of that rectangle.

       --width width
              Width of snapshot to emit

       --height height
              Height of snapshot to emit

       --nologo
              Hide splash screen

       --noplugins
              Don't restore plugins on startup. Useful if some third-party plugins make QGIS crash during startup.

       --optionspath path
              Use the given QSettings path

       --configpath path
              Use the given path for all user configuration

       --help
              Display brief usage help.

       file...
              A  list  of  one or more files to be loaded into QGIS at startup. Files must consist of a data format supported by QGIS and only disk-based formats can be loaded using this method. This in‐
              cludes shapefiles, MapInfo files, and most raster formats. Data stores that cannot be loaded in this way include PostGIS layers in a PostgreSQL database and GRASS vector/raster data.

FILES
       ~/.config/QGIS/qgis.conf
              QGIS preferences file. This file stores windows size/location, loaded plugins, user options, and other application settings.

BUGS
       See the QGIS home page (http://qgis.org) for a list of known issues with the latest release.
