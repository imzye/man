NAME
       evQueue - evQueue core engine

SYNOPSIS
       evqueue [ OPTIONS ]

DESCRIPTION
       evQueue is the core engine daemon. It must be running if you want to launch tasks and workflows.

       An IPC queue is used for communication between tasks monitors and evQueue daemon. This is used to allow daemon restarting while tasks are running (as IPC queue is persistent). Missed messages
       will be processed after restart. So it is safe to restart the engine while workflows are running.

OPTIONS
       --config configfile
              Load configuration from file configfile.

       --daemon
              Run in background.

       --ipcq-remove
              Remove  the  IPC  queue.  This will erase all persistent state of processes termination. In general you should never use this option unless the IPC queue has become corrupted. This can
              happen after an upgrade to an incompatible version when messages are pending in queue.

       --ipcq-stats
              Display information about IPC queue.

       --ipc-terminate-tid tid
              Send IPC message to notify evQueue that the task identified by tid is terminated. The return code -1 is sent (error status). This can be used if a task is stuck (task is terminated but
              message from monitor to daemon has been lost). This can happen when multiple daemons are launched with the same queue ID and the wrong daemon gets notified.

       --version
              Display version information and build date.
