NAME
       libabigail - Library to analyze and compare ELF ABIs

OVERVIEW OF THE ABIGAIL FRAMEWORK
       ABIGAIL stands for the Application Binary Interface Generic Analysis and Instrumentation Library.

       It’s  a  framework  which aims at helping developers and software distributors to spot some ABI-related issues like interface incompatibility in ELF shared libraries by performing a static analysis of
       the ELF binaries at hand.

       The type of interface incompatibilities that Abigail focuses on is related to changes on the exported ELF functions and variables symbols, as well as layout and size changes of data types of the func‐
       tions and variables exported by shared libraries.

       In other words, if the return type of a function exported by a shared library changes in an incompatible way from one version of a given shared library to another, we want Abigail to help people catch
       that.

       In more concrete terms, the Abigail framwork provides a shared library named libabigail which exposes an API to parse a shared library in ELF format (accompanied with its associated debug  information
       in  DWARF format) build an internal representation of all the functions and variables it exports, along with their types.  Libabigail also builds an internal representation of the ELF symbols of these
       functions and variables.  That information about these exported functions and variables is roughly what we consider as being the ABI of the shared library, at least, in the scope of Libabigail.

       Aside of this internal representation, libabigail provides facilities to perform deep comparisons of two ABIs.  That is, it can compare the types of two sets of functions or variables  and  represents
       the result in a way that allows it to emit textual reports about the differences.

       This  allows  us to write tools like abidiff that can compare the ABI of two shared libraries and represent the result in a meaningful enough way to help us spot ABI incompatibilities.  There are sev‐
       eral other tools that are built using the Abigail framwork.

TOOLS
   Overview
       The upstream code repository of Libabigail contains several tools written using the library.  They are maintained and released as part of the project.  All tools come with a bash-completion script.

   Tools manuals
   abidiff
       abidiff compares the Application Binary Interfaces (ABI) of two shared libraries in ELF format.  It emits a meaningful report describing the differences between the two ABIs.

       This tool can also compare the textual representations of the ABI of two ELF binaries (as emitted by abidw) or an ELF binary against a textual representation of another ELF binary.

       For a comprehensive ABI change report that includes changes about function and variable sub-types, the two input shared libraries must be accompanied with their  debug  information  in  DWARF  format.
       Otherwise, only ELF symbols that were added or removed are reported.

   Invocation
          abidiff [options] <first-shared-library> <second-shared-library>

   Environment
       abidiff loads two default suppression specifications files, merges their content and use it to filter out ABI change reports that might be considered as false positives to users.

       · Default system-wide suppression specification file

         It’s  located  by  the  optional  environment  variable  LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_SUPPRESSION_FILE.   If  that environment variable is not set, then abidiff tries to load the suppression file $lib‐
         dir/libabigail/libabigail-default.abignore.  If that file is not present, then no default system-wide suppression specification file is loaded.

       · Default user suppression specification file.

         It’s located by the optional environment LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_USER_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment variable is not set, then abidiff tries to load the suppression file $HOME/.abignore.  If that
         file is not present, then no default user suppression specification is loaded.

   Options
          · --help | -h

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · --debug

            In this mode, error messages are emitted for types which fail type canonicalization.

            This is an optional ebugging and sanity check option.  To enable it the libabigail package needs to be configured with the –enable-debug-self-comparison option.

          · --version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --debug-info-dir1 | --d1 <di-path1>

            For cases where the debug information for first-shared-library is split out into a separate file, tells abidiff where to find that separate debug information file.

            Note  that  di-path  must  point  to  the  root  directory  under  which  the  debug  information  is  arranged  in  a  tree-like  manner.   Under Red Hat based systems, that directory is usually
            <root>/usr/lib/debug.

            This option can be provided several times with different root directories.  In that case, abidiff will potentially look into  all  those  root  directories  to  find  the  split  debug  info  for
            first-shared-library.

            Note also that this option is not mandatory for split debug information installed by your system’s package manager because then abidiff knows where to find it.

          · --debug-info-dir2 | --d2 <di-path2>

            Like --debug-info-dir1, this options tells abidiff where to find the split debug information for the second-shared-library file.

            This  option  can  be  provided  several  times with different root directories.  In that case, abidiff will potentially look into all those root directories to find the split debug info for sec‐
            ond-shared-library.

          · --headers-dir1 | --hd1 <headers-directory-path-1>

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the first shared library (or binary in general) that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter out ABI  changes  on  types  that  are  not
            defined in public headers.

            Note that several public header directories can be specified for the first shared library.  In that case the --headers-dir1 option should be present several times on the command line, like in the
            following example:

                $ abidiff --headers-dir1 /some/path       \
                          --headers-dir1 /some/other/path \
                          binary-version-1 binary-version-2

          · --header-file1 | --hf1 <header-file-path-1>

            Specifies where to find one public header of the first shared library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter out ABI changes on types that are not defined in public headers.

          · --headers-dir2 | --hd2 <headers-directory-path-1>

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the second shared library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter out ABI changes on types that are not defined in public headers.

            Note that several public header directories can be specified for the second shared library.  In that case the --headers-dir2 option should be present several times like in the following example:

                $ abidiff --headers-dir2 /some/path       \
                          --headers-dir2 /some/other/path \
                          binary-version-1 binary-version-2

          · --header-file2 | --hf2 <header-file-path-2>

            Specifies where to find one public header of the second shared library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter out ABI changes on types that are not defined in public headers.

          · --no-linux-kernel-mode

            Without this option, if abidiff detects that the binaries it is looking at are Linux Kernel binaries (either vmlinux or modules) then it only considers functions and variables which  ELF  symbols
            are listed in the __ksymtab and __ksymtab_gpl sections.

            With this option, abidiff considers the binary as a non-special ELF binary.  It thus considers functions and variables which are defined and exported in the ELF sense.

          · --kmi-whitelist | -kaw <path-to-whitelist>

            When  analyzing  a  Linux kernel binary, this option points to the white list of names of ELF symbols of functions and variables which ABI must be considered.  That white list is called a “Kernel
            Module Interface white list”.  This is because for the Kernel, we don’t talk about ABI; we rather talk about the interface between the Kernel and its module. Hence the term KMI rather than ABI.

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present in that white list will not be considered by this tool.

            If this option is not provided – thus if no white list is provided – then the entire KMI, that is, the set of all publicly defined and exported functions and global variables by the Linux  Kernel
            binaries, is considered.

          · --drop-private-types

            This  option  is  to be used with the --headers-dir1, header-file1, header-file2 and --headers-dir2 options.  With this option, types that are NOT defined in the headers are entirely dropped from
            the internal representation build by Libabigail to represent the ABI.  They thus don’t have to be filtered out from the final ABI change report because they are not even present  in  Libabigail’s
            representation.

            Without this option however, those private types are kept in the internal representation and later filtered out from the report.

            This  options  thus  potentially  makes Libabigail consume less memory.  It’s meant to be mainly used to optimize the memory consumption of the tool on binaries with a lot of publicly defined and
            exported types.

          · --stat

            Rather than displaying the detailed ABI differences between first-shared-library and second-shared-library, just display some summary statistics about these differences.

          · --symtabs

            Only display the symbol tables of the first-shared-library and second-shared-library.

          · --deleted-fns

            In the resulting report about the differences between first-shared-library and second-shared-library, only display the globally defined functions that got deleted from first-shared-library.

          · --changed-fns

            In the  resulting  report  about  the  differences  between  first-shared-library  and  second-shared-library,  only  display  the  changes  in  sub-types  of  the  global  functions  defined  in
            first-shared-library.

          · --added-fns

            In the resulting report about the differences between first-shared-library and second-shared-library, only display the globally defined functions that were added to second-shared-library.

          · --deleted-vars

            In the resulting report about the differences between first-shared-library and second-shared-library, only display the globally defined variables that were deleted from first-shared-library.

          · --changed-vars

            In  the  resulting  report  about  the  differences  between  first-shared-library  and  second-shared-library,  only  display  the  changes  in  the  sub-types of the global variables defined in
            first-shared-library

          · --added-vars

            In the resulting report about the differences between first-shared-library and second-shared-library, only display the global variables that were added (defined) to second-shared-library.

          · --non-reachable-types|-t

            Analyze and emit change reports for all the types of the binary, including those that are not reachable from global functions and variables.

            This option might incur some serious performance degradation as the number of types analyzed can be huge.  However, if paired with the  --headers-dir{1,2}  and/or  header-file{1,2}  options,  the
            additional non-reachable types analyzed are restricted to those defined in public headers files, thus hopefully making the performance hit acceptable.

            Also,  using this option alongside suppression specifications (by also using the --suppressions option) might help keep the number of analyzed types (and the potential performance degradation) in
            control.

            Note that without this option, only types that are reachable from global functions and variables are analyzed, so the tool detects and reports changes on these reachable types only.

          · --no-added-syms

            In the resulting report about the differences between first-shared-library and second-shared-library, do not display added functions or variables.  Do not display added functions or variables ELF
            symbols either.  All other kinds of changes are displayed unless they are explicitely forbidden by other options on the command line.

          · --no-linkage-name

            In the resulting report, do not display the linkage names of the added, removed, or changed functions or variables.

          · --no-show-locs
              Do not show information about where in the second shared library the respective type was changed.

          · --show-bytes

            Show sizes and offsets in bytes, not bits.  By default, sizes and offsets are shown in bits.

          · --show-bits

            Show sizes and offsets in bits, not bytes.  This option is activated by default.

          · --show-hex

            Show sizes and offsets in hexadecimal base.

          · --show-dec

            Show sizes and offsets in decimal base.  This option is activated by default.

          · --no-show-relative-offset-changes

            Without this option, when the offset of a data member changes, the change report not only mentions the older and newer offset, but it also mentions by how many bits the data member changes.  With
            this option, the latter is not shown.

          · --no-unreferenced-symbols

            In the resulting report, do not display change information about function and variable symbols that are not referenced by any debug information.  Note that for these symbols not referenced by any
            debug information, the change information displayed is either added or removed symbols.

          · --no-default-suppression

            Do not load the default suppression specification files.

          · --suppressions | --suppr <path-to-suppressions>

            Use a suppression specification file located at path-to-suppressions.  Note that this option can appear multiple times on the command line.  In that case, all of the provided suppression specifi‐
            cation files are taken into account.

            Please note that, by default, if this option is not provided, then the default suppression specification files are loaded .

          · --drop <regex>

            When reading the first-shared-library and second-shared-library ELF input files, drop the globally defined functions and variables which name match the regular expression regex.  As a result,  no
            change involving these functions or variables will be emitted in the diff report.

          · --drop-fn <regex>

            When reading the first-shared-library and second-shared-library ELF input files, drop the globally defined functions which name match the regular expression regex.  As a result, no change involv‐
            ing these functions will be emitted in the diff report.

          · --drop-var <regex>

            When reading the first-shared-library and second-shared-library ELF input files, drop the globally defined variables matching a the regular expression regex.

          · --keep <regex>

            When reading the first-shared-library and second-shared-library ELF input files, keep the globally defined functions and variables which names match the regular expression regex.  All other func‐
            tions and variables are dropped on the floor and will thus not appear in the resulting diff report.

          · --keep-fn <regex>

            When  reading  the  first-shared-library  and  second-shared-library  ELF  input files, keep the globally defined functions which name match the regular expression regex.  All other functions are
            dropped on the floor and will thus not appear in the resulting diff report.

          · --keep-var <regex>

            When reading the first-shared-library and second-shared-library ELF input files, keep the globally defined which names match the regular expression regex.  All other variables are dropped on  the
            floor and will thus not appear in the resulting diff report.

          · --harmless

            In  the  diff report, display only the harmless changes.  By default, the harmless changes are filtered out of the diff report keep the clutter to a minimum and have a greater chance to spot real
            ABI issues.

          · --no-harmful

            In the diff report, do not display the harmful changes.  By default, only the harmful changes are displayed in diff report.

          · --redundant

            In the diff report, do display redundant changes.  A redundant change is a change that has been displayed elsewhere in the report.

          · --no-redundant

            In the diff report, do NOT display redundant changes.  A redundant change is a change that has been displayed elsewhere in the report.  This option is switched on by default.

          · --no-architecture

            Do not take architecture in account when comparing ABIs.

          · --no-corpus-path

            Do not emit the path attribute for the ABI corpus.

          · --fail-no-debug-info

            If no debug info was found, then this option makes the program to fail.  Otherwise, without this option, the program will attempt to compare properties of the binaries that  are  not  related  to
            debug info, like pure ELF properties.

          · --leaf-changes-only|-l only show leaf changes, so don’t show impact analysis report.  This option implies --redundant.

            The typical output of abidiff when comparing two binaries looks like this

                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function
                Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

                1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

                  [C]'function void fn(C&)' at test-v1.cc:13:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:
                    parameter 1 of type 'C&' has sub-type changes:
                      in referenced type 'struct C' at test-v1.cc:7:1:
                        type size hasn't changed
                        1 data member change:
                         type of 'leaf* C::m0' changed:
                           in pointed to type 'struct leaf' at test-v1.cc:1:1:
                             type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                             1 data member insertion:
                               'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                $

            So  in  that  example the report emits information about how the data member insertion change of “struct leaf” is reachable from function “void fn(C&)”.  In other words, the report not only shows
            the data member change on “struct leaf”, but it also shows the impact of that change on the function “void fn(C&)”.

            In abidiff parlance, the change on “struct leaf” is called a leaf change.  So the --leaf-changes-only --impacted-interfaces options show, well, only the leaf change.  And it goes like this:

                $ abidiff -l libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                'struct leaf' changed:
                  type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                  1 data member insertion:
                    'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                  one impacted interface:
                    function void fn(C&)
                $

            Note how the report ends by showing the list of interfaces impacted by the leaf change.

            Now if you don’t want to see that list of impacted interfaces, then you can just avoid using the --impacted-interface option.  You can learn about that option below, in any case.

          · --impacted-interfaces

            When showing leaf changes, this option instructs abidiff to show the list of impacted interfaces.  This option is thus to be used in  addition  the  --leaf-changes-only  option,  otherwise,  it’s
            ignored.

          · --dump-diff-tree
              After  the  diff  report, emit a textual representation of the diff nodes tree used by the comparison engine to represent the changed functions and variables.  That representation is emitted to
              the error output for debugging purposes.  Note that this diff tree is relevant only to functions and variables that have some sub-type changes.  Added or removed functions and variables do  not
              have any diff nodes tree associated to them.

          · --stats

            Emit statistics about various internal things.

          · --verbose

            Emit verbose logs about the progress of miscellaneous internal things.

   Return values
       The exit code of the abidiff command is either 0 if the ABI of the binaries being compared are equal, or non-zero if they differ or if the tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the exit code is a 8-bits-wide bit field in which each bit has a specific meaning.

       The first bit, of value 1, named ABIDIFF_ERROR means there was an error.

       The  second  bit, of value 2, named ABIDIFF_USAGE_ERROR means there was an error in the way the user invoked the tool.  It might be set, for instance, if the user invoked the tool with an unknown com‐
       mand line switch, with a wrong number or argument, etc.  If this bit is set, then the ABIDIFF_ERROR bit must be set as well.

       The third bit, of value 4, named ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE means the ABI of the binaries being compared are different.

       The fourth bit, of value 8, named ABIDIFF_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE means the ABI of the binaries compared are different in an incompatible way.  If this bit is set, then the ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE bit must
       be  set  as  well.  If the ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE is set and the ABIDIFF_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE is NOT set, then it means that the ABIs being compared might or might not be compatible.  In that case, a human
       being needs to review the ABI changes to decide if they are compatible or not.

       Note that, at the moment, there are only a few kinds of ABI changes that would result in setting the flag ABIDIFF_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE.  Those ABI changes are either:

          · the removal of the symbol of a function or variable that has been defined and exported.

          · the modification of the index of a member of a virtual function table (for C++ programs and libraries).

       With time, when more ABI change patterns are found to always constitute incompatible ABI changes, we will adapt the code to recognize those cases and set  the  ABIDIFF_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE  accord‐
       ingly.  So, if you find such patterns, please let us know.

       The remaining bits are not used for the moment.

   Usage examples
          1. Detecting a change in a sub-type of a function:

                 $ cat -n test-v0.cc
                          1      // Compile this with:
                          2      //   g++ -g -Wall -shared -o libtest-v0.so test-v0.cc
                          3
                          4      struct S0
                          5      {
                          6        int m0;

   abipkgdiff
       abipkgdiff compares the Application Binary Interfaces (ABI) of the ELF binaries contained in two software packages.  The software package formats currently supported are Deb, RPM, tar archives (either
       compressed or not) and plain directories that contain binaries.

       For a comprehensive ABI change report that includes changes about function and variable sub-types, the two input packages must be accompanied with their debug information packages that  contain  debug
       information in DWARF format.

   Invocation
          abipkgdiff [option] <package1> <package2>

       package1 and package2 are the packages that contain the binaries to be compared.

   Environment
       abipkgdiff loads two default suppression specifications files, merges their content and use it to filter out ABI change reports that might be considered as false positives to users.

       · Default system-wide suppression specification file

         It’s  located  by  the  optional  environment  variable LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment variable is not set, then abipkgdiff tries to load the suppression file $lib‐
         dir/libabigail/libabigail-default.abignore.  If that file is not present, then no default system-wide suppression specification file is loaded.

       · Default user suppression specification file.

         It’s located by the optional environment LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_USER_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment variable is not set, then abipkgdiff tries to load the suppression file  $HOME/.abignore.   If
         that file is not present, then no default user suppression specification is loaded.

       In  addition  to  those default suppression specification files, abipkgdiff will also look inside the packages being compared and if it sees a file that ends with the extension .abignore, then it will
       consider it as a suppression specification and it will combine it to the default suppression specification that might be already loaded.

       The user might as well use the --suppressions option (that is documented further below) to provide a suppression specification.

   Options
          · --help | -h

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · –version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --debug-info-pkg1 | --d1 <path>

            For cases where the debug information for package1 is split out into a separate file, tells abipkgdiff where to find that separate debug information package.

            Note that the debug info for package1 can have been split into several different debug info packages.  In that case, several instances of this options can be provided, along  with  those  several
            different debug info packages.

          · --debug-info-pkg2 | --d2 <path>

            For cases where the debug information for package2 is split out into a separate file, tells abipkgdiff where to find that separate debug information package.

            Note  that  the  debug info for package2 can have been split into several different debug info packages.  In that case, several instances of this options can be provided, along with those several
            different debug info packages.

          · --devel-pkg1 | --devel1 <path>

            Specifies where to find the Development Package associated with the first package to be compared.  That Development Package at path should at least contain header  files  in  which  public  types
            exposed  by  the  libraries (of the first package to be compared) are defined.  When this option is provided, the tool filters out reports about ABI changes to types that are NOT defined in these
            header files.

          · --devel-pkg2 | --devel2 <path>

            Specifies where to find the Development Package associated with the second package to be compared.  That Development Package at path should at least contains header files in  which  public  types
            exposed  by  the libraries (of the second package to be compared) are defined.  When this option is provided, the tool filters out reports about ABI changes to types that are NOT defined in these
            header files.

          · --drop-private-types

            This option is to be used with the --devel-pkg1 and --devel-pkg2 options.  With this option, types that are NOT defined in the headers are entirely dropped from the internal representation  build
            by Libabigail to represent the ABI.  They thus don’t have to be filtered out from the final ABI change report because they are not even present in Libabigail’s representation.

            Without this option however, those private types are kept in the internal representation and later filtered out from the report.

            This  options  thus  potentially  makes Libabigail consume less memory.  It’s meant to be mainly used to optimize the memory consumption of the tool on binaries with a lot of publicly defined and
            exported types.

          · --dso-only

            Compare ELF files that are shared libraries, only.  Do not compare executable files, for instance.

          · --private-dso

            By default, abipkgdiff does not compare DSOs that are private to the RPM package.  A private DSO is a DSO which SONAME is NOT advertised in the “provides” property of the RPM.

            This option instructs abipkgdiff to also compare DSOs that are NOT advertised in the “provides” property of the RPM.

            Please note that the fact that (by default) abipkgdiff skips private DSO is a feature that is available only for RPMs, at the moment.  We would happily accept  patches  adding  that  feature  for
            other package formats.

          · --leaf-changes-only|-l only show leaf changes, so don’t show impact analysis report.  This option implies --redundant

            The typical output of abipkgdiff and abidiff when comparing two binaries, that we shall call full impact report, looks like this

                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function
                Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

                1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

                  [C]'function void fn(C&)' at test-v1.cc:13:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:
                    parameter 1 of type 'C&' has sub-type changes:
                      in referenced type 'struct C' at test-v1.cc:7:1:
                        type size hasn't changed
                        1 data member change:
                         type of 'leaf* C::m0' changed:
                           in pointed to type 'struct leaf' at test-v1.cc:1:1:
                             type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                             1 data member insertion:
                               'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                $

            So  in  that  example the report emits information about how the data member insertion change of “struct leaf” is reachable from function “void fn(C&)”.  In other words, the report not only shows
            the data member change on “struct leaf”, but it also shows the impact of that change on the function “void fn(C&)”.

            In abidiff (and abipkgdiff) parlance, the change on “struct leaf” is called a leaf change.  So the --leaf-changes-only --impacted-interfaces options show, well, only the leaf change.  And it goes
            like this:

                $ abidiff -l libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so
                'struct leaf' changed:
                  type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                  1 data member insertion:
                    'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1

                  one impacted interface:
                    function void fn(C&)
                $

            Note how the report ends up by showing the list of interfaces impacted by the leaf change.  That’s the effect of the additional --impacted-interfaces option.

            Now if you don’t want to see that list of impacted interfaces, then you can just avoid using the --impacted-interface option.  You can learn about that option below, in any case.

            Please  note  that  when  comparing  two  Linux Kernel packages, it’s this leaf changes report that is emitted, by default.  The normal so-called full impact report can be emitted with the option
            --full-impact which is documented later below.

          · --impacted-interfaces

            When showing leaf changes, this option instructs abipkgdiff to show the list of impacted interfaces.  This option is thus to be used in addition to the --leaf-changes-only option, or,  when  com‐
            paring two Linux Kernel packages.  Otherwise, it’s simply ignored.

          · --full-impact|-f

            When comparing two Linux Kernel packages, this function instructs abipkgdiff to emit the so-called full impact report, which is the default report kind emitted by the abidiff tool:

                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so

          · --non-reachable-types|-t

            Analyze and emit change reports for all the types of the binary, including those that are not reachable from global functions and variables.

            This option might incur some serious performance degradation as the number of types analyzed can be huge.  However, if paired with the --devel-pkg{1,2} options, the additional non-reachable types
            analyzed are restricted to those defined in the public headers files carried by the referenced development packages, thus hopefully making the performance hit acceptable.

            Also, using this option alongside suppression specifications (by also using the --suppressions option) might help keep the number of analyzed types (and the potential performance degradation)  in
            control.

            Note that without this option, only types that are reachable from global functions and variables are analyzed, so the tool detects and reports changes on these reachable types only.

          · --redundant
              In the diff reports, do display redundant changes.  A redundant change is a change that has been displayed elsewhere in a given report.

          · --harmless

            In  the  diff report, display only the harmless changes.  By default, the harmless changes are filtered out of the diff report keep the clutter to a minimum and have a greater chance to spot real
            ABI issues.

          · --no-linkage-name

            In the resulting report, do not display the linkage names of the added, removed, or changed functions or variables.

          · --no-added-syms

            Do not show the list of functions, variables, or any symbol that was added.

          · --no-added-binaries

            Do not show the list of binaries that got added to the second package.

            Please note that the presence of such added binaries is not considered like an ABI change by this tool; as such, it doesn’t have any impact on the exit code of the tool.  It  does  only  have  an
            informational value.  Removed binaries are, however, considered as an ABI change.

          · --no-abignore

            Do not search the package for the presence of suppression files.

          · --no-parallel

            By default, abipkgdiff will use all the processors it has available to execute concurrently.  This option tells it not to extract packages or run comparisons in parallel.

          · --no-default-suppression

            Do not load the default suppression specification files.

          · --suppressions | --suppr <path-to-suppressions>

            Use  a  suppression  specification  file located at path-to-suppressions.  Note that this option can appear multiple times on the command line.  In that case, all of the suppression specification
            files are taken into account.

            Please note that, by default, if this option is not provided, then the default suppression specification files are loaded .

          · --linux-kernel-abi-whitelist | -w <path-to-whitelist>

            When comparing two Linux kernel RPM packages, this option points to the white list of names of ELF symbols of functions and variables that must be compared for ABI changes.  That  white  list  is
            called a “Linux kernel ABI white list”.

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present in that white list will not be considered by the ABI comparison process.

            If this option is not provided – thus if no white list is provided – then the ABI of all publicly defined and exported functions and global variables by the Linux Kernel binaries are compared.

            Please note that if a white list package is given in parameter, this option handles it just fine, like if the –wp option was used.

          · --wp <path-to-whitelist-package>

            When  comparing  two Linux kernel RPM packages, this option points an RPM package containining several white lists of names of ELF symbols of functions and variables that must be compared for ABI
            changes.  Those white lists are called “Linux kernel ABI white lists”.

            From the content of that white list package, this program then chooses the appropriate Linux kernel ABI white list to consider when comparing the ABI of Linux kernel  binaries  contained  in  the
            Linux kernel packages provided on the command line.

            That choosen Linux kernel ABI white list contains the list of names of ELF symbols of functions and variables that must be compared for ABI changes.

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present in that white list will not be considered by the ABI comparison process.

            Note that this option can be provided twice (not mor than twice), specifying one white list package for each Linux Kernel package that is provided on the command line.

            If this option is not provided – thus if no white list is provided – then the ABI of all publicly defined and exported functions and global variables by the Linux Kernel binaries are compared.

          · --no-unreferenced-symbols

            In the resulting report, do not display change information about function and variable symbols that are not referenced by any debug information.  Note that for these symbols not referenced by any
            debug information, the change information displayed is either added or removed symbols.

          · --no-show-locs
              Do not show information about where in the second shared library the respective type was changed.

          · --show-bytes

            Show sizes and offsets in bytes, not bits.  By default, sizes and offsets are shown in bits.

          · --show-bits

            Show sizes and offsets in bits, not bytes.  This option is activated by default.

          · --show-hex

            Show sizes and offsets in hexadecimal base.

          · --show-dec

            Show sizes and offsets in decimal base.  This option is activated by default.

          · --no-show-relative-offset-changes

            Without this option, when the offset of a data member changes, the change report not only mentions the older and newer offset, but it also mentions by how many bits the data member changes.  With
            this option, the latter is not shown.

          · --show-identical-binaries
              Show  the names of the all binaries compared, including the binaries whose ABI compare equal.  By default, when this option is not provided, only binaries with ABI changes are mentionned in the
              output.

          · --fail-no-dbg

            Make the program fail and return a non-zero exit code if couldn’t read any of the debug information that comes from the debug info packages that were given on the command line.  If no debug  info
            package were provided on the command line then this option is not active.

            Note  that  the  non-zero  exit code returned by the program as a result of this option is the constant ABIDIFF_ERROR.  To know the numerical value of that constant, please refer to the exit code
            documentation.

          · --keep-tmp-files

            Do not erase the temporary directory files that are created during the execution of the tool.

          · --verbose

            Emit verbose progress messages.

          · self-check

            This is used to test the underlying Libabigail library.  When in used, the command expects only on input package, along with its associated debug info packages.  The command  then  compares  each
            binary  inside  the  package against its own ABIXML representation. The result of the comparison should yield the empty set if Libabigail behaves correctly.  Otherwise, it means there is an issue
            that ought to be fixed.  This option is used by people interested in Libabigail development for regression testing purposes.  Here is an example of the use of this option:

                $ abipkgdiff --self-check --d1 mesa-libGLU-debuginfo-9.0.1-3.fc33.x86_64.rpm  mesa-libGLU-9.0.1-3.fc33.x86_64.rpm
                 ==== SELF CHECK SUCCEEDED for 'libGLU.so.1.3.1' ====
                $

   Return value
       The exit code of the abipkgdiff command is either 0 if the ABI of the binaries compared are equal, or non-zero if they differ or if the tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the value of the exit code is the same as for the abidiff tool.

   kmidiff
       kmidiff compares the binary Kernel Module Interfaces of two Linux Kernel trees.  The binary KMI is the interface that the Linux Kernel exposes to its modules.  The trees we are interested in here  are
       the result of the build of the Linux Kernel source tree.

   General approach
       And example of how to build your kernel if you want to compare it to another one using kmidiff is:

          git clone -b v4.5 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux/v4.5
          cd linux/v4.5
          make allyesconfig all

       Then install the modules into a directory, for instance, the build/modules sub-directory of the your kernel source tree:

          mkdir build/modules
          make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_DIR=build/modules

       Then construct a list of interfaces exported by the kernel, that you want to compare:

          cat > kmi-whitelist << EOF
          [kernel_4.5_kmi_whitelist]
           init_task
           schedule
           dev_queue_xmit
           __kmalloc
           printk
          EOF

       Suppose  you’ve  done  something  similar  for  the  v4.6  branch  of  the Linux kernel, you now have these two directories: linux/v4.5 and linux/v4.6.  Their modules are present under the directories
       linux/v4.5/build/modules and linux/v4.6/build/modules.

       To Comparing their KMI kmidiff needs to know where to find the vmlinux binaries and their associated modules.  Here would be what the command line looks like:

          kmidiff                                     \
            --kmi-whitelist  linux/v4.6/kmi-whitelist \
            --vmlinux1       linux/v4.5/vmlinux       \
            --vmlinux2       linux/v4.6/vmlinux       \
                             linux/v4.5/build/modules \
                             linux/v4.6/build/modules

   Invocation
       More generally, kmidiff is invoked under the form:

          kmidiff [options] <first-modules-dir> <second-modules-dir>

   Environment
       By default, kmidiff compares all the interfaces (exported functions and variables) between the Kernel and its modules.  In practice, though, users want to compare a subset of the those interfaces.

       Users can then define a “white list” of the interfaces to compare.  Such a white list is a just a file in the “INI” format that looks like:

          [kernel_version_x86_64_whitelist]
            function1_name
            function2_name
            global_variable1_name
            ....

       Note that the name of the section (the name that is between the two brackets) of that INI file just has to end with the string “whitelist”.  So you can define the name you  want,  for  instance  [ker‐
       nel_46_x86_64_whitelist].

       Then  each  line of that whitelist file is the name of an exported function or variable.  Only those interfaces along with the types reachable from their signatures are going to be compared by kmidiff
       recursively.

       Note that kmidiff compares the interfaces exported by the vmlinux binary and by the all of the compiled modules.

   Options
          · --help | -h

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · --version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --verbose

            Display some verbose messages while executing.

          · --debug-info-dir1 | --d1 <di-path1>

            For cases where the debug information for the binaries of the first Linux kernel is split out into separate files, tells kmidiff where to find those separate debug information files.

            Note that di-path must point to the root directory  under  which  the  debug  information  is  arranged  in  a  tree-like  manner.   Under  Red  Hat  based  systems,  that  directory  is  usually
            <root>/usr/lib/debug.

          · --debug-info-dir2 | --d2 <di-path2>

            Like --debug-info-dir1, this options tells kmidiff where to find the split debug information for the binaries of the second Linux kernel.

          · --vmlinux1 | --l1 <path-to-first-vmlinux>

            Sets the path to the first vmlinux binary to consider.  This has to be the uncompressed vmlinux binary compiled with debug info.

          · --vmlinux2 | --l2 <path-to-first-vmlinux>

            Sets the path to the second vmlinux binary to consider.  This has to be the uncompressed vmlinux binary compiled with debug info.

          · --kmi-whitelist | -w <path-to-interface-whitelist>

            Set the path to the white list of interfaces to compare while comparing the Kernel Module Interface of the first kernel against the one of the second kernel.

            If this option is not provided, all the exported interfaces of the two kernels are compared.  That takes a lot of times and is not necessarily meaningful because many interface are probably meant
            to see their reachable types change.

            So please, make sure you always use this option unless you really know what you  are doing.

          · --suppressions | --suppr <path-to-suppressions>

            Use a suppression specification file located at path-to-suppressions.  Note that this option can appear multiple times on the command line.  In that case, all of the provided suppression specifi‐
            cation files are taken into account.

            Please note that, by default, if this option is not provided, then the default suppression specification files are loaded .

          · --impacted-interfaces | -i

            Tell what interfaces got impacted by each individual ABI change.

          · --full-impact | -f

            Emit a change report that shows the full impact of each change on exported interfaces.  This is the default kind of report emitted by tools like abidiff or abipkgdiff.

          · --show-bytes

            Show sizes and offsets in bytes, not bits.  This option is activated by default.

          · --show-bits

            Show sizes and offsets in bits, not bytes.  By default, sizes and offsets are shown in bytes.

          · --show-hex

            Show sizes and offsets in hexadecimal base.  This option is activated by default.

          · --show-dec

            Show sizes and offsets in decimal base.

   abidw
       abidw  reads  a shared library in ELF format and emits an XML representation of its ABI to standard output.  The emitted representation includes all the globally defined functions and variables, along
       with a complete representation of their types.  It also includes a representation of the globally defined ELF symbols of the file.  The input shared library must contain associated  debug  information
       in DWARF format.

       When  given  the  --linux-tree  option,  this program can also handle a Linux kernel tree.  That is, a directory tree that contains both the vmlinux binary and Linux kernel modules.  It analyses those
       Linux kernel binaries and emits an XML representation of the interface between the kernel and its module, to standard output.  In this case, we don’t call it an ABI, but a KMI  (Kernel  Module  Inter‐
       face).  The emitted KMI includes all the globally defined functions and variables, along with a complete representation of their types.  The input binaries must contain associated debug information in
       DWARF format.

   Invocation
          abidw [options] [<path-to-elf-file>]

   Options
          · --help | -h

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · –version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --debug-info-dir | -d <dir-path>

            In cases where the debug info for path-to-elf-file is in a separate file that is located in a non-standard place, this tells abidw where to look for that debug info file.

            Note that dir-path must point to the root directory under  which  the  debug  information  is  arranged  in  a  tree-like  manner.   Under  Red  Hat  based  systems,  that  directory  is  usually
            <root>/usr/lib/debug.

            This  option  can  be  provided  several times with different root directories.  In that case, abidw will potentially look into all those root directories to find the split debug info for the elf
            file.

            Note that this option is not mandatory for split debug information installed by your system’s package manager because then abidw knows where to find it.

          · --out-file <file-path>

            This option instructs abidw to emit the XML representation of path-to-elf-file into the file file-path, rather than emitting it to its standard output.

          · --noout

            This option instructs abidw to not emit the XML representation of the ABI.  So it only reads the ELF and debug information, builds the internal representation of the ABI and exits.   This  option
            is usually useful for debugging purposes.

          · --no-corpus-path

            Do not emit the path attribute for the ABI corpus.

          · --suppressions | suppr <path-to-suppression-specifications-file>

            Use  a  suppression specification file located at path-to-suppression-specifications-file.  Note that this option can appear multiple times on the command line.  In that case, all of the provided
            suppression specification files are taken into account.  ABI artifacts matched by the suppression specifications are suppressed from the output of this tool.

          · --kmi-whitelist | -kaw <path-to-whitelist>

            When analyzing a Linux kernel binary, this option points to the white list of names of ELF symbols of functions and variables which ABI must be written out.  That white list is called a ”  Kernel
            Module  Interface  white  list”.  This is because for the Kernel, we don’t talk about the ABI; we rather talk about the interface between the Kernel and its module. Hence the term KMI rather than
            ABI

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not present in that white list will not be considered by the KMI writing process.

            If this option is not provided – thus if no white list is provided – then the entire KMI, that is, all publicly defined and exported functions and global variables by the Linux Kernel binaries is
            emitted.

          · --linux-tree | --lt

            Make abidw to consider the input path as a path to a directory containing the vmlinux binary as several kernel modules binaries.  In that case, this program emits the representation of the Kernel
            Module Interface (KMI) on the standard output.

            Below is an example of usage of abidw on a Linux Kernel tree.

            First, checkout a Linux kernel source tree and build it.  Then install the kernel modules in a directory somewhere.  Copy the vmlinux binary into that directory too.  And then serialize  the  KMI
            of that kernel to disk, using abidw:

                $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
                $ cd linux && git checkout v4.5
                $ make allyesconfig all
                $ mkdir build-output
                $ make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=./build-output modules_install
                $ cp vmlinux build-output/modules/4.5.0
                $ abidw --linux-tree build-output/modules/4.5.0 > build-output/linux-4.5.0.kmi

          · --headers-dir | --hd <headers-directory-path-1>

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the binary that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter out types that are not defined in public headers.

            Note  that  several  public  header directories can be specified for the binary to consider.  In that case the --header-dir option should be present several times on the command line, like in the
            following example:

                $ abidw --header-dir /some/path       \
                        --header-dir /some/other/path \
                        binary > binary.abi

          · --header-file | --hf <header-file-path>

            Specifies where to find one of the public headers of the abi file that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter out types that are not defined in public headers.

          · --drop-private-types

            This option is to be used with the --headers-dir and/or header-file options.  With this option, types that are NOT defined in the headers are entirely dropped  from  the  internal  representation
            build by Libabigail to represent the ABI and will not end up in the abi XML file.

          · --no-elf-needed

            Do not include the list of DT_NEEDED dependency names in the corpus.

          · --drop-undefined-syms

            With  this option functions or variables for which the (exported) ELF symbol is undefined are dropped from the internal representation build by Libabigail to represent the ABI and will not end up
            in the abi XML file.

          · --no-linux-kernel-mode

            Without this option, if abipkgiff detects that the binaries it is looking at are Linux Kernel binaries (either vmlinux or modules) then it only considers functions and variables which ELF symbols
            are listed in the __ksymtab and __ksymtab_gpl sections.

            With this option, abipkgdiff considers the binary as a non-special ELF binary.  It thus considers functions and variables which are defined and exported in the ELF sense.

          · --check-alternate-debug-info <elf-path>

            If  the  debug  info for the file elf-path contains a reference to an alternate debug info file, abidw checks that it can find that alternate debug info file.  In that case, it emits a meaningful
            success message mentioning the full path to the alternate debug info file found.  Otherwise, it emits an error code.

          · --no-show-locs
              In the emitted ABI representation, do not show file, line or column where ABI artifacts are defined.

          · --no-parameter-names

            In the emitted ABI representation, do not show names of function parameters, just the types.

          · --no-write-default-sizes

            In the XML ABI representation, do not write the size-in-bits for pointer type definitions, reference type definitions, function declarations and function types when they are equal to the  default
            address size of the translation unit.  Note that libabigail before 1.8 will not set the default size and will interpret types without a size-in-bits attribute as zero sized.

          · --type-id-style <sequence``|``hash>

            This  option  controls how types are idenfied in the generated XML files.  The default sequence style just numbers (with type-id- as prefix) the types in the order they are encountered.  The hash
            style uses a (stable, portable) hash of libabigail’s internal type names and is intended to make the XML files easier to diff.

          · --check-alternate-debug-info-base-name <elf-path>

            Like --check-alternate-debug-info, but in the success message, only mention the base name of the debug info file; not its full path.

          · --load-all-types

            By default, libabigail (and thus abidw) only loads types that are reachable from functions and variables declarations that are publicly defined and exported by the binary.  So  only  those  types
            are present in the output of abidw.  This option however makes abidw load all the types defined in the binaries, even those that are not reachable from public declarations.

          · --abidiff
              Load  the  ABI  of the ELF binary given in argument, save it in libabigail’s XML format in a temporary file; read the ABI from the temporary XML file and compare the ABI that has been read back
              against the ABI of the ELF binary given in argument.  The ABIs should compare equal.  If they don’t, the program emits a diagnostic and exits with a non-zero code.

              This is a debugging and sanity check option.

              · --debug-abidiff

              Same as --abidiff but in debug mode.  In this mode, error messages are emitted for types which fail type canonicalization.

              This is an optional debugging and sanity check option.  To enable it the libabigail package needs to be configured with the –enable-debug-self-comparison option.

          · --annotate
              Annotate the ABIXML output with comments above most elements.  The comments are made of the pretty-printed form types, declaration or even ELF symbols.  The purpose is to make the ABIXML output
              more human-readable for debugging or documenting purposes.

          · --stats

            Emit statistics about various internal things.

          · --verbose

            Emit verbose logs about the progress of miscellaneous internal things.

   Notes
   Alternate debug info files
       As  of  the  version 4 of the DWARF specification, Alternate debug information is a GNU extension to the DWARF specification.  It has however been proposed for inclusion into the upcoming version 5 of
       the DWARF standard.  You can read more about the GNU extensions to the DWARF standard here.

   abicompat
       abicompat checks that an application that links against a given shared library is still ABI compatible with a subsequent version of that library.  If the new version of the library introduces  an  ABI
       incompatibility, then abicompat hints the user at what exactly that incompatibility is.

   Invocation
          abicompat [options] [<application> <shared-library-first-version> <shared-library-second-version>]

   Options
          · --help

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · –version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --list-undefined-symbols | -u

            Display the list of undefined symbols of the application and exit.

          · --show-base-names | -b

            In  the  resulting report emitted by the tool, this option makes the application and libraries be referred to by their base names only; not by a full absolute name.  This can be useful for use in
            scripts that wants to compare names of the application and libraries independently of what their directory names are.

          · --app-debug-info-dir | --appd <path-to-app-debug-info-directory>

            Set the path to the directory under which the debug information of the application is supposed to be laid out.  This is useful for application binaries for which the debug info is in  a  separate
            set of files.

          · --lib-debug-info-dir1 | --libd1 <path-to-lib1-debug-info>

            Set  the  path  to the directory under which the debug information of the first version of the shared library is supposed to be laid out.  This is useful for shared library binaries for which the
            debug info is in a separate set of files.

          · --lib-debug-info-dir2 | --libd2 <path-to-lib1-debug-info>

            Set the path to the directory under which the debug information of the second version of the shared library is supposed to be laid out.  This is useful for shared library binaries for  which  the
            debug info is in a separate set of files.

          · --suppressions | --suppr <path-to-suppressions>

            Use  a suppression specification file located at path-to-suppressions.  Note that this option can appear multiple times on the command line; all the suppression specification files are then taken
            into account.

          · --no-show-locs
              Do not show information about where in the second shared library the respective type was changed.

          · --weak-mode

            This triggers the weak mode of abicompat.  In this mode, only one version of the library is required.  That is, abicompat is invoked like this:

                abicompat --weak-mode <the-application> <the-library>

            Note that the --weak-mode option can even be omitted if only one version of the library is given, along with the application; in that case, abicompat automatically switches  to  operate  in  weak
            mode:

                abicompat <the-application> <the-library>

            In  this  weak  mode,  the  types  of functions and variables exported by the library and consumed by the application (as in, the symbols of the these functions and variables are undefined in the
            application and are defined and exported by the library) are compared to the version of these types as expected by the application.  And if these two versions of types  are  different,  abicompat
            tells the user what the differences are.

            In other words, in this mode, abicompat checks that the types of the functions and variables exported by the library mean the same thing as what the application expects, as far as the ABI is con‐
            cerned.

            Note that in this mode, abicompat doesn’t detect exported functions or variables (symbols) that are expected by the application but that are removed from the library.  That is why  it  is  called
            weak mode.

   Return values
       The exit code of the abicompat command is either 0 if the ABI of the binaries being compared are equal, or non-zero if they differ or if the tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the exit code is a 8-bits-wide bit field in which each bit has a specific meaning.

       The first bit, of value 1, named ABIDIFF_ERROR means there was an error.

       The  second  bit, of value 2, named ABIDIFF_USAGE_ERROR means there was an error in the way the user invoked the tool.  It might be set, for instance, if the user invoked the tool with an unknown com‐
       mand line switch, with a wrong number or argument, etc.  If this bit is set, then the ABIDIFF_ERROR bit must be set as well.

       The third bit, of value 4, named ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE means the ABI of the binaries being compared are different.

       The fourth bit, of value 8, named ABIDIFF_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE means the ABI of the binaries compared are different in an incompatible way.  If this bit is set, then the ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE bit must
       be  set  as  well.  If the ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE is set and the ABIDIFF_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE is NOT set, then it means that the ABIs being compared might or might not be compatible.  In that case, a human
       being needs to review the ABI changes to decide if they are compatible or not.

       The remaining bits are not used for the moment.

                  $ abicompat test-app libtest-0.so libtest-1.so
                  ELF file 'test-app' might not be ABI compatible with 'libtest-1.so' due to differences with 'libtest-0.so' below:

                  Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

                  2 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

   abilint
       abilint parses the native XML representation of an ABI as emitted by abidw.  Once it has parsed the XML representation of the ABI, abilint builds and in-memory model from it.  It then tries to save it
       back to an XML form, to standard output.  If that read-write operation succeeds chances are the input XML ABI representation is meaningful.

       Note that the main intent of this tool to help debugging issues in the underlying Libabigail library.

       Note  also  that  abilint  can  also read an ELF input file, build the in-memory model for its ABI, and serialize that model back into XML to standard output.  In that case, the ELF input file must be
       accompanied with its debug information in the DWARF format.

   Invocation
          abilint [options] [<abi-file1>]

   Options
          · --help

            Display a short help message and exits.

          · –version | -v

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          · --debug-info-dir <path>

            When reading an ELF input file which debug information is split out into a separate file, this options tells abilint where to find that separate debug information file.

            Note that path must point to the root directory under which the debug information is arranged in a tree-like manner.  Under Red Hat based systems, that directory is usually <root>/usr/lib/debug.

            Note also that this option is not mandatory for split debug information installed by your system’s package manager because then abidiff knows where to find it.

          · --diff

            For XML inputs, perform a text diff between the input and the memory model saved back to disk.  This can help to spot issues in the handling  of  the  XML  format  by  the  underlying  Libabigail
            library.

          · --noout

            Do not display anything on standard output.  The return code of the command is the only way to know if the command succeeded.

          · --suppressions | suppr <path-to-suppression-specifications-file>

            Use  a  suppression specification file located at path-to-suppression-specifications-file.  Note that this option can appear multiple times on the command line.  In that case, all of the provided
            suppression specification files are taken into account.  ABI artifacts matched by the suppression specifications are suppressed from the output of this tool.

          · --headers-dir | --hd <headers-directory-path-1>

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the first shared library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter out types that are not defined in public headers.

          · --header-file | --hf <header-file-path>

            Specifies where to find one of the public headers of the abi file that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter out types that are not defined in public headers.

          · --stdin | --

            Read the input content from standard input.

          · --tu

            Expect the input XML to represent a single translation unit.

   fedabipkgdiff
       fedabipkgdiff compares the ABI of shared libraries in Fedora packages.  It’s a convenient way to do so without having to manually download packages from the Fedora Build System.

       fedabipkgdiff knows how to talk with the Fedora Build System to find the right packages versions, their associated debug information and development packages, download them, compare their ABI locally,
       and report about the possible ABI changes.

       Note  that by default, this tool reports ABI changes about types that are defined in public header files found in the development packages associated with the packages being compared.  It also reports
       ABI changes about functions and global variables whose symbols are defined and exported in the ELF binaries found in the packages being compared.

   Invocation
          fedabipkgdiff [option] <NVR> ...

   Environment
       fedabipkgdiff loads two default suppression specifications files, merges their content and use it to filter out ABI change reports that might be considered as false positives to users.

       · Default system-wide suppression specification file

         It’s located by the optional environment variable LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment variable is not set, then fedabipkgdiff tries to load the  suppression  file  $lib‐
         dir/libabigail/libabigail-default.abignore.  If that file is not present, then no default system-wide suppression specification file is loaded.

       · Default user suppression specification file.

         It’s  located  by  the optional environment LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_USER_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment variable is not set, then fedabipkgdiff tries to load the suppression file $HOME/.abignore.
         If that file is not present, then no default user suppression specification is loaded.

   Options
          · --help | -h

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          · --dry-run

            Don’t actually perform the ABI comparison.  Details about what is going to be done are emitted on standard output.

          · --debug

            Emit debugging messages about the execution of the program.  Details about each method invocation, including input parameters and returned values, are emitted.

          · --traceback

            Show traceback when an exception raised. This is useful for developers of the tool itself to know more exceptional errors.

          · --server <URL>

            Specifies the URL of the Koji XMLRPC service the tool talks to.  The default value of this option is http://koji.fedoraproject.org/kojihub.

          · --topurl <URL>

            Specifies the URL of the package store the tool downloads RPMs from.  The default value of this option is https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org.

          · --from <distro>

            Specifies the name of the baseline Fedora distribution in which to find the first build that is used for comparison. The distro value can be any valid value of the RPM macro %{?dist} for  Fedora,
            for example, fc4, fc23, fc25.

          · --to <distro>

            Specifies  the  name  of the Fedora distribution in which to find the build that is compared against the baseline specified by option --from.  The distro value could be any valid value of the RPM
            macro %{?dist} for Fedora, for example, fc4, fc23.

          · --all-subpackages

            Instructs the tool to also compare the ABI of the binaries in the sub-packages of the packages specified.

          · --dso-only

            Compares the ABI of shared libraries only.  If this option is not provided, the tool compares the ABI of all ELF binaries found in the packages.

          · --suppressions <path-to-suppresions>

            Use a suppression specification file located at path-to-suppressions.

          · --clean-cache-after

            Clean cache after ABI comparison.

          · --clean-cache

            If you want to clean cache both before and after ABI comparison, --clean-cache is the convenient way for you to save typing of two options at same time.

       Note that a build is a specific version and release of an RPM package.  It’s specified by its the package name, version and release. These are specified by the Fedora Naming Guidelines

   Return value
       The exit code of the abipkgdiff command is either 0 if the ABI of the binaries compared are equivalent, or non-zero if they differ or if the tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the value of the exit code is the same as for the abidiff tool.

   Use cases
       Below are some usage examples currently supported by fedabipkgdiff.

          1. Compare the ABI of binaries in a local package against the ABI of the latest stable package in Fedora 23.

             Suppose you have built just built the httpd package and you want to compare the ABI of the binaries in this locally built package against the ABI of the binaries in the latest  http  build  from
             Fedora 23.  The command line invocation would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff --from fc23 ./httpd-2.4.18-2.fc24.x86_64.rpm

          2. Compare the ABI of binaries in two local packages.

             Suppose you have built two versions of package httpd, and you want to see what ABI differences between these two versions of RPM files. The command line invocation would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff path/to/httpd-2.4.23-3.fc23.x86_64.rpm another/path/to/httpd-2.4.23-4.fc24.x86_64.rpm

             All what fedabipkgdiff does happens on local machine without the need of querying or downloading RPMs from Koji.

          3. Compare the ABI of binaries in the latest build of the httpd package in Fedora 23 against the ABI of the binaries in the latest build of the same package in 24.

             In  this  case, note that neither of the two packages are available locally.  The tool is going to talk with the Fedora Build System, determine what the versions and releases of the latest pack‐
             ages are, download them and perform the comparison locally.  The command line invocation would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff --from fc23 --to fc24 httpd

          4. Compare the ABI of binaries of two builds of the httpd package, designated their versions and releases.

             If we want to do perform the ABI comparison for all the processor architectures supported by Fedora the command line invocation would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff httpd-2.8.14.fc23 httpd-2.8.14.fc24

             But if we want to perform the ABI comparison for a specific architecture, say, x86_64, then the command line invocation would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff httpd-2.8.14.fc23.x86_64 httpd-2.8.14.fc24.x86_64

          5. If the use wants to also compare the sub-packages of a given package, she can use the –all-subpackages option.  The first command of the previous example would thus look like:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff --all-subpackages httpd-2.8.14.fc23 httpd-2.8.14.fc24

CONCEPTS
   ABI artifacts
       An ABI artifact is a relevant part of the ABI of a shared library or program.  Examples of ABI artifacts are exported types, variables, functions, or ELF symbols exported by a shared library.

       The set of ABI artifact for a binary is called an ABI Corpus.

   Harmful changes
       A change in the diff report is considered harmful if it might cause ABI compatibility issues.  That is, it might prevent an application dynamically linked against a given version of a library to  keep
       working with the changed subsequent versions of the same library.

   Harmless changes
       A  change in the diff report is considered harmless if it will not cause any ABI compatibility issue.  That is, it will not prevent an application dynamically linked against given version of a library
       to keep working with the changed subsequent versions of the same library.

       By default, abidiff filters harmless changes from the diff report.

   Suppression specifications
   Definition
       A suppression specification file is a way for a user to instruct abidiff, abipkgdiff or any other relevant libabigail tool to avoid emitting reports for changes involving certain ABI artifacts.

       It contains directives (or specifications) that describe the set of ABI artifacts to avoid emitting change reports about.

   Introductory examples
       Its syntax is based on a simplified and customized form of Ini File Syntax.  For instance, to specify that change reports on a type named FooPrivateType should be suppressed, one could write this sup‐
       pression specification:

          [suppress_type]
            name = FooPrivateType

       If we want to ensure that only change reports about structures named FooPrivateType should be suppressed, we could write:

          [suppress_type]
            type_kind = struct
            name = FooPrivateType

       But we could also want to suppress change reports avoid typedefs named FooPrivateType.  In that case we would write:

          [suppress_type]
            type_kind = typedef
            name = FooPrivateType

       Or, we could want to suppress change reports about all struct which names end with the string “PrivateType”:

          [suppress_type]
            type_kind = struct
            name_regexp = ^.*PrivateType

       Let’s now look at the generic syntax of suppression specification files.

   Syntax
   Properties
       More generally, the format of suppression lists is organized around the concept of property.  Every property has a name and a value, delimited by the = sign.  E.g:

          name = value

       Leading and trailing white spaces are ignored around property names and values.

   Regular expressions
       The  value  of  some  properties might be a regular expression.  In that case, they must comply with the syntax of extended POSIX regular expressions.  Note that Libabigail uses the regular expression
       engine of the GNU C Library.

   Escaping a character in a regular expression
       When trying to match a string that contains a * character, like in the pointer type int*, one must be careful to notice that the character * is a  special  character  in  the  extended  POSIX  regular
       expression syntax.  And that character must be escaped for the regular expression engine.  Thus the regular expression that would match the string int* in a suppression file should be

          int\\*

       Wait;  but then why the two \ characters?  Well, because the \ character is a special character in the Ini File Syntax used for specifying suppressions.  So it must be escaped as well, so that the Ini
       File parser leaves a \ character intact in the data stream that is handed to the regular expression engine.  Hence the \\ targeted at the Ini File parser.

       So, in short, to escape a character in a regular expression, always prefix the character with the \\ sequence.

   Modus operandi
       Suppression specifications can be applied at two different points of the processing pipeline of libabigail.

       In the default operating mode called “late suppression mode”, suppression specifications are applied to the result of comparing the in-memory internal representations of two ABIs.  In this mode, if an
       ABI artifact matches a suppression specification, its changes are not mentioned in the ABI change report.  The internal representation of the “suppressed” changed ABI artifact is still present in mem‐
       ory; it is just not mentioned in the ABI change report.  The change report can still mention statistics about the number of changed ABI artifacts that were suppressed.

       There is another operating mode called the “early suppression mode” where suppression specifications are applied during the construction of the in-memory internal representation of a  given  ABI.   In
       that mode, if an ABI artifact matches a suppression specification, no in-memory internal representation is built for it.  As a result, no change about the matched ABI artifact is going to be mentioned
       in the ABI change report and no statistic about the number of suppressed ABI changes is available.  Also, please note that because suppressed ABI artifacts are removed from the in-memory internal rep‐
       resentation in this mode, the amount memory used by the internal representation is potentially smaller than the memory consumption in the late suppression mode.

   Sections
       Properties are then grouped into arbitrarily named sections that shall not be nested.  The name of the section is on a line by itself and is surrounded by square brackets, i.e:

          [section_name]
          property1_name = property1_value
          property2_name = property2_value

       A  section  might  or  might not have properties.  Sections that expect to have properties and which are found nonetheless empty are just ignored.  Properties that are not recognized by the reader are
       ignored as well.

   Section names
       Each different section can be thought of as being a directive to suppress ABI change reports for a particular kind of ABI artifact.

   [suppress_file]
       This directive prevents a given tool from loading a file (binary or abixml file) if its file name or other properties match certain properties.  Thus, if the tool is meant to compare the ABIs  of  two
       files, and if the directive prevents it from loading either one of the files, then no comparison is performed.

       Note that for the [suppress_file] directive to work, at least one of the following properties must be provided:
          file_name_regexp, file_name_not_regexp, soname_regexp, soname_not_regexp.

       If none of the above properties are provided, then the [suppress_file] directive is simply ignored.

       The potential properties of this sections are listed below:

       · file_name_regexp

         Usage:
            file_name_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Prevents the system from loading the file which name matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · file_name_not_regexp

         Usage:
            file_name_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Prevents the system from loading the file which name does not match the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · soname_regexp

         Usage:
            soname_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Prevents  the system from loading the file which contains a SONAME property that matches the regular expression of this property.  Note that this property also works on an abixml file if it contains
         a SONAME property.

       · soname_not_regexp

         Usage:
            soname_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Prevents the system from loading the file which contains a SONAME property that does NOT match the regular expression of this property.  Note that this property also works on an abixml  file  if  it
         contains a SONAME property.

       · label
          Usage:
              label = <some-value>

          Define a label for the section.  A label is just an informative string that might be used by the tool to refer to a type suppression in error messages.

   [suppress_type]
       This directive suppresses report messages about a type change.

       Note that for the [suppress_type] directive to work, at least one of the following properties must be provided:
          file_name_regexp, file_name_not_regexp, soname_regexp, soname_not_regexp, name, name_regexp, name_not_regexp, type_kind, source_location_not_in, source_location_not_regexp.

       If none of the above properties are provided, then the [suppress_type] directive is simply ignored.

       The potential properties of this sections are listed below:

       · file_name_regexp

         Usage:
            file_name_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Suppresses change reports about ABI artifacts that are defined in a binary file which name matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · file_name_not_regexp

         Usage:
            file_name_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Suppresses change reports about ABI artifacts that are defined in a binary file which name does not match the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · soname_regexp

         Usage:
            soname_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Suppresses change reports about ABI artifacts that are defined in a shared library which SONAME property matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · soname_not_regexp

         Usage:
            soname_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Suppresses change reports about ABI artifacts that are defined in a shared library which SONAME property does not match the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · name_regexp
          Usage:
              name_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving types whose name matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · name_not_regexp
          Usage:
              name_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses  change reports involving types whose name does NOT match the regular expression specified as value of this property.  Said otherwise, this property specifies which types to keep, rather
          than types to suppress from reports.

       · name
          Usage:
              name = <a-value>

          Suppresses change reports involving types whose name equals the value of this property.

       · type_kind
          Usage:

              type_kind = class | struct | union | enum |
                     array | typedef | builtin

          Suppresses change reports involving a certain kind of type.  The kind of type to suppress change reports for is specified by the possible values listed above:

              ·

                class: suppress change reports for class types. Note that
                       even if class types don’t exist for C, this value still triggers the suppression of change reports for struct types, in C.  In C++ however, it should do what it suggests.

              ·

                struct: suppress change reports for struct types in C or C++.
                       Note that the value class above is a super-set of this one.

              · union: suppress change reports for union types.

              · enum: suppress change reports for enum types.

              · array: suppress change reports for array types.

              · typedef: suppress change reports for typedef types.

              · builtin: suppress change reports for built-in (or native) types.  Example of built-in types are char, int, unsigned int, etc.

       · source_location_not_in
          Usage:
              source_location_not_in = <list-of-file-paths>

          Suppresses change reports involving a type which is defined in a file which path is NOT listed in the value list-of-file-paths.  Note that the value is a comma-separated list  of  file  paths  e.g,
          this property

              source_location_not_in = libabigail/abg-ir.h, libabigail/abg-dwarf-reader.h

          suppresses change reports about all the types that are NOT defined in header files whose path end up with the strings libabigail/abg-ir.h or libabigail/abg-dwarf-reader.h.

       · source_location_not_regexp
          Usage:
              source_location_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving a type which is defined in a file which path does NOT match the regular expression provided as value of the property. E.g, this property

              source_location_not_regexp = libabigail/abg-.*\\.h

          suppresses change reports involving all the types that are NOT defined in header files whose path match the regular expression provided a value of the property.

       · has_data_member_inserted_at
          Usage:
              has_data_member_inserted_at = <offset-in-bit>

          Suppresses change reports involving a type which has at least one data member inserted at an offset specified by the property value offset-in-bit.  The value offset-in-bit is either:

                 · an integer value, expressed in bits, which denotes the offset of the insertion point of the data member, starting from the beginning of the relevant structure or class.

                 · the keyword end which is a named constant which value equals the offset of the end of the of the structure or class.

                 · the  function  call  expression  offset_of(data-member-name)  where data-member-name is the name of a given data member of the relevant structure or class.  The value of this function call
                   expression is an integer that represents the offset of the data member denoted by data-member-name.

                 · the function call expression offset_after(data-member-name) where data-member-name is the name of a given data member of the relevant structure or class.  The value of this  function  call
                   expression is an integer that represents the offset of the point that comes right after the region occupied by the data member denoted by data-member-name.

       · has_data_member_inserted_between
          Usage:
              has_data_member_inserted_between = {<range-begin>, <range-end>}

          Suppresses  change  reports involving a type which has at least one data mber inserted at an offset that is comprised in the range between range-begin`` and range-end.  Please note that each of the
          values range-begin and range-end can be of the same form as the has_data_member_inserted_at property above.

          Usage examples of this properties are:

              has_data_member_inserted_between = {8, 64}

          or:

              has_data_member_inserted_between = {16, end}

          or:

              has_data_member_inserted_between = {offset_after(member1), end}

       · has_data_members_inserted_between
          Usage:
              has_data_members_inserted_between = {<sequence-of-ranges>}

          Suppresses change reports involving a type which has multiple data member inserted in various offset ranges.  A usage example of this property is, for instance:

              has_data_members_inserted_between = {{8, 31}, {72, 95}}

          This usage example suppresses change reports involving a type which has data members inserted in bit offset ranges [8 31] and [72 95].  The length of the sequence of ranges  or  this  has_data_mem‐
          bers_inserted_between is not bounded; it can be as long as the system can cope with.  The values of the boundaries of the ranges are of the same kind as for the has_data_member_inserted_at property
          above.

          Another usage example of this property is thus:

              has_data_members_inserted_between =
                {
                     {offset_after(member0), offset_of(member1)},
                     {72, end}
                }

       · accessed_through
          Usage:
              accessed_through = <some-predefined-values>

          Suppress change reports involving a type which is referred to either directly or through a pointer or a reference.  The potential values of this property are the predefined keywords below:

              · direct

                So if the [suppress_type] contains the property description:

                   accessed_through = direct

                then changes about a type that is referred-to directly (i.e, not through a pointer or a reference) are going to be suppressed.

              · pointer

                If the accessed_through property is set to the value pointer then changes about a type that is referred-to through a pointer are going to be suppressed.

              · reference

                If the accessed_through property is set to the value reference then changes about a type that is referred-to through a reference are going to be suppressed.

              · reference-or-pointer

                If the accessed_through property is set to the value reference-or-pointer then changes about a type that is referred-to through either a reference or a pointer are going to be suppressed.

          For an extensive example of how to use this property, please check out the example below about suppressing change reports about types accessed either directly or through pointers.

       · drop
          Usage:
              drop = yes | no

          If a type is matched by a suppression specification which contains the “drop” property set to “yes” (or to “true”) then the type is not even going to be represented in the  internal  representation
          of the ABI being analyzed.  This property makes its enclosing suppression specification to be applied in the early suppression specification mode.  The net effect is that it potentially reduces the
          memory used to represent the ABI being analyzed.

          Please note that for this property to be effective, the enclosing suppression specification must  have  at  least  one  of  the  following  properties  specified:  name_regexp,  name,  name_regexp,
          source_location_not_in or source_location_not_regexp.

       · label
          Usage:
              label = <some-value>

          Define a label for the section.  A label is just an informative string that might be used by a tool to refer to a type suppression in error messages.

       · changed_enumerators

         Usage:
            changed_enumerators = <list-of-enumerators>

         Suppresses  change  reports  involving changes in the value of enumerators of a given enum type.  This property is applied if the type_kind property is set to the value enum, at least.  The value of
         the changed_enumerators is a comma-separated list of the enumerators that the user expects to change.  For instance:

            changed_enumerators = LAST_ENUMERATORS0, LAST_ENUMERATOR1

   [suppress_function]
       This directive suppresses report messages about changes on a set of functions.

       Note that for the [suppress_function] directive to work, at least one of the following properties must be provided:
          label, file_name_regexp, file_name_not_regexp, soname_regexp, soname_not_regexp, name, name_regexp, name_not_regexp, parameter, return_type_name, return_type_regexp,  symbol_name,  symbol_name_reg‐
          exp, symbol_name_not_regexp, symbol_version, symbol_version_regexp.

       If none of the above properties are provided, then the [suppress_function] directive is simply ignored.

       The potential properties of this sections are:

       · label
          Usage:
              label = <some-value>

          This property is the same as the label property defined above.

       · file_name_regexp

         Usage:

         file_name_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Suppresses change reports about ABI artifacts that are defined in a binary file which name matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · file_name_not_regexp

         Usage:
            file_name_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Suppresses change reports about ABI artifacts that are defined in a binary file which name does not match the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · soname_regexp

         Usage:
            soname_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Suppresses change reports about ABI artifacts that are defined in a shared library which SONAME property matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · soname_not_regexp

         Usage:
            soname_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

         Suppresses change reports about ABI artifacts that are defined in a shared library which SONAME property does not match the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · name
          Usage:
              name = <some-value>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose name equals the value of this property.

       · name_regexp
          Usage:
              name_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose name matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

          Let’s consider the case of functions that have several symbol names.  This happens when the underlying symbol for the function has aliases.  Each symbol name is actually one alias name.

          In  this case, if the regular expression matches the name of at least one of the aliases names, then it must match the names of all of the aliases of the function for the directive to actually sup‐
          press the diff reports for said function.

       · name_not_regexp
          Usage:
              name_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose names don’t match the regular expression specified as value of this property.

          The rules for functions that have several symbol names are the same rules as for the name_regexp property above.

       · change_kind
          Usage:
              change_kind = <predefined-possible-values>

          Specifies the kind of changes this suppression specification should apply to.  The possible values of this property as well as their meaning are listed below:

              · function-subtype-change

                This suppression specification applies to functions that which have at least one sub-type that has changed.

              · added-function

                This suppression specification applies to functions that have been added to the binary.

              · deleted-function

                This suppression specification applies to functions that have been removed from the binary.

              · all

                This suppression specification applies to functions that have all of the changes above.  Note that not providing the change_kind property at all is equivalent to setting it to the value all.

       · parameter
          Usage:
              parameter = <function-parameter-specification>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose parameters match the parameter specification indicated as value of this property.

          The format of the function parameter specification is:

          ' <parameter-index> <space> <type-name-or-regular-expression>

          That is, an apostrophe followed by a number that is the index of the parameter, followed by one of several spaces, followed by either the name of the type of the parameter, or a regular  expression
          describing a family of parameter type names.

          If the parameter type name is designated by a regular expression, then said regular expression must be enclosed between two slashes; like /some-regular-expression/.

          The  index of the first parameter of the function is zero.  Note that for member functions (methods of classes), the this is the first parameter that comes after the implicit “this” pointer parame‐
          ter.

          Examples of function parameter specifications are:

              '0 int

          Which means, the parameter at index 0, whose type name is int.

              '4 unsigned char*

          Which means, the parameter at index 4, whose type name is unsigned char*.

              '2 /^foo.*&/

          Which means, the parameter at index 2, whose type name starts with the string “foo” and ends with an ‘&’.  In other words, this is the third parameter and it’s a reference on  a  type  that  starts
          with the string “foo”.

       · return_type_name
          Usage:
              return_type_name = <some-value>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose return type name equals the value of this property.

       · return_type_regexp
          Usage:
              return_type_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose return type name matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · symbol_name
          Usage:
              symbol_name = <some-value>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose symbol name equals the value of this property.

       · symbol_name_regexp
          Usage:
              symbol_name_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose symbol name matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

          Let’s consider the case of functions that have several symbol names.  This happens when the underlying symbol for the function has aliases.  Each symbol name is actually one alias name.

          In this case, the regular expression must match the names of all of the aliases of the function for the directive to actually suppress the diff reports for said function.

       · symbol_name_not_regexp
          Usage:
              symbol_name_not_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose symbol name does not match the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · symbol_version
          Usage:
              symbol_version = <some-value>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose symbol version equals the value of this property.

       · symbol_version_regexp
          Usage:
              symbol_version_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving functions whose symbol version matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · drop
          Usage:
              drop = yes | no

          If  a  function is matched by a suppression specification which contains the “drop” property set to “yes” (or to “true”) then the function is not even going to be represented in the internal repre‐
          sentation of the ABI being analyzed.  This property makes its enclosing suppression specification to be applied in the early suppression specification mode.  The net effect is that  it  potentially
          reduces the memory used to represent the ABI being analyzed.

          Please  note  that  for  this  property  to  be  effective,  the  enclosing  suppression  specification must have at least one of the following properties specified: name_regexp, name, name_regexp,
          source_location_not_in or source_location_not_regexp.

   [suppress_variable]
       This directive suppresses report messages about changes on a set of variables.

       Note that for the [suppress_variable] directive to work, at least one of the following properties must be provided:
          label, file_name_regexp, file_name_not_regexp, soname_regexp, soname_not_regexp, name, name_regexp, name_not_regexp, symbol_name, symbol_name_regexp,  symbol_name_not_regexp,  symbol_version,  sym‐
          bol_version_regexp, type_name, type_name_regexp.

       If none of the above properties are provided, then the [suppress_variable] directive is simply ignored.

       The potential properties of this sections are:

       · label
          Usage:
              label = <some-value>

          This property is the same as the label property defined above.

              name_regexp = <regular-expression>

          Suppresses change reports involving variables whose name matches the regular expression specified as value of this property.

       · change_kind
          Usage:
              change_kind = <predefined-possible-values>

          Specifies  the  kind  of changes this suppression specification should apply to.  The possible values of this property as well as their meaning are the same as when it’s used in the [suppress_func‐
          tion] section.

       · symbol_name
          Usage:
              symbol_name = <some-value>

   Code examples
       1. Suppressing change reports about types.

          Suppose we have a library named libtest1-v0.so which contains this very useful code:

             $ cat -n test1-v0.cc
                  1  // A forward declaration for a type considered to be opaque to
                  2  // function foo() below.
                  3  struct opaque_type;
                  4
                  5  // This function cannot touch any member of opaque_type.  Hence,
                  6  // changes to members of opaque_type should not impact foo, as far as
                  7  // ABI is concerned.
                  8  void
                  9  foo(opaque_type*)
                 10  {
                 11  }
                 12
                 13  struct opaque_type
                 14  {
                 15    int member0;
                 16    char member1;
                 17  };
             $

       Let’s change the layout of struct opaque_type by inserting a data member around line 15, leading to a new version of the library, that we shall name libtest1-v1.so:

          $ cat -n test1-v1.cc
               1  // A forward declaration for a type considered to be opaque to
               2  // function foo() below.
               3  struct opaque_type;
               4
               5  // This function cannot touch any member of opaque_type;  Hence,
               6  // changes to members of opaque_type should not impact foo, as far as
               7  // ABI is concerned.
               8  void
               9  foo(opaque_type*)
              10  {
              11  }
              12
              13  struct opaque_type
              14  {
              15    char added_member; // <-- a new member got added here now.
              16    int member0;
              17    char member1;
              18  };
          $

       Let’s compile both examples.  We shall not forget to compile them with debug information generation turned on:

          $ g++ -shared -g -Wall -o libtest1-v0.so test1-v0.cc
          $ g++ -shared -g -Wall -o libtest1-v1.so test1-v1.cc

       Let’s ask abidiff which ABI differences it sees between libtest1-v0.so and libtest1-v1.so:

          $ abidiff libtest1-v0.so libtest1-v1.so
          Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function
          Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

          1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

            [C]'function void foo(opaque_type*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
              parameter 0 of type 'opaque_type*' has sub-type changes:
                in pointed to type 'struct opaque_type':
                  size changed from 64 to 96 bits
                  1 data member insertion:
                    'char opaque_type::added_member', at offset 0 (in bits)
                  2 data member changes:
                   'int opaque_type::member0' offset changed from 0 to 32
                   'char opaque_type::member1' offset changed from 32 to 64

       So abidiff reports that the opaque_type’s layout has changed in a significant way, as far as ABI implications are concerned, in theory.  After all, a sub-type (struct opaque_type) of an exported func‐
       tion (foo()) has seen its layout change.  This might have non negligible ABI implications.  But in practice here, the programmer of the litest1-v1.so library knows that the “soft” contract between the
       function foo() and the type struct opaque_type is to stay away from the data members of the type.  So layout changes of struct opaque_type should not impact foo().

       Now to teach abidiff about this soft contract and have it avoid emitting what amounts to false positives in this case, we write the suppression specification file below:

          $ cat test1.suppr
          [suppress_type]
            type_kind = struct
            name = opaque_type

       Translated in plain English, this suppression specification would read: “Do not emit change reports about a struct which name is opaque_type”.

       Let’s now invoke abidiff on the two versions of the library again, but this time with the suppression specification:

          $ abidiff --suppressions test1.suppr libtest1-v0.so libtest1-v1.so
          Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed (1 filtered out), 0 Added function
          Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

       As you can see, abidiff does not report the change anymore; it tells us that it was filtered out instead.

       Suppressing change reports about types with data member insertions

       Suppose the first version of a library named libtest3-v0.so has this source code:

          /* Compile this with:
               gcc -g -Wall -shared -o libtest3-v0.so test3-v0.c
           */

          struct S
          {
            char member0;
            int member1; /*
                            between member1 and member2, there is some padding,
                            at least on some popular platforms.  On
                            these platforms, adding a small enough data
                            member into that padding shouldn't change
                            the offset of member1.  Right?
                          */
          };

          int
          foo(struct S* s)
          {
            return s->member0 + s->member1;
          }

       Now, suppose the second version of the library named libtest3-v1.so has this source code in which a data member has been added in the padding space of struct S and another data member has  been  added
       at its end:

          /* Compile this with:
               gcc -g -Wall -shared -o libtest3-v1.so test3-v1.c
           */

          struct S
          {
            char member0;
            char inserted1; /* <---- A data member has been added here...  */
            int member1;
            char inserted2; /* <---- ... and another one has been added here.  */
          };

          int
          foo(struct S* s)
          {
            return s->member0 + s->member1;
          }

       In  libtest3-v1.so, adding char data members S::inserted1 and S::inserted2 can be considered harmless (from an ABI compatibility perspective), at least on the x86 platform, because that doesn’t change
       the offsets of the data members S::member0 and S::member1.  But then running abidiff on these two versions of library yields:

          $ abidiff libtest3-v0.so libtest3-v1.so
          Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function
          Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

          1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

            [C]'function int foo(S*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
              parameter 0 of type 'S*' has sub-type changes:
                in pointed to type 'struct S':
                  type size changed from 64 to 96 bits
                  2 data member insertions:
                    'char S::inserted1', at offset 8 (in bits)
                    'char S::inserted2', at offset 64 (in bits)
          $

       That is, abidiff shows us the two changes, even though we (the developers of that very involved library) know that these changes are harmless in this particular context.

       Luckily, we can devise a suppression specification that essentially tells abidiff to filter out change reports about adding a data member between S::member0 and S::member1, and adding a data member at
       the end of struct S.  We have written such a suppression specification in a file called test3-1.suppr and it unsurprisingly looks like:

          [suppress_type]
            name = S
            has_data_member_inserted_between = {offset_after(member0), offset_of(member1)}
            has_data_member_inserted_at = end

       Now running abidiff with this suppression specification yields:

          $ ../build/tools/abidiff --suppressions test3-1.suppr libtest3-v0.so libtest3-v1.so
          Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed (1 filtered out), 0 Added function
          Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

          $

       Hooora! \o/ (I guess)

       Suppressing change reports about types accessed either directly or through pointers

       Suppose we have a first version of an object file which source code is the file widget-v0.cc below:

          // Compile with: g++ -g -c widget-v0.cc

          struct widget
          {
            int x;
            int y;

            widget()
              :x(), y()
            {}
          };

          void
          fun0(widget*)
          {
            // .. do stuff here.
          }

          void
          fun1(widget&)
          {
            // .. do stuff here ..
          }

          void
          fun2(widget w)
          {
            // ... do other stuff here ...
          }

       Now suppose in the second version of that file, named widget-v1.cc, we have added some data members at the end of the type struct widget; here is what the content of that file would look like:

          // Compile with: g++ -g -c widget-v1.cc

          struct widget
          {
            int x;
            int y;
            int w; // We have added these two new data members here ..
            int h; // ... and here.

            widget()
              : x(), y(), w(), h()
            {}
          };

          void
          fun0(widget*)
          {
            // .. do stuff here.
          }

          void
          fun1(widget&)
          {
            // .. do stuff here ..
          }

          void
          fun2(widget w)
          {
            // ... do other stuff here ...
          }

       When we invoke abidiff on the object files resulting from the compilation of the two file above, here is what we get:

           $ abidiff widget-v0.o widget-v1.o
           Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 2 Changed (1 filtered out), 0 Added functions
           Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

           2 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

             [C]'function void fun0(widget*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
               parameter 1 of type 'widget*' has sub-type changes:
                 in pointed to type 'struct widget':
                   type size changed from 64 to 128 bits
                   2 data member insertions:
                     'int widget::w', at offset 64 (in bits)
                     'int widget::h', at offset 96 (in bits)

             [C]'function void fun2(widget)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
               parameter 1 of type 'struct widget' has sub-type changes:
                 details were reported earlier
          $

       I guess a little bit of explaining is due here.  abidiff detects that two data member got added at the end of struct widget.  it also tells us that the type change impacts the exported function fun0()
       which uses the type struct widget through a pointer, in its signature.

       Careful readers will notice that the change to struct widget also impacts the exported function fun1(), that uses type struct widget through a reference.  But then abidiff doesn’t tell  us  about  the
       impact on that function fun1() because it has evaluated that change as being redundant with the change it reported on fun0().  It has thus filtered it out, to avoid cluttering the output with noise.

       Redundancy  detection  and filtering is fine and helpful to avoid burying the important information in a sea of noise.  However, it must be treated with care, by fear of mistakenly filtering out rele‐
       vant and important information.

       That is why abidiff tells us about the impact that the change to struct widget has on function fun2().  In this case, that function uses the type struct widget directly (in its  signature).   It  does
       not  use  it  via  a pointer or a reference.  In this case, the direct use of this type causes fun2() to be exposed to a potentially harmful ABI change.  Hence, the report about fun2() is not filtered
       out, even though it’s about that same change on struct widget.

       To go further in suppressing reports about changes that are harmless and keeping only those that we know are harmful, we would like to go tell abidiff to suppress reports about this particular  struct
       widget change when it impacts uses of struct widget through a pointer or reference.  In other words, suppress the change reports about fun0() and fun1().  We would then write this suppression specifi‐
       cation, in file widget.suppr:

          [suppress_type]
            name = widget
            type_kind = struct
            has_data_member_inserted_at = end
            accessed_through = reference-or-pointer

            # So this suppression specification says to suppress reports about
            # the type 'struct widget', if this type was added some data member
            # at its end, and if the change impacts uses of the type through a
            # reference or a pointer.

       Invoking abidiff on widget-v0.o and widget-v1.o with this suppression specification yields:

          $ abidiff --suppressions widget.suppr widget-v0.o widget-v1.o
          Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed (2 filtered out), 0 Added function
          Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

          1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

            [C]'function void fun2(widget)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
              parameter 1 of type 'struct widget' has sub-type changes:
                type size changed from 64 to 128 bits
                2 data member insertions:
                  'int widget::w', at offset 64 (in bits)
                  'int widget::h', at offset 96 (in bits)
          $

       As expected, I guess.

       Suppressing change reports about functions.

       Suppose we have a first version a library named libtest2-v0.so whose source code is:

           $ cat -n test2-v0.cc

            1     struct S1
            2     {
            3       int m0;
            4
            5       S1()
            6         : m0()
            7       {}
            8     };
            9
           10     struct S2
           11     {
           12       int m0;
           13
           14       S2()
           15         : m0()
           16       {}
           17     };
           18
           19     struct S3
           20     {
           21       int m0;
           22
           23       S3()
           24         : m0()
           25       {}
           26     };
           27
           28     int
           29     func(S1&)
           30     {
           31       // suppose the code does something with the argument.
           32       return 0;
           33
           34     }
           35
           36     char
           37     func(S2*)
           38     {
           39       // suppose the code does something with the argument.
           40       return 0;
           41     }
           42
           43     unsigned
           44     func(S3)
           45     {
           46       // suppose the code does something with the argument.
           47       return 0;
           48     }
          $

       And then we come up with a second version libtest2-v1.so of that library; the source code is modified by making the structures S1, S2, S3 inherit another struct:

          $ cat -n test2-v1.cc
                1 struct base_type
                2 {
                3   int m_inserted;
                4 };
                5
                6 struct S1 : public base_type // <--- S1 now has base_type as its base
                7                              // type.
                8 {
                9   int m0;
               10
               11   S1()
               12     : m0()
               13   {}
               14 };
               15
               16 struct S2 : public base_type // <--- S2 now has base_type as its base
               17                              // type.
               18 {
               19   int m0;
               20
               21   S2()
               22     : m0()
               23   {}
               24 };
               25
               26 struct S3 : public base_type // <--- S3 now has base_type as its base
               27                              // type.
               28 {
               29   int m0;
               30
               31   S3()
               32     : m0()
               33   {}
               34 };
               35
               36 int
               37 func(S1&)
               38 {
               39   // suppose the code does something with the argument.
               40   return 0;
               41
               42 }
               43
               44 char
               45 func(S2*)
               46 {
               47   // suppose the code does something with the argument.
               48   return 0;
               49 }
               50
               51 unsigned
               52 func(S3)
               53 {
               54   // suppose the code does something with the argument.
               55   return 0;
               56 }
           $

       Now let’s build the two libraries:

          g++ -Wall -g -shared -o libtest2-v0.so test2-v0.cc
          g++ -Wall -g -shared -o libtest2-v0.so test2-v0.cc

       Let’s look at the output of abidiff:

          $ abidiff libtest2-v0.so libtest2-v1.so
          Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 3 Changed, 0 Added functions
          Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

          3 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

            [C]'function unsigned int func(S3)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
              parameter 0 of type 'struct S3' has sub-type changes:
                size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                1 base class insertion:
                  struct base_type
                1 data member change:
                 'int S3::m0' offset changed from 0 to 32

            [C]'function char func(S2*)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
              parameter 0 of type 'S2*' has sub-type changes:
                in pointed to type 'struct S2':
                  size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                  1 base class insertion:
                    struct base_type
                  1 data member change:
                   'int S2::m0' offset changed from 0 to 32

            [C]'function int func(S1&)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
              parameter 0 of type 'S1&' has sub-type changes:
                in referenced type 'struct S1':
                  size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                  1 base class insertion:
                    struct base_type
                  1 data member change:
                   'int S1::m0' offset changed from 0 to 32
          $

       Let’s tell abidiff to avoid showing us the differences on the overloads of func that takes either a pointer or a reference.  For that, we author this simple suppression specification:

          $ cat -n libtest2.suppr
               1 [suppress_function]
               2   name = func
               3   parameter = '0 S1&
               4
               5 [suppress_function]
               6   name = func
               7   parameter = '0 S2*
          $

       And then let’s invoke abidiff with the suppression specification:

          $ ../build/tools/abidiff --suppressions libtest2.suppr libtest2-v0.so libtest2-v1.so
          Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed (2 filtered out), 0 Added function
          Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

          1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

                 [C]'function unsigned int func(S3)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
                   parameter 0 of type 'struct S3' has sub-type changes:
                     size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                     1 base class insertion:
                       struct base_type
                     1 data member change:
                      'int S3::m0' offset changed from 0 to 32

       The suppression specification could be reduced using regular expressions:

          $ cat -n libtest2-1.suppr
                    1   [suppress_function]
                    2     name = func
                    3     parameter = '0 /^S.(&|\\*)/
          $

          $ ../build/tools/abidiff --suppressions libtest2-1.suppr libtest2-v0.so libtest2-v1.so
          Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed (2 filtered out), 0 Added function
          Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

          1 function with some indirect sub-type change:

                 [C]'function unsigned int func(S3)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
                   parameter 0 of type 'struct S3' has sub-type changes:
                     size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                     1 base class insertion:
                       struct base_type
                     1 data member change:
                      'int S3::m0' offset changed from 0 to 32
