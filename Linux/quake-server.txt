NAME
       quake-server - dedicated server for Quake

SYNOPSIS
       quake-server [WRAPPER-OPTIONS] [ENGINE-OPTIONS] [ENGINE-COMMANDS]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the quake-server command.

       Quake is a popular first-person shooter game that appeared in 1996, released by iD Software.  This wrapper script will launch the Quake dedicated server.

       The game data needs to be installed independently using the 'game-data-packager' program, and by default it will be looked for at /usr/share/games/quake.

       This  wrapper  script  accepts the two common GNU-style options to get information on the program.  Any further arguments are passed to the engine unmodified.  Consult the engine documentation for
       full details, but most engines support a syntax whereby engine switches are prefixed with a minus sign, and you can give console commands by prefixing with a plus sign.  See the  examples  section
       for some common cases.

OPTIONS
       These options are accepted for WRAPPER-OPTIONS in the synopsis.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.
