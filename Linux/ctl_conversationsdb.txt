NAME
       ctl_conversationsdb - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Perform operations on the conversations databases

SYNOPSIS
       ctl_conversationsdb [ -C config-file ] -d userid > text
       ctl_conversationsdb [ -C config-file ] -u userid < text
       ctl_conversationsdb [ -C config-file ] [ -v ] [ -z | -b | -R ] userid
       ctl_conversationsdb [ -C config-file ] [ -v ] [ -z | -b | -R ] -r

DESCRIPTION
       ctl_conversationsdb  is  used  to perform various administrative opera‐
       tions  on  a  conversations  database  and  associated  information  in
       cyrus.index files.

       ctl_conversationsdb   reads   its  configuration  options  out  of  the
       imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by -C.

       The configdirectory option in imapd.conf(5) is used  to  determine  the
       default location of the conversations database.

       In  the first synopsis, the -d option dumps the contents of a conversa‐
       tions database to standard output in an ASCII format.   In  the  second
       synopsis,  the  resulting  file  is fed back in, using the -u option to
       "undump" from standard input.  This pair of commands is useful for dis‐
       aster recovery, or for changing the backend used to store the conversa‐
       tions database.

       The third synopsis is used to reconstruct conversations information  in
       various ways for a specific user, and the fourth to reconstruct conver‐
       sations information for all users.  See OPTIONS below for details.

       This command was introduced in version 3.0.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the
              default imapd.conf(5).

       -d userid
              Dump  the  conversations  database which corresponds to the user
              userid to standard output in an  ASCII  format.   The  resulting
              file can be used to recreate a database using the -u option.

       -u userid
              "Undumps"  the  conversations database corresponding to the user
              userid, i.e. replaces all  the  entries  with  data  from  ASCII
              records  parsed from standard input.  The output from the -d op‐
              tion can be used as input.

       -v     Be more verbose when running.

       -r     Be recursive; apply the main operation to every user.   Warning:
              do not combine with -u, it will not do what you expect.

       -z     Remove all conversation information from the conversations data‐
              base for user userid, and from all the  user's  mailboxes.   The
              information  can  all  be recalculated (eventually) from message
              headers, using the -b option.

       -b     Rebuild all conversation information in the conversations  data‐
              base  for user userid, and in all the user's mailboxes, from the
              header information in messages.  Does not affect messages  which
              already have conversation information.

              This is a bulk mode version of what happens to each message when
              it arrives, and can be used to add missing conversation informa‐
              tion  for  past messages, e.g. after using -z or after upgrading
              Cyrus from older versions.  Note: this operation  uses  informa‐
              tion  from  cyrus.cache  files so it does not need to read every
              single message file.

       -R     Recalculate counts of messages stored in existing  conversations
              in  the  conversations database for user userid.  This is a lim‐
              ited subset of -b; in particular it does  not  create  conversa‐
              tions or assign messages to conversations.

       -S     If  given  with -b, allows splitting of conversations during the
              rewrite.   Only do this is  changing  the  maximum  conversation
              size and you need to split those existing conversations.
