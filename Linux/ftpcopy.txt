NAME
       ftpcp - copy files from a FTP server to the local machine

SYNOPSIS
       ftpcp ftp://host[:port]/directory local-dir

       or

       ftpcp host[:post] /directory local-dir

DESCRIPTION
       ftpcp is a frontend to the ftpcopy program. Calling

         ftpcp arguments ...

       has exactly the same results as calling

         ftpcopy -n arguments ...

       or, in other words: ftpcp calls ftpcopy -n, so that files already in the local directory are not deleted.
