DESCRIPTION
       Net::Remctl provides Perl bindings to the libremctl client library.  remctl is a protocol for remote command execution using GSS-API authentication.  The specific allowable commands must be listed
       in a configuration file on the remote system and the remote system can map the remctl command names to any local command without exposing that mapping to the client.  This module implements a
       remctl client.

   Simplified Interface
       If you want to run a single command on a remote system and get back the output and exit status, you can use the exported remctl() function:

       remctl(HOSTNAME, PORT, PRINCIPAL, COMMAND, [ARGS, ...])
           Runs  a  command on the remote system and returns a Net::Remctl::Result object (see below).  HOSTNAME is the remote host to contact.  PORT is the port of the remote remctld server and may be 0
           to tell the library to use the default (first try 4373, the registered remctl port, and fall back to the legacy 4444 port if that fails).  PRINCIPAL is the principal of the server to  use  for
           authentication;  pass  in the empty string to use the default of host/HOSTNAME, with the realm determined by domain-realm mapping.  The remaining arguments are the remctl command and arguments
           passed to the remote server.

           As far as the module is concerned, undef may be passed as PORT and PRINCIPAL and is the same as 0 and the empty string respectively.  However, Perl will warn about passing undef explicitly  as
           a function argument.

           The return value is a Net::Remctl::Result object which supports the following methods:

           error()
               Returns  the  error  message  from  either  the  remote  host  or from the local client library (if, for instance, contacting the remote host failed).  Returns undef if there was no error.
               Checking whether error() returns undef is the supported way of determining whether the remctl() call succeeded.

           stdout()
               Returns the command's standard output or undef if there was none.

           stderr()
               Returns the command's standard error or undef if there was none.

           status()
               Returns the command's exit status.

           Each call to remctl() will open a new connection to the remote host and close it after retrieving the results of the command.  To maintain a  persistent  connection,  use  the  full  interface
           described below.

   Full Interface
       The full remctl library interface requires that the user do more bookkeeping, but it provides more flexibility and allows one to issue multiple commands on the same persistent connection (provided
       that the remote server supports protocol version two; if not, the library will transparently fall back to opening a new connection for each command).

       To  use  the  full  interface,  first  create  a  Net::Remctl  object  with  new()  and  then connect() to a remote server.  Then, issue a command() and call output() to retrieve output tokens (as
       Net::Remctl::Output objects) until a status token is received.  Destroying the Net::Remctl object will close the connection.

       Methods below are annotated with the version at which they were added.  Note that this is the version of the remctl distribution, which only matches the Net::Remctl  module  version  in  3.05  and
       later.  Earlier versions of the module used an independent versioning system that is not documented here, and versions earlier than 3.05 are therefore not suitable for use with "use".

       The supported object methods are:

       new()
           [2.8] Create a new Net::Remctl object.  This doesn't attempt to connect to a host and hence will only fail (by throwing an exception) if the library cannot allocate memory.

       error()
           [2.8] Retrieves the error message from the last failing operation and returns it as a string.

       set_ccache(CCACHE)
           [3.00]  Sets  the  GSS-API credential cache for outgoing connections to CCACHE, which is normally the path to a Kerberos ticket cache but may have other valid forms depending on the underlying
           Kerberos implementation in use by GSS-API.  This method will affect all subsequent open() calls on at least the same object, but will have no effect  on  connections  that  are  already  open.
           Returns true on success and false on failure.

           If  the remctl client library was built against a Kerberos library and the GSS-API library supported gss_krb5_import_cred, this call affects only this Net::Remctl object.  Otherwise, this will
           affect not only all subsequent open() calls for the same object, but all subsequent remctl connections of any kind from the same process, and even  other  GSS-API  connections  from  the  same
           process unrelated to remctl.

           Not all GSS-API implementations support setting the credential cache.  If this is not supported, false will be returned.

       set_source_ip(SOURCE)
           [3.00]  Sets  the  source  IP  for outgoing connections to SOURCE, which can be either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address (if IPv6 is supported).  It must be an IP address, not a host name.  This will
           affect all subsequent open() calls on the same object, but will have no effect on connections that are already open.  Returns true on success and false on failure.

       set_timeout(TIMEOUT)
           [3.01] Sets the timeout for connections and commands to TIMEOUT, which should be an integer number of seconds.  TIMEOUT may be 0 to clear a timeout that was  previously  set.   All  subsequent
           operations  on  this  Net::Remctl  object  will  be subject to this timeout, including open() if called prior to calling open().  Returns true on success and false on failure.  Failure is only
           possible if TIMEOUT is malformed.

           The timeout is a timeout on network activity from the server, not on a complete operation.  So, for example, a timeout of ten seconds just requires that the server send  some  data  every  ten
           seconds.  If the server sends only tiny amounts of data at a time, the complete operation could take much longer than ten seconds without triggering the timeout.

       open(HOSTNAME[, PORT[, PRINCIPAL]])
           [2.8]  Connect  to  HOSTNAME  on port PORT using PRINCIPAL as the remote server's principal for authentication.  If PORT is omitted or 0, use the default (first try 4373, the registered remctl
           port, and fall back to the legacy 4444 port if that fails).  If PRINCIPAL is omitted or the empty string, use the default of host/HOSTNAME, with the realm determined by  domain-realm  mapping.
           Returns true on success, false on failure.  On failure, call error() to get the failure message.

           As  far as the module is concerned, undef may be passed as PORT and PRINCIPAL and is the same as 0 and the empty string respectively.  However, Perl will warn about passing undef explicitly as
           a function argument.

       command(COMMAND[, ARGS, ...])
           [2.8] Send the command and arguments to the remote host.  The command and the arguments may, under the remctl protocol, contain any character, but be aware that most remctl servers will reject
           commands or arguments containing ASCII 0 (NUL), so currently this cannot be used for upload of arbitrary unencoded binary data.  Returns  true  on  success  (meaning  success  in  sending  the
           command, and implying nothing about the result of the command), false on failure.  On failure, call error() to get the failure message.

       output()
           [2.8] Returns the next output token from the remote host.  The token is returned as a Net::Remctl::Output object, which supports the following methods:

           type()
               Returns  the  type  of  the  output  token,  which will be one of "output", "error", "status", or "done".  A command will result in either one "error" token or zero or more "output" tokens
               followed by a "status" token.  After either a "error" or "status" token is seen, another command can be issued.  If the caller tries to retrieve another output token when  it  has  already
               consumed all of them for that command, the library will return a "done" token.

           data()
               Returns  the contents of the token.  This method only makes sense for "output" and "error" tokens; otherwise, it will return undef.  Note that the returned value may contain any character,
               including ASCII 0 (NUL).

           length()
               Returns the length of the data in the token.  As with data(), this method only makes sense for the "output" and "error" tokens.  It will return 0 if there is no data  or  if  the  data  is
               zero-length.

           stream()
               For  an  "output"  token,  returns the stream with which the data is associated.  Currently, only two stream values will be used: 1, meaning standard output; and 2, meaning standard error.
               The value is undefined for all other output token types.

           status()
               For a "status" token, returns the exit status of the remote command.  The value is undefined for all other token types.

           error()
               For an "error" token, returns the remctl error code for the protocol error.  The text message will be returned by data().  The value is undefined for all other token types.

       noop()
           [3.00] Send a NOOP message to the server and read the reply.  This is primarily used to keep a connection to a remctl server alive, such as through a firewall with  a  session  timeout,  while
           waiting to issue further commands.  Returns true on success, false on failure.  On failure, call error() to get the failure message.

           The  NOOP  message  requires  protocol  version  3 support in the server, so the caller should be prepared for this function to fail, indicating that the connection could not be kept alive and
           possibly that it was closed by the server.  In this case, the client will need to explicitly reopen the connection with open().

       Note that, due to internal implementation details in the library, the Net::Remctl::Output object returned by output() will be invalidated by the next call to command() or output() or by destroying
       the producing Net::Remctl object.  Therefore, any data in the output token should be processed and stored if needed before making any further Net::Remctl method calls on the same object.

COMPATIBILITY
       The main object methods are annotated above with the version in which that interface was added.  All unannotated methods have been present since the first release of the module.

       Support for the gss_krb5_import_cred method of isolating the changed ticket cache to only this remctl client object was added in version 3.5.

       The default port was changed to the IANA-registered port of 4373 in version 2.11.

       This module was first released with version 2.8.

CAVEATS
       If the principal argument to remctl() or remctl_open() is NULL, most GSS-API libraries will canonicalize the host using DNS before deriving the principal  name  from  it.   This  means  that  when
       connecting  to a remctl server via a CNAME, remctl() and remctl_open() will normally authenticate using a principal based on the canonical name of the host instead of the specified host parameter.
       This behavior may cause problems if two consecutive DNS lookups of host may return two different results, such as with some DNS-based load-balancing systems.

       The canonicalization behavior is controlled by the GSS-API library; with the MIT Kerberos GSS-API library, canonicalization can be disabled by setting "rdns" to false in the [libdefaults]  section
       of  krb5.conf.   It  can  also  be disabled by passing an explicit Kerberos principal name via the principal argument, which will then be used without changes.  If canonicalization is desired, the
       caller may wish to canonicalize host before calling remctl() or remctl_open() to avoid problems with multiple DNS calls returning different results.

       The default behavior, when the port is not specified, of trying 4373 and falling back to 4444 will be removed in a future version of  this  module  in  favor  of  using  the  "remctl"  service  in
       /etc/services if set and then falling back on only 4373.  4444 was the poorly-chosen original remctl port and should be phased out.

NOTES
       The remctl port number, 4373, was derived by tracing the diagonals of a QWERTY keyboard up from the letters "remc" to the number row.
