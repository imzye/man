NAME
       kakasi-config - script to get information about the installed version of KAKASI

SYNOPSIS
       kakasi-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--help] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       kakasi-config  is  a  tool  that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use KAKASI. It is also used internally to the .m4
       macros for GNU autoconf that are included with KAKASI.

OPTIONS
       kakasi-config accepts the following options:

       --help  Print the help text and exit.

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of KAKASI on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a KAKASI program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a KAKASI program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that KAKASI was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec pre‐
               fix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified,  use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that GTK+ was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified before
               any --libs or --cflags options.
