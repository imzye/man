NAME
       cgioptions.cfg - Command-line parameters for the Xymon CGI tools

SYNOPSIS
       $XYMONHOME/etc/cgioptions.cfg

DESCRIPTION
       cgioptions.cfg(1)  controls the command-line options passed to all of the Xymon CGI tools through their respective shell-script wrappers. Typically the options listed here are used for system-wide
       configuration of the CGI utilities, e.g. to define where they read configuration files.

       The exact set of command-line options available are described in the man-page for each of the CGI utilities.

       The file is "sourced" into the shell script wrapper, so assignments to the CGI-specific variables must follow standard shell-script syntax.
