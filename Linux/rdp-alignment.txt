NAME
       rdp-alignment: - Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) alignment tools package

SYNOPSIS
       rdp-alignment <subcommand> <options>

DESCRIPTION
       The Alignment tools package contains commands to do defined community analysis, pairwise alignment and hidden markov model (HMMER3 models, no training).

OPTIONS
       List of subcommands:

       alignment-merger
              - Merge alignments

       pairwise-knn
              - Compute k-nearest-neighbors by pairwise alignment

       compare-error-type
              - Detect insertion, deletion and substitution errors in sequences comparing to reference sequences

       align-nucl-to-prot
              - Transfer a sequence alignment from protein sequences to nucleotide sequences

       rm-partialseq
              - remove partial sequences based on pairwise alignment to reference sequences
