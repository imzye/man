NAME
       autodep8 - DEP-8 test control file generator

DESCRIPTION
       autodep8 will detect well-known types of packages and generate DEP-8-compliant test control files for them. It can be used by DEP-8 implementations to support implicit test control files.

USAGE
           $ autodep8                 # assumes source package in current dir
           $ autodep8 /path/to/srcpkg # path to source package

       If a known package type is detected, autodep8 exits with 0 and prints the suggested contents of debian/tests/control to the standard output.

       If a known package type is NOT detected, autodep8 exits with 1 and produces not output.

AUTOMATIC USAGE BY AUTOPKGTEST
       autodep8 can be automatically called by autopkgtest(1). To achieve that, you must set the Testsuite: field in the source package paragraph to autopkgtest-pkg-TYPE, where TYPE if one of package
       types supported by autodep8. The valid values of TYPE are listed below as the headings of the "EXAMPLES OF PRODUCED TEST CONTROL FILES" section.

       See the autopkgtest(1) documentation for more details.

HOW THE PACKAGE TYPE IS DETECTED
       autodep8 will first look for Testsuite: autopkgtest-pkg-TYPE field in debian/control. if TYPE is a known package type, then that is used. If not, each supported package type is tried against a set
       of heuristics, based on packages names, build dependencies. specific files under debian/, or a combination of those.

PACKAGE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION
       Packages can provide configuration for autodep8 in debian/tests/autopkgtest-pkg-${PACKAGETYPE}.conf. The file format is the following:

           # comment lines start with # and are ignored.
           # note that #'s only mark comments when in the beginning of the line
           # empty lines are also ignored

           # values are set in this format:
           var1=value1

           # spaces around the = sign are allowed
           var2 = value 2

           # backslashes allow one to set values that span multiple lines.
           # Note that the newline is removed in the final value, though
           # The following is equivalent to "multilinevar=value1, value2"
           multilinevar = value1, \
           value2

       The following configuration variables are supported:

   All package types
       extra_depends: extra test dependencies to be added to the generated tests.  Will be included as-is in the generated control file.

       extra_restrictions: extra restrictions to be added to the generated tests.  Will be included as-is in the generated control file.

       architecture: Adds restrictions on what architecture the generated tests are suitable to run on.  Will be included as-is in the generated control file.

   octave (debian/tests/autopkgtest-pkg-octave.conf)
       test_env: value for the DH_OCTAVE_TEST_ENV environment variable that will be used when invoking dh_octave_check. The default value of DH_OCTAVE_TEST_ENV is "xvfb -a".

   python (debian/tests/autopkgtest-pkg-python.conf)
       import_name: name of the module to import, if it cannot be inferred from the name of the Debian package. For example, `python3-xlib` is used via `import Xlib`, so `import_name = Xlib` would be
       appropriate.  This used to be configured by writing to `debian/tests/pkg-python/import-name`, but that is now deprecated.

COMBINING AUTO-GENERATED TESTS WITH MANUALLY SPECIFIED ONES
       If `debian/tests/control` exists, autodep8 will prepend the contents of that file to its own output. In that case, autodep8 will exit with a status of 0 even if no known package type is detected.
       The same applies for `debian/tests/control.autodep8`, but the use of that file is deprecated because the test dependencies defined there aren't processed by dpkg-source.
