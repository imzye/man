NAME
       ccmake - CMake Curses Dialog Command-Line Reference

SYNOPSIS
          ccmake [<options>] -B <path-to-build> [-S <path-to-source>]
          ccmake [<options>] <path-to-source | path-to-existing-build>

DESCRIPTION
       The ccmake executable is the CMake curses interface.  Project configuration settings may be specified interactively through this GUI.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal
       when the program is running.

       CMake  is  a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name CMake‐
       Lists.txt.  Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.

OPTIONS
       -S <path-to-source>
              Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.

       -B <path-to-build>
              Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.

              If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

       -C <initial-cache>
              Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

              When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from
              which to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's CMake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the project's default values.  The given  file  should  be  a
              CMake script containing set() commands that use the CACHE option, not a cache-format file.

              References to CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR within the script evaluate to the top-level source and build tree.

       -D <var>:<type>=<value>, -D <var>=<value>
              Create or update a CMake CACHE entry.

              When  CMake  is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting
              that takes priority over the project's default value.  The option may be repeated for as many CACHE entries as desired.

              If the :<type> portion is given it must be one of the types specified by the set() command documentation for its CACHE signature.  If the :<type> portion is omitted the entry will  be  cre‐
              ated with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a command in the project sets the type to PATH or FILEPATH then the <value> will be converted to an absolute path.

              This option may also be given as a single argument: -D<var>:<type>=<value> or -D<var>=<value>.

              It's  important to note that the order of -C and -D arguments is significant. They will be carried out in the order they are listed, with the last argument taking precedence over the previ‐
              ous ones. For example, if you specify -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug, followed by a -C argument with a file that calls:

                 set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)

              then the -C argument will take precedence, and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE will be set to Release. However, if the -D argument comes after the -C argument, it will be set to Debug.

              If a set(... CACHE ...) call in the -C file does not use FORCE, and a -D argument sets the same variable, the -D argument will take precedence regardless of order because of the  nature  of
              non-FORCE set(... CACHE ...) calls.

       -U <globbing_expr>
              Remove matching entries from CMake CACHE.

              This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ? are supported.  The option may be repeated for as many CACHE entries
              as desired.

              Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non-working.

       -G <generator-name>
              Specify a build system generator.

              CMake  may  support  multiple native build systems on certain platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating a particular build system.  Possible generator names are specified in the
              cmake-generators(7) manual.

              If not specified, CMake checks the CMAKE_GENERATOR environment variable and otherwise falls back to a builtin default selection.

       -T <toolset-spec>
              Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.

              Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell the native build system how to choose a compiler.  See the CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET variable for details.

       -A <platform-name>
              Specify platform name if supported by generator.

              Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the native build system to choose a compiler or SDK.  See the CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM variable for details.

       --toolchain <path-to-file>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify the cross compiling toolchain file, equivalent to setting CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable. Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the build directory, and if not  found,  rela‐
              tive to the source directory.

       --install-prefix <directory>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify the installation directory, used by the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable. Must be an absolute path.

       -Wno-dev
              Suppress developer warnings.

              Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files. By default this will also turn off deprecation warnings.

       -Wdev  Enable developer warnings.

              Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files. By default this will also turn on deprecation warnings.

       -Wdeprecated
              Enable deprecated functionality warnings.

              Enable warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.

       -Wno-deprecated
              Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.

              Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.

       -Werror=<what>
              Treat CMake warnings as errors. <what> must be one of the following:

              dev    Make developer warnings errors.

                     Make warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files errors. By default this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors.

              deprecated
                     Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.

                     Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files, errors.

       -Wno-error=<what>
              Do not treat CMake warnings as errors. <what> must be one of the following:

              dev    Make warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files not errors. By default this will also turn off deprecated warnings as errors.

              deprecated
                     Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files, not errors.
