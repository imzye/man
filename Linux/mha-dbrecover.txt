NAME
       mha-dbrecover - rebuild a MHonArc archive database

SYNOPSIS
       mha-dbrecover [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mha-dbrecover is a utility program that is part of the MHonArc software
       package.  The program allows can be used to rebuild a MHonArc archive
       database from the HTML message files.  This allows database recovery if
       the database gets corrupted or accidentally deleted.

       The documentation for MHonArc is distributed in HTML format.  Due to
       its size and organization, it is not suited for manpage format.
       Consult your system administrator for where the documentation has been
       installed, or see "AVAILABILITY" on where you can access the
       documentation on the web.

OPTIONS
       mha-dbrecover takes all the options available to mhonarc along with the
       following additional options:

       "-dbr-startnum" #
           The starting message number to recover data from.  This option is
           useful if you have many message files in a directory, but you only
           want to recover a subset of the files.

           If this option is not specified, the starting number is 0.

       "-dbr-endnum" #
           The ending message number to recover data from.  This option is
           useful if you have many message files in a directory, but you only
           want to recover a subset of the files.

           If this option is not specified, all messages starting from
           "-dbr-startnum" will be recovered.

       NOTE: Only a subset of the options available to mhonarc are actually
       supported since many options are not applicable for recovering
       operations.
