DESCRIPTION
       The application described by this document, diagram-viewer, is a lightweight processor for tklib diagram files

       diagram-viewer is based upon the package diagram.  See it for examples and language reference.

   USE CASES
       diagram-viewer was written with the following two use cases in mind.

       [1]    Processing and display of one or more diagram files.

       [2]    Batch conversion of one or more diagram files into raster image files.

   COMMAND LINE
       diagram-viewer show inputfile...
              This is the form for use case [1]. The application opens a gui showing the list of input files to the left, allowing the user to choose which of them to render to the canvas on the right.

       diagram-viewer convert -o output format inputfile...
              This is the form for use case [2]. The application converts the input files into raster image of the specified format.

              path output (in)
                     This argument specifies where to write the generated image. It can be the path to a file or directory.

                     If the output does not exist then [file dirname $output] has to exist and must be a writable directory.

                     In case of multiple input files the generated image will be written to a file in the directory, and the name of that file will be derived from the inputfile, and format.

                     In case of a single input file the generated image will be written to the file.

              (handle) format (in)
                     This  argument  specifies the image format to convert the diagrams into when processing the input. The application recognizes all formats supported by the Img package, i.e. for which
                     it can load a package img::format (together with canvas::snap), and all formats for which it can load a package canvas::format. These are (currently) mvg, and pdf.

              path inputfile (in)
                     This argument specifies the path to the diagram file to process. It has to exist, must be readable, and written in diagram format.
