NAME
       pwo2xsf - convert the pw.x output file to XSF format

SYNOPSIS
       pwo2xsf [special-option] coordinates-option [file]

DESCRIPTION
       pwo2xsf  extracts atomic structures from pw.x output file and prints the XSF formated structure data to standard output.  It is a utility program of xcrysden package (http://www.xcrysden.org/) and
       XSF is the native xcrysden structure format (http://www.xcrysden.org/doc/XSF.html).

       If file is not specified then standard input is read.

SPECIAL OPTION
       -r dim
           Reduce periodic dimension to dim, i.e., dim = 2, 1, or 0.

COORDINATES OPTIONS
       These options specify which cordinates to extract. The possibilities are:

       -ic file
       --inicoor file
           Extract the initial, that is, input ionic coordinates.

       -lc file
       --latestcoor file
           Extract the latest printed ionic coordinates from pw.x output file.

       -oc file
       --optcoor file
           Similar to "--latestcoor" but extracts just the optimized coordinates if present or else nothing.

       -a file
       --animxsf file
           Extract the coordinates of all ionic steps as Animated-XSF.

       -nc file
       --nebcoor PW.out
           Extract the coordinates and forces from the PW.out file of NEB (path) calculation.
