NAME
       mpt-status - retrieve configuration and health status from LSI hardware RAID controllers

SYNOPSIS
       mpt-status [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The mpt-status software is a query tool to access the running configuration and status of LSI SCSI HBAs.  mpt-status allows you to monitor the health and status of your RAID setup.

OPTIONS
          --autoload
              This will try to automatically load the mptctl kernel module.

       -u --controller <int>
              Set the IOC unit (controller).

       -h --help
              Print some help information.

       -n --newstyle
              Use  the new style output. This parameter was introduced to retain backwards compatibility. If not set, you get the old style output.  It is very likely that the output of the newstyle for‐
              mat will change heavily in the future, so do not rely on it when writing plugins for monitoring software, for example.

       -i --set_id <int>
              Set id of primary device (check README).

       -p --probe_id
              Use this to probe SCSI id's when not on id 0.

       -q --quiet
              Do not display any warnings.

       -s --status_only
              Only print the status information. This can be used for easy scripting

       -v --verbose
              Print verbose information, such as warnings

       -V --version
              Print version information

       -d --debug [<int>]
              Enable debugging and set level optionally.  NOTE: This is not fully implemented yet.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The program's exit(2) status is meant to be interpreted as a bit mask. If everything went well, zero is returned. If not (i.e. if for example an error or unknown condition is detected),  the  bits
       of the return value shall be interpreted as:
       Bit   Value   Meaning
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
         0       1   Abnormal condition / unknown error
         1       2   A logical volume has failed
         2       4   A logical volume is degraded
         3       8   A logical volume is resyncing
         4      16   At least one physical disk failed
         5      32   At least one physical disk is in warning condition

REPORTING BUGS
       Report  bugs  to your linux distribution or software vendor, if mpt-status was bundled on your installation. If you have been compiling mpt-status from the vanilla sources and experience problems,
       redirect them to preferably <ratz@drugphish.ch> or <rnibali@pyx.ch>.

BUGS
       Besides design bugs, gross software engineering and missing features, this software is considered pretty stable and can be used in production environments.
