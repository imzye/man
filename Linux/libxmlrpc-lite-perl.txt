NAME
       XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP - Server/Client side HTTP support for XMLRPC::Lite

SYNOPSIS
       Client
             use XMLRPC::Lite
               proxy => 'http://localhost/',
             # proxy => 'http://localhost/cgi-bin/xmlrpc.cgi', # local CGI server
             # proxy => 'http://localhost/',                   # local daemon server
             # proxy => 'http://login:password@localhost/cgi-bin/xmlrpc.cgi', # local CGI server with authentication
             ;

             print getStateName(1);

       CGI server
             use XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP;

             my $server = XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::CGI
               -> dispatch_to('methodName')
               -> handle
             ;

       Daemon server
             use XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP;

             my $daemon = XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::Daemon
               -> new (LocalPort => 80)
               -> dispatch_to('methodName')
             ;
             print "Contact to XMLRPC server at ", $daemon->url, "\n";
             $daemon->handle;

DESCRIPTION
       This  class  encapsulates  all  HTTP related logic for a XMLRPC server, independent of what web server it's attached to.  If you want to use this class you should follow simple guideline mentioned
       above.

   PROXY SETTINGS
       You can use any proxy setting you use with LWP::UserAgent modules:

        XMLRPC::Lite->proxy('http://endpoint.server/',
                            proxy => ['http' => 'http://my.proxy.server']);

       or

        $xmlrpc->transport->proxy('http' => 'http://my.proxy.server');

       should specify proxy server for you. And if you use "HTTP_proxy_user" and "HTTP_proxy_pass" for proxy authorization SOAP::Lite should know how to handle it properly.

   COOKIE-BASED AUTHENTICATION
         use HTTP::Cookies;

         my $cookies = HTTP::Cookies->new(ignore_discard => 1);
           # you may also add 'file' if you want to keep them between sessions

         my $xmlrpc = XMLRPC::Lite->proxy('http://localhost/');
         $xmlrpc->transport->cookie_jar($cookies);

       Cookies will be taken from response and provided for request. You may always add another cookie (or extract what you need after response) with HTTP::Cookies interface.

       You may also do it in one line:

         $xmlrpc->proxy('http://localhost/',
                        cookie_jar => HTTP::Cookies->new(ignore_discard => 1));

   COMPRESSION
       XMLRPC::Lite provides you option for enabling compression on wire (for HTTP transport only). Both server and client should support this capability, but this logic should be absolutely  transparent
       for your application.  Server will respond with encoded message only if client can accept it (client sends Accept-Encoding with 'deflate' or '*' values) and client has fallback logic, so if server
       doesn't  understand  specified encoding (Content-Encoding: deflate) and returns proper error code (415 NOT ACCEPTABLE) client will repeat the same request not encoded and will store this server in
       per-session cache, so all other requests will go there without encoding.

       Having options on client and server side that let you specify threshold for compression you can safely enable this feature on both client and server side.

       Compression will be enabled on client side IF: threshold is specified AND size of current message is bigger than  threshold  AND  module  Compress::Zlib  is  available.  Client  will  send  header
       'Accept-Encoding' with value 'deflate' if threshold is specified AND module Compress::Zlib is available.

       Server  will  accept  compressed  message if module Compress::Zlib is available, and will respond with compressed message ONLY IF: threshold is specified AND size of current message is bigger than
       threshold AND module Compress::Zlib is available AND header 'Accept-Encoding' is presented in request.
