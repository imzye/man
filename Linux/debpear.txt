NAME
       debpear - automatically builds and installs PEAR packages as Debian packages

SYNOPSIS
       debpear [options] <pear-package-name>

DESCRIPTION
       debpear is a tool to automatically create and build a Debian package out of a PHP PEAR package. It will download the PEAR package from pear.php.net, then by looking into it, create the corre‐
       sponding Debian package, and eventually also installs it.

PARAMETERS
       <pear-package-name>

              Defines the PEAR package name you want to install, as seen on the http://pear.php.net/ site. Make sure respect the case in the name of the package (for example: Package_NAME).

OPTIONS
       --build-dir|-b

              Specify the directory where the Debian package will be built.

       --verbose|-v

              Makes debpear more verbose.

       --channel|-c channel-alias

              Specify the channel-alias which provide from the pear-channels package, pear and pecl channel.

       --tarball|-t tarball --pkg-version|-pv pkg-version [ --wget|-w URL ]

              Do  not use "pear download" to optain the PEAR package from upstream authors.  Instead, use tarball and use pkg-version when building the package.  Eventually also download the tarball
              from URL using wget before building.

       --install|-i

              Install the resulting debian package in your system. Note that you must be root to use this option. If you aren't root, then debpear will try to get root using sudo.

EXAMPLE
       debpear -i Auth_RADIUS

              This will create a php-auth-radius package in ./build-area, and automatically install it. Because it's written in the package.xml shipped with Auth_RADIUS at pear.php.net, php-auth-ra‐
              dius will depend on php5-radius.

       debpear -t current.tgz -pv 1.3.1 -w http://downloads.jasig.org/cas-clients/php/current.tgz CAS

              Downloads cas-clients from http://downloads.jasig.org/cas-clients/php/current.tgz, as current.tgz in the current directory, then builds it as if it was downloaded as  CAS-1.3.1.tgz  by
              "pear download".

       debpear -c pecl gnupg

              This will create a php-gnupg package from the pecl.php.net channel.

       debpear -c phpunit DbUnit

              This will create a php-dbunit package from the pear.phpunit.de channel.

IMPORTANT
              Note  that the debian/copyright file generated by debpear isn't good enough for redistribution of the created packages. You should carefuly review the PEAR package license before doing
              so. Also, debpear has been created for convenience, but it will never replace the manual work of an experienced Debian maintainer for creating PEAR packages. It can, however,  be  used
              to create a template package quickly, before a careful review, in order to save time building a Debian PEAR package.
