NAME
       nodau - simple console notetaking program

SYNOPSIS
       nodau <OPTION> [DATA]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the nodau command.

       nodau is a simple console notetaking program.

   OPTIONS:
       help   print this message

       list [SEARCH]
              list notes, accepts optional search term

       new <NAME>
              create new note, <NAME> must be unique

       encrypt <NAME>
              encrypt a new or existing note

       decrypt <NAME>
              decrypt an existing note

       edit <NAME>
              open an existing note for editing

       append <NAME>
              when piping data from stdin, append it to any existing data instead of overwritting

       show <NAME>
              display an existing note

       del <SEARCH>
              delete a note/notes, accepts name or search term

       rename <OLD> <NEW>
              rename an existing note

   SEARCH TERM:
              search  terms  with  spaces do not need to be inside "quotes". One exception to this convention is rename, in which speaces are used as delimiter between old name and new name. In such case
              use "quotes" in either argument to denote spaces in note's name.
              <NAME>          name of a note, list will search for names similar to the term, del will delete only an exact match
              t@<DATESTRING>  matches notes created at a given date/time
              t-<DATESTRING>  matches notes created before a given date/time
              t+<DATESTRING>  matches notes created after a given date/time

   DATE STRING:
              <DATESTRING> can be made of any typical date format such as:
              dd/mm/yy
              dd, mm, yyyy hh:mm

   EDITING:
              By default nodau will use the EDITOR environment variable to edit notes, simply edit the file as usual, nodau will save the note to it's database when you exit the editor. If EDITOR is  not
              set the nodau builtin editor will be used.
              Use  of  the  builtin editor can be forced by setting `force_builtin_editor = true' in the nodau config file.  Alternatively, the external_editor config setting can be set to use a specific
              editor regardless of the EDITOR environment variable value. `force_builtin_editor = true' takes precedence over EDITOR and external_editor settings.
              The builtin editor accepts standard printable characters, enter, and backspace. There is no support for moving the cursor with the arrow keys or mouse. To exit the editor and save the note,
              create a new line with only a dot (.) on it, or press escape.

   ENCRYPTION:
              Encrypting a note will apply DES encryption to the note using a passphrase which is requested from the user during the process.  The passphrase is then required to decrypt,  edit,  or  read
              the note. Decrypting a note will restore the note as plain text, and the passphrase will no longer be required for access.

   CONFIGURATION FILE:
              The nodau config file is located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nodau/nodau.conf which is typically ~/.config/nodau/nodau.conf.

              The following config settings are currently in use:

              SETTING                    VALUES                DEFAULT
              external_editor            name of a text editor executable (vim, nano,etc).
              force_builtin_editor       true or false         false
              import_old_db              true or false         true
              edit_autocreate            true of false         true

              If import_old_db value is true or not set, nodau will import notes from the 0.2.x database to the 0.3.x database.
