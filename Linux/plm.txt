NAME
       PLM - Cross-platform Programming Exerciser

SYNOPSIS
       plm

DESCRIPTION
       The Programmer's Learning Machine (PLM) is a free cross-platform programming exerciser. It lets you explore various concepts of programming through interactive exercises, that you can solve in ei‐
       ther Java, python or scala (see below for the Scala support).  The interface and the whole content is thoughtfully translated to English and French, and mostly translated to Brazilian and Italian.

       The following lessons are included in this package:

       . Welcome:   Teaches the basics of programming to absolute beginners

       . Maze:      Presents some classical maze escaping algorithms for intermediate

       . Sort:      Focuses  on  the  classical  sorting algorithms for intermediate. One introduction lesson presents the basics of the sorting algorithms while two additional lessons apply them in more
                    recreating settings.

       . Recursion: Dives into classical logo algorithms for intermediate

       . Turtle Art:
                    Presents a few classical LOGO figures; your imagination will certainly explore this world further.

       . LightBot:  Constitutes a little programmer's brain teaser for intermediate and advanced

       This program is released under the GNU General Public License, while the content is released under the CC-BY-SA version. It requires Java version 1.6 or higher, either from OpenJDK or from another
       vendor.

CONFIGURATION
       PLM does not accept any command-line switch or options; every elements are configured either through the user-defined property file, or within the graphical interface directly.

FUTURE EVOLUTION
       Other lessons are planned to explore new concepts, such as the backtracking, dynamic programming, object-oriented programming or the standard libraries of python and Java. Other  programming  lan‐
       guages  (such  as ruby or JavaScript) may be added in the future. We hope that the translation of the interface and content to other human languages will be contributed by the community in the fu‐
       ture.

FILES
       ~/.plm/plm.properties
              User-configured properties.

       ~/.plm/plm.users
              List of PLM users defined on this machine.

       ~/.plm/<UUID>/
              Save files for each user. This contains the text that you provided to solve the exercises. You can copy them over to another machine to continue your work, but you probably  don't  want  to
              manually mess up with these files. If both machines are connected to the Internet, it is much easier to recreate a user with the same UUID on the second machine, and let the PLM synchronize
              the files for you.
