NAME
       rfdump — Tool to detect RFID-Tags and show their meta information

SYNOPSIS
       rfdump [-p /dev/ttyS?]  [--setupreader]  [file.xml]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rfdump command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       rfdump  is  a tool to detect RFID-Tags and show their meta information: Tag ID, Tag Type, manufacturer etc. The User-Data of a tag can be displayed and modified using either a Hex or an ASCII edi‐
       tor. In addition, the integrated cookie feature demonstrates how easy it is for a company to abuse RFID technology to spy on their customers.  rfdump works with the ACG Multi-Tag Reader or similar
       card reader hardware.
