NAME
       wmmenugen - Window Maker PropList menu generator

SYNOPSIS
       wmmenugen [options...]  -parser=<name> fspec [fspec...]  [-parser=<name> fspec [fspec...]...]

DESCRIPTION
       wmmenugen  generates a menu in the PropList format for Window Maker from the input file fspec.  In the case where fspec is a directory instead of a file, then wmmenugen will read all the files present
       in the hierarchy of this directory.

OPTIONS
       --help, -h
              print a help message with the list of options

       -parser
              specify the format of the file to be parsed

       --version
              print the version of Window Maker from which the program comes

PARSERS
       wmmenugen supports these file formats for input files:

       wmconfig
              the format of the menu generation tool for X of the same name

       xdg    the format of the menu specification as defined by the FreeDesktop standard, currently at version 1.1

RETURN VALUE
       The exit status from the wmmenugen command provides information for the caller:

       0      when the PropList menu was successfully generated on stdout.

       1      when a fspec caused a problem (non readable file, ...)

       2      the arguments of the command line where not recognised

       3      the program met an unexpected menu structure; you probably want to look at the section BUGS below.

BUGS
       If you get the exit status 3 with the unclear error message about unprocessed levels on the stack, you encountered a limitation of wmmenugen.  It would be a good idea to prepare an  archive  with  the
       files incriminated and submit them to the mailing list (wmaker-dev@googlegroups.com) with you command line, so the team can work on improving the behaviour of the program on this case.
