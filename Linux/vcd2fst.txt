VCD2FST(1)                    Filetype Conversion                   VCD2FST(1)

NAME
       vcd2fst - Converts VCD files to FST files

SYNTAX
       vcd2fst [option]... [VCDFILE] [FSTFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Converts VCD files to FST files.

OPTIONS
       -v,--vcdname <filename>
              Specify  VCD/FSDB/VPD/WLF  input  filename.  Processing of file‐
              types other than VCD requires that  the  appropriate  2vcd  con‐
              verter was found during ./configure.

       -f,--fstname <filename>
              Specify FST output filename.

       -4,--fourpack
              Indicates  that  LZ4  should  be  used  for  value  change  data
              (default).

       -F,--fastpack
              Indicates that fastlz should be used instead of  LZ4  for  value
              change data.

       -4,--zlibpack
              Indicates  that  zlib  should  be  used instead of LZ4 for value
              change data.

       -c,--compress
              Indicates that the entire file should be  run  through  gzip  on
              close.   This  results in much smaller files at the expense of a
              one-time decompression penalty on file open during reads.

       -p,--parallel
              Indicates that parallel mode should be enabled.  This  spawns  a
              worker  thread  to continue with FST block processing while con‐
              version continues on the main thread for new FST block data.

       -h,--help
              Show help screen.

       EXAMPLES

       Note that you should specify  dumpfile.vcd  directly  or  use  "-"  for
       stdin.

       vcd2fst dumpfile.vcd dumpfile.fst --compress
              This  indicates  that  the FST file should be post-compressed on
              close.
