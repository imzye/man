NAME
       ujconv -- reinvented iconv(1) using Unicode::Japanese

SYNOPSIS
         ujconv [-f from_encoding] [-t to_encoding] [-s string] [files...]
         ujconv -l
         ujconv -h
         ujconv -V

VERSION
       ujconv 0.02

DESCRIPTION
       ujconv is an iconv-like tool which is written in perl using Unicode::Japanese.

       ujconv reads text from STDIN or files, convert them, and print them to STDOUT.

       Available options are as follows. Each options can be in short form (-f) or long form (--from):

       -f,--from from_encoding
           Convert characters from from_encoding. Unlike iconv this option can be omitted. In that case, the encoding of the input is guessed by ujconv.

       -t,--to to_encoding
           Convert characters to to_encoding.

       -s,--string string
           Input from the argument string instead of file or STDIN.

       -l,--list
           List all available encodings, one name per each lines.

       -h,--help
           Print a short help message.

       -V,--version
           Print the version of ujconv.
