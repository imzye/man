NAME
       tappy - a tap consumer for python

SYNOPSIS
       tappy [options] <pathname> [<pathname> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  tappy command consumes the list of tap files given as pathname s and produces an output similar to what the regular text test-runner from python's unittest module would. If pathname points to
       a directory, tappy will look in that directory for *.tap files to consume.

       If you have a tool that consumes the unittest regular output, but wish to use the TAP protocol to better integrate with other tools, you may use tappy to replay tests from .tap files, without hav‐
       ing to actually run the tests again (which is much faster).

       It is also an example of how to use the tap consumer API provided by the tap module.

       WARNING:
          tappy's output will differ from the standard unittest output. Indeed it cannot reproduce error and failure messages (e.g. stack traces, ...) that are not recorded in tap files.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show a short description and option list and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              produce verbose output
