NAME
       scrappie - basecaller for Nanopore sequencer

DESCRIPTION
       Scrappie is a technology demonstrator for the Oxford Nanopore Technologies Limited Research Algorithms group.

       Basic usage: * scrappie events        Base call from event based data.  * scrappie help          Print general help or help about specific Scrappie command.  * scrappie licence       Print licens‐
       ing  information.   *  scrappie raw           Base call directly from raw signal.  * scrappie version       Print version information.  * scrappie squiggle      Create approximate squiggle for se‐
       quence * scrappie mappy         Map signal to approximate squiggle * scrappie seqmappy      Map signal to sequence via basecall posteriors * scrappie event_table   Output table of events for read

       This project began life as a proof (bet) that a base caller could be written in a low level language in under 8 hours.  Some of the poor and just plain odd design decisions, along with the lack of
       documentation, are a result of its inception. In keeping with ONT's fish naming policy, the project was originally called Crappie.

       Scrappie's purpose is to demonstrate the next generation of base calling and, as such, may change drastically between releases and breaks backwards compatibility.  Newer versions may drop  support
       of current features or change their behaviour.
