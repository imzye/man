NAME
       ocamlwc - count the lines of code and comments in OCaml sources

SYNOPSIS
       ocamlwc [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       ocamlwc  is  a  program  to count the number of lines of code and documentation in OCaml sources.  It assumes its input to be lexically well-formed.  If no files are given, then ocamlwc reads from
       stdin.

       The first column of the output lists the number of source lines of code, the second column the number of lines of documentation, and the third the respective filename.  If  ocamlwc  acts  on  more
       than one file, then it prints a total in the last line.

OPTIONS
       -p     Print percentage of documentation (in an additional column after the filename).

       -c     Print only the code size, i.e., omit the documentation column.

       -e     (everything) Do not skip headers.  A header is the first comment in a file.

       -a     (all)  Do  not  skip  generated  files.  foo.ml is a generated file if one of foo.mll, foo.mly, or foo.ml4 is amongst the given files.  foo.mli is a generated file if foo.mly is amongst the
              given files.

       -h     Print short usage information.
