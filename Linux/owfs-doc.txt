DESCRIPTION
   1-Wire
       1-wire is a wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector scheme where the data line can also provide
       power.

       Each device is uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage,  contact,  current),  switches,
       timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also 1-wire devices that have encryption included.

       The  1-wire  scheme  uses  a single bus master and multiple slaves on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be individually discovered and addressed using their
       unique ID.

       Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB adapters.

   OWFS design
       OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique ID being the  direc‐
       tory, and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.

       Details  of  the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or control ap‐
       plications. There are some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.  Still  the  fundamental
       goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed.

   EDS00XX Overview
       The EDS00XX sensors are a family of devices from Embedded Data Systems.  Although provisional support for several types is included, only early EDS0071 has been tested with OWFS.

       The sensors all share the same 7E family code. They have the same first memory page layout with a text tag property that describes them, and a sub-type field giving the particular sensor. The data
       properties shown in a directory listing will be specific to the sensor sub-type.

   EDS0071
       The EDS0071 (3) is a micro-processor based 1-wire slave made by EDS (Embedded Data Systams). Is uses a high accuracy and extended range RTD sensor to accurately measure temperatures.

   Memory
       The EDS00XX sensors are read and controlled by accessing parts of their on-chip memory. Although the raw memory contents are exposed in the memory and pages fields, all the available functionality
       is best accessed by the other fields. In fact, directly changing memory will confuse OWFS.

   Relay and LED
       All the EDS00XX sensors have an LED and optional relay. Both can be controlled either directly, or when the sensors reaches an alarm state.

ADDRESSING
       All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:

       Family Code
              8 bits

       Address
              48 bits

       CRC    8 bits

       Addressing under OWFS is in hexadecimal, of form:

              01.123456789ABC

       where 01 is an example 8-bit family code, and 12345678ABC is an example 48 bit address.

       The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
