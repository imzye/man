NAME
       lib3ds-config - script to get information about the installed version of lib3ds

SYNOPSIS
       lib3ds-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       lib3ds-config  is  a  tool  that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use lib3ds. It is also used internally to the .m4
       macros for GNU autoconf that are included with lib3ds.

OPTIONS
       lib3ds-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of lib3ds on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a lib3ds program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a lib3ds program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that lib3ds was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec pre‐
               fix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that lib3ds was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified before
               any --libs or --cflags options.
