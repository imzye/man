NAME
       news - display system news

SYNOPSIS
       news [-adDeflnpvxs] [[article1] [article2] ..]

DESCRIPTION
       The  news command keeps you informed of news concerning the system.  Each news item is contained in a separate file in the /var/lib/sysnews directory. Anyone having write permission to this direc‐
       tory can create a news file.

       If you run the news command without any flags, it displays every unread file in the /var/lib/sysnews directory.

       Each file is preceded by an appropriate header. To avoid reporting old news, the news command stores a  currency  time.  The  news  command  considers  your  currency  time  to  be  the  date  the
       $HOME/.news_time  file was last modified. Each time you read the news, the modification time of this file changes to that of the reading. Only news item files posted after this time are considered
       unread.
