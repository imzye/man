NAME
       guess-upstream-metadata - guess upstream package metadata

DESCRIPTION
       guess-upstream-metadata  [-h]  [--trust]  [--disable-net-access] [--check] [--consult-external-directory] [--version] [path] This tool tries to guess upstream metadata (Homepage, Contact, VCS
       Repository) information from a Debian package. It does this by parsing various files in the package, and possibly calling out to external services (unless --disable-net-access is specified).

   positional arguments:
              path

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --trust
              Whether to allow running code from the package.

       --disable-net-access
              Do not probe external services.

       --check
              Check guessed metadata against external sources.

       --consult-external-directory
              Pull in external (not maintained by upstream) directory data

       --version
              show program's version number and exit
