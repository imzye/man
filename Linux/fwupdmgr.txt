       This tool allows an administrator to query and control the fwupd daemon, allowing them to perform actions such as installing or downgrading firmware.

SCRIPTING
       A variety of client tools are provided by fwupd.  Not all tools are suggested to be scripted.

       fwupdmgr is a command line fwupd client intended to be used interactively. The output between versions of fwupd is not guaranteed to be stable. Commands that
       succesfully execute will return "0". Commands that have no actions but succesfully execute will return "2".

       fwupdagent is a command line fwupd client intended to be used by scripts. The output is JSON and guaranteed to be stable. Commands that  succesfully  execute
       will return "0".
