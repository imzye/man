AUTHORS
       This Program has been rewritten by the last author Jaroslav Fojtik, Email (try one of these): JaFojtik@seznam.cz, JaFojtik@yandex.com.

       There are some other ports of this code. But now I hope, that this release is best one.

BUGS
       Tabbings are sometimes interpreted incorrectly.  Captions of formulas is loosed.  Many WP features remain unconverted.  There remain many other LaTeX warnings during TeX processing.
