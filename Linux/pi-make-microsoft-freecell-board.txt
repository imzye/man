NAME
       pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board, make_pysol_freecell_board.py - Programs to generate boards to be used as input to Freecell Solver.

SYNOPSIS
       pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board [-t] board-number

       or for make_pysol_freecell_board.py:

       make_pysol_freecell_board.py [-t] [-F] [--ms] board-number [game-string]

DESCRIPTION
       These programs are command-line programs that can generate the initial board of the games of several popular Solitaire implementations. Those boards can be in turn be input to fc-solve by means of a
       pipeline, or placed inside a file for safe-keeping.

       make_pysol_freecell_board.py also accepts an optional third argument which indicates the game variants. This type defaults to Freecell, but is useful for generating the boards of other games. Note
       that using this flag still requires one to use the "--game" flag of fc-solve, if necessary.

       make_pysol_freecell_board.py also accepts a flag called -F or --pysolfc that deals the PySolFC boards instead of the classic PySol ones, and one called --ms or -M that deals Microsoft
       Freecell/Freecell Pro deals even for higher seeds.

       A common paradigm for using those programs is something like:

           bash:~$ pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board -t 11982 | fc-solve -l gi

       If the "-t" option is specified, then the 10 cards are printed with "T"'s, instead of "10"'s. While fc-solve can accept either as input, it may prove useful for other solvers or solitaire
       implementations which do not accept "10"'s.

       Here is a short description of each program:

       make_pysol_freecell_board.py

       A Python script that generates the boards of the various games of PySol.

       pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board

       A program that generates the boards of Microsoft Freecell and of the Freecell Pro implementation of Freecell.
