NAME
       clitest - performs automatic testing in command lines

SYNOPSIS
       clitest [options] <file ...>

DESCRIPTION
       Clitest is a portable POSIX shell script that performs automatic testing in Unix command lines. This script was carefully coded to be portable between POSIX shells

       It's the same concept as in Python's doctest module: you document both the commands and their expected output, using the familiar interactive prompt format, and a specialized tool tests them.

       The clitest command searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Unix command lines, and then executes those command lines to verify that they work exactly as shown.
