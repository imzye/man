String::Flogger(3pm)                                                                User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                String::Flogger(3pm)

NAME
       String::Flogger - string munging for loggers

VERSION
       version 1.101246

SYNOPSIS
         use String::Flogger qw(flog);

         my @inputs = (
           'simple!',

           [ 'slightly %s complex', 'more' ],

           [ 'and inline some data: %s', { look => 'data!' } ],

           [ 'and we can defer evaluation of %s if we want', sub { 'stuff' } ],

           sub { 'while avoiding sprintfiness, if needed' },
         );

         say flog($_) for @inputs;

       The above will output:

         simple!

         slightly more complex

         and inline some data: {{{ "look": "data!" }}}

         and we can defer evaluation of stuff if we want

         while avoiding sprintfiness, if needed

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That
       is, if the most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

METHODS
   flog
       This method is described in the synopsis.

   format_string
         $flogger->format_string($fmt, \@input);

       This method is used to take the formatted arguments for a format string (when "flog" is passed an arrayref) and turn it into a string.  By default, it just uses ""sprintf" in perlfunc".
