STAG-AUTOSCHEMA(1p)                                                                   User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                   STAG-AUTOSCHEMA(1p)

NAME
       stag-autoschema - writes the implicit stag-schema for a stag file

SYNOPSIS
         stag-autoschema -w sxpr sample-data.xml

         stag-autoschema -dtd sample-data.xml

DESCRIPTION
       Takes a stag compatible file (xml, sxpr, itext), or a file in any format plus a parser, and writes out the implicit underlying stag-schema

       stag-schema should look relatively self-explanatory.

       Here is an example stag-schema, shown in sxpr syntax:

         (db
          (person*
           (name "s"
           (address+
            (address_type "s")
            (street "s")
            (street2? "s")
            (city "s")
            (zip? "s")))))

       The database db contains zero or more persons, each person has a mandatory name and at least one address.

       The cardinality mnemonics are as follows:

       +   1 or more

       ?   0 or one

       *   0 or more

       The default cardinality is 1

ARGUMENTS
       -p|parser FORMAT
           FORMAT is one of xml, sxpr or itext, or the name of a perl module

           xml assumed as default

       -dtd
           exports schema as DTD

       -w|writer FORMAT
           FORMAT is one of xml, sxpr or itext, or the name of a perl module, OR DTD

           The default is sxpr

           note that stag schemas exported as xml will be invalid xml, due to the use of symbols *, +, ? in the node names

LIMITATIONS
       not event based - memory usage becomes exhorbitant on large files; prepare a small sample beforehand
