NAME
       seinfo - SELinux policy information tool

SYNOPSIS
       seinfo [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION] [POLICY]

DESCRIPTION
       seinfo allows the user to query the components of a SELinux policy.

POLICY
       A single file containing a binary policy. This file is usually named by
       version on Linux systems, for example, policy.30. This file is  usually
       named  sepolicy  on  Android  systems.   If no policy file is provided,
       seinfo will search for the policy running on the current system. If  no
       policy can be found, seinfo will print an error message and exit.
