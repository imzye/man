RACLUSTER(1)                General Commands Manual               RACLUSTER(1)

NAME
       racluster - aggregate argus(8) data files.

SYNOPSIS
       racluster [-f conf] [-m agr(s)] [-M mode(s)] [raoptions] [-- filter-ex‐
       pression]

DESCRIPTION
       Racluster reads  argus  data  from  an  argus-data  source,  and  clus‐
       ters/merges the records based on the flow key criteria specified either
       on the command line, or in a racluster configuration file, and  outputs
       a  valid  argus-stream.   This  tool is primarily used for data mining,
       data management and report generation.

       The default action is to merge status records from the  same  flow  and
       argus  probe,  providing in some cases huge data reduction with limited
       loss of flow information.  Racluster provides the ability to modify the
       flow  model key, either using the "-m" option, or in the racluster.conf
       file, allowing records to be clustered  based  on  any  number  of  at‐
       tributes.   This supports the development of important reports, such as
       MPLS LSP usage statistics, DiffServe flow marking policy  verification,
       VLAN group behavior, IP distance related measurements, routing loop de‐
       tection, traceroute path data recovery, and complex availability/reach‐
       ability reports, to name just a few useful applications.

       Please  see  racluster.5  for  detailed information regarding racluster
       configuration.

OPTIONS
       Racluster, like all ra based clients, supports a number of  ra  options
       including filtering of input argus records through a terminating filter
       expression, and the ability to specify the  output  style,  format  and
       contents for printing data.  See ra(1) for a complete description of ra
       options.  racluster(1) specific options are:

              ias            intermediate node origin AS number, if available.

       -M modes
           Supported modes are:
              correct        Attempt to correct the direction of flows by also
                             searching the reverse flow key, if a match  isn't
                             found  in  the cache.  This mode is on by default
                             when using the default full 5-tuple flow key def‐
                             initions.
              nocorrect      Turn  off  flow  correction  for direction.  This
                             mode is used by default if the flow key has  been
                             changed.
              norep          Do  not  generate an aggregate statistic for each
                             flow.  This is used  primarily  when  the  output
                             represents  a single object.  Primarily used when
                             merging status records to generate  single  flows
                             that represent single transactions.
              rmon           Generate  data  suitable for producing RMON types
                             of metrics.
              ind            Process each input file  independantly,  so  that
                             after   the  end  of  each  inputfile,  racluster
                             flushes its output.
              replace        Replace each inputfile contents, with the  aggre‐
                             gated output. The initial file compression status
                             is maintained

       -V  Verbose operation, printing a line of output for  each  input  file
           processed.  Very useful when using the ra() -R option.

INVOCATION
       A  sample  invocation  of  racluster(1).  This call reads argus(8) data
       from inputfile and aggregates the TCP protocol based argus(8) data.  By
       default, racluster(1) merges using the standard 5-tuple flow key.  This
       method is used to merge multiple status  records  into  a  single  flow
       record per transaction.

       A  sample  invocation  of  racluster(1).  This call reads argus(8) data
       from inputfile and aggregates the TCP  protocol  based  argus(8)  data,
       based  on  the  source and destination address matrix and the protocol.
       It reports the metrics as a percent of the total.
