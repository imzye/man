NAME
       openarena-server - OpenArena dedicated server

SYNOPSIS
       openarena-server [-h|--help] [-q|--quiet] [+set option value]...

DESCRIPTION
       openarena-server is the dedicated server for the first-person shooter OpenArena.

OPTIONS
       The wrapper script used for OpenArena in Debian accepts these options:

       -h, --help
              Display a short help summary

       -q, --quiet
              Disable all output

       Any  console  command  can also be prefixed with + and used as a command-line option (run the server in a terminal to use the console).  The +set command is generally the most useful to use on the
       command line.

ENVIRONMENT
       The wrapper script used to launch OpenArena allows it to be debugged by setting environment variables.

       OPENARENA_DEBUGGER=command
              A debugger or other prefix to prepend to the OpenArena command line, such as strace; overridden by OPENARENA_BACKTRACE

       OPENARENA_BACKTRACE=1
              Use gdb(1) to get a backtrace if OpenArena crashes (the gdb package must be installed for this to work)
