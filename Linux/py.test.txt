PYTEST(1)                                                                      pytest                                                                      PYTEST(1)

NAME
       pytest - pytest usage

       SEE ALSO:
          Complete pytest command-line flag reference

       In  general, pytest is invoked with the command pytest (see below for other ways to invoke pytest). This will execute all tests in all files whose names fol‐
       low the form test_*.py or \*_test.py in the current directory and its subdirectories. More generally, pytest follows standard test discovery rules.

SPECIFYING WHICH TESTS TO RUN
       Pytest supports several ways to run and select tests from the command-line.

       Run tests in a module

          pytest test_mod.py

       Run tests in a directory

          pytest testing/

       Run tests by keyword expressions

          pytest -k "MyClass and not method"

       This will run tests which contain names that match the given string expression (case-insensitive), which can include Python  operators  that  use  filenames,
       class names and function names as variables.  The example above will run TestMyClass.test_something  but not TestMyClass.test_method_simple.

       Run tests by node ids

       Each  collected  test is assigned a unique nodeid which consist of the module filename followed by specifiers like class names, function names and parameters
       from parametrization, separated by :: characters.

       To run a specific test within a module:

          pytest test_mod.py::test_func

       Another example specifying a test method in the command line:

          pytest test_mod.py::TestClass::test_method

       Run tests by marker expressions

          pytest -m slow

       Will run all tests which are decorated with the @pytest.mark.slow decorator.

       For more information see marks.

       Run tests from packages

          pytest --pyargs pkg.testing

       This will import pkg.testing and use its filesystem location to find and run tests from.

GETTING HELP ON VERSION, OPTION NAMES, ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
          pytest --version   # shows where pytest was imported from
          pytest --fixtures  # show available builtin function arguments
          pytest -h | --help # show help on command line and config file options

PROFILING TEST EXECUTION DURATION
       Changed in version 6.0.

       To get a list of the slowest 10 test durations over 1.0s long:

          pytest --durations=10 --durations-min=1.0

       By default, pytest will not show test durations that are too small (<0.005s) unless -vv is passed on the command-line.

MANAGING LOADING OF PLUGINS
   Early loading plugins
       You can early-load plugins (internal and external) explicitly in the command-line with the -p option:

          pytest -p mypluginmodule

       The option receives a name parameter, which can be:

       • A full module dotted name, for example myproject.plugins. This dotted name must be importable.

       • The entry-point name of a plugin. This is the name passed to setuptools when the plugin is registered. For example to early-load the pytest-cov plugin  you
         can use:

            pytest -p pytest_cov

   Disabling plugins
       To disable loading specific plugins at invocation time, use the -p option together with the prefix no:.

       Example: to disable loading the plugin doctest, which is responsible for executing doctest tests from text files, invoke pytest like this:

          pytest -p no:doctest

OTHER WAYS OF CALLING PYTEST
   Calling pytest through python -m pytest
       You can invoke testing through the Python interpreter from the command line:

          python -m pytest [...]

       This  is  almost equivalent to invoking the command line script pytest [...]  directly, except that calling via python will also add the current directory to
       sys.path.

   Calling pytest from Python code
       You can invoke pytest from Python code directly:

          retcode = pytest.main()

       this acts as if you would call "pytest" from the command line.  It will not raise SystemExit but return the exit code instead.  You can pass in  options  and
       arguments:

          retcode = pytest.main(["-x", "mytestdir"])

       You can specify additional plugins to pytest.main:

          # content of myinvoke.py
          import pytest
          import sys

          class MyPlugin:
              def pytest_sessionfinish(self):
                  print("*** test run reporting finishing")

          if __name__ == "__main__":
              sys.exit(pytest.main(["-qq"], plugins=[MyPlugin()]))

       Running it will show that MyPlugin was added and its hook was invoked:

          $ python myinvoke.py
          *** test run reporting finishing

       NOTE:
          Calling pytest.main() will result in importing your tests and any modules that they import. Due to the caching mechanism of python's import system, making
          subsequent calls to pytest.main() from the same process will not reflect changes to those files between the calls. For this reason, making multiple  calls
          to pytest.main() from the same process (in order to re-run tests, for example) is not recommended.
