NAME
       tpm_setpresence- change TPM physical presence states or settings

SYNOPSIS
       tpm_setpresence [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm_setpresence reports the status of the TPM's flags regarding physical presence.  This is the default behavior and also accessible via the --status option. Requesting a report of this status prompts
       for the owner password.  The --assert option changes the TPM to the physically present state.  The --clear option changes the TPM to the not present state.  The --lock option locks the TPM to the
       current physical presence state for the current boot cycle.  The --enable-cmd option allows the TPM to accept local commands to toggle physical presence states. The --disable-cmd option prevents the
       TPM from accepting local commands to toggle physical presence states.  The --enable-hw option allows the TPM to accept hardware signals to toggle physical presence states. The --disable-hw option
       prevents the TPM from accepting hardware signals to toggle physical presence states.  The --set-lifetime-lock option locks the Command and Hardware enablement flags in their current state permenantly.
       This option can never be undone.  The system will attempt to use the owner password to display the current states before preceding unless the --yes option is given to answer yes to all questions.  All
       changes are made with the TSC_Physical Presence API.

       -h, --help
              Display command usage info.

       -v, --version
              Display command version info.

       -l, --log [none|error|info|debug]
              Set logging level.

       -u, --unicode
              Use TSS UNICODE encoding for passwords to comply with applications using TSS popup boxes

       -s, --status
              Report current physical presence states.

       -a, --assert
              Assert that an admin is physically present at the machine.

       -c, --clear
              Remove the assertion that an admin is physically present at the machine.

       --lock Lock the assertions of physical presence in there current states until a reboot.

       --enable-cmd
              Allow use of commands to signal an admin is physically present.

       --disable-cmd
              Disallow use of commands to signal an admin is physically present.

       --enable-hw
              Allow use of hardware signals to signal an admin is physically present.

       --disable-hw
              Disallow use of hardware signals to signal an admin is physically present.

       --set-lifetime-lock
              Allow no further changes to the flags controling how physical presence can be signaled.  This is PERMANENT.

       -y, --yes
              Answer yes to all questions.  Only applicable with --set-lifetime-lock.

       -z, --well-known
              Authenticate using 20 bytes of zeros as owner password (the default TSS Well Known Secret), instead of prompting for an owner password.
