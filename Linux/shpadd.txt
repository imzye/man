NAME
       shpadd - append a shape to an ESRI shapefile

SYNOPSIS
       shpadd shp_file [[x y] [+]]*

DESCRIPTION
       Appends  a  shape  to the shapefile determined from shp_file. The geometric data of the new shape consists of lists of X/Y points on the command line grouped into parts, with points in different parts
       separated by a plus (+) sign. If no points or parts are given then a shape of type NullShape is appended to the shapefile, and otherwise the type of the new shape  is  determined  by  the  shapefile´s
       header.  See shpdump(1) for a description of shape types and how geometric data for parts are interpreted for a specific type. No geometric restrictions set by the shapefile specification are enforced
       by shpadd(1).

       Shapefiles actually consist of two files with the same basename and extensions .shp and .shx (or .SHP and .SHX) containing the shape data and shape index respectively. The files to open are determined
       by first stripping any filename extension from file and attempting to open the files shp_file.shp or shp_file.SHP, and shp_file.shx or shp_file.SHX for the respective data and index files.

OPTIONS
       shp_file
              the name of an existing shapefile.

       x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn
              the  set  of x,y coordinates that describes the shape that you wish to add. Note that you must specify the correct number of parameters for a given type of shapefile. e.g.: for point shapefiles
              you have to pass 1 pair of XY coordinates and for a polygon shapefile you should pass at least 4 pairs of XY coordinates (where the first and the last point must have the same coordinates).

EXAMPLE
       shpadd testpolygon 100000 7000000 250000 6500000 200000 6000000 100000 7000000

       assuming that testpolygon is a polygon shapefile, this command line will insert a new shape (a triangle) into testpolygon with the following XY coordinates:

           vertice 0: 100000 7000000 (this will also be the vertice where the shape starts and ends)
           vertice 1: 250000 6500000
           vertice 2: 200000 6000000
           vertice 3: 100000 7000000

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Missing shp_file argument, the shapefile can´t be opened, or the program ran out of memory.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stdout:

       Unable to open:shp_file

       Out of memory

BUGS
       Coordinate values that can´t be be parsed by sscanf(3) get undefined values. There´s no way to give measure or Z data to vertices in a shape, but those are always set to zero if the shapefile´s  shape
       type requires those values. MultiPatch shape types aren´t supported.
