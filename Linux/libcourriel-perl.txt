NAME
       Courriel::Header - A single header's name and value

VERSION
       version 0.49

SYNOPSIS
         my $subject = $headers->get('subject');
         print $subject->value;

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a single header, which consists of a name and value.

API
       This class supports the following methods:

Courriel::Header->new( ... )
       This method requires two attributes, "name" and "value". Both must be strings. The "name" cannot be empty, but the "value" can.

   $header->name()
       The header name as passed to the constructor.

   $header->value()
       The header value as passed to the constructor.

   $header->as_string( charset => $charset )
       Returns the header name and value with any necessary MIME encoding and folding.

       The "charset" parameter specifies what character set to use for MIME-encoding non-ASCII values. This defaults to "utf8". The charset name must be one recognized by the Encode module.

   $header->stream_to( output => $output, charset => ... )
       This method will send the stringified header to the specified output. The output can be a subroutine reference, a filehandle, or an object with a "print()" method. The output may be sent as a
       single string, as a list of strings, or via multiple calls to the output.

       See the "as_string()" method for documentation on the "charset" parameter.

ROLES
       This class does the "Courriel::Role::Streams" role.
