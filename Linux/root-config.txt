NAME
       root-config - ROOT utility for your Makefiles

SYNOPSIS
       root-config [options]

DESCRIPTION
       root-config is a tool that is used to configure and determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use ROOT.

              CPPFLAGS  += $(shell root-config --cflags)
              LDLIBS    += $(shell root-config --libs)
              LDFLAGS   += $(shell root-config --ldflags)

              %Cint.cxx:Include.h LinkDef.h
                      rootcint -f $@ -c $^

       in your Makefile to use the built-in rules of GNU make. For GUIs, replace --libs by --glibs.

       You  may  also find the automake(1), autoconf(1), and libtool(1) macro file /usr/share/aclocal/root.m4 useful.  If that macro file isn't installed where aclocal will find it, copy the contents to your
       local acinclude.m4 file.  In the directories you use ROOT libraries, have in your Makefile.am file:

              lib_LTLIBRARIES         = libFoo.la
              pkginclude_HEADERS      = Foo.h
              noinst_HEADERS          = FooCint.h
              libFoo_la_SOURCES       = Foo.cxx FooCint.cxx
              libFoo_la_LDFLAGS       = -version-info 1:0 -R @ROOTLIBDIR@
              libFoo_la_LDADD         = -lCore -lCint @ROOTAUXLIBS@

              BUILT_SOURCES           = FooCint.cxx FooCint.h

              AM_CPPFLAGS             = -I@ROOTINCDIR@
              AM_LDFLAGS              = -L@ROOTLIBDIR@
              CLEANFILES              = *Cint.cxx *Cint.h *~ core

              %Cint.cxx %Cint.h:Include.h LinkDef.h
                      @ROOTCINT@ -f $*Cint.cxx -c $(INCLUDES) $(AM_CPPFLAGS) $^

       where you should substitute Foo with whatever, and list the appropriate source files in the _SOURCES variable. In you configure.in file, put:

              AC_PROG_CC
              AC_PROG_CXX
              ROOT_PATH
              AM_PROG_LIBTOOL

       along with any other macros you may need.

       Note that the ROOT_PATH macro takes three optional arguments: the minimal ROOT version to use, action if ROOT is found, and action if ROOT isn't found.  Some examples are

              ROOT_PATH(3.03/05, , AC_MSG_ERROR(Your ROOT version is too old))
              ROOT_PATH(, AC_DEFUN(HAVE_ROOT))

       For example, if you want to compile some part of your source tree conditionally on wether ROOT is present or not, you can put in your configure.in file

              ROOT_PATH(,
              [
                AC_DEFUN(HAVE_ROOT)
                have_root=yes
              ])
              AM_CONDITIONAL(GOT_ROOT, test "x$have_root" = "xyes")

       And then in some Makefile.am

              EXTRA_SOURCES       = root_dependent_source.cc
              if GOT_ROOT
              LIBFOOXTRA              = root_dependent_source.cc
              else
              LIBFOOXTRA              =
              endif

              lib_LTLIBRARIES         = libFoo.la
              libFoo_la_SOURCES   = Foo.cc  $(LIBFOOXTRA)

       ROOTINCDIR
              Where the ROOT headers are

       ROOTCFLAGS
              Extra compiler flags

       ROOTLIBS
              ROOT basic libraries

       ROOTGLIBS
              ROOT basic + GUI libraries

       ROOTAUXLIBS

OPTIONS
       --help Give a short list of options available, and exit

       --version
              Report the version number of installed ROOT, and exit.

       --prefix=<prefix>
              If no arguments are given, reports where ROOT is installed. With an argument of =<prefix>, set the base of the subsequent options to <prefix>. If \--exec-prefix is passed with an  argument,  it
              overrides the argument given to \--prefix for the library path.

       --exec-prefix=<prefix>
              If  no  argument  is  given,  report  where  the libraries are installed. If an argument is given, use that as the installation base directory for the libraries. This option does not affect the
              include path.

       --libdir
              Print the directory where the ROOT libraries are installed.

       --incdir
              Print the directory where the ROOT headers are installed.

       --libs Output a line suitable for linking a program against the ROOT libraries. No graphics libraries are included.

       --glibs
              As above, but also output for the graphics (GUI) libraries.

       --evelibs
              As above, but also output for the graphics libraries and Eve libraries.

       --cflags
              Output a line suitable for compiling a source file against the ROOT header (class declararion) files.

       --new  Put the libNew.so library in the library lists.  This option must be given before options --libs and --glibs.

       --nonew
              Compatiblity option, does nothing.

       --auxlibs
              Print auxiliary libraries and/or system linker flags.

       --noauxlibs
              Do not print auxiliary libraries and/or system linker flags in the output of --libs and --glibs.  --auxcflags Print auxiliary compiler flags.

       --noauxcflags
              Do not print auxiliary compiler flags in the output of --cflags.

       --noldflags
              Do not print library path link option in output of --libs, --evelibs and --glibs.

       --ldflags
              Print additional linker flags (eg. -m64)

       --arch Print the architecture (compiler/OS)

       --platform
              Print the platform (OS)

       --bindir
              Print the binary directory of the root installation (location of the root executable)

       --etcdir
              Print the configuration directory (place of system.rootrc, mime type, valgrind suppression files and .desktop files)

       --config
              Print arguments used for ./configure as used when building root. These cannot be used for ./configure if root was built with CMake.

       --git-revision
              Print the ROOT git revision number from which root was built.

       --has-<feature>
              Test if <feature> has been enabled in the build process.

       --features
              Print list of all supported features

       --ncpu Print number of available (hyperthreaded) cores

       --python-version
              Print the Python version used by ROOT

       --cc   Print alternative C compiler specified when ROOT was built

       --cxx  Print alternative C++ compiler specified when ROOT was built
