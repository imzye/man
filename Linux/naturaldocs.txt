NAME
       NaturalDocs - an extensible, multi-language documentation generator

SYNOPSIS
       naturaldocs -i <input (source) directory> [-i <input (source) directory> ...] -o <output format> <output directory> [-o <output format> <output directory> ...] -p <project directory> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the .B naturaldocs command. Note that naturaldocs is a wrapper script that on Debian invokes the real NaturalDocs perl program. So, the real, original name of
       the program is NaturalDocs but on Debian systems you invoke it as naturaldocs.

       Natural Docs is is an open-source, extensible, multi-language documentation generator. You document your code in a natural syntax that reads like plain English. Natural Docs then scans  your  code
       and builds high-quality HTML documentation from it.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options, extracted from the help printed by the -h switch is included below.  For a complete description of how NaturalDocs works, see the text files in the /usr/share/doc/naturaldocs
       directory.

       Required parameters:

       -i, --input, --source DIR
              Specifies an input (source) directory. Required.
              Can be specified multiple times.

       -o, --output FMT DIR
              Specifies an output format and directory. Required.
              Can be specified multiple times, but only once per directory. Possible output formats are HTML and FramedHTML.

       -p, --project DIR
              Specifies the project directory. Required.
              There needs to be a unique project directory for every source directory.

       Optional parameters:

       -s, --style STYLE [STYLE ...]
              Specifies the CSS style when building HTML output. If multiple styles are specified, they will all be included in the order given.

       -img, --image DIR
              Specifies an image directory. Can be specified multiple times. Start with * to specify a relative directory, as in -img */images.

       -do, --documented-only
              Specifies only documented code aspects should be included in the output.

       -t, --tab-length LEN
              Specifies the number of spaces tabs should be expanded to. This only needs to be set if you use tabs in example code and text diagrams. Defaults to 4.

       -xi, --exclude-input, --exclude-source
              Excludes an input (source) directory from the documentation. Automatically done for the project and output directories. Can be specified multiple times.

       -nag, --no-auto-group
              Turns off auto-grouping completely.

       -oft, --only-file-titles
              Source files will only use the file name as the title.

       -r, --rebuild
              Rebuilds all output and data files from scratch. Does not affect the menu file.

       -ro, --rebuild-output
              Rebuilds all output files from scratch.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppresses all non-error output.

       -?, -h, --help
              Displays syntax reference.
