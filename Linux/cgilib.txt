NAME
       cgi - Common Gateway Interface

DESCRIPTION
       The  Common  Gateway  Interface is a way to create dynamic web pages.  It defines rules for interaction between a program and the web server while the server
       talks to the client.  There are some ways to use it.

ENVIRONMENT
       Normally the webserver sets several environment variables to give some information to the CGI program so it can determine various stuff.

       AUTH_TYPE
              This reflects the authentification method used to validate a user.

       CONTENT_LENGTH
              The length of the data in bytes passed to the CGI program through standard input.  This is used by the POST method.

       CONTENT_TYPE
              The MIME type of the query data, such as "text/html", optional.

       DOCUMENT_ROOT
              This reflects the document root directory of the webserver.

       GATEWAY_INTERFACE
              Reflects the version of the Common Gateway Interface that the server is using

       HTTP_ACCEPT
              A comma separated list of MIME type that the client is willing to accept.

       HTTP_FROM
              The email address of the user issuing the information request.  This is not supported by most browsers.

       HTTP_REFERER
              Reflects the URL from which this CGI program was accessed.

       HTTP_USER_AGENT
              The name, version and libraries of the browser making the request.  This information can be used to determine if the browser is  capable  of  graphics
              and is able to display frames and tables.

       PATH_INFO
              This shows extra information that was passed to the CGI program via command line.  Normally it's empty or non-existent.

       PATH_TRANSLATED
              The translated path on the local filesystem.

       QUERY_STRING
              This variable refers to additional arguments that were appended to the CGI program - normally with the '?' sign.

       REMOTE_ADDR
              This refers to the host from which the information request was issued, as IP number.

       REMOTE_HOST
              This refers to the host from which the information request was issued.

       REMOTE_USER
              The authenticated name of the user.

       REQUEST_METHOD
              This refers to the method with which the information request was issued.  Normally this is either GET or POST.

       SCRIPT_NAME
              The virtual name of the script being executed.

       SERVER_NAME
              The server's hostname or IP number.  This may be used to determine the correct paths or resulting HTML code for CGI programs that are used on the same
              machine for several servers.

       SERVER_PROTOCOL
              This is the name and version of the information protocol the request came in with.  Normally this is "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".

       SERVER_PORT
              This refers to the TCP/IP port on which the webserver is running.

       SERVER_SOFTWARE
              This reflects the name and revision of the webserver software.
