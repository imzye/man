NAME
       moglistfids -- Iterate fid/key data from a MogileFS installation

DESCRIPTION
       Example utility for pulling all file data out of a MogileFS installation.  Utilities like this can be built on for creating backup systems, Mogile<->Mogile syncronization systems, or Mogile->S3
       syncronization.

       This method is only a way of pulling new files which have existed since the last time it was checked, as there's no logging of deleted files.

OPTIONS
       --trackers=host1:7001,host2:7001
           Use these MogileFS trackers to negotiate with.

       --fromfid=<fid>
           The highest numbered fid fetched the last time this utility was run.

       --count=<count>
           Numer of fids to inspect and return.
