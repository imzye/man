NAME
       flake8 - code checker using pycodestyle and pyflakes

SYNOPSIS
       flake8 [options] input ...

DESCRIPTION
       flake8  is  a  command-line utility for enforcing style consistency across Python projects. By default it includes lint checks provided by the PyFlakes project, PEP-0008 inspired style checks pro‐
       vided by the PyCodeStyle project, and McCabe complexity checking provided by the McCabe project. It will also run third-party extensions if they are found and installed.

OPTIONS
       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --verbose
              print more information about what is happening in flake8. This option is repeatable and will increase verbosity each time it is repeated.

       -q, --quiet
              report only file names, or nothing. This option is repeatable.

       --count
              print total number of errors and warnings to standard error and set the exit code to 1 if total is not empty.

       --diff report changes only within line number ranges in the unified diff provided on standard in by the user.

       --exclude=patterns
              comma-separated list of files or directories to exclude. (Default: .svn,CVS,.bzr,.hg,.git,__pycache__,.tox,.eggs,*.egg)

       --filename=patterns
              only check for filenames matching the patterns in this comma-separated list. (Default: *.py)

       --stdin-display-name=STDIN_DISPLAY_NAME
              the name used when reporting errors from code passed via stdin. This is useful for editors piping the file contents to flake8. (Default: stdin)

       --format=format
              format errors according to the chosen formatter.

       --hang-closing
              hang closing bracket instead of matching indentation of opening bracket's line.

       --ignore=errors
              comma-separated list of errors and warnings to ignore (or skip). For example, --ignore=E4,E51,W234.  (Default: E121,E123,E126,E226,E24,E704,W503,W504)

       --max-line-length=n
              maximum allowed line length for the entirety of this run. (Default: 79)

       --select=errors
              comma-separated list of errors and warnings to enable.  For example, --select=E4,E51,W234. (Default: E,F,W,C90)

       --disable-noqa
              disable the effect of "# noqa". This will report errors on lines with "# noqa" at the end.

       --show-source
              show the source generate each error or warning.

       --statistics
              count errors and warnings.

       --enable-extensions=ENABLE_EXTENSIONS
              enable plugins and extensions that are otherwise disabled by default

       --exit-zero
              exit with status code "0" even if there are errors.

       --install-hook=INSTALL_HOOK
              install a hook that is run prior to a commit for the supported version control system.

       -j JOBS, --jobs=JOBS
              number of subprocesses to use to run checks in parallel. This is ignored on Windows. The default, "auto", will auto-detect the number of processors available to use. (Default: auto)

       --output-file=OUTPUT_FILE
              redirect report to a file.

       --tee  write to stdout and output-file.

       --append-config=APPEND_CONFIG
              provide extra config files to parse in addition to the files found by Flake8 by default. These files are the last ones read and so they take the highest precedence when multiple files  pro‐
              vide the same option.

       --config=CONFIG
              path to the config file that will be the authoritative config source. This will cause Flake8 to ignore all other configuration files.

       --isolated
              ignore all found configuration files.

       --benchmark
              print benchmark information about this run of Flake8

       --max-complexity=MAX_COMPLEXITY
              McCabe complexity threshold

       --bug-report
              print information necessary when preparing a bug report

       --builtins=BUILTINS
              define more built-ins, comma separated

       --doctests
              check syntax of the doctests

       --include-in-doctest=INCLUDE_IN_DOCTEST
              run doctests only on these files

       --exclude-from-doctest=EXCLUDE_FROM_DOCTEST
              skip these files when running doctests

CONFIGURATION
       The  project  options are read from the [flake8] section of the tox.ini file or the setup.cfg file located in any parent folder of the path(s) being processed.  Allowed options are: exclude, file‐
       name, select, ignore, max-line-length, hang-closing, count, format, quiet, showpep8, show-source, statistics, verbose, max-complexity, builtins.

                                                                                               November 2016                                                                                      FLAKE8(1)
