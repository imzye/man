NAME
       nntpd - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       NNTP server process

SYNOPSIS
          nntpd [ -C config-file ] [ -U uses ] [ -T timeout ] [ -D ]
              [ -H ] [ -s ] [ -r ] [ -f ] [ -p ssf ]

DESCRIPTION
       nntpd is an NNTP server. It accepts commands on its standard input and responds on its standard output. It MUST invoked by master(8) with those descriptors attached to a remote client connection.

       nntpd reads its configuration options out of the imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by -C.  The optional newsprefix setting specifies a prefix to be prepended to newsgroup names to make
       the corresponding IMAP mailbox names.  The optional newspostuser setting specifies the special userid to be used when constructing the To: header address for following up to articles when read via
       IMAP.   The optional newspeer setting specifies the fully qualified hostname of the upstream news server to which articles are fed.  The optional allownewnews setting enables the NNTP NEWNEWS com‐
       mand.

       NOTE:
          For servers with a large volume of articles, the NEWNEWS command can be expensive.

       If the directory <configdirectory>/log/user exists, then nntpd will create protocol telemetry logs for sessions authenticating as user. The telemetry logs will be stored in the log/user  directory
       with a filename of the nntpd process-id.

OPTIONS
       -C config-file
              Use the specified configuration file config-file rather than the default imapd.conf(5).

       -U uses
              The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.

       -T timeout
              The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new connection before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero) will disable the timeout.  The default is 60.

       -D     Run external debugger specified in debug_command.

       -H     Tell nntpd to expect a HAProxy protocol header from the sender.

       -s     Serve NNTP over SSL (https).  All data to and from nntpd is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer.

       -r     Only allow NNTP reader commands.  Permitted clients will only be allowed to read/post articles.

       -f     Only allow NNTP feeder commands.  Permitted clients will only be allowed to feed articles (no reading).

       -p ssf Tell nntpd that an external layer exists.  An SSF (security strength factor) of 1 means an integrity protection layer exists.  Any higher SSF implies some form of privacy protection.
