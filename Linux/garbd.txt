NAME
       garbd - arbitrator daemon for Galera cluster

SYNOPSIS
       garbd [options] [group address]

DESCRIPTION
       garbd joins Galera cluster as an additional node for the purpose of establishing quorum in case of network partitioning. It can do so by serving:
              a) as an odd node to prevent split-brains;
              b) as a reference connection point outside a datacenter.
       Arbitrator  node  must  see  all messages that the other nodes of the cluster see, however it does not process them any further and just discards them.  As such it does not store any cluster state and
       can't be used to bootstrap the cluster, so it only can join existing cluster.
