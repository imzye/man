NAME
       MPSolve - A multiprecision polynomial rootfinder

DESCRIPTION
       mpsolve [-a alg] [-b] [-c] [-G goal] [-o digits] [-i digits] [-j n] [-t type] [-S set] [-D detect] [-O format] [-l filename] [-x] [-d] [-v] [-r] [infile | -p poly]

OPTIONS
       -a alg Select the algorithm used to solve the polynomial/secular equation:

              u: Classic unisolve algorithm (Aberth iterations and dynamic precision)
              s: Secular algorithm, using regeneration of increasingly better-conditioned

              secular equations with the same roots of the polynomial

       -b     Perform Aberth iterations in Jacobi-style instead of Gauss-Seidel

       -c     Enable crude approximation mode

       -G goal
              Select the goal to reach. Possible values are:

              a: Approximate the roots
              i: Isolate the roots
              c: Count the roots in the search set

       -o digits
              Number of guaranteed digits of the roots

       -i digits
              Digits of precision of the input coefficients

       -j n   Number of threads to spawn as workers

       -t type
              Type can be 'f' for floating point or 'd' for DPE

       -S set Restrict the search set for the roots set can be one of:

              u: upper half-plane { x | Im(x) > 0 }
              d: lower half-plane { x | Im(x) < 0 }
              l: left half-plane { x | Re(x) < 0 }
              r: right half-plane { x | Re(x) > 0 }
              i: inside the unit circle: { x | |x| < 1 }
              o: outside the unit circle { x | |x| > 1 }
              R: real axis { x | Im(x) = 0 }
              I: imaginary axis { x | Re(x) = 0 }

       -D detect
              Detect properties of the roots:

              r: real roots
              i: imaginary roots
              b: both

       -O format
              Select format for output:

              f: full output
              b: bare output
              c: compact output
              v: verbose output
              g: gnuplot-ready output
              gf: gnuplot-full mode, can be piped to gnuplot and display error bars.
              gp: The same as gf but only with points (suitable for high degree polynomials)

              For example:

              mpsolve -as -Ogf myfile.pol | gnuplot

       -l filename Set filename as the output for the log, instead of the tty. Use this option with

              -d[domains] to activate the desired debug domains.

       -x     Enable graphic visualization of convergence

       -d[domains] Activate debug on selected domains, that can be one of:

              t: trace
              a: approximation
              c: cluster
              i: improvement
              w: timings
              o: input/Output
              m: memory management
              f: function calls
              p: debug stop condition and development of iteration packets
              r: regeneration Example: -dfi for function calls and improvement

       -p poly
              Solve the polynomial specified on the command line.

              For example: mpsolve -p "x^4-6*x^9+6/7*x + 5"

       -r     Use a recursive strategy to dispose the initial approximations.
              This option is available only for monomial polynomials.
              Note: this option is considered experimental.

       -v     Print the version and exit
