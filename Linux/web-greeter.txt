THEME JAVASCRIPT API
       Please note that all properties and functions which are marked as "deprecated" are only available for backwards compatibility and will be removed in a future version of web-greeter.  Theme authors
       should  not  use  any  deprecated  properties  or  functions  in  new works and should update any existing works which make use of deprecated properties and/or functions to ensure continued proper
       functionality.

       The following signals are available to connect javascript functions when a LightDM or web-greeter signal occurs:

       lightdm.authentication_complete
           Gets emitted when the greeter has completed authentication.

       lightdm.autologin_timer_expired
           Gets emitted when the automatic login timer has expired.

       lightdm.show_message
           Gets emitted when the greeter should show a message to the user.  This signal emits a message: string and a type: number.

       lightdm.show_prompt
           Gets emitted when the greeter should show a prompt to the user.  This signal emits a message: string and a type: number.

       The following functions are available for the greeter to call to execute actions within LightDM:

       lightdm.authenticate(username)
           Specifies the username of the user we'd like to start authenticating as.  Note that if you call lightdm.authenticate with no argument, LightDM (via PAM) will issue a show_prompt() call to  ask
           for the username.

       lightdm.authenticate_as_guest()
           Authenticates as the guest user.

       lightdm.cancel_authentication()
           Cancels the authentication of any user currently in the process of authenticating.

       lightdm.cancel_autologin()
           Cancels the authentication of the autologin user.

       lightdm.start_session(session)
           Once  LightDM  has  successfully  authenticated the user, start the user's session by calling this function.  "session" is the authenticated user's session.  If no session is passed, start the
           authenticated user with the system default session.

       lightdm.respond(text)
           When LightDM has prompted for input, provide the response to LightDM.

       lightdm.set_language(lang)
           Will set the language for the current LightDM session.

       lightdm.shutdown()
           Shuts down the system, if the greeter has the authority to do so.  Check if greeter can shutdown with lightdm.can_shutdown

       lightdm.restart()
           Restarts the system, if the greeter has the authority to do so.  Check if greeter can restart with lightdm.can_restart

       lightdm.suspend()
           Suspends the system, if the greeter has the authority to do so.  Check if greeter can suspend with lightdm.can_suspend

       lightdm.hibernate()
           Hibernates the system, if the greeter has the authority to do so.  Check if greeter can hibernate with lightdm.can_hibernate
