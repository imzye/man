NAME
       Net::DNS::SEC::Private - DNSSEC Private key object

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::DNS::SEC::Private;

           $private = Net::DNS::SEC::Private->new( $keypath );

           $private = Net::DNS::SEC::Private->new(
               'algorithm'  => '13',
               'keytag'     => '26512',
               'privatekey' => 'h/mc+iq9VDUbNAjQgi8S8JzlEX29IALchwJmNM3QYKk=',
               'signame'    => 'example.com.'
               );

DESCRIPTION
       Class representing private keys as read from a keyfile generated by BIND dnssec-keygen. The class is written to be used only in the context of the Net::DNS::RR::RRSIG create method. This class is
       not designed to interact with any other system.

METHODS
   new (from private keyfile)
           $keypath = '/home/foo/Kexample.com.+013+26512.private';
           $private = Net::DNS::SEC::Private->new( $keypath );

       The argument is the full path to a private key file generated by the BIND dnssec-keygen tool.  Note that the filename contains information about the algorithm and keytag.

   new (from private key parameters)
           $private = Net::DNS::SEC::Private->new(
               'algorithm'  => '13',
               'keytag'     => '26512',
               'privatekey' => 'h/mc+iq9VDUbNAjQgi8S8JzlEX29IALchwJmNM3QYKk=',
               'signame'    => 'example.com.'
               );

       The arguments define the private key parameters as (name,value) pairs.  The name and data representation are identical to that used in a BIND private keyfile.

   private_key_format
           $format = $private->private_key_format;

       Returns a string which identifies the format of the private key file.

   algorithm, keytag, signame
           $algorithm = $private->algorithm;
           $keytag    = $private->keytag;
           $signame   = $private->signame;

       Returns the corresponding attribute determined from the filename.

   Private key attributes
           $attribute = $private->attribute;

       Returns the value as it appears in the private key file.  The attribute names correspond to the tag in the key file, modified to form an acceptable Perl subroutine name.

   created, publish, activate
           $created  = $private->created;
           $publish  = $private->publish;
           $activate = $private->activate;

       Returns a string which represents a date in the form 20141212123456.  Returns undefined value for key formats older than v1.3.
