Name
       gethead - Print FITS or IRAF header keyword values

Synopsis
       gethead [-hptv] [-d pathname] [-n num] <FITS or IRAF file> kw1 kw2 ... kwn

Description
       Print  values  of  the specified keywords from the given image header.  By default they are all listed on one line, separated by spaces.  The -v flag causes the keyword names and values to be printed,
       one keyword per line.  To read keywords from a list of files, substitute @<listfile> for the file names on the command line.  To read a lot of keywords, put them, one per line, in a file  and  substi‐
       tute @<keylistfile> on the command line.  If two @ commands are present, the program will figure out which contains file names and which contains keywords.

Options
       -a     List file name even if keywords are not found

       -d     Root directory for input files (default is cwd)

       -e     Output keyword=value's on one line per file

       -f     Never print filenames (default is to print them if more than one)

       -g     Output keyword=value's on one line per keyword

       -h     flag causes the keyword names to be printed at top of columns.

       -n     Number of decimal places in numeric output

       -o     OR conditions instead of ANDing them

       -p     Print full pathnames of files

       -t     flag causes the output to be in tab-separated tables with keyword column headings.

       -u     Always print ___ if keyword not found, event if only one keyword in search

       -v     Print output as <keyword>=<value>, one per line
