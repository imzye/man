NAME
     apertium-desmediawiki — MediaWiki format processor for Apertium

SYNOPSIS
     apertium-desmediawiki [input_file [output_file]]

DESCRIPTION
     apertium-desmediawiki is a processor for mediawiki XML dumps (i.e., those produced using Special:Export).  Data should be passed through this processor before being piped to lt-proc(1).  The program
     takes input in the form of a text file and produces output suitable for processing with lt-proc(1).  Format information (newlines, tabs, etc.) is enclosed in brackets so that lt-proc(1) treats it as
     whitespace between words.
