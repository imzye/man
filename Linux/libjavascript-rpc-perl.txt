DESCRIPTION
       JavaScript::RPC::Server::CGI is a CGI-based server library for use with Brent Ashley's JavaScript Remote Scripting (JSRS) client library. It works asynchronously and uses DHTML to deal with the
       payload.

       In order to add your custom meothds, this module should be subclassed.

       The most current version (as of the release of this module) of the client library as well as a demo application have been included in this distribution.

INSTALLATION
       To install this module via Module::Build:

               perl Build.PL
               ./Build         # or `perl Build`
               ./Build test    # or `perl Build test`
               ./Build install # or `perl Build install`

       To install this module via ExtUtils::MakeMaker:

               perl Makefile.PL
               make
               make test
               make install

METHODS
   new()
       Creates a new instance of the module. No further options are available at this time.

   query()
       Gets / sets the query object. This has the side effect of extracting the env() data.

   get_new_query()
       This method generates a new query object. It is used internally by the query() method. This method should only be used if you want to supply a query object other than the standard CGI.pm object.
       However, it must be a CGI.pm compatible object. Here's an example using CGI::Simple.

               sub get_new_query {
                       require CGI::Simple;
                       my $q = CGI::Simple->new();

                       return $q;
               }

   env()
       Gets / sets a hash of information related to the currently query. The resulting structure contains four items:

       •   method - the method called

       •   params - an array of parameters for the method

       •   uid - the unique id for this query

       •   context - the context id

   error_message()
       Get / sets the error message sent to the client if an error occurred.

   process()
       Processes  the current query and either returns the result from the appropriate method, or an error to the client and returns either true or false, respectively, to the caller. An error will occur
       if the method name is blank, or the method has not been defined. This function takes an optional CGI.pm compatible object as an input.

       Your subclass' method will be evaled and will either return an error to the caller if it died, or return a valid result payload on success.

   error()
       Returns a valid error payload to the client and false to the caller. It will automatically call error_message() for you.

   result()
       Returns a valid result payload to the client and true to the caller.
