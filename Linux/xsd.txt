NAME
       xsd - Mono's utility for generating schema or class files

SYNOPSIS
       xsd <schema.xsd> /classes [options]

       xsd <schema.xsd> /dataset [options]

       xsd <assembly>.dll|<assembly>.exe [options]

       xsd <instance.xml> [<instance.xml> ...] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       xsd is a tool for intended to complement the XML serialization support of Mono. It can do the following tasks:

       Generate serializable classes
              From a given XML schema, generate a class that can be used to read and write xml documents that conform that schema (/classes option).

       Generate typed datasets
              From a given XML schema, generate a typed DataSet class that can be used to read and write xml documents that conform that schema (/dataset option).

       Generate XML schemas
              From  a  given  assembly and an optional type name, generate an XML schema that can be used to validate the xml documents that can be obtained by serializing objects of that type. If no type is
              provided, xsd generates a schema for all types in the assembly. When specifying the assembly name do not include the file extension (.dll or .exe). xsd will look  for  the  assembly  using  the
              standard assembly loading rules.

       Infer XML schemas
              From a given set of XML documents, infer the XML schema that can be used to validate those documents.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       /element:name /e:name
              Specifies the name of the XML schema element for which a class or a dataset has to be generated.

       /namespace:name /n:name
              Specifies the namespace of the XML schema element for which a class or a dataset has to be generated.

       /language:name /l:name
              Specifies the programming language to use for the generated code. The only supported languages are CS (C#) and VB (Visual Basic.NET).

       /generator:type,assembly /g:type,assembly
              Indicates  xsd.exe  to  use custom CodeDomProvider to generate code. The type name must be full name. Assembly name is a local file name that is going to be loaded. The specified Type must have
              the default constructor.

       /outputdir:path /o:path
              Specifies the directory where to generate the code or schemas.

       /type:name /t:name
              Specifies the full name of the type (including namespace) for which to generate the XML schema.

       /help /h
              Show usage help.
