NAME
       tlsrpt_finish_policy - finishes a policy within a delivery request

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tlsrpt.h>

       int tlsrpt_finish_policy(struct tlsrpt_dr_t* dr, tlsrpt_final_result_t final_result)

DESCRIPTION
       The tlsrpt_finish_policy function finishes a policy within a delivery request. It frees all the ressources allocated by tlsrpt_init_policy. Every call to tlsrpt_init_policy must be matched by a
       call to tlsrpt_finish_policy!

           Note

           No plausibility checks are done by the library regarding the number of failures added to this policy and the final result. It is just as well possible to finish a poliy as TLSRPT_FINAL_FAILURE
           with no failures added at all, as it is possible to finish a poliy as TLSRPT_FINAL_SUCCESS with one or more failures added.

RETURN VALUE
       The tlsrpt_finish_policy function returns 0 on success and a combined error code on failure. The combined error code can be analyzed with the tlsrpt_strerror function.
