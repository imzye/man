DESCRIPTION
       Sereal is an efficient, compact-output, binary and feature-rich serialization protocol. The Perl encoder is implemented as the Sereal::Encoder module, the Perl decoder correspondingly as
       Sereal::Decoder. They are distributed separately to allow for safe upgrading without downtime. (Hint: Upgrade the decoder everywhere first, then the encoder.)

       This "Sereal" module is a very thin wrapper around both "Sereal::Encoder" and "Sereal::Decoder". It depends on both and loads both. So if you have a user of both encoder and decoder, it is enough
       to depend on a particular version of "Sereal" and you'll get the most recent released versions of "Sereal::Encoder" and "Sereal::Decoder" whose version is smaller than or equal to the version of
       "Sereal" you depend on.

       The protocol specification and many other bits of documentation can be found in the github repository. Right now, the specification is at
       <https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/sereal_spec.pod>, there is a discussion of the design objectives in <https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/README.pod>, and the output of our
       benchmarks can be seen at <https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/wiki/Sereal-Comparison-Graphs>.

   EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       It is recommended to use the object-oriented interface of "Sereal::Encoder" and "Sereal::Decoder" if you care about performance. For detailed performance considerations, see Sereal::Performance.

       You can optionally import five functions from "Sereal".  "encode_sereal" is the same function as Sereal::Encoder's "encode_sereal" function. "decode_sereal" and "looks_like_sereal" are the same as
       Sereal::Decoder's functions of the same names.  Finally, you can import the advanced functional interface "sereal_encode_with_object" and "sereal_decode_with_object".  Again, see
       Sereal::Performance for information about those.

       After loading the "Sereal" module, both "Sereal::Encoder" and "Sereal::Decoder" are guaranteed to be loaded, so you can use their object-oriented interface.

   get_sereal_encoder($OPTSHASH)
       Returns a Sereal::Encoder with the given options. This encoder will be shared by other calls to this function.

   get_sereal_decoder($OPTSHASH)
       Returns a Sereal::Decoder with the given options. This encoder will be shared by other calls to this function.

   clear_sereal_object_cache
       Clears cache of objects created via get_sereal_encoder() and get_sereal_decoder(). Returns the number of objects that were removed from the cache (the sum of both types).

   write_sereal_file($FILENAME,$STRUCT,$APPEND,$OPTS)
       Write a sereal packet to $FILENAME. See Sereal::Encoder::encode_to_file().

   write_sereal($FILENAME,$STRUCT,$APPEND,$OPTS)
       alias for write_sereal_file()

   read_sereal_file($FILENAME,$OPTS,$ROOT)
       Read a sereal packet from a file. See Sereal::Decoder::decode_from_file().

   read_sereal($FILENAME,$OPTS,$ROOT)
       alias for read_sereal_file()
