NAME
       fpc - Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) binary

SYNOPSIS
       fpc [options] [sourcefile]

DESCRIPTION
       This binary is the main binary of the Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) which is a Turbo Pascal and Delphi (7.0) compatible standalone (non GCC frontend) multitarget Pascal compiler.

       The compiler uses LD(1) and can use AS(1) (see parameter -Aas), but also has its own binary object writer.

       The  current  main targets are Go32V2 (Dos DJGPP extender), Freebsd, Linux, MacOS, MacOSX, MorphOS, Netware, OS/2 and Win32.  The other targets (M68K compilers for Atari and Amiga) are either based on
       older versions of the compiler or are still in development.

       This manpage is meant for quick-reference only. FPC comes with a great (2000+ pages) manual, which is updated constantly, while this man page can be out of date.

Version number
       Starting with release 1.0, a new versioning system has been implemented.  If the last number is even (1.0, 1.0.2), it is stable, and if the last number is odd it is a daily changing  development  ver‐
       sion.(1.0.5, 1.1) just like the linux kernel.

       Version 0.99.5 however is a stable release. It was made before the even/odd version naming system was introduced.

Usage
       The compilation process is started by typing fpc followed by a sourcefile name (normally with .pas or .pp extension). Before processing the actual processing of the source file, fpc.cfg(5) the config‐
       uration file of the compiler is read which contains the location of the RTL, other packages (FCL, FreeVision), and optionally default values for some switches. See the separate manpage  of  fpc.cfg(5)
       for more information.

Options
       General options

       -h     if you specify this option, the compiler outputs a list of all options, and exits after that.

       -?     idem as -h, but waiting after every screenfull for the enter key.

       -i     This option tells the compiler to print the copyright information.

              You can give it an option, as -ixxx where "xxx" can be one of the following:

              D      Returns the compiler date.

              V      Returns the compiler version.

              SO     Returns the compiler OS.

              SP     Returns the compiler processor.

              TO     Returns the target OS.

              TP     Returns the target Processor.

       -l     This option tells the compiler to print the FPC logo on standard output. It also gives you the FPC version number.

       -n     Tells the compiler not to read the configuration file fpc.cfg(5)

       Options for getting feedback

       -vxxx  Be verbose. "xxx" is a combination of the following:

              e      Tells the compiler to show only errors. This option is on by default.

              i      Tells the compiler to show some general information.

              w      Tells the compiler to issue warnings.

              n      Tells the compiler to issue notes.

              h      Tells the compiler to issue hints.

              l      Tells the compiler to show the line numbers as it processes a file. Numbers are shown per 100.

              u      Tells the compiler to print the names of the files it opens.

              t      Tells the compiler to print the names of the files it tries to open.

              p      Tells the compiler to print the names of procedures and functions as it is processing them.

              c      Tells the compiler to warn you when it processes a conditional.

              m      Tells the compiler to write which macros are defined.

              d      Tells the compiler to write other debugging info.

              a      Tells the compiler to write all possible info. (this is the same as specifying all options)

              0      Tells the compiler to write no messages. This is useful when you want to override the default setting in the configuration file.

              b      Tells the compiler to show all procedure declarations if an overloaded function error occurs.

              x      Tells the compiler to output some executable info (for Win32 platform only).

              r      Rhide/GCC compatibility mode: formats the error differently, so they are understood by RHIDE.

       Options concerning files and directories

       -exxx  tells the compiler that xxx is the directory where it can find the executables as (the assembler) and ld (the linker).

       -FD    same as -e.

       -Fexxx This option tells the compiler to write errors, etc. to the file xxx

       -FExxx set the executable/unit output path to xxx

       -Fixxx adds xxx to the path where the compiler searches for its include files.

       -Flxxx Adds xxx to the library searching path, and is passe to the linker.

       -FLxxx ( Linux only) Tells the compiler to use xxx as the dynamic linker. Default this is /lib/ld-linux.so.2, or lib/ld-linux.so.1, depending on which one is found.

       -Foxxx Adds xxx to the object file path. This path is used when looking for files that need to be linked in.

       -Frxxx tells  the compiler that xxx contains the compiler messages. Default the compiler has built-in messages. Specifying this option will override the default messages.  (useful if you want to use a
              language other than the default language).

       -Fuxxx Adds xxx to the unit path.  By default, the compiler only searches for units in the current directory and the directory where the compiler itself resides. This option tells the compiler also to
              look in the directory xxx

       -FUxxx Tells the compiler to write units in directory xxx instead of the current directory.

       -Ixxx  Add xxx to the include file search path.  This path is used when looking for include files.

       Options controlling the kind of output for more information on these options, see also the programmers manual.

       -a     Tells the compiler not to delete the assembler file.  This also counts for the (possibly) generated batch script.

       -al    Tells the compiler to include the sourcecode lines in the assembler file as comments.

       -an    Tells the compiler to include node information in the generated assembler file.  This is mainly for use by the compiler developers.

       -ap    Tells the compiler to use pipes to communicate with the assembler.

       -ar    Tells the compiler to include register allocation/deallocation information.

       -at    Tells the compiler to include temporary register allocation/deallocation information.

       -Axxx  specifies what kind of assembler should be generated . Here xxx is one of the following :

              AS     A unix .o (object) file, using GNU AS

              coff   coff object file (go32) using internal writer.

       -pg    Generate profiler code for gprof.

       -s     Tells the compiler not to call the assembler and linker.  Instead, the compiler writes a script, PPAS.BAT under DOS, or ppas.sh under Linux, which can then be executed to produce an executable.

       -sh    Tells the compiler to generate a script that can be used to assemble and link on the host system, not on the target system. Use this when cross-compiling.

       -sr    Skip register allocation stage in compiler (use with -ar)

       -st    Tells the compiler to generate a script that can be used to assemble and link on the target system, not on the host system. Use this when cross-compiling.

       -Txxx  Specifies the target operating system.  xxx can be one of the following:

              EMX    OS/2 and DOS via the EMX extender.

              FREEBSD
                     FreeBSD

              GO32V2 DOS and version 2 of the DJ DELORIE extender.

              LINUX  Linux.

              NETBSD Netbsd.

              NETWARE

       -uxxx  undefine the symbol xxx if it is defined. This is the opposite of the -d option.

       -Xx    Executable options. These tell the compiler what kind of executable should be generated. the parameter x can be one of the following:

              c      (Linux only, obsolete) Link with the C library. You should only use this when you start to port Free Pascal to another operating system.

              D      Link with dynamic libraries (defines the FPC_LINK_DYNAMIC symbol)

              d      Don't use the standard library path. Use this when cross-compiling, to avoid linking with the host OS libraries.

              Pxxx   Prepend the names of binutils (as, ld) with xxx. For use when cross-compiling.

              rxxx   Set the library search path to xxx.

              s      Strip the symbols from the executable.

              S      Link with static libraries (defines the FPC_LINK_STATIC symbol)

              t      Link statically (passes -static to the linker)

              X      Link smart. Using this option sets the FPC_LINK_SMART symbol.

       Options concerning the sources (language options) for more information on these options, see also in the Programmers Manual

       -Mmode Specify the language mode.  mode can be one of the following:

              delphi Delphi-compatibility mode. This loads the objpas unit, and switches on ansistring mode ( -Sh ).

              fpc    Default mode.

              gpc    GNU pascal mode (does nothing at the moment)

              macpas Mac pascal mode. This loads the macpas unit and switches on some Mac extensions (mainly macros)

              objfpc Object Pascal mode. This loads the objpas unit.

              tp     Turbo Pascal mode.

       -Rxxx  Specifies what assembler you use in your "asm" assembler code blocks. Here xxx is one of the following:

              att    Asm blocks contain AT&T assembler.

              intel  Asm blocks contain Intel assembler.

              direct Asm blocks should be copied as-is in the assembler file.

       -S2    Switch on Delphi 2 extensions.

       -Sa    Generate code for assertions.

       -Sc    Support C-style operators, i.e. *=, +=, /= and -=.

       -Sd    Tries to be Delphi compatible

       -Se    The  compiler  stops  after the first error. Normally, the compiler tries to continue compiling after an error, until 50 errors are reached, or a fatal error is reached, and then it stops. With
              this switch, the compiler will stop after the first error.

       -Sg    Support the label and goto commands.

       -Sh    use ansistrings by default.

       -SIxxx Specify the kind of interfaces.  xxx can be one of the following:

              COM    use COM interfaces. (all interfaces descend from IUnknown)

              CORBA  use CORBA interfaces. (no inheritance is supposed)

       -Si    Support C++ style INLINE.

       -Sm    Support C-style macros.

       -So    Try to be Borland TP 7.0 compatible (no function overloading etc.).

       -Sp    Try to be GPC (GNU Pascal Compiler) compatible.

       -Ss    The name of constructors must be "init", and the name of destructors should be "done".

       -St    Allow the "static" keyword in objects.

       -Un    Do not check the unit name. Normally, the unit name is the same as the filename. This option allows both to be different.

       -Ur    Create a release unit. This sets a special flag in the unit, causing the compiler not to look for sources.

       -Us    Compile a system unit. This option causes the compiler to define only some very basic types.
