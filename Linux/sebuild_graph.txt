NAME
       sebuild_graph - SELinux policy visualization tool graph builder

SYNOPSIS
       sebuild_graph [-h] [-dg] [-fb [FILTER_BOOLS]] [-c CLASSES]
                          [-p [POLICY]] FILENAME

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a snapshot of given SELinux policy (if no policy file is provided, policy loaded in the system is be used) that can be analyzed using segraph_query.

OPTIONS
   Positional arguments:
              FILENAME
                     Name for the new policy graph file.

   Optional arguments:
              -h, --help
                     show this help message and exit

              -dg, --domain_grouping
                     Group SELinux domains based on package they belong to.  Use with caution, generates false positives!

              -fb [FILTER_BOOLS], --filter_bools [FILTER_BOOLS]
                     Filter rules based on current boolean setting or comma separated list of [boolean]:[on/off].

              -c CLASSES, --class CLASSES
                     Comma separated list of object classes to be present in the graph. All classes assumed if omitted.

              -p [POLICY], --policy [POLICY]
                     Path to the SELinux policy to be used.

EXAMPLE
       Create snapshot of SELinux policy loaded in the system (only rules concerning files and processes are considered, boolean setting is taken into account):

             $ sebuild_graph.py -fb -c file,process graph
