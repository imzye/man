NAME
       mbtserver - Tilburg Memory Based Tagger Server

SYNOPSIS
       mbtserver [server options]

       or

       mbtserver -s settingsfile -S portnumber (deprecated)

DESCRIPTION
       mbtserver extends mbt with a server layer. It provided the possibility to access a trained tagger from multiple sessions. It also allows one to run and access different taggers in parallel.

OPTIONS
       -h or --help
              show help

       --config=file
              read the settings for one or more taggers from the specified configuration file.

              A configuration file must contain a port specification:

              port=<number>

              It may provide a limit to the number of parallel connections:

              maxconn=<number>

              And it must give one or more mbt tagger descriptions:

              <base>=<mbt options line>

              The  <base>  is a basename for the Tagger that will be started with the options specified. The basename is needed because it is possible to start several (different) taggers. When accessing
              the server, we need a way to tell which Tagger we want to use.  In general, the mbt options line will just be something like: "-s <settingsfile>", where settingsfile is a file generated  by
              mbtg

              example config file:
                     port=4567
                     maxconn=15
                     test1 = -s tests/eindh.set
                     another = -s tests/wotan.set

       --pidfile=file
              store the pid of the main server process in file

       --logfile=file
              log server actions to file

       --daemonize=[yes|no]
              run the server as a daemon. Default is yes.

       -V or --version
              show version

       deprecated options are

       -s settingsfile
              read settings (probably generated with mbtg ) from the settingsfile

       -S <port>
              run the server on 'port'.

       For mbt options see mbt(1)
