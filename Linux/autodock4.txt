NAME
       autodock - docking of chemical ligands to protein receptors

SYNOPSIS
       autodock4 [options]

DESCRIPTION
       AutoDock perfoms the automated docking of chemical compounds to proteins, i.e. it predicts how small molecules, such as substrates or drug candidates, bind to a receptor of known 3D structure.

       The AutoDockSuite consists of two main programs of which AutoDock performs the docking of the ligand to a set of grids describing the target protein and AutoGrid pre-calculates these grids.

OPTIONS
       -p     parameter_filename

       -l     log_filename

       -o     Use old PDBQ format, charge q in columns 55-61

       -k     Keep original residue numbers

       -i     Ignore header-checking

       -t     Parse the PDBQ file to check torsions, then stop.

       -c <   command_file Command mode, by file

       -c |   control_program Command mode, by control_program

EXAMPLE
       On Debian, the directory /usr/share/doc/autodock offers examples to run. Change to that directory and unpack (as root) the gzipped map files, then execute AutoDock as shown below:
       gunzip *.map.gz
       autodock4 -p 1pgp.dpf -l /tmp/1pgp.dlg

       The interpretation of results is aided by the AutoDockTools suite. Please also inspect the tutorials offered online.
