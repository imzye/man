NAME
       reply - read, eval, print, loop, yay!

VERSION
       version 0.42

SYNOPSIS
         reply [-lb] [-I dir] [-M mod] [--version] [--help] [--cfg file]

DESCRIPTION
       This script runs the Reply shell. It looks for a configuration file in ".replyrc" in your home directory, and will generate a basic configuration for you if that file does not exist.

       See the Reply documentation for more information about using and configuring this program.

OPTIONS
       reply takes these command line options:

       -I lib
           Adds the given directory to @INC.

       -l  Equivalent to "-I lib".

       -b  Equivalent to "-I blib/lib -I blib/arch".

       -M Carp::Always
           Loads the specified module before starting the repl. It is loaded within the repl, so things like exporting work properly.

       --cfg ~/.replyrc
           Specifies a different configuration file to use. "~/.replyrc" is the default.

       --version
           Displays the program version.

       --help
           Displays usage information.
