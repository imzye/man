       All short form options have long form variants - see below for these and more advanced options.

DESCRIPTION
       inxi  is  a  command  line  system information tool built for console and IRC. It is also used as a debugging tool for forum technical support to quickly ascertain users' system configurations and
       hardware. inxi shows system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, compiler version(s), Processes, RAM usage, and a wide variety of other useful information.

       inxi output varies depending on whether it is being used on CLI or IRC, with some default filters and color options applied only for IRC use. Colors can be turned off if  desired  with  -c  0,  or
       changed using the -c color options listed in the STANDARD OPTIONS section below.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY
       In  order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi used on IRC automatically filters out your network device MAC address, WAN and LAN IP, your /home username directory in partitions, and a few
       other items.

       Because inxi is often used on forums for support, you can also trigger this filtering with the -z option (-ez, for example). To override the IRC filter, you can use the -Z option. This can be use‐
       ful in debugging network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.

       See FILTER OPTIONS for all filters. If you want to filter everything, use --za though that's usually overkill.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
       This man page is pretty long and information packed. It is divided into the following sections:

       * USING OPTIONS How to use the command line options.

       * STANDARD OPTIONS Primary data types trigger items.

       * FILTER OPTIONS Apply a variety of output filters.

       * OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS Change default colors, widths, heights, output types, etc.

       * EXTRA DATA OPTIONS What -x, -xx, and -xxx add to the report per primary data type.

       * ADMIN EXTRA DATA OPTIONS What -a adds to the report per primary data type. These have a lot of information because this is advanced admin data, which are not always intuitive or easy  to  under‐
       stand.

       * ADVANCED OPTIONS Modify behavior or choice of data sources, and other advanced switches.

       * DEBUGGING OPTIONS For development use mainly, or contributing datasets to the project.

       * DEBUGGING OPTIONS TO DEBUG DEBUGGER FAILURES Only for advanced users, sometimes something will hang the debuggers, this shows you various ways to get around those failures.

       * SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS List of known good IRC clients. Not checked often, let us know if something is not working.

       * RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT How to run inxi in various IRC clients.

       * CONFIGURATION FILE Configuration file locations and priority in using.

       * CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Most of the commonly used configuration options, along with sample values.

       * BUGS How and where to report bugs.

       * HOMEPAGE, AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE, SPECIAL THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING These are self explanitory.

USING OPTIONS
       Options can be combined if they do not conflict. You can either group the letters together or separate them.

       Letters  with  numbers  can have no gap or a gap at your discretion, except when using  -t. Note that if you use an option that requires an additional argument, that must be last in the short form
       group of options. Otherwise you can use those separately as well.

       For example: inxi -AG | inxi -A -G | inxi -b | inxi -c10 | inxi -exxzJy90 | inxi -bay

       Note that all the short form options have long form equivalents, which are listed below. However, usually the short form is used in examples in order to keep things simple.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -A , --audio
              Show Audio/sound device(s) information, including device driver. Shows active sound API(s) and sound server(s).

              Supported APIs: ALSA, OSS, sndio. Supported servers: aRts (artsd), Enlightened Sound Daemon (esound, esd), JACK, NAS (Network Audio System, nasd), PipeWire, PulseAudio, RoarAudio, sndiod.

              Use -Ax to show all sound APIs/servers detected, including inactive, -Axx to see API/Server helper daemons/plugin/modules, and -Aa to see API/sound server tools.

              Audio:
                Device-1: C-Media CMI8788 [Oxygen HD Audio] driver: snd_virtuoso
                Device-2: AMD Cedar HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 5400/6300/7300 Series]
                  driver: snd_hda_intel
                Device-3: AMD Family 17h HD Audio driver: snd_hda_intel
                API: ALSA v: k5.19.0-16.2-liquorix-amd64 status: kernel-api
                Server-1: PulseAudio v: 16.1 status: active

       -b , --basic
              Show basic report with the following items: System (-S); Machine (-M); Battery (-B) (if available); basic CPU (cores, type, average clock speed, and min/max speeds, if available);  Graphics
              (-G); Networking devices (-N); basic Disk; Info (-I).

              The CPU and Disk short forms are special, and are only used in -b. To see their full forms, add -C or -D.

              Same as: inxi -v 2

              For expanded -b report, see -e/--expanded.

       -B , --battery
              Show  system  battery  (ID-x)  data,  charge,  condition, plus extra information (if battery present). Uses /sys or, for BSDs without systctl battery data, use --dmidecode to force its use.
              dmidecode does not have very much information, and none about current battery state/charge/voltage. Supports multiple batteries when using /sys or sysctl data.

              Note that for charge:, the report shows the current charge, as well as its value as a percentage of the available capacity, which can be less than the original design capacity. In the  fol‐
              lowing example, the actual current available capacity of the battery is 22.2 Wh.

              charge: 20.1 Wh (95.4%)

              If charge percent > 100, adds note: check. The causes from that can range from driver bugs, hardware bugs, odd behaviors, so there's no way to know why.

              The condition: item shows the remaining available capacity / original design capacity, and then this figure as a percentage of original capacity available in the battery.

              condition: 22.2/36.4 Wh (61%)

              Corner cases of failing battery show < 1 Wh and percent values for charge, capacity, and condition, and an alert.

              condition: 0.01/62.6 Wh (0.02%) alert: bad battery?

              If health item is available and if it is not 'good', shows health: value.  Always shows with -x if present.

              With  -x,  or if voltage difference is critical, volts: item shows the current voltage, and the min: voltage. Note that if the current is below the minimum listed the battery is essentially
              dead and will not charge.  Test that to confirm, but that's technically how it's supposed to work.

              volts: 12.0 min: 11.4

              With -x shows attached Device-x information (mouse, keyboard, etc.) if they are battery powered.

       --bluetooth
              See -E.

       -c , --color
              See OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS.

       --config, --configuration
              Show active configuration values, by file, and exit.

       -C , --cpu
              Show full CPU report (if each item available): basic CPU topology, model, type, L2 cache, average speed of all cores (if > 1 core, otherwise speed of the core), min/max speeds for CPU,  and
              per CPU clock speed. More data available with -x, -xxx, and -a options.

              Explanation of CPU type (type: MT MCP) abbreviations:

              * AMCP - Asymmetric Multi Core Processor. More than 1 core per CPU, and more than one core type (single and multithreaded cores in the same CPU).

              * AMP - Asymmetric Multi Processing (more than 1 physical CPU, but not identical in terms of core counts or min/max speeds).

              * MT - Multi/Hyper Threaded CPU (more than 1 thread per core, previously HT).

              * MST - Multi and Single Threaded CPU (a CPU with both Single and Multi Threaded cores).

              * MCM - Multi Chip Model (more than 1 die per CPU).

              * MCP - Multi Core Processor (more than 1 core per CPU).

              * SMP - Symmetric Multi Processing (more than 1 physical CPU).

              * UP - Uni (single core) Processor.

              Note  that  min/max:  speeds  are  not necessarily true in cases of overclocked CPUs or CPUs in turbo/boost mode. See -Ca for alternate base/boost: speed data, more granular cache data, and
              more.

              Sample:
              CPU:
                Info: 2x 8-core model: Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 bits: 64 type: MT MCP SMP
                  cache: L2: 2x 2 MiB (4 MiB)
                Speed (MHz): avg: 1601 min/max: 1200/3000 cores: 1: 1280 2: 1595 3: 1416
                  ... 32: 1634

       -d , --disk-full,--optical
              Show optical drive data as well as -D HDD/SSD drive data. With -x, adds a feature line to the report. Also shows floppy disks if present. Note that there is no current way to get any infor‐
              mation about the floppy device that we are aware of, so it will simply show the floppy ID without any extra data. -xx adds a few more features.

       -D , --disk
              Show HDD/SSD drive info. Shows total drive space and used percentage. The drive used percentage includes space used by swap partition(s), since those are not usable for data storage.  Also,
              unmounted partitions are not counted in drive use percentages since inxi has no access to the used amount.

              If  the system has RAID or other logical storage, and if inxi can determine the size of those vs their components, you will see the storage total raw and usable sizes, plus the percent used
              of the usable size. The no argument short form of inxi will show only the usable (or total if no usable) and used percent. If there is no logical storage detected,  only  total:  and  used:
              will show. Sample (with RAID logical size calculated):

              Local Storage: total: raw: 5.49 TiB usable: 2.80 TiB used: 1.35 TiB (48.3%)

              Without logical storage detected:

              Local Storage: total: 2.89 TiB used: 1.51 TiB (52.3%)

              Also  shows  per  drive information: Disk ID, type (FireWire, Removable, USB if present), vendor (if detected), model, and size. See Extra Data Options (-x options) and Admin Extra Data Op‐
              tions (--admin options) for many more features.

       -e , --expanded
              Show expanded -b report. Includes all Upper Case options (except -J), plus --swap, -s and -n. Does not show extra verbose options such as -d -f -i -J -l -m -o -p -r -t -u -x unless you  use
              those arguments in the command, e.g.: inxi -ermxx

              The  basic CPU line is expanded to full CPU data (-C); the basic disk information line is expanded to full drive information (-D) plus primary system partition data (-P), along with adding,
              if found, RAID (-R) and Logical (-L) items; the Network line (-N) is expanded to advanced network (-n).

              Note that with -e, to avoid clutter, -B, -E, -L, and -R only show if results are found since those are often not relevant.

              For basic report, see -b/--basic.

              The previous -F/--full are deprecated because the expanded report has not been full for a long time.

       -E, --bluetooth
              Show bluetooth device(s), drivers. Show Report: with HCI ID, state, address per device (requires btmgmt, bt-adapter, or hciconfig), and if available (hciconfig, btmgmt only) bluetooth  ver‐
              sion (bt-v). See Extra Data Options for more.

              If bluetooth shows as status: down, shows bt-service: state and rfkill software and hardware blocked states, and rfkill ID.

              Note that Report-ID: indicates that the HCI item was not able to be linked to a specific device, similar to IF-ID: in -n.

              If your internal bluetooth device does not show, it's possible that it has been disabled, if you try enabling it using for example:

              hciconfig hci0 up

              and it returns a blocked by RF-Kill error, you can do one of these:

              connmanctl enable bluetooth

              or

              rfkill list bluetooth

              rfkill unblock bluetooth

       --edid
              Triggers full EDID data in Graphics, activates -G and -a.

              - Adds monitor chromacity (chroma: red:..green:...blue:...white:).

              - Shows all available monitor modes if > 2 present, in comma separated list.

              - Shows EDID errors and warnings if any present.

       --filter, -z
              See FILTER OPTIONS.

       -f , --flags
              Show all CPU flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with -e in order to avoid spamming. ARM CPUs: show features items.

       -F , --full
              Deprecated. See -e/--expanded.

       -G , --graphics
              Show Graphic device(s) information, including details of device and display drivers (X: loaded:, and, if applicable: unloaded:, failed:, dri: (if X and different from loaded X drivers) dri‐
              vers, and active gpu: drivers), display protocol (if available), display server (and/or Wayland compositor), vendor and version number, e.g.:

              Display: x11 server: Xorg v: 1.15.1

              or:

              Display: wayland server: X.org v: 1.20.1 with: Xwayland v: 20.1

              If protocol is not detected, shows:

              Display: server: Xorg 1.15.1

              Adds with: Xwayland v:... if xwayland server is installed, regardless of protocol.

              Also  shows  screen  resolution(s) (per monitor/X screen). Shows graphics API information (if available). EGL: EGL version, drivers, acdtive platforms; OpenGL: renderer, OpenGL core profile
              version/OpenGL version (if core/compat versions different, shows that as well); Vulkan: Vulkan version, drivers, surfaces;VESA: data (for Xvesa).

              Compositor information will show if detected using -xx option or always if detected and Wayland since the compositor is the server with Wayland.

              -Gxx shows monitor data as well, if detected. --edid shows advanced monitor data (full modes, chroma, etc.).

       -h , --help
              The help menu. Features dynamic sizing to fit into terminal window. Set global COLS_MAX_CONSOLE if you want a different default value, or use -y [width] to temporarily override the defaults
              or actual window width.

       -i , --ip
              Show WAN IP address and local interfaces (latter requires ifconfig or ip network tool), as well as network report from -n. Not shown with -e for user security reasons. You  shouldn't  paste
              your local/WAN IP.  Shows both IPv4 and IPv6 link IP addresses.

       --ip-limit, --limit [-1 - x]
              Raise or lower max report limit of IP addresses for -i. -1 removes limit.

       -I , --info
              Show  Information:  processes,  uptime,  memory,  IRC  client  (or  shell type if run in shell, not IRC), inxi version. See -Ix, -Ixx, and -Ia for extra information (init type/version, run‐
              level/target, packages).

              Note: if -m or -tm are active, the memory item will show in the main Memory: report of -m/-tm/, not in Info:.

              See -m for explanation of Memory: fields and values..

       -j, --swap
              Shows all active swap types (partition, file, zram). When this option is used, swap partition(s) will not show on the -P line to avoid redundancy.

              To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use with -l or -u.

       -J , --usb
              Show USB data for attached Hubs and Devices. Hubs also show number of ports. Be aware that a port is not always external, some may be internal, and either used or  unused  (for  example,  a
              motherboard USB header connector that is not used).

              Hubs and Devices are listed in order of BusID.

              BusID is generally in this format: BusID-port[.port][.port]:DeviceID

              Device  ID is a number created by the kernel, and has no necessary ordering or sequence connection, but can be used to match this output to lsusb values, which generally shows BusID / Devi‐
              ceID (except for tree view, which shows ports).

              Examples: Device-3: 4-3.2.1:2 or Hub: 4-0:1

              The rev: 2.0 item refers to the USB revision number, like 1.0 or 3.1.

              Use -Jx for basic Si base 10 bits/s speed, -Jxx for Si and IEC base 2 Bytes/s speeds. -Ja adds USB mode.

       -l , --label
              Show partition labels. Use with -j, -o, -p, and -P to show partition labels. Requires one of those options.

              Sample: -ojpl.

       -L, --logical
              Show Logical volume information, for LVM, LUKS, bcache, etc. Shows size, free space (for LVM VG). For LVM, shows Device-[xx]: VG: (Volume Group)  size/free,  LV-[xx]  (Logical  Volume).  LV
              shows type, size, and components.  Note that components are made up of either containers (aka, logical devices), or physical devices. The full report requires doas/sudo/root.

              Logical block devices can be thought of as devices that are made up out of either other logical devices, or physical devices. inxi does its best to show what each logical device is made out
              of. RAID devices form a subset of all possible Logical devices, but have their own section, -R.

              If -R is used with -Lxx, -Lxx will not show RAID information for LVM RAID devices since it's redundant. If -R is not used, a simple RAID line will appear for LVM RAID in -Lxx.

              -Lxx also shows all components and devices. Note that since components can go in many levels, each level per primary component is indicated by either another 'c', or ends with a 'p' device,
              the physical device. The number of c's or p's indicates the depth, so you can see which component belongs to which.

              -L shows only the top level components/devices (like -R).  -La shows component/device size, maj:min ID, mapped name (if applicable), and puts each component/device on its own line.

              Sample:

                Device-10: mybackup type: LUKS dm: dm-28 size: 6.36 GiB Components:
                  c-1: md1 cc-1: dm-26 ppp-1: sdj2 cc-2: dm-27 ppp-1: sdk2
                LV-5: lvm_raid1 type: raid1 dm: dm-16 size: 4.88 GiB
                  RAID: stripes: 2 sync: idle copied: 100% mismatches: 0
                Components: c-1: dm-10 pp-1: sdd1 c-2: dm-11 pp-1: sdd1 c-3: dm-13
                  pp-1: sde1 c-4: dm-15 pp-1: sde1

              It  is  easier  to  follow  the  flow of components and devices using -y1. In this example, there is one primary component (c-1), md1, which is made up of two components (cc-1,2), dm-26 and
              dm-27. These are respectively made from physical devices (p-1) sdj2 and sdk2.

              Device-10: mybackup
                maj-min: 254:28

              Memory (RAM) data. Does not display with -b or -e unless you use -m explicitly. Ordered by system board physical system memory array(s) (Array-[number]), and individual memory devices  (De‐
              vice-[number]).  Physical memory array data shows array capacity, number of devices supported, and Error Correction information. Devices shows locator data (highly variable in syntax), type
              (eg: type: DDR3)size, speed.

              Note: inxi -m uses either dboot (BSDs), dmidecode, or udevadm (Linux) to collect the RAM data. Not all boards have DMI RAM data available.

              dmidecode must be run as root (or start inxi with doas/sudo), unless you figure out how to set up doas/sudo to permit dmidecode to read /dev/mem as user.

              udevadm  can  be run by non-superuser, or if dmidecode is not installed (Linux only). It has a slightly less reliable dmi table report, and does not seem to support more than 1 board memory
              array, but is pretty good. Voltages may be wrong however.

              Both dmidecode and udevadm need a DMI table with RAM data to create the report. Most SBC/SOC boards don't have dmi based RAM data. But most other machines do.

              speed and bus-width will not show if no module installed is found in size.

              Note: If -m is triggered RAM available/used report will appear in this section, not in -I or -tm items.

              Because dmi source data is somewhat unreliable, inxi will try to make best guesses. If you see (check) after the capacity number, you should check  it  with  the  specifications.  (est)  is
              slightly  more  reliable,  but  you should still check the real specifications before buying RAM. Unfortunately there is nothing inxi can do to get truly reliable data about the system RAM;
              maybe one day the kernel devs will put this data into /sys, and make it real data, taken from the actual system, not dmi data. For most people, the data will be  right,  but  a  significant
              percentage of users will have either a wrong max module size, if available, or max capacity.

              Under  dmidecode/udevadm, speed: is the expected speed of the memory (spec:, what is advertised on the memory spec sheet) and actual:, what the actual speed is now. To handle this, if speed
              and configured speed values are different, you will see this instead:

              speed: spec: [specified speed] MT/s actual: [actual] MT/s

              Also, if DDR, and speed in MHz, will change to: speed: [speed] MT/s ([speed] MHz)

              If the detected speed is logically absurd, like 1 MT/s or 69910 MT/s, adds: note: check. Sample:

              Memory:
                System RAM: total: 32 GiB note: est. available: 31.38 GiB

              See --memory-modules and --memory-short if you want a shorter report.

              Notes on System RAM: / Memory: report item:

              * total: and igpu: do not show for short form.

              * The total: can come from several possible sources:

              - If not superuser, and if /sys/devices/system/memory exists, it will estimate the total RAM based on how many RAM blocks and their size. Sometimes the block count is not an exact match  to
              installed RAM, and inxi will attempt to guess the actual RAM amount, except for virtual machines. When it synthesizes the actual physical RAM total, it will show note: est..

              Note that not all kernels are compiled to support generating this /sys directory (kernel needs to be compiled with CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG).

              - For OpenBSD and not superuser, the total comes from the detected RAM in dboot, if available.

              -  If  superuser, and if -m used, it comes from the dmidecode RAM totals if available, and if not, it comes from counting up the System RAM ranges in /proc/iomem (Linux only), then rounding
              up, since that total is usually slightly under the actual physical RAM total. If inxi is unsure about the total, it will show note: est..

              If no total data found, shows total: N/A.

              * The available: item is the total installed RAM minus some reserved and kernel code RAM (and in some cases iGPU assigned main system RAM) that is allocated on system boot, and thus is gen‐
              erally less than the actual physical RAM installed. This is called MemTotal in free/meminfo even though it isn't, though it is the total available the kernel has to work with.

              * The used: is the percent of the available RAM used, NOT of the total physical RAM.

              * The igpu: item either comes from Raspberry Pi gpu RAM, or from /proc/iomem. The latter source is Linux + superuser only, and is not guaranteed to be accurate, but sometimes  is.  That  is
              for iGPU system RAM used, not for standalone GPUs with their own internal RAM. Not all types of internal VRAM are detectable, it depends on how the hardware assigns RAM to iGPU.

              Raspberry Pi uses vcgencmd get_mem gpu to get gpu RAM amount, if user is in video group and vcgencmd is installed.

       --memory-modules, --mm
              Memory (RAM) data. Show only RAM arrays and modules in Memory report.  Skip empty slots. See -m.

       --memory-short, --ms
              Memory (RAM) data. Show a one line RAM report in Memory. See -m.

              Sample: Report: arrays: 1 slots: 4 modules: 2 type: DDR4

       -M , --machine
              Show  machine  data. Device, Motherboard, BIOS, and if present, System Builder (Like Lenovo). Older systems/kernels without the required /sys data can use dmidecode instead, run as root. If
              using dmidecode, may also show BIOS/UEFI revision as well as version. --dmidecode forces use of dmidecode data instead of /sys. Will also attempt to show if the system was booted  by  BIOS,
              UEFI, or UEFI [Legacy], the latter being legacy BIOS boot mode in a system board using UEFI.

              Device information requires either /sys or dmidecode. Note that other-vm? is a type that means it's usually a VM, but inxi failed to detect which type, or positively confirm which VM it is.
              Primary  VM  identification  is  via  systemd-detect-virt but fallback tests that should also support some BSDs are used. Less commonly used or harder to detect VMs may not be correctly de‐
              tected. If you get an incorrect report, post an issue and we'll get it fixed if possible.

              Due to unreliable vendor data, device type will show: desktop, laptop, notebook, server, blade, plus some obscure stuff that inxi is unlikely to ever run on.

       -n , --network-advanced
              Show Advanced Network device information in addition to that produced by -N. Shows interface, speed, MAC ID, state, etc.

       -N , --network
              Show Network device(s) information, including device driver. With -x, shows Bus ID, Port number.

       -o , --unmounted
              Show unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if available).  Shows file system type if you have lsblk installed (Linux only). For BSD/GNU Linux: shows file system  type  if
              file is installed, and if you are root or if you have added to /etc/sudoers (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

              <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file (sample)

              doas users: see man doas.conf for setup.

              Does not show components (partitions that create the md-raid array) of md-raid arrays.

              To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use with -l or -u.

       -p , --partitions-full
              Show full Partition information (-P plus all other detected mounted partitions).

              To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use with -l or -u.

       --partitions-sort, --ps [dev-base|fs|id|label|percent-used|size|uuid|used]
              Change default sort order of partition report. Corresponds to PARTITION_SORT configuration item. These are the available sort options:

              dev-base - /dev partition identifier, like /dev/sda1.  Note that it's an alphabetic sort, so sda12 is before sda2.

              fs - Partition filesystem. Note that sorts will be somewhat random if all filesystems are the same.

              id - Mount point of partition (default).

              label - Label of partition. If partitions have no labels, sort will be random.

              percent-used - Percentage of partition size used.

              size - KiB size of partition.

              uuid - UUID of the partition.

              used - KiB used of partition.

       -P , --partitions
              Show  basic  Partition  information.   Shows,  if  detected: / /boot /boot/efi /home /opt /tmp /usr /usr/home /var /var/tmp /var/log (for android, shows /cache /data /firmware /system).  If
              --swap is not used, shows active swap partitions (never shows file or zram type swap). Use -p to see all mounted partitions.

              To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use with -l or -u.

       --processes
              See -t.

       -r , --repos
              Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types:

              YUM/ZYPP (Fedora, Red Hat, Suse + derived versions)

              More will be added as distro data is collected. If yours is missing please show us how to get this information and we'll try to add it.

              See -rx, -rxx, and -ra for installed package count information.

       -R , --raid
              Show RAID data. Shows RAID devices, states, levels, device/array size, and components. See extra data with -x / -xx.

              md-raid: If device is resyncing, also shows resync progress line.

              Note: supported types: lvm raid, md-raid, softraid, ZFS, and hardware RAID.  Other software RAID types may be added, if the software RAID can be made to give the required output.

              The component ID numbers work like this: mdraid: the numerator is the actual mdraid component number; lvm/softraid/ZFS: the numerator is auto-incremented counter only. Eg. Online: 1: sdb1

              If hardware RAID is detected, shows basic information. Due to complexity of adding hardware RAID device disk / RAID reports, those will only be added if there is demand, and reasonable  re‐
              porting tools.

       --recommends
              Checks inxi application dependencies and recommends, as well as directories, then shows what package(s) you need to install to add support for each feature.

       -s , --sensors
              Show  report  from  sensors  if  sensors installed/configured: Motherboard/CPU/GPU temperatures; detected fan speeds. GPU temperature when available. Nvidia shows screen number for multiple
              screens. IPMI sensors are also used (root required) if present.

              See Advanced options --sensors-use or --sensors-exclude if you want to use only a subset of all sensors, or exclude one (currently only for lm-sensors and /sys sourced data).

              For current Linux, will fallback gracefully to using /sys/class/hwmon as sensor data source if lm-sensors is not installed. You can compare the two by using --force sensors-sys option  with
              -s.

       --slots
              Show PCI slots with type, speed, and status information.

       --swap
              See -j

       -S , --system
              Show  System  information:  host  name, kernel, desktop environment (if in X), distro. With -xx show dm - or startx - (only shows if present and running if out of X), and if in X, with -xxx
              show more desktop info, e.g. taskbar or panel.

       -t , --processes
              [c|m|cm|mc NUMBER] Show processes. If no arguments, defaults to cm. If followed by a number, shows that number of processes for each type (default: 5; if in IRC, max: 5)

              Make sure that there is no space between letters and numbers (e.g. write as -t cm10).

       -t c   - CPU only. With -x, also shows memory for that process on same line.

       -t m   - memory only. With -x, also shows CPU for that process on same line.  If the -I or -m lines are not triggered, will also show the system RAM used/total information.

              See -m for explanation of System RAM: fields and values.

       -t cm  - CPU+memory. With -x, shows also CPU or memory for that process on same line.

       -u , --uuid
              Show UUIDs. Use with -j, -M -o, -p, and -P to show partition/system board (not common) UUIDs. Requires one of those options.

              Sample: -opju.

       -U , --update
              Note - Maintainer may have disabled this function.

              If inxi -h has no listing for -U then it's disabled.

              Auto-update inxi or pinxi. Note: if you installed as root, you must be root to update, otherwise user is fine. Also installs / updates current man  page  to:  /usr/local/share/man/man1  (if
              /usr/local/share/man/  exists AND there is no inxi man page in /usr/share/man/man1, otherwise it goes to /usr/share/man/man1). This requires that you be root to write to that directory. See
              --man or --no-man to force or disable man install.

              -U accepts the following options (inxi and pinxi):

              No arg - Get from main git branch.

              3 - Get the dev server (smxi.org) version. Be aware that pinxi when taken from here can be very unstable during active development! The inxi version is the  stable  master  branch  version.
              Also useful to update if you have SSL issues and --no-ssl works.

              4  -  Get the dev server (smxi.org) FTP version (same as 3 version). Use if SSL issues and --no-ssl doesn't work. For very old systems with SSL 1, you will probably need to use this option,
              which bypasses HTTP downloading, and uses straight FTP to get the file from smxi.org server.

              [http|https|ftp] - Get a version of $self_name from your own server. Use the full download path, e.g.

              inxi -U https://myserver.com/inxi

              For failed downloads, use the debug option --dbg 1 in addition to get more verbose failure reports.

       --usb
              See -J.

       -v , --verbosity
              Report verbosity levels. If no verbosity level number is given, 0 is assumed.  Should not be used with -b or -e since the option that triggers the most features will override the  one  with
              fewer.

              Supported levels: 0-8

              Can be used together with other options.

              Examples: inxi -v 4  or inxi -v4 or inxi --verbosity 4 or inxi -zv8

       -v 0   - Simple report. Same as: inxi (with no options).

       -v 1   - Basic report: System (-S); basic CPU (cores, type, average clock speed, and min/max speeds, if available); Graphics (-G); basic Disk; Info (-I).

       -v 2   - Adds: Machine (-M); Battery (-B) (if available); Networking devices (-N). Same as inxi -b.

       -v 3   - Adds: full CPU (-C); advanced network (-n); triggers -x extra data option.

       -v 4   - Adds: full Drive (-D); system Partitions (-P) (if present): / /home /var/ /boot.

       -v 5   - Adds: memory/RAM (-m); audio device (-A); bluetooth (-E) (if present); RAID data (-R) (if present); partition label (-l) and UUID (-u); swap (-j); sensors (-s),

       -v 6   - Adds: full mounted partitions (-p); unmounted partitions (-o); optical drives (-d); USB (-J); triggers -xx extra data option.

       -v 7   -  Adds: full CPU flags/features (-f); advanced network IP (-i); triggers -xxx; forces battery (-B), bluetooth (-E), Logical devices (-L) and RAID (-R) regardless whether data was found for
              them or not.

       -v 8   - Adds: PCI slots (--slots); GPU advanced EDID data (--edid); Repos (-r); Processes (-tcm); triggers -a admin data option. This is all the available system data.

       --version, --vf
              inxi full version and license information. Prints information then exits.

       --version-short, --vs
              inxi single line version information. Prints information if not short form (which shows version info already). Does not exit unless used without any other options. Can be used  with  normal
              line options, and prints version info line as first line of output.

       -w , --weather [location]
              DO  NOT USE THIS FEATURE FOR AUTOMATED WEATHER UPDATES! Automated or excessive use will lead to your being blocked from any further access. This feature is not meant for widget type weather
              monitoring, or Conky type use. It is meant to get weather when you need to see it, for example, on a remote server. If you did not type the weather option in manually, it's an automated re‐
              quest.

              Adds weather line for your current location (by IP address) if no location requested. To get weather for an alternate location, add [location]. See also -x, -xx, -xxx options.  Please  note
              that your distribution's maintainer may chose to disable this feature.

              With  optional [location] - get weather/time for an alternate location.  Accepts postal/zip code[, country], city,state pair, or latitude,longitude.  Note: city/country/state names must not
              contain spaces. Replace spaces with the '+' sign. Don't place spaces around any commas. Postal code is not reliable except for North America and maybe the UK.  Try  postal  codes  with  and
              without  country  code  added.  Note that City,State applies only to USA, otherwise it's City,Country. If country name (english) does not work, try 2 character country code (e.g. Spain: es;
              Great Britain: gb).

              See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 for current 2 letter country codes.

              Use only ASCII letters in city/state/country names.

              Examples: -w OR -w 95623,us OR -w Boston,MA OR -w 45.5234,-122.6762 OR -w new+york,ny OR -w bodo,norway.

       --weather-source, --ws [source-id]
              [1-9] Switches weather data source. Possible values are 1-9.  1-4 will generally be active, and 5-9 may or may not be active, so check. 1 may not support city / country  names  with  spaces
              (even if you use the + sign instead of space). 2 offers pretty good data, but may not have all small city names for -w location.

              Please  note  that the data sources are not static per value, and can change any time, or be removed, so always test to verify which source is being used for each value if that is important
              to you. Data sources may be added or removed on occasions, so try each one and see which you prefer. If you get unsupported source message, it means that number has not been implemented.

       --weather-unit, --wu [unit]
              [m|i|mi|im] Sets weather units to metric (m), imperial (i), metric (imperial) (mi, default), imperial (metric) (im). If metric or imperial not found,sets to default value, or N/A.

FILTER OPTIONS
       The following options allow for applying various types of filtering to the output.

       --filter , --filter-override
              See -z, -Z.

       --filter-label, --filter-uuid, --filter-vulnerabilities
              See --zl, --zu, --zv.

       --host Turns on hostname in System line. Overrides inxi config file value (if set):

              SHOW_HOST='false' - Same as: SHOW_HOST='true'

              This is an absolute override, the host will always show no matter what other switches you use.

       --no-host
              Turns off hostname in System line. This is default when using -z, for anonymizing inxi report for posting on forums or IRC. Overrides configuration value (if set):

              SHOW_HOST='true' - Same as: SHOW_HOST='false'

              This is an absolute override, the host will not show no matter what other switches you use.

       -z, --filter
              Adds security filters for IP addresses, serial numbers, MAC, location (-w), and user home directory name. Removes Host:. On by default for IRC clients.

       --za, --filter-all
              Shortcut to trigger -z, --zl, --zu, --zv. All the filters, that is.

       --zl, --filter-label
              Filter partition label names from -j, -o, -p, -P, and -Sa (root=LABEL=...). Generally only useful in very specialized cases.

       --zu, --filter-uuid
              Filter partition UUIDs from -j, -o, -p, -P, -Sa (root=UUID=...), -Mxxx board UUID. Useful in specialized cases.

       --zv, --filter-v, --filter-vulnerabilities
              Filter Vulnerabilities report from -Ca. Generally only useful in very specialized cases.

       -Z , --filter-override , --no-filter
              Absolute override for output filters. Useful for debugging networking issues in IRC for example.

OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS
       The following options allow for modifying the output in various ways.

       -c , --color [0-42]
              Set color scheme. If no scheme number is supplied, 0 is assumed.

       -c  [94-99]
              These color selectors run a color selector option prior to inxi starting which lets you set the config file value for the selection.

              NOTE: All configuration file set color values are removed when output is piped or redirected. You must use the explicit runtime -c [color number] option  if  you  want  color  codes  to  be
              present in the piped/redirected output.

              Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: IRC and global only show safe color set):

       -c 94  - Console, out of X.

       -c 95  - Terminal, running in X - like xTerm.

       -c 96  - GUI IRC, running in X - like XChat, Quassel, Konversation etc.

       -c 97  - Console IRC running in X - like irssi in xTerm.

       -c 98  - Console IRC not in X.

       -c 99  - Global - Overrides/removes all settings.

              Setting a specific color type removes the global color selection.

       --export [json|screen|xml]
              See --output.

       --indent [11-xx]
              Change primary wide indent width. Generally useless. Only applied if output width is greater than max wrap width (see --max-wrap). Use configuration item INDENT to make permanent.

       --indents [0-10]
              Change primary wrap mode, second, and -y1 level indents. First indent level only applied if output width is less than max wrap width (see --max-wrap). 0 disables all wrapped indents and all
              second level indents. Use configuration item INDENTS to make permanent.

       --max-wrap, --wrap-max [integer]
              Overrides  default  or  configuration set line starter wrap width value. Wrap max is the maximum width that inxi will wrap line starters (e.g. Info:) to their own lines, with data lines in‐
              dented default 2 columns (use --indents to change).

              If terminal/console width or --width is less than wrap width, wrapping of line starter occurs. If 80 or less, no wrapping will occur. Overrides internal default value (110) and user config‐
              uration value MAX_WRAP.

       --output,  --export [json|screen|xml]
              Change data output type. Requires --output-file if not screen.

              See this page https://smxi.org/docs/inxi-json-xml-output.htm BEFORE you post an issue about not understanding, or being unable to use, the output format! That gives a fairly complete expla‐
              nation of what the output means, and how to work with it. It is not a tutorial, and it will not teach you to program, if you don't know how to work with json/xml structures using  a  proper
              language, then this feature is not meant for you.

       --output-file,  --export-file [full path to output file|print]
              The given directory path must exist. The directory path given must exist, The print options prints to stdout.  Required for non-screen --output formats (json|xml).

       --separator, --sep [character(s)]
              Change the default report key: value separator : to something else. Make permanent with configuration item SEP2_CONSOLE.

       --wrap-max [integer]
              See --max-wrap.

       -y, --width [integer]
              This is an absolute width override which sets the output line width max.  Overrides COLS_MAX_IRC, COLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY, COLS_MAX_CONSOLE configuration items, or the actual widths of the ter‐
              minal.

              * -y - sets default width of 80 columns.
              * -y [60-xxx] - sets width to given number. Must be 60 or more.
              * -y 1 -  switches to a single indented key/value pair per line, and removes all long line wrapping (similar to dmidecode output). Not recommended for use with -Y;
              * -y -1 - removes width limits (if assigned by configuration items).

              Examples:
              inxi -exx -y 130
              inxi -exxy
              inxi -bay1

       -Y, --height, --less [-3-[integer]
              Control output height. Useful when in console, and scrollback not available.  Breaks output flow based on values provided.

              * -Y 0 or -Y - Set default max height to terminal height.
              * -Y [1-xxx] - set max output block height height in lines.
              * -Y -1 - Print out one primary data item block (like CPU:, System:) at a time. Useful for very long outputs like -ea, -v8, etc. Not available for -h.
              * -Y -2 - Do not disable output colors when redirected or piped to another program. Useful if piping output to less -R for example. This does not limit the height otherwise since the expec‐
              tation it is being piped to another program like less which will handle that.
              * -Y -3 - Restore default unlimited output lines if LINES_MAX configuration item set.

              Recommended to use the following for very clean up and down scrollable output out of display, while retaining the color schemes, which are normally removed with piping or redirect:

              pinxi -v8Y -2 | less -R

              Note: since it's not possible for inxi to know how many actual terminal lines are being used by terminal wrapped output, with -y 1 , it may be better in general to use a fixed height like:

              -y 1 -Y 20 instead of: -y 1 -Y

EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
       These options can be triggered by one or more -x.  Alternatively, the -v options trigger them in the following way: -v 3 adds -x; -v 6 adds -xx; -v 7 adds -xxx

       These extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in-depth data on various options. They can be added to any long form option list, e.g.: -bxx or -Sxxx

       There are 3 extra data levels:
       -x, -xx, -xxx
       OR
       --extra 1, --extra 2, --extra 3

       The following details show which lines / items display extra information for each extra data level.

       -x -A  - Adds (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which shows specific vendor [product] information.

              - Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each device.

              - Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

              - Adds inactive sound servers/APIs, if detected.

       -x -B  - Adds battery health: (uncommon. If other than 'good', always shows for -B.

              - Adds battery temperature, in C (uncommon).

              - Adds vendor/model, battery status (if battery present).

              - Adds attached battery powered peripherals (Device-[number]:) if detected (keyboard, mouse, etc.).

              - Adds battery volts:, min: voltages. Note that if difference is critical, that is current voltage is too close to minimum voltage, shows without -x.

       -x -C  - Adds bogomips to CPU speed report (if available).

              -  Adds  L1:  and  L3: cache types if either are present/available. For BSD or legacy Linux, uses dmidecode + doas/sudo/root. Force use of dmidecode cache values by adding --dmidecode. This
              will override /sys based cache data, which tends to be better, so in general don't do that.

              - Adds boost: [enabled|disabled] if detected, aka turbo. Not all CPUs have this feature.

              - Adds CPU Flags-basic: (short list). Use -f to see full flag/feature list.

              - Adds CPU microarchitecture + revision (e.g. Sandy Bridge, K8, ARMv8, P6, etc.). Only shows data if detected. Newer microarchitectures will have to be added as they appear, and require the
              CPU family ID, model ID, and stepping.

              - Adds, if smt (Simultaneous MultiThreading) is available but disabled, after type: data smt: disabled. type: MT means it's enabled. See -Cxxx.

              Examples:
              arch: Sandy Bridge rev: 2
              arch: K8 rev.F+ rev: 2

              If unable to non-ambiguosly determine architecture, will show something like: arch: Amber Lake note: check rev: 9

              - Adds CPU highest speed after avg: [speed] high: [speed] if greater than 1 core and cores have different speeds. Linux only.

       -x -d  - Adds more items to Features line of optical drive; dds rev version to optical drive.

       -x -D  - Adds drive temperature with disk data.

              Method 1: Systems running Linux kernels ~5.6 and newer should have drivetemp module data available. If so, drive temps will come from /sys data for each drive, and will not require root  or
              hddtemp. This method is MUCH faster than using hddtemp. Note that NVMe drives do not require drivetemp.

              If your drivetemp module is not enabled, enable it:

              modprobe drivetemp

              Once enabled, add drivetemp to /etc/modules or /etc/modules-load.d/***.conf so it starts automatically.

              If  you see drive temps running as regular user and you did not configure system to use doas/sudo hddtemp, then your system supports this feature. If no /sys data is found, inxi will try to
              use hddtemp methods instead for that drive.  Hint: if temp is /sys sourced, the temp will be to 1 decimal, like 34.8, if hddtemp sourced, they will be integers.

              Method 2: if you have hddtemp installed, if you are root or if you have added to /etc/sudoers (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

              <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/hddtemp (sample)

              doas users: see man doas.conf for setup.

              You can force use of hddtemp for all drives using --hddtemp.

              - If free LVM volume group size detected (root required), show lvm-free: on Local Storage line. This is how much unused space the VGs contain, that is, space not assigned to LVs.

       -x -E (--bluetooth)
              - Adds (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which shows specific vendor [product] information.

              - Adds PCI/USB Bus ID of each device.

              - Adds driver version (if available) for each device.

              - Adds (if available, btmgmt, hciconfig only) LMP (HCI if no LMP data, and HCI if HCI/LMP versions are different) version (if available) for each HCI ID.

       -x -G  - Adds GPU micro-architecture (if AMD/Intel/Nvidia and detected).

              - Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

              - Adds (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which shows specific vendor [product] information.

              - X.org: Adds (for single GPU, nvidia driver) screen number that GPU is running on.

              - Adds device temperature for each discrete device (Linux only).

              - For EGL, adds active/inactive platform report.

              - For OpenGL (X.org only) adds direct render status, GLX version.

              - For Vulkan, adds device count.

       -x -i  - Adds IP v6 additional scope data, like Global, Site, Temporary for each interface.

              Note that there is no way we are aware of to filter out the deprecated IP v6 scope site/global temporary addresses from the output of ifconfig. The ip tool shows that clearly.

              ip-v6-temporary - (ip tool only), scope global temporary.  Scope global temporary deprecated is not shown

              ip-v6-global - scope global (ifconfig will show this for all types, global, global temporary, and global temporary deprecated, ip shows it only for global)

              ip-v6-link - scope link (ip/ifconfig) - default for -i.

              ip-v6-site - scope site (ip/ifconfig). This has been deprecated in IPv6, but still exists. ifconfig may show multiple site values, as with global temporary, and global temporary deprecated.

              ip-v6-unknown - unknown scope

       -x -I  - Adds current init system (and init rc in some cases, like OpenRC).  With -xx, shows init/rc version number, if available.

              - Adds default system compilers. With -xx, also show other installed compiler versions.

              - Adds current runlevel/target (not available with all init systems).

              - Adds total packages discovered in system. See -xx and -a for per package manager type reports. Moves to Repos if -rx.

              If your package manager is not supported, please file an issue and we'll add it.  That requires the full output of the query or method to discover all installed packages on your system,  as
              well of course as the command or method used to discover those.

              - If in shell (i.e. not in IRC client), adds shell version number, if available.

       -x -j (--swap)
              Add mapper:. See -x -o.

       -x -J (--usb)
              - For Devices, adds driver(s).

              -  Adds,  if  available,  USB speed in base 10 bits/s (Si) units Mb/s or Gb/s (may be incorrect on BSDs due to non reliable data source). These are base 10 bits per second. This unit corre‐
              sponds to the standard units the USB consortium uses to indicate speeds, but not to how most of the rest of your system reports sizes. Use -Jxx to add base 2 IEC Byte/second speeds.

       -x -L (--logical)
              - Adds dm: dm-x to VG > LV and other Device types. This can help tracking down which device belongs to what.

       -x -m, --memory-modules
              - If present, adds maximum memory module/device size in the Array line.  Only some systems will have this data available. Shows estimate if it can generate one.

       -x -N  - Adds (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which shows specific vendor [product] information.

              - Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each device;

              - Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

              - Adds device temperature for each discrete device (Linux only).

       -x -o, -x -p, -x -P
              - Adds mapper: (the /dev/mapper/ partition ID) if mapped partition.

              Example: ID-4: /home ... dev: /dev/dm-6 mapped: ar0-home

       -x -r  - Adds Package info. See -Ix

       -x -R  - md-raid: Adds second RAID Info line with extra data: blocks, chunk size, bitmap (if present). Resync line, shows blocks synced/total blocks.

              - Hardware RAID: Adds driver version, Bus ID.

       -x -s  - Adds basic voltages: 12v, 5v, 3.3v, vbat (ipmi, lm-sensors / /sys/class/hwmon if present).

       -x -S  - Adds Kernel compiler version.

              - Adds to Distro: base: if detected. System base will only be seen on a subset of distributions. The distro must be both derived from a parent distro (e.g. Mint from Ubuntu), and explicitly
              added to the supported distributions for this feature. Due to the complexity of distribution identification, these will only be added as relatively solid methods are found for each distrib‐
              ution system base detection.

       -x --slots
              - Adds slot bus-ID:, if found.

       -x -t (--processes)
              - Adds memory use report to CPU (-xt c), and CPU use to memory (-xt m).

       -x -w  - Adds humidity and barometric pressure.

              - Adds wind speed and direction.

       -xx -A - Adds vendor:product ID for each device.

              - Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, if detected).

              - Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

              - Adds with: [item] status: [state/plugin] helper daemons/plugins for the sound API/server.

       -xx -B - Adds current power use, in watts (if available).

              - Adds serial number.

              - Adds a charging: container for all charging specific information.

              - Adds charge cycles (NOTE: there appears to be a problem with the Linux kernel obtaining the cycle count, so this often shows 0. There's nothing that can be done  about  this  glitch,  the
              data is simply not available as of 2018-04-03), Since 0 isn't a real value, shows N/A if not found or 0.

       -xx -D - Adds HDD/SSD drive serial number.

              - Adds drive speed (if available). This is the theoretical top speed of the device as reported. This speed may be restricted by system board limits, eg. a SATA 3 drive on a SATA 2 board may
              report SATA 2 speeds, but this is not completely consistent, sometimes a SATA 3 device on a SATA 2 board reports its design speed.

              NVMe  drives:  adds  lanes, and (per direction) speed is calculated with lane speed * lanes * PCIe overhead. PCIe 1 and 2 have data rates of GT/s * .8 = Gb/s (10 bits required to transfer 8
              bits of data).  PCIe 3 and greater transfer data at a rate of GT/s * 128/130 * lanes = Gb/s (130 bits required to transfer 128 bits of data).

              For a PCIe 3 NVMe drive, with speed of 8 GT/s and 4 lanes (8GT/s * 128/130 * 4 = 31.6 Gb/s):

              speed: 31.6 Gb/s lanes: 4

              - Adds HDD/SSD drive duid, if available. Some BSDs have it.

              - Adds for USB drives USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

       -xx -E (--bluetooth)
              - Adds vendor:product ID of each device.

              - Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe bluetooth, which is rare).

              - Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

              - Adds (hciconfig only) LMP subversion (and/or HCI revision if applicable) for each device.

       -xx -G Triggers much more complete Screen/Monitor report.

              X.org: requires xdpyinfo or xrandr, and the advanced per monitor feature requires xrandr.

              Wayland: requires any tool capable of showing monitor and resolution information. Sway has swaymsg, weston-info or wayland-info can show Wayland information on any Wayland  compositor,  and
              wlr-randr can show Wayland information for any wlroots based compositor.

              Further note that all references to Displays, Screens, and Monitors are referring to the X or Wayland technical terms, not normal consumer usage.

              X.org: 1 Display runs 1 or more Screens, and 1 Screen runs 1 or more Monitors.

              Wayland: The Display is the primary container, and it can contain 1 or more Monitors.

              - Adds vendor:product ID of each device.

              - Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe device and detected).

              - Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

              - Adds output port IDs, active, off (connected but disabled, like a closed laptop lid) and empty. Example:

              ports: active: DVI-I-1,VGA-1 empty: HDMI-A-1

              - Adds Display ID. X.org: the Display running the Screen that runs the Monitors; Wayland: the Display that runs the monitors.

              - Adds compositor, if found (always shows for Wayland).

              - Wayland: Adds to  Display d-rect: if > 1 monitors in Display. This is the size of the rectangle Wayland creates to situate the monitors in.

              -  X.org:  If available, shows alternate: Xorg drivers. This means a driver on the default list of drivers Xorg automatically checks for the device, but which is not installed. For example,
              if you have nouveau driver, nvidia would show as alternate if it was not installed. Note that alternate: does NOT mean you should have it, it's just one of the drivers Xorg checks to see if
              is present and loaded when checking the device. This can let you know there are other driver options. Note that if you have explicitly set the driver in xorg.conf, Xorg will not create this
              automatic check driver list.

              - Xorg: Adds total number of Screens listed for the current Display.

              - Xorg: Adds default Screen ID if Screen (not monitor!) total is greater than 1.

              - X.org: Adds Screen line, which includes the ID (Screen: 0) then s-res (Screen resolution), s-dpi. Remember, this is an Xorg Screen, NOT a monitor screen, and  the  information  listed  is
              about the Xorg Screen! It may at times be the same as a single monitor system, but usually it's different in some ways. Note that the physical monitor dpi and the Xorg dpi are not necessar‐
              ily the same thing, and can vary widely.

              -  Adds  Monitor  lines.  Monitors are a subset of a Screen (X.org) or Display (Wayland), each of which can have one or more monitors. Normally a dual monitor setup is 2 monitors run by one
              Xorg Screen/Wayland Display.

              - res: is the current monitor mode, along with the frequency hz:.

              - pos: [primary,]{position string|row-col} (X.org: requires xrandr; Wayland: requires swaymsg [sway], wlr-randr [wlroots based compositors], weston-info / wayland-info [all]).  Uses  either
              explicit primary value or +0+0 position if no primary monitor value set.  pos: does not show for single monitor setups, or if no position data was found.

              Position is text (left, center, center-l, center-r, right, top, top-left, top-center, top-right, middle, middle-c, middle-r, bottom, bottom-l, bottom-c, bottom-r) if monitors fit within the
              following grids: 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 3x1, 3x2, 3x3. If layout not supported in text, uses [row-nu]-[column-nu] instead to indicate the monitor's position in its grid.

              The position is based on the upper left corner of each monitor relative to the grid of monitors that the Xorg Screen is composed of.

              - diag: monitor screen diagonal in mm (inches). Note that this is the real monitor size, not the Xorg full Screen diagonal size, which can be quite different.

              - For EGL, shows platform by specific platforms, with driver and egl version if different from the main one.

              - For OpenGL, adds ES version (es-v) if available. If the Display line did not find an X11 display ID, the ID (e.g. :0.0) will show here instead.

              - For OpenGL, Vulkan, adds device-ID, if available.

              - For Vulkan, adds per Device ID report (type, driver, device-ID).

              with 0 packages. See -a for full report. Moves to Repos if -rxx.

              - Adds parent program (or pty/tty) that started shell, if not IRC client.

       -xx -j (--swap), -xx -p, -xx -P

       -xx -m, --memory-modules
              - Adds memory device Manufacturer.

              -  Adds  memory  device  Part  Number (part-no:). Useful for ordering new or replacement memory sticks etc. Part numbers are unique, particularly if you use the word memory in the search as
              well. With -xxx, also shows serial number.

              - Adds single/double bank memory, if data is found. Note, this may not be 100% right all of the time since it depends on the order that data is found in dmidecode output for type 6 and type
              17.

              - Adds, if present, memory array voltage. Only some legacy systems will have this data available.

              - Adds, if run in X, window manager (wm:), if available. Not all window managers are supported. File issue to request a missing one. Some desktops support using more than  one  window  man‐
              ager, so this can be useful to see what window manager is actually running. If none found, shows nothing. Uses a less accurate fallback tool wmctrl if ps tests fail to find data.

              -  Adds  display/login  manager  (dm:/lm:), if present. If none, shows N/A. Supports most known display/login managers, including elogind, entrance, gdm, gdm3, greetd, kdm, lemurs, lightdm,
              lxdm, ly, mdm, mlogind, nodm, sddm, seatd, slim, slimski,  tint, wdm, xdm, and several others, added as discovered.

              - Adds battery charging type (uncommon).

              - Adds attached device rechargeable: [yes|no] information.

       -xxx -C
              - Adds CPU voltage and external clock speed (this is the motherboard speed).  Requires doas/sudo/root and dmidecode.

              - Adds, if smt (Simultaneous MultiThreading) data is available, after type: data smt: [status].
              smt: [status]
              MT in type: will show if smt is enabled in general. 3 values are possible: [enabled|disabled|<unsupported>]. <unsupported> means the CPU does not support SMT.

       -xxx -D
              - Adds HDD/SSD drive firmware revision number (if available).

              - Adds drive partition scheme (in most cases), e.g. scheme: GPT.  Currently not able to detect all schemes, but handles the most common, e.g.  GPT or MBR.

              - Adds drive tech (HDD/SSD), rotation speed (in some but not all cases), e.g. tech: HDD rpm: 7200, or tech: SSD if positive SSD identification was made. If no HDD, rotation, or positive SSD
              ID found, shows tech: N/A. Not all HDD spinning disks report their speed, so even if they are spinning, no rpm data will show.

       -xxx -E (--bluetooth)
              - Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.

              - Adds, if present, bluetooth device class ID.

       -xxx -G
              - Adds, if present, Device PCI/USB class ID.

              - Adds to Device serial: number (if found).

              - Xorg: Adds to Screen: s-size: and s-diag:. (Screen size data requires xdpyinfo). This is the X.org Screen dimensions, NOT the Monitor size!

              - Expands monitor res: to current mode:, hz:, scale:, and if scale != 1, scaled to: resolution.

              - Adds to Monitors (if detected) size (size: 277x156mm (10.9x6.1")). Note that this is the real physical monitor size, not the Xorg Screen/Wayland Display size, which can be quite different
              (1 Xorg Screen / Wayland Display can for instance contain two or more monitors).

              - Adds to Monitors modes: min: max: (if detected). These are the smallest and largest monitor modes found, using an inexact method, so might not always be right.

              - Adds to Monitors serial: number (if detected).

              - For EGL, shows hardware based driver(s) (hw:), with the related hardware, like AMD or Intel.

              - For Vulkan, adds layer count, per device driver hardware vendor (not displayed if device name is present with -a).

       -xxx -I
              - For Power: adds supported system power states:, active suspend: type, active hibernate: type. See https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/admin-guide/pm/sleep-states.html for full  explana‐
              tion of states and actions.

              - For Shell: adds (su|sudo|login) to shell name if present.

              - For Shell: adds default: shell if different from running shell, and default shell v:, if available.

              - For running-in: adds (SSH) to parent, if present. SSH detection uses the whoami test.

       -xxx -J (--usb)
              - Adds, if present, serial number for non hub devices.

              - Adds interfaces: for non hub devices.

              - Adds, if present, USB class ID.

              - Adds, if non 0, max power in mA.

       -xxx -m, --memory-modules
              - Adds memory bus width: primary bus width, and if present, total width. e.g.

              width (bits): data: 64 total: 72

              Note  that  total / data widths are mixed up sometimes in dmidecode output, so inxi will take the larger value as the total if present. Data width usually corresponds to the CPU bits. Total
              can reflect EEC or Dual Channel widths. If no total width data is found, shows:

              width: N/A

              - Adds device type detail, e.g. type: DDR3 detail: Synchronous.

              - Adds device serial number.

              - Adds memory module current, max, and min voltages, if they are available and different from each other. If they are the identical, displays same as -xxm voltage report. Use -ma to  always
              see them.

       -xxx -M
              - Adds, if present, board/chassis UUID, This is also activated by --uuid.

       -xxx -N
              - Adds, if present, serial number.

              - Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.

       -xxx -R
              - md-raid: Adds system mdraid support types (kernel support, read ahead, RAID events)

              - zfs-raid: Adds portion allocated (used) by RAID array/device.

              - Hardware RAID: Adds rev, ports, and (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which shows specific vendor [product] information.

       -xxx -S
              - Adds current kernel clock source, if available (Linux only).

              - Adds (if present), window manager (wm) version number.

              - Adds, if in X, or with --display, bar/dock/menu/panel/tray components (with:). If none found, shows nothing. Examples:  cairo-dock, docky, gnome-panel, lxpanel, tint2, trayer, lxqt-panel,
              xfce4-panel and many others.

              - Adds (if present) tools: item for all detected running screensavers, screen lockers. Note that not all screen lockers run as daemons/services, some are just programs called by other tools
              or actions.

              - Adds (if available, and in display), virtual terminal (vt) number.  These are the same as ctrl+alt+F[x] numbers usually. Some systems have this, some don't, it varies.

              - Adds (if present), display/login manager (dm) version number.

       -xxx -w
              - Adds location (city state country), observation altitude (if available), weather observation time (if available), sunset/sunrise (if available).

ADMIN EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
       These options are triggered with --admin or -a. Admin options are advanced report options, and are more technical, and mostly of interest to system administrators or other machine admins.

       The --admin option sets -xxx, and only has to be used once.  It will trigger the following features:

       -a -A  -  Adds,  if  present, possible alternate: kernel modules capable of driving each Device-x (not including the current driver:). If no non-driver modules found, shows nothing. NOTE: just be‐
              cause it lists a module does NOT mean it is available in the system, it's just something the kernel knows could possibly be used instead.

              - Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe generation, speed or lanes, link-max: gen: speed: lanes: (only items different from primary shown).

              - Adds list of detected audio server tools (tools: [tools]) to API/Server lines, like alsamixer, jack_control, pactl, pavuctl, pw-cli, sndioctl, etc.

              - Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

       -a -C
              - Adds CPU generation, process node, and built years, if detected. For Intel, only will show if Core generation, otherwise the arch value is enough. For AMD, only shows Zen generation.

              - Adds microarchitecture level: (v1,v2,v3,v4) (64 bit Intel/AMD CPUs only). This information is used for setting compile time optimization switches in for example GCC. These levels were in‐
              troduced in 2020.

              Because this a CPU flag based test, and these levels when > 2 are not always 100% based on exposed CPU flags (eg OSXSAVE), for > v2, adds note: check.

              - Adds CPU family, model-id, and stepping (replaces rev of -Cx).  Format is hexadecimal (decimal) if greater than 9, otherwise hexadecimal.

              - Adds CPU microcode. Format is hexadecimal.

              - Adds socket type (for motherboard CPU socket, if available). If results doubtful will list two socket types and note: check. Requires doas/sudo/root and dmidecode. The item in parentheses
              may simply be a different syntax for the same socket, but in general, check this before trusting it.

              Sample: socket: 775 (478) note: check
              Sample: socket: AM4

              - Adds DMI CPU base and boost/turbo speeds. Requires doas/sudo/root and dmidecode. In some cases, like with overclocking or 'turbo' or 'boost' modes, voltage and external clock  speeds  may
              be increased, or short term limits raised on max CPU speeds. These are often not reflected in /sys based CPU min/max: speed results, but often are using this source.

              Samples:
              CPU not overclocked, with boost, like Ryzen:
              Speed (MHz):
                avg: 2861
                high: 3250
                min/max: 1550/3400
                boost: enabled
                base/boost: 3400/3900
              Overclocked 2900 MHz CPU, with no boost available:
              Speed (MHz):
                avg: 2345
                high: 2900
                min/max: 800/2900
                base/boost: 3350/3000
              Overclocked 3000 MHz CPU, with boosted max speed:
              Speed (MHz):
                avg: 3260
                high: 4190
                min/max: 1200/3001
                base/boost: 3000/4000

              Note that these numbers can be confusing, but basically, the base number is the actual normal top speed the CPU runs at without boost mode, and the boost number is the max speed the CPU re‐
              ports  itself  able to run at.  The actual max speed may be higher than either value, or lower. The boost number appears to be hard-coded into the CPU DMI data, and does not seem to reflect
              actual max speeds that overclocking or other combinations of speed boosters can enable, as you can see from the example where the CPU is running at  a  speed  faster  than  the  min/max  or
              base/boost values.

              Note that the normal min/max: speeds do NOT show actual overclocked OR boost/turbo mode speeds, and appear to be hard-coded values, not dynamic real values. The base/boost: values are some‐
              times real, and sometimes not.  base appears in general to be real.

              - Adds frequency scaling: governor:.. driver:.. if found/available. Also adds scaling min/max speeds if different from standard CPU min/max spees (not common).

              - Adds description of cache topology per cpu. Linux only.

              - Creates new Topology: line after the Info: line. Moves cache data to this line from Info: line.

              Topology  line  contains,  if  available  and/or relevant: physical CPU count (cpus:); per physical CPU dies:, clusters:, cores:; threads per core, if > 1 (tpc:); how many threads: (if more
              threads than cores); smt status (if no smt status found, shows N/A).

              Not all CPUs have or report dies or clusters. Some may have dies but no clusters, some clusters but no dies, some dies and clusters, and some neither dies nor clusters. This is  a  function
              of  how  the  CPU  topology  reports itself to the kernel. Note that core counts are per physical CPU, not per die or cluster.  Clusters are per die, and in cases of > 1 dies, will show as:
              clusters: 2x4.

              If complex CPU type, like Alder lake, cores: will have a more granular breakdown of how many mt (multi-threaded) and how many st (single-threaded)  cores  there  are  in  the  physical  cpu
              (mt-cores:, st-cores:);  For complex CPU types like ARM SoC devices with 2 CPU types, with different core counts and/or min/max:) frequencies, variant: per type found, with relevant differ‐
              ences shown, like cores:, min/max:, etc.

              - Adds CPU Vulnerabilities (bugs) as known by your current kernel. Lists by Type: ... (status|mitigation): .... for systems that support this feature (Linux kernel 4.14 or newer, or patched
              older kernels).

       -a -d,-a -D
              - Adds logical and physical block size in bytes.

              Using smartctl (requires doas/sudo/root privileges).

              - Adds device model family, like Caviar Black, if available.

              - Adds SATA type (eg 1.0, 2.6, 3.0) if a SATA device.

              - Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

              - Adds SMART report line: status, enabled/disabled, health, powered on, cycles, and some error cases if out of range values. Note that for Pre-fail items, it will show the VALUE and THRESH‐
              OLD numbers. It will also fall back for unknown attributes that are or have been failing and print out the Attribute name, value, threshold, and failing message. This way even for unhandled
              Attribute  names, you should get a solid report for full failure cases. Other cases may show if inxi believes that the item may be approaching failure. This is a guess so make sure to check
              the drive and smartctl full output to verify before taking any further action.

              - Adds, for USB or other external drives, actual model name/serial if available, and different from enclosure model/serial, and corrects block sizes if necessary.

              - Adds for USB drives USB mode (Linux only).

              - Adds in drive temperature for some drives as well, and other useful data.

       -a -E (--bluetooth)
              - Adds (hciconfig only) extra line to Report:, Info:.  Includes, if available, ACL MTU, SCO MTU, Link policy, Link mode, and Service Classes.

              - Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe generation, speed or lanes, link-max: gen: speed: lanes: (only items different from primary shown. Bluetooth PCIe rare).

              - Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

              - Adds, if present, bluetooth status: discoverable, active discoverable, and pairing items.

       -a -G  - Adds, if present, possible alternate: kernel modules capable of driving each Device-x (not including the current loaded:). If no non-driver modules found, shows nothing.  NOTE:  just  be‐
              cause it lists a module does NOT mean it is available in the system, it's just something the kernel knows could possibly be used instead.

              - Adds (AMD/Intel/Nvidia, if available) process: [node] built: [years] to arch: item.

              -  Adds  (if Linux and Nvidia device) non-free support information (if available). This can be useful for forum support people to determine if the card supports current active legacy Nvidia
              driver branches, or if the card nonfree driver is EOL or active. Note that if card is current, shows basic series and status.

              Includes extended non free Nvidia legacy informatin (Linux and Nvidia only), and arch: reports (AMD/Intel/Nvidia). Useful to help diagnose driver support issues, shows extra data  that  can
              help diagnose/debug. Adds code: item if found and not the same as arch:.

              - Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

              - Adds power daemons/services (services:) running. Note not all services are daemons.

              - Adds to Packages number of lib packages detected per package manager. Also adds detected package managers with 0 packages listed. Adds package manager tools (supported:  rpm,  dpkg,  pkg‐
              tool) Moves to Repos if -ra.

              -  Adds  service  control tool, tested for in the following order: systemctl rc-service rcctl service sv /etc/rc.d /etc/init.d. Can be useful to know which you need when using an unfamiliar

       -a -j (--swap), -a -P [swap], -a -P [swap]
              - Adds swappiness and vfs cache pressure, and a message to indicate if the value is the default value or not (Linux only, and only if available). If not the  default  value,  shows  default
              value as well, e.g.

              For -P per swap physical partition:

              swappiness: 60 (default) cache-pressure: 90 (default 100)

              For -j row 1 report:

              Kernel: swappiness: 60 (default) cache-pressure: 90 (default 100)

              - Adds zswap data for row 1 report:

              zswap: [yes/no] compressor: [type] max-pool: xx%

              - Adds for zram swap type: active compression type, available compression types, and max compression streams.

              - Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

       -a -J (--usb)
              - Adds, if available, USB speed in IEC units MiB/s or GiB/s (may be incorrect on BSDs due to non reliable data source). These are base 2 Bytes per second.

              -  Adds USB mode (Linux only), which is the technical terms the USB group uses to describe USB revisions. In cases where speed and rev are an unknown combination, (and probably at least one
              is wrong) shows message.

              There are no granular data sources in BSDs for accurate revision/lane/speed information, so mode cannot be determined.

              - Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe generation, speed or lanes, link-max: gen: speed: lanes: (only items different from primary shown).

              - Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

              - Adds Info: line (-n, -i only), with running network type services:. Note not all services are daemons. For example, NetworkManager can be started with --no-daemon flag.

       -a -o  - Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

       -a -p,-a -P
              - Adds raw partition size, including file system overhead, partition table, e.g.

              raw-size: 60.00 GiB.

              - Adds percent of raw size available to size: item, e.g.

              size: 58.81 GiB (98.01%).

              Note that used: 16.44 GiB (34.3%) percent refers to the available size, not the raw size.

              - Adds partition filesystem block size if found (requires root and blockdev).

              - Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

       -a -r  - Adds to Packages: report. See -Ia

       -a -R  - Adds device kernel major:minor number (mdraid, Linux only).

              - Adds, if available, component size, major:minor number (Linux only). Turns Component report to 1 component per line.

       -a -S  - Adds alternate kernel clock sources, if available (Linux only).

              - Adds kernel boot parameters to Kernel section (if detected). Support varies by OS type.

              - Adds advanced desktop (info:) item, and version. Currently supports KDE Frameworks and version.

              - Adds other available (avail:) screensavers/lockers in tools: section. These are ones installed, but not necessarily active or running.

       -a --slots
              - Adds PCI children of the main slot bus ID, and their types and class IDs, recursively. Linux only, and only if detected. Sample:

              Slot: 0
                type: PCIe
                lanes: 16
                status: in use
                length: long
                volts: 3.3
                bus-ID: 00:03.1
                  children:

                      type: audio

ADVANCED OPTIONS
       --alt 40
              Bypass Perl as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl (HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

       --alt 41
              Bypass Curl as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl (HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

       --alt 42
              Bypass Fetch as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl (HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

       --alt 43
              Bypass Wget as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl (HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, OpenBSD only: ftp

       --alt 44
              Bypass  Curl,  Fetch,  and Wget as downloader options. This basically forces the downloader selection to use Perl 5.x HTTP::Tiny, which is generally slower than Curl or Wget but it may help
              bypass issues with downloading.

       --bt-tool [bluetoothctl|bt-adapter|btmgmt|hciconfig|rfkill]
              See --force [tool name]. Used to set -E report tool.

       --dig  Shortcut. See --force dig.

       --display [:<integer>]
              Will try to get display data out of X (does not usually work as root user).  Default gets display info from display :0. If you use the format --display :1 then it would get it from  display
              1 instead, or any display you specify.

              Note  that  in some cases, --display will cause inxi to hang endlessly when running the option in console with Intel graphics. The situation regarding other free drivers such as nouveau/ATI
              is currently unknown. It may be that this is a bug with the Intel graphics driver - more information is required.

              You can test this easily by running the following command out of X/display server: glxinfo -display :0

              If it hangs, --display will not work.

       --dmidecode
              Shortcut. See --force dmidecode.

       --downloader [curl|fetch|perl|wget]
              Force inxi to use Curl, Fetch, Perl, or Wget for downloads.

       --egl  Shortcut. See --force egl.

       --force [option(s)]
              Various force options to allow users to override defaults. Values can be given as a comma separated list:

              inxi -MJ --force dmidecode,lsusb

              - bluetoothctl - Force use of bluetoothctl in -E.

              - bt-adapter - Force use of bt-adapter tool in -E.

              - btmgmt - Force use of btmgmt tool in -E.

              - colors - Do not remove colors from piped or redirected output. Same as -Y -2.

              - cpuinfo - Force use of cpuinfo over sys for cpu data in -C.

              - dig - Temporary override of NO_DIG configuration item. Only use to test w/wo dig. Restores default behavior for WAN IP, which is use dig if present.

              - dmidecode - Force use of dmidecode. This will override /sys data in some lines, e.g. -M or -B.

              - egl - Force use of EGL graphics API even if internal rules block it from running due to possible hanging. This is the case sometimes with Intel 32 bit Pentium 4 era Gen2 and  older  GPUs,
              but it's not consistent.

              - hciconfig - Force use of hciconfig tool in -E.

              - hddtemp - Force use of hddtemp instead of /sys temp data for disks.

              -  html-wan  - Temporary override of NO_HTML_WAN configuration item. Only use to test w/wo HTML downloaders for WAN IP. Restores default behavior for WAN IP, which is use HTML downloader if
              present and if dig failed.

              - ifconfig - Force use of IF tool ifconfig for -i.

              - ip - Force use of IF ip tool for -i (default).

              - kscreen - Wayland: Force -G monitor data source kscreen-console.

              - lsusb - Forces the USB data generator to use lsusb as data source (default). Overrides USB_SYS in user configuration file(s).

              - man - Force update / install of man page with -U if pinxi or using -U 3 dev branch. (Only active if -U is is not disabled by maintainers). Default is to install always for inxi,  and  not
              for pinxi.

              - no-dig - Overrides default use of dig to get WAN IP address.  Allows use of normal downloader tool to get IP addresses. Only use if dig is failing, since dig is much faster and more reli‐
              able in general than other methods.

              -  no-doas - Skips the use of doas to run certain internal features (like hddtemp, file) with doas. Not related to running inxi itself with doas/sudo or super user. Some systems will regis‐
              ter errors which will then trigger admin emails in such cases, so if you want to disable regular user use of doas (which requires configuration to setup anyway for these options)  just  use
              this option, or NO_DOAS configuration item. See --no-sudo if you need to disable both types.

              - no-egl - Skip eglinfo sourced EGL graphics API in -G. Use if Graphics hangs or running a debugger data set which hangs due to eglinfo bug ( only found on ancient Pentium 4 w/ Gen 2 GPUs).

              - no-graphics-api -  Skip graphics API in -G.

              - no-html-wan - Overrides use of HTML downloaders to get WAN IP address. Use either only dig, or do not get wan IP. Only use if dig is failing, and the HTML downloaders are taking too long,
              or are hanging or failing.

              Make permanent with NO_HTML_WAN='true'

              -  no-man - Disables man page install with -U for master and active development branches. (Only active if -U is is not disabled by maintainers). No man install is default for pinxi. Man in‐
              stall is default for inxi.

              - no-opengl - Skip glxinfo sourced OpenGL graphics API in -G.

              - no-ssl - Skip SSL certificate checks for all downloader actions (-U, -w, -i). Use if your system does not have current SSL certificate lists, or if you have problems making  a  connection
              for any reason.  Works with Wget, Curl, Perl HTTP::Tiny and Fetch.

              - no-sudo  - Skips the use of sudo to run certain internal features (like hddtemp, file) with sudo. Not related to running inxi itself with sudo or superuser. Some systems will register er‐
              rors  which  will  then trigger admin emails in such cases, so if you want to disable regular user use of sudo (which requires configuration to setup anyway for these options) just use this
              option, or NO_SUDO configuration item.

              - no-vulkan - Skip vulkaninfo sourced Vulkan graphics API in -G.

              - rfkill - Force use of rfkill tool in -E. rfkill does not support mac address data.

              - rpm, pkg - Override disabled rpm package counts on primarily rpm run systems due to unacceptably slow execution times for this command on some systems:

              rpm -qa --nodigest --nosignature

              Even on newer rpm systems, in virtual machines, running rpm package list query takes more than 0.15 seconds (compared to 0.01 to 0.05 for dpkg, pacman, pkgtool etc)  for  just  this  single
              feature,  which  is north of 10% of total execution time for inxi -bar. On bare metal this can hit 1 second or more in our tests.  Older systems have taken up to 30 seconds to run this com‐
              mand!

              For systems that support running rpm along with the primary package installer (dpkg/apt, pacman, and pkgtool/slackpkg), there are not going to be many rpms, if any, installed, so  the  com‐
              mand runs in those cases (if inxi can determine it is running in that type of system).

              - sensors-sys - Force use of /sys/class/hwmon data for sensors (excluding ipmi sensors, which are their own line if present), skip lm-sensors. Generally useful for testing since sys data is
              used if no lm-sensors data was found anyway, but if lm-sensors was installed, and returned no data, it's most likely if not nearly certain that /sys will also not return data.

              - swaymsg -  Wayland: Force -G monitor data source swaymsg.

              - udevadm - Forces use of udevadm as data source (currently -m RAM data).

              - usb-sys - Forces the USB data generator to use /sys as data source instead of lsusb (Linux only).

              - vmstat - Forces use of vmstat for memory data.

              - wayland - Wayland: Force use of Wayland data sources, disables x tools glxinfo, xrandr, xdpyinfo.

              - wl-info - Wayland: Force -G monitor data source wayland-info or weston-info.

              - wlr-randr - Wayland: Force -G monitor data source wlr-randr.

              - wmctrl - Force System item wm to use wmctrl as data source, override default ps source.

       --hddtemp
              Shortcut. See --force hddtemp.

       --html-wan
              Shortcut. See --force --html-wan.

       --ifconfig
              Shortcut. See --force ifconfig.

       --man  Shortcut. See --force man.

       --no-dig
              Shortcut. See --force no-dig.

       --no-doas
              Shortcut. See --force no-doas.

       --no-egl
              Shortcut. See --force no-egl.

       --no-html-wan
              Shortcut. See --force no-html-wan.

       --no-man
              Shortcut. See --force no-man.

       --no-opengl
              Shortcut. See --force no-opengl.

       --no-sensor-force
              Overrides user set SENSOR_FORCE configuration value. Restores default behavior.

       --no-ssl
              Shortcut. See --force no-ssl.

       --no-sudo
              Shortcut. See --force no-sudo.

       --pm-type [package manager name]
              For distro package maintainers only, and only for non apt, rpm, or pacman based systems. To be used to test replacement package lists for recommends for that package manager.

       --rpm, --pkg
              Shortcut. See --force rpm.

       --sensors-default
              Overrides configuration values SENSORS_USE or SENSORS_EXCLUDE on a one time basis.

       --sensors-exclude
              Linux only. Similar to --sensors-use except removes listed sensors from sensor data. Make permanent with SENSORS_EXCLUDE configuration item. Note that gpu, network, disk, and other specific
              device monitor chips are excluded by default.

              Example: inxi -sxx --sensors-exclude k10temp-pci-00c3

       --sensors-sys
              Shortcut. See --force sensors-sys

       --sensors-use
              Linux  only.  Use only the (comma separated) sensor arrays for -s report.  Make permanent with SENSORS_USE configuration item. Sensor array ID value must be the exact value shown in lm-sen‐
              sors sensors output (lm-sensors only) or use -s --dbg 18 ('main' =>.. section) to see the sensor ID strings used internally. If you only want to exclude one (or more) sensors from  the  re‐
              port, use --sensors-exclude.

              Can  be  useful if the default sensor data used by inxi is not from the right sensor array. Note that all other sensor data will be removed, which may lead to undesired consequences. Please
              be aware that this can lead to many undesirable side-effects, since default behavior is to use all the sensors arrays and select which values to use from them following a  set  sequence  of
              rules. So if you force one to be used, you may lose data that was used from another one.

              Most  likely best use is when one (or two) of the sensor arrays has all the sensor data you want, and you just want to make sure inxi doesn't use data from another array that has inaccurate
              or misleading data.

              Note that gpu, network, disk, and other specific device monitor chips are excluded by default, and should not be added since they do not provide cpu, board, system, etc, sensor data.

              Example: inxi -sxx --sensors-use nct6791-isa-0290,k10temp-pci-00c3

       --sleep [0-x.x]
              Usually in decimals. Change CPU sleep time for -C (current:  .35).  Sleep is used to let the system catch up and show a more accurate CPU use.  Example:

              inxi -Cxxx --sleep 0.15

              Overrides default internal value and user configuration value:

              CPU_SLEEP=0.25

       --tty  Forces internal IRC flag to off. Used in unhandled cases where the program running inxi may not be seen as a shell/pty/tty, but it is not an IRC client.  Put --tty first in option  list  to
              avoid unexpected errors. If you want a specific output width, use the --width option. If you want normal color codes in the output, use the -c [color ID] flag.

              The  sign  you  need to use this is extra numbers before the key/value pairs of the output of your program. These are IRC, not TTY, color codes. Please post a codeberg.org issue if you find
              you need to use --tty (including the full -Ixxx line) so we can figure out how to add your program to the list of whitelisted programs.

              You can see what inxi believed started it in the -Ixxx line, Shell: or Client: item. Please let us know what that result was so we can add it to the parent start program whitelist.

              In some cases, you may want to also use --no-filter/-Z option if you want to see filtered values. Filtering is turned on by default if inxi believes it is running in an IRC client.

       --usb-sys
              Shortcut. See --force usb-sys

       --usb-tool
              Shortcut. See --force lsusb

       --wan-ip-url [URL]
              Force -i to use supplied URL as WAN IP source. Overrides dig or default IP source urls. URL must start with http[s] or ftp.

              The IP address from the URL must be the last item on the last (non-empty) line of the page content source code.

              Same as configuration value (example):

              WAN_IP_URL='https://mysite.com/ip.php'

       --wayland, --wl
              Shortcut. See --force wayland.

       --wm   Shortcut. See --force wmctl.

DEBUGGING OPTIONS
       --dbg {[1-x][,[1-x]]}
              Accepts one or more comma separated dbg specific debugging numbers.

              1 - Debug downloader failures. Turns off silent/quiet mode for curl, wget, and fetch. Shows more downloader action information. Shows some more information for Perl downloader.

              1-xx - See codeberg.org inxi-perl/docs/inxi-values.txt for specific specialized debugging options. There are a lot.

       --debug [1-3]
              - On screen debugger output.

       --debug 10
              - Basic logging. Check $XDG_DATA_HOME/inxi/inxi.log or $HOME/.local/share/inxi/inxi.log or $HOME/.inxi/inxi.log.

       --debug 11
              - Full file/system info logging.

       --debug 20
              Creates a tar.gz file of system data and collects the inxi report in a file.

              * tree traversal data file(s) read from /proc and /sys, and other system data.

              * xorg conf and log data, xrandr, xprop, xdpyinfo, glxinfo etc.

              * data from dev, disks, partitions, etc.

       --debug 21
              Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to ftp.smxi.org, then removes the debug data directory, but leaves the debug tar.gz file.  See --ftp for uploading to alternate locations.

       --debug 22
              Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to ftp.smxi.org, then removes the debug data directory and the tar.gz file.  See --ftp for uploading to alternate locations.

       --debug-id [string]
              Insert string to file name for debugger. This is helpful so you can add for instance a username to a debugger dataset to make it easy to find.

              Sample: --debug 22 --debug-id mrmazda

       --fake-data-dir
              Developer only: Change default location of $fake_data_dir, which is where files are for --fake {item} items.

       --ftp [ftp.yoursite.com/incoming]
              For alternate ftp upload locations: Example:

              inxi --ftp ftp.yourserver.com/incoming --debug 21

DEBUGGING OPTIONS TO DEBUG DEBUGGER FAILURES
       Only use the following in conjunction with --debug 2[012], and only use if you experienced a failure or hang, or were instructed to do so.

       --debug-proc
              Force debugger to parse /proc directory data when run as root. Normally this is disabled due to unpredictable data in /proc tree.

       --debug-proc-print
              Use this to locate file that /proc debugger hangs on.

       --debug-no-exit
              Skip exit on error when running debugger.

       --debug-no-proc
              Skip /proc debugging in case of a hang.

       --debug-no-sys
              Skip /sys debugging in case of a hang.

       --debug-sys
              Force PowerPC debugger parsing of /sys as doas/sudo/root.

       --debug-sys-print
              Use this to locate file that /sys debugger hangs on.

SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS
       BitchX, Gaim/Pidgin, ircII, Irssi, Konversation, Kopete, KSirc, KVIrc, Weechat, and Xchat. Plus any others that are capable of displaying either built-in or external program output.

RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT
       To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate method from the list below:

       Hexchat, XChat, Irssi
              (and many other IRC clients) /exec -o inxi [options] If you don't include the -o, only you will see the output on your local IRC client.

       Konversation
              /cmd inxi [options]

              To run inxi in Konversation as a native program if your distribution or inxi package hasn't already done this for you, create this symbolic link:

              KDE 4: ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi

              KDE 5: ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/konversation/scripts/inxi

              If inxi is somewhere else, change the path /usr/local/bin to wherever it is located.

              If you are using KDE/QT 5, then you may also need to add the following to get the Konversation /inxi command to work:

              ln -s /usr/share/konversation /usr/share/apps/

              Make sure you also have the qdbus-qt5 package (Debian/Ubuntu + derived), qt5-qttools (Fedora/RHEL/SUSE + derived),  qt5-tools (Arch + derived) installed (for KDE 5/QT 5, check  distros  for
              future package names), qt5-tools (Arch + derived). Check your distro if the program is missing.  Depending on the distro, /usr/lib/qt5/bin/qdbus is required, which in Debian+ is provided by
              the above package.

              Then you can start inxi directly, like this:

              /inxi [options]

       WeeChat
              NEW: /exec -o inxi [options]

              OLD: /shell -o inxi [options]

              Newer (2014 and later) WeeChats work pretty much the same now as other console IRC clients, with /exec -o inxi [options]. Newer WeeChats have dropped the -curses part of their program name,
              i.e.: weechat instead of weechat-curses.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       inxi will read its configuration/initialization files in the following order:

       /etc/inxi.conf  contains  the  default  configurations. These can be overridden by creating a /etc/inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf file (global override), which will prevent distro packages from changing or
       overwriting your edits. This method is recommended if you are using a distro packaged inxi and want to override some global configuration items from the package's default /etc/inxi.conf  file  but
       don't want to lose your changes on a package update.

       In case the distro is using either /usr/etc or /usr/local/etc as non core tool default location, inxi will use those paths instead, with the inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf override option.

       You can also override, per user, with a user configuration file found in one of the following locations (inxi will store its config file using the following precedence):

       if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not empty, it will go there, else if $HOME/.config/inxi.conf exists, it will go there, and as a last default, the legacy location is used), i.e.:

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inxi.conf > $HOME/.config/inxi.conf > $HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf > /usr/etc/inxi.conf > /usr/etc/inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf > /usr/local/etc/inxi.conf > /usr/local/etc/inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf
       > /etc/inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf > /etc/inxi.conf

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       See the documentation page for more complete information on how to set these up, and for a complete list of options:

       https://smxi.org/docs/inxi-configuration.htm

       Basic Options
              Here's a brief overview of the basic options you are likely to want to use:

              COLS_MAX_CONSOLE The max display column width on terminal. If terminal/console width or --width is less than wrap width, wrapping of line starter occurs

              COLS_MAX_IRC The max display column width on IRC clients.

              COLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY The max display column width in out of X / Wayland / desktop / window manager.

              CPU_SLEEP Decimal value 0 or more. Default is usually around 0.35 seconds. Time that inxi will 'sleep' before getting CPU speed data, so that it reflects actual system state.

              DOWNLOADER Sets default inxi downloader: curl, fetch, ftp, perl, wget.  See --recommends output for more information on downloaders and Perl downloaders.

              FILTER_STRING Default <filter>. Any string you prefer to see instead for filtered values.

              INDENT Change primary indent width of wide mode output. See --indent.

              INDENTS Change primary indents of narrow wrapped mode output, and second level indents. See --indents.

              LIMIT Overrides default of 10 IP addresses per IF. This is only of interest to sys admins running servers with many IP addresses.

              LINES_MAX  Values: [-2-xxx]. See -Y for explanation and values.  Use -Y -3 to restore default unlimited output lines. Avoid using this in general unless the machine is a headless system and
              you want the output to be always controlled.

              MAX_WRAP (or WRAP_MAX) The maximum width where the line starter wraps to its own line. If terminal/console width or --width is less than wrap width, wrapping of line starter  occurs.  Over‐
              rides default. See --max-wrap. If 80 or less, wrap will never happen.

              NO_DIG Set to 1 or true to disable WAN IP use of dig and force use of alternate downloaders.

              NO_DOAS Set to 1 or true to disable internal use of doas.

              NO_HTML_WAN  Set to 1 or true to disable WAN IP use of HTML Downloaders and force use of dig only, or nothing if dig disabled as well. Same as --no-html-wan. Only use if dig is failing, and
              HTML downloaders are hanging.

              NO_SUDO Set to 1 or true to disable internal use of sudo.

              PARTITION_SORT Overrides default partition report sort. See --partition-sort for options.

              PS_COUNT The default number of items showing per -t type, m or c. Default is 5.

              SENSORS_CPU_NO In cases of ambiguous temp1/temp2 (inxi can't figure out which is the CPU), forces sensors to use either value 1 or 2 as CPU temperature. See the above configuration page  on
              smxi.org for full info.

              SENSORS_EXCLUDE Exclude supplied sensor array[s] from sensor report.  Override with --sensors-default. See --sensors-exclude.

              SENSORS_USE Use only supplied sensor array[s]. Override with --sensors-default. See --sensors-use.

              SEP2_CONSOLE Replaces default key / value separator of ':'. Test with --separator.

              USB_SYS Forces all USB data to use /sys instead of lsusb.

              WAN_IP_URL  Forces  -i  to use supplied URL, and to not use dig (dig is generally much faster). URL must begin with http or ftp. Note that if you use this, the downloader set tests will run
              each time you start inxi whether a downloader feature is going to be used or not.

              The IP address from the URL must be the last item on the last (non-empty) line of the URL's page content source code.

              Same as --wan-ip-url [URL]

              WEATHER_SOURCE Values: [0-9]. Same as --weather-source.  Values 4-9 are not currently supported, but this can change at any time.

              WEATHER_UNIT Values: [m|i|mi|im]. Same as --weather-unit.

       Color Options
              It's best to use the -c [94-99] color selector tool to set the following values because it will correctly update the configuration file and remove any invalid or conflicting items,  but  if
              you prefer to create your own configuration files, here are the options. All take the integer value from the options available in -c 94-99.

              NOTE: All default and configuration file set color values are removed when output is piped or redirected. You must use the explicit -c [color number] option if you want colors to be present
              in the piped/redirected output (creating a PDF for example).

              CONSOLE_COLOR_SCHEME The color scheme for console output (not in X/Wayland).

              GLOBAL_COLOR_SCHEME Overrides all other color schemes.

              IRC_COLOR_SCHEME Desktop X/Wayland IRC CLI color scheme.

              IRC_CONS_COLOR_SCHEME Out of X/Wayland, IRC CLI color scheme.

              IRC_X_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME In X/Wayland IRC client terminal color scheme.

              VIRT_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME Color scheme for virtual terminal output (in X/Wayland).

       Developer Options
              These are useful only for developers.

              FAKE_DATA_DIR - change default fake data directory location. See --fake-data-dir.

BUGS
       Please report bugs using the following resources.

       You  may be asked to run the inxi debugger tool (see --debug 21/22), which will upload a data dump of system files for use in debugging inxi. These data dumps are very important since they provide
       us with all the real system data inxi uses to parse out its report.

SPECIAL THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING
       The  nice  people  at  irc.oftc.net channels #linux-smokers-club and #smxi, who all really have to be considered to be co-developers because of their non-stop enthusiasm and willingness to provide
       real-time testing and debugging of inxi development over the years.

       LinuxQuestions.org Slackware forum members, for major help with development and debugging new or refactored features, particularly the redone CPU logic of 2021-12.

       Siduction forum members, who have helped get some features working by providing a large number of datasets that have revealed possible variations, particularly for the RAM -m option.

       AntiX users and admins, who have helped greatly with testing and debugging, particularly for the 3.0.0 release.

       ArcherSeven (Max), Brett Bohnenkamper (aka KittyKatt), and Iotaka, who always manage to find the weirdest or most extreme hardware and setups that help make inxi much more robust.

       For the vastly underrated skill of report error/glitch catching, Pete Haddow.  His patience and focus in going through inxi repeatedly to find errors and inconsistencies is much appreciated.

       For a huge boost to BSD support, Stan Vandiver, who did a lot of testing and setup many remote access systems for testing and development.

       For testing, bug finding, suggestions, feature requests, MrMazda. He has over the years has helped shape inxi into what it is today, in particular but not limited to, the Graphics features.

       All the inxi package maintainers, distro support people, forum moderators, and in particular, sys admins with their particular issues, which almost always help make inxi better, and any others who
       contribute ideas, suggestions, and patches.

       Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel-based Free Desktop systems to test on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's turning out to be.

       And of course, a big thanks to locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core ideas, logic, and tricks originally used in inxi Gawk/Bash.
