NAME
       Transmission::AttributeRole - For Torrent and Client

DESCRIPTION
       This role is used by Transmission::Client and Transmission::Torrent.  It requires the consuming class to provide the method "read_all()".

ATTRIBUTES
   client
        $obj = $self->client;

       Returns a Transmission::Client object.

   lazy_write
        $bool = $self->lazy_write;
        $self->lazy_write($bool);

       Will prevent writeable attributes from sending a request to Transmission.  "write_all()" can then later be used to sync data.

   eager_read
        $bool = $self->eager_read;

       Setting this attribute in constructor forces "read_all()" to be called.  This will again populate all (or most) attributes right after the object is constructed (if Transmission answers the
       request).
