NAME
       SCRAM - Command-line Risk Analysis Multi-tool

SYNOPSIS
       scram [options] input-files...

DESCRIPTION
       SCRAM  is a probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) tool.  It can perform event tree analysis, static fault tree analysis, analysis with common cause failure models, probability calculations with impor‐
       tance analysis, and uncertainty analysis with Monte Carlo simulations.  This tool can handle non-coherent fault trees, containing NOT logic.

       SCRAM works with PRA models and constructs described in the Open-PSA Model Exchange Format.
