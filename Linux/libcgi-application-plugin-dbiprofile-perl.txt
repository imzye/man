NAME
       CGI::Application::Plugin::DBIProfile::Graph::GDGraphInline - Inlined GD Graph output for CAP:DBIProfile.

SYNOPSIS
           # in httpd.conf
           SetVar CAP_DBIPROFILE_GRAPHMODULE CGI::Application::Plugin::DBIProfile::Graph::GDGraphInline
           PerlSetVar CAP_DBIPROFILE_GRAPHMODULE CGI::Application::Plugin::DBIProfile::Graph::GDGraphInline

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a GD::Graph::bars inlined graphing option for CAP:DBIProfile. Please note, inlined images are NOT supported by MSIE as of version 7. Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and
       Konqueror are supported.

       The following settings control the output:

       $CGI::Application::Plugin::DBIProfile::Graph::GDGraphInline::FORMAT
           Output format. Defaults to "png". One of "png", "gif", or "jpeg".  Any GD supported output format can be easily added.

       $CGI::Application::Plugin::DBIProfile::Graph::GDGraphInline::WIDTH
           Width of output image. If you have problems with browser support for large inline images, reduce this.

       $CGI::Application::Plugin::DBIProfile::Graph::GDGraphInline::HEIGHT
           Height of output image. If you have problems with browser support for large inline images, reduce this.

BUGS
       Microsoft Internet Explorer, as of versions 6 and 7, lacks support for the "data: URI scheme", and thus lacks support for inline images.

       Inline images max size is limited to the browsers max URI length. For example, on Opera, this used to be 4kb. If you hit this limit, you can change the size of the output to try to compensate.

REQUIREMENTS
       GD::Graph
       MIME::Base64
