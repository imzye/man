NAME
       makeastheme, installastheme - manage themes in the Afterstep windows manager.

SYNOPSIS
       makeastheme [--theme <theme_name>] [--no_wharf] [--no_pager] [--no_winlist] [--no_background]

       installastheme [--theme <theme_name>] [--no_wharf] [--no_pager] [--no_winlist] [--no_background]

DESCRIPTION
       This bundle of two Perl scripts is used to implement themes in the AfterStep window manager for X (http://www.afterstep.org).

       At this time, these scripts are becoming solid beta quality.  I would still highly recommend you to backup your configuration files in the ~/.afterstep dir.  The easiest way to undo a theme is to sim‐
       ply restore your old files.

       This theme pack currently supports the following modules and options:
              Wharf:                  Pager:
                      BgColor                 Align
                      Pixmap                  Back
                      TextureColor            BalloonBack
                      TextureType             BalloonBorderColor
                                              BalloonBorderWidth
              WinList:                        BalloonFore
                      Font                    DesktopImage
                      Fore                    Font
                      Back                    Hilight
                      Justify                 Image
                      Pixmap (AS 1.5b6 pl2)   SmallFont

       Of course, the look file and desktop background is supported.  Also, any images specified in the look file or the module options above are also carried with the theme that is built.

       This theme pack expects to find the ~/.afterstep/desktop/themes directory.  Each theme should be a subdirectory from there.  When you download a theme, untar it in the  themes  dir.   Also,  when  you
       build a theme, if you want to bundle any unique icons for use in the database file, put them in the specific subir of the themes dir.

       Also,  the  theme  pack  will only look in ~/.afterstep for module configuration files.  That means when building a theme, it only takes modifications from that dir.  If the config files aren't there,
       makeastheme will ignore that module.  When installing a theme, installastheme will only edit files in ~/.afterstep.  If it doesn't find any modules there, it will skip that module.  At a minimum,  you
       should have 'wharf', 'pager', and 'winlist' files in the ~/.afterstep dir.

OPTIONS
       Both  installastheme  and  makeastheme  take  the  same command line, which can be in any order.  The directory from which the scripts are called is irrelevant.  All directory paths are coded into the
       scripts and double-checked at runtime.  After running installastheme, you will need to manually restart AfterStep for the changes to take place.

       When making the themes, you simply run makeastheme with the --theme <theme_name> argument and any of the other command line arguments you might want to use.  This script will grab all the config files
       necessary and all images specified within those config files.  It then creates the theme in your '~/.afterstep/desktop/themes'

       --theme
              this option is used to specify the theme to install.  With installastheme it is mandatory.  With makeastheme if unspecified, the $USER environmental variable will be used instead.

       --no_wharf, --no_pager, --no_winlist, --no_background
              Each  of  these  options  tell the scripts to skip processing for each of these modules.  For makeastheme it is similar to saying, "I don't have anything interesting in this module, don't store
              those options in the theme."   For installastheme it is similar to saying, "I really like my <module>, don't change any settings in there."
