NAME
       awayrc - configuration file for Away

DESCRIPTION
       An  away  configuration  file  consists  of a series of commands.  Each line of the file may contain only one command.  Command names are case-insensitive.  Commands and arguments are separated by
       spaces.

       The hash mark, or pound sign ("#"), is used as a comment character.  You can use it to annotate your configuration file.  All text after the comment character to the end of the line is ignored.

       Take note that if any mailboxes are configured in the rc file, they will be the only mailboxes checked, which means that you must add your inbox--the $MAIL environment variable will be ignored.

COMMANDS
       mail VALUE
              This command allows the user to disable or enable the checking of the user's mailboxes.  If mail checking is disabled, all mailbox and maildir commands are ignored.  VALUE can be 0, 1,  no,
              or yes.  The default value is 'yes'.

       mailbox FILENAME
              A  file  that should be checked for "new mail."  The filename will be appended to the previous maildir declaration.  An optional description of the mailbox may be supplied.  If the descrip‐
              tion contains a space, the entire description must be enclosed in braces, "{" and "}".

       maildir DIRECTORY
              A path where subsequent mailbox declarations will be located.  The only argument is the path itself.

       persist VALUE
              This command will set whether to do persistent mail checking.  VALUE can be 0, 1, no, or yes.  The default value is 'yes'.

       time SECONDS
              This command will set the number of seconds that away sleeps before performing its background tasks.  Presently, the only background task that away will perform is  the  checking  of  mail‐
              boxes.  The SECONDS value must be more than the minimum, which set at compile time.  The only argument is the number of seconds.  The default value is 300.

EXAMPLE
       # check mailboxes
       mail yes

       # check mail every 60 seconds
       time 60

       # do not do persistent checking
       persist no

       # inbox
       maildir /var/spool/mail
           mailbox johndoe                {your Inbox}

       # procmail folders
       maildir /home/johndoe/mail
           mailbox linux-security         {Linux Security}
           mailbox mutt-announce          {Mutt Announce}
