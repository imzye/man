NAME
       auedit - graphically record and edit audio files

SYNOPSIS
       auedit [-audio servername] [-toolkitoption ...] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       auedit provides an X-based window-oriented interface allowing the user to record and edit audio files.  The editing features available include:

       o   Cutting, copying, pasting, and mixing within a single auedit instance or between multiple auedit instances.

       o   Changing the amplitude of an interval.

       o   Reversing an interval.

       o   Fading in or out an interval.

AUEDIT AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET
       auedit uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set.  For more information, see the Athena Widget Set documentation.

SCREEN LAYOUT
       auedit starts out with a single window divided into several areas:

       o   A collection of drop-down menus and command buttons.

       o   A volume indicator and control slider.

       o   The  audio file represented as a wave form.  If the audio data contains multiple tracks, the tracks will be displayed in ascending order.  For stereo data, the convention is left track, then right
           track.

       o   A set of indicators displaying the interval start, duration, and end and the current position.  These indicators are in units of minutes, seconds, and hundredths of seconds.

       o   Buttons to play, stop, and pause the audio.

       o   Two menus indicating the current file and data formats.

       o   Two editable fields containing the current frequency and the audio file comment.

INTERVALS
       Many functions in auedit operate on a range of audio data called an interval.  The initial interval encompasses all of the audio data.  The interval is indicated within the wave  form  by  two  solid,
       vertical  lines.   The  left  marker  indicates the start of the interval.  The right marker indicates the end of the interval.  To select an interval of audio data, use the mouse to move the interval
       markers in the wave form.  Pressing a mouse button in the wave form will select the marker closest to the mouse position.  That marker may then be dragged to the desired location  in  the  wave  form.
       Note that the markers may not cross over each other.

PLAYING AN INTERVAL
       To  play an interval, click on the Play button (the one with the triangle on its side).  The audio data delimited by the start and end markers will be played.  A dashed vertical line will indicate the
       approximate position of the data currently being played.  To stop playing, click on the Stop button (the one containing a solid square).  Clicking on Pause (the button containing two vertical,  paral‐
       lel  lines) will pause the playing.  To resume, click on Pause again.  The volume slider controls the play volume.  The interval is played at the frequency specified by the Frequency field.  Note that
       while data is being played, most other functions are disabled.

THE FILE MENU
       New...              Initializes auedit with an empty file.  You will be prompted for the number of tracks for the new file.

       Load...             Loads a file.  You will be prompted for the file name.

       Save                Saves the current file.  A backup file will be created by appending a tilde (~) to the current file name.  The file format, data format, frequency and comment are used when  saving
                           the file.

       Save as...          Saves the current file under a new name.  You will be prompted for the file name.  The file format, data format, frequency and comment are used when saving the file.

       Save interval...    Saves the interval to a file.  You will be prompted for a file name.  The file format, data format, frequency and comment are used when saving the file.

       Revert              Discards all changes made since the last save and restores the data to its state following the last save.

       Exit                Exits auedit.  If there have been changes made to the current file that have not been saved, you will be asked if you wish to save them.

THE EDIT MENU
       The  cut, copy, and paste commands in the edit menu transfer data to and from a selection buffer.  This buffer is shared between all instances of auedit.  This means that you can cut or copy data from
       one instance of auedit and paste it into another instance.  The only restriction is that the audio data in both instances must have the same number of tracks.  When transferring data between instances
       of  differing  frequencies,  the  data will be converted to the frequency of the destination.  This can be used to change the frequency of the data in a single instance of auedit.  First, cut the data
       whose frequency you wish to change.  Then change the Frequency field to the desired frequency.  Finally, paste the data back in.  The frequency of the data will be converted to the frequency specified
       in the Frequency field.

       Cut                 Moves the interval to the selection buffer.

       Copy                Copies the interval to the selection buffer.

       Paste insert        Inserts the selection buffer at the point marked by the start marker.

       Paste replace       Replaces the data at the point marked by the start marker with the data from the selection buffer.

       Paste mix           Mixes the data at the point marked by the start marker with the data from the selection buffer.  The mixing function is an average.

       Undo                Undoes the last operation that modified the audio data.  This includes effects operations in addition to editing operations.  If the last operation was an Undo then the undo is un‐
                           done, restoring the data to the state prior to the first undo.

THE ZOOM MENU
       In                  Zoom in by a factor of two.

       Out                 Zoom out by a factor of two.

       Markers             Zoom in to the interval delimited by the start and end markers.

       Full                Zoom out to display all of the audio data.

THE EFFECTS MENU
       All operations under the effects menu apply to the current interval.

       Amplitude...        Scale the amplitude.  You will be prompted for the scale.  The scale may be non-integral.

       Max Amplitude       Scales the interval to its maximum amplitude without clipping.

       Reverse             Reverses the order of the data within the interval.

       Fade In             Linearly scales the interval using a scale ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

       Fade Out            Linearly scales the interval using a scale ranging from 1.0 to 0.0.

THE RECORD COMMAND
       Clicking on the Record button brings up the record dialog box.  The record dialog box consists of:

       o   A duration field.  This is the maximum duration of the recording in seconds.

       o   A frequency field.  This is the frequency of the recording in hertz.

       o   An input mode toggle button.  Clicking this button toggles between line mode and microphone mode.

       o   A gain slider.  This controls the input gain level.

       o   A record toggle button.  Clicking this button starts and stops the recording.

       o   A monitor toggle button.  Clicking this button toggles the record monitoring feature that lets you hear what you're recording.

       o   A dismiss command button.  Clicking this button stops any current recording and dismisses the record dialog box.
