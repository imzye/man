NAME
       Biblio::Citation::Compare - Perl extension for performing fuzzy comparisons between bibliographic citations

SYNOPSIS
         use Biblio::Citation::Compare 'sameWork','sameAuthors';

         sameWork(
           # first item
           {
               authors => ['Bourget, D','Lukasiak, Zbigniew'],
               title => "A paper with such and such a title",
               date => 2010
           },
           # second item
           {
               authors => ['Bourget, David J. R.','Lukasiak, Zbigniew'],
               title => "A paper with such nd such a tlitle",
               date => undef
           }
         );

         # true!

         sameAuthors(
           ['Dave Bourget','Z Lukasiak'],
           ['Bourget DJR','Zbigniew Z. Lukasiak']
         );

         # true!

DESCRIPTION
       This module exports two subroutines which perform fuzzy comparisons between citations (described using Perl hashes) and author lists. The subroutine attempt to determine if the citations and
       author lists refer to the same works and ordered lists of authors, respectively.

SUBROUTINES
   sameWork(hashref citation1, hashref citation2): boolean
       Takes as input two citations in a simple format illustrated in the synopsis. Returns true iff the two citations plausibly refer to the same work. A number of factors are taken into account to make
       the evaluation resistant to random variations. Among them: names are normalized and compared fuzzily using Text::Names, allowances are made for random typos, allowances are made for short and long
       versions of titles (esp with titles containing a colon), small but important variations as in "Paper title part 1" and "Paper title part 2" are taken into account. The algorithm has been used to
       merge multiple data sources on PhilPapers.org.

       Some advanced additional parameters are not explained here; they can only be explained by pointing to the source code. Their use should not normally be necessary.

   sameAuthors(arrayref list1, arrayref list2): boolean
       Returns true if the two lists are plausibly lists of the same authors. This is merely a convenient wrapper over Text::Names::samePerson.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

SEE ALSO
       See also Text::Names for name normalization.
