NAME
       geocpset - adds control points based on geometric position

SYNOPSIS
       geocpset [-o output.pto] input.pto

DESCRIPTION
       geocpset is a tool for panoramas which contains featureless images, e.g.  sky images. In this images a control point detector does not find control points. geocpset analyses the positions of the
       images in project files.  Then it adds control points to these images which are not connected by control points. The control points are set only be the geometric positions of the images and not by the
       image content. So geocpset should only used with projects which have assigned rough image positions.

USAGE
        geocpset -o output.pto input.pto

       If the --output/-o switch is missing then the suffix "_geo" is added to the filename.

       The indented workflow is

       #1 First create project file
           pto_gen -o project.pto *.jpg

       #2 Then assign rough positions to images
           pto_var --set y=i*20-40,p=0,r=0 -o project.pto project.pto

       #3 Now run a "normal" control point detector, e.g. only on overlapping images
           cpfind --prealigned -o project.pto project.pto

       #4 And finally connect all unconnected images
           geocpset -o project.pto project.pto

OPTIONS
       -o|--output output.pto
           Output a pto file with the given filename. If not given it will append "_geo" to the input filename.

       -e|--each-overlap
           By default geocpset adds only control points to unconnected images.  With this switch you can force to add a geometric control point to each overlap, which is not connect by control points or
           linked with image positions.

       --min-overlap=NUM
           By default geocpset takes only image pairs into account which overlap more than 10 %. If you have very narrow overlaps you can decrease this value to take also such small overlaps into account,
           e.g.  --min-overlap=1

       -h|--help
           Display help.
