NAME
       go-bindata — embed data in a Go program

SYNOPSIS
       go-bindata [options] input [input ...]

DESCRIPTION
       go-bindata  converts  any file into manageable Go source code. It is useful for embedding binary data into a Go program. The file data is optionally gzip compressed before being converted to a raw
       byte slice.

       input is an input directory containing the assets to incorporate. If suffixed by /... it will be searched recursively.

       The options are as follows:

       -debug  Do not embed the assets, but provide the embedding API. Contents will still be loaded from disk.

       -nocompress
               Assets will *not* be GZIP compressed when this flag is specified.

       -nomemcopy
               Use a .rodata hack to get rid of unnecessary memcopies. Refer to the documentation to see what implications this carries.

       -pkg package
               Package name to use in the generated code.

       -prefix prefix
               Optional path prefix to strip off asset names.

       -o      Name of the output file to be generated.

       -tags tags
               Optional set of build tags to include.
