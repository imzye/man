SMP_REP_EXP_ROUTE_TBL(8)                                                                           SMP_UTILS                                                                           SMP_REP_EXP_ROUTE_TBL(8)

NAME
       smp_rep_exp_route_tbl - invoke REPORT EXPANDER ROUTE TABLE LIST SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_rep_exp_route_tbl [--brief] [--help] [--hex] [--index=IN] [--interface=PARAMS] [--num=NUM] [--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a SAS Serial Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT EXPANDER ROUTE TABLE LIST function request to an SMP target and decodes or outputs the response. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and
       the SAS_ADDR.  Depending on the interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N  to  dif‐
       ferentiate between HBAs if there are multiple present.

       There are two expander route table types: phy-based and expander-based.  The expander-based route table was introduced in SAS-2 and supersedes the phy-based route tables. The REPORT EXPANDER ROUTE TA‐
       BLE LIST function is associated with an expander-based route table. There is no corresponding CONFIGURE function because a expander-based route table is self-configured.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -b, --brief
              reduce the decoded response output.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -i, --index=IN
              IN is the starting routed SAS address index. The default value is 0.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -n, --num=NUM
              maximum number of descriptors to fetch (default is 62). Note that maximum SMP frame size is 1028 bytes (including a trailing 4 byte CRC) so 62 descriptors is the maximum number that can fit  in
              one response.

       -p, --phy=ID
              starting phy identifier within bitmap. ID should be one of 0 (the default), or a multiple of 48. Note there is only one expnder route table per expander, not one per phy.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies  the  SAS  address  of the SMP target device. Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the target's SAS address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in
              decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP REPORT EXPANDER ROUTE TABLE LIST function was introduced in SAS-2 .
