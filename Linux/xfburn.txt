NAME
       xfburn - An easy to use burning application

SYNOPSIS

       xfburn --burn-image [IMAGE]

       xfburn [options] --data-composition | --audio-composition  [[FILE]...]

       xfburn --blank

       xfburn --transcoder list | basic | gst

DESCRIPTION
       xfburn is an easy to use burning application based on the libburnia libraries. So far it features burning to CD, and DVD, as well as blanking rewritable discs. Data and audio compositions can get
       created from scratch. Images in .iso format can be burned, or created.

INVOCATION
       xfburn can be called with --burn-image to immediately show the burn image dialog. Optionally the image file can be preselected by appending it to the command line.

       When the --data-composition or the --audio-composition options is specified, then xfburn's main window will open up with the selected composition type instead of the welcome tab. The filename(s)
       of the contents of the composition may follow the composition option.

   Options
       -?, --help
           Print brief help and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version information and exit.

       -i, --burn-image [IMAGE]
           Open the burn image dialog. Optionally the image is given as IMAGE.

       -b, --blank
           Open the blank disc dialog.

       -d, --data-composition [FILE(S)]
           Opens xfburn with a new data composition. Optionally FILE(S) to be added to the composition follow.

       -a, --audio-composition [MUSIC FILE(S)]
           Opens xfburn with a new audio composition. Optionally MUSIC FILE(S) to be added to the composition follow.

       -t, --transcoder [TRANSCODER]
           Selects the transcoder to use when creating audio compositions. Specify list to see all available options. Currently implemented are the gst and the basic transcoder.  gst uses gstreamer, and
           can allows the use of any gstreamer-supported media file.  basic only allows using audio files already in CD format: 48khz uncompressed WAV files.

       -m, --main
           When the --burn-image or the --blank option is selected, xfburn will quit after the dialog exists, unless the --main option is given. In that case the main xfburn window is shown after the
           dialog has been closed.

       --display=DISPLAY
           Use the specified X DISPLAY for the user interface.
