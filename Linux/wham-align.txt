NAME
       wham-build - Wisconsin's High-Throughput Alignment Method

DESCRIPTION
   Usage:
              wham-build  [options]*  -l  <int>  <ref_sequence>  <basepath> -l <int>         specify the length of short reads <ref_sequence>   comma-separated list of fiels with ref sequences <basepath>
              write wham data to files with this dir/basename

OPTIONS
       -v <int>
              report hits with <=v errors (0-5), ignore qualities

       -p <int>

       -m <int>
              discard subsequences appearing more than <int> times (default: 100).

       -b <int>
              specify the number of buckets

       --mask keep masked characters in the sequences (default: on)
