NAME
       cpmchattr - change file attributes on CP/M files

SYNOPSIS
       cpmchattr [-f format] [-u] image attrib file-pattern ...

DESCRIPTION
       Cpmchattr changes the file attributes for files on CP/M disks.

OPTIONS
       -f format
              Use the given CP/M disk format instead of the default format.

       -T libdsk-type
              libdsk driver type, e.g. tele for Teledisk images or raw for raw
              images (requires building cpmtools with support for libdsk).

       -u     Show all CP/M file names in upper case.

       attrib Set the file attributes as given.

FILE ATTRIBUTES
       The file attribute string can contain  the  characters  1,2,3,4,r,s,a,n
       and m.  The meanings of these are:

       1-4    The  CP/M  "user  attributes"  F1-F4.   CP/M does not assign any
              meaning to these attributes, though MP/M does.

       r      The file is read-only.  This is the same as using cpmchmod(1) to
              revoke write permissions.

       s      The  file  is  a system file.  This attribute can also be set by
              cpmchmod(1).

       a      The file has been backed up.

       n      Reset all attributes to zero.  So the string  "n1r"  resets  all
              attributes and then sets F1 and Read-Only.

       m      Attributes  after  an  m  are unset rather than set.  The string
              "12m34" sets atttributes F1 and F2, and unsets F3 and F4.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, exit code 0 is returned.

ERRORS
       Any errors are indicated by exit code 1.

ENVIRONMENT
