NAME
       fades - A system that automatically handles the virtualenvs in the cases normally found when writing scripts and simple programs, and even helps to administer big projects.

SYNOPSIS
       fades [-h][--help] [-V][--version] [-v][--verbose] [-q][--quiet] [-i][--ipython] [-d][--dependency] [-r][--requirement] [-x][--exec] [-p version][--python=version] [--rm=UUID] [--system-site-pack‐

       [-a][--autoimport] [--freeze] [-m][--module] [--avoid-pip-upgrade] [child_program [child_options]]

       fades can be used to execute directly your script, or put it with a #! at your script's beginning.

DESCRIPTION
       fades will automagically create a new virtualenv (or reuse a previous created one), installing the necessary dependencies, and execute your script inside that virtualenv, with the only requirement
       of executing the script with fades and also marking the required dependencies.

       The first non-option parameter (if any) would be then the child program to execute, and any other parameters after that are passed as is to that child script.

       fades can also be executed without passing a child script to execute: in this mode it will open a Python interactive interpreter inside the  created/reused  virtualenv  (taking  dependencies  from
       --dependency or --requirement options). If --autoimport is given, it will automatically import all the installed dependencies.

       If the child_program parameter is really an URL, the script will be automatically downloaded from there (supporting also the most common pastebins URLs: pastebin.com, linkode.org, gist, etc.).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help about all the parameters and options, and quit.

       -V, --version
              Show the program version and info about the system, and quit.

       -v, --verbose
              Send all internal debugging lines to stderr, which may be very useful if any problem arises.

       -q, --quiet
              Don't show anything (unless it has a real problem), so the original script stderr is not polluted at all.

       -i, --ipython
              Runs IPython shell instead of python ones.

       -d, --dependency
              Specify  dependencies  through  command  line. This option can be specified multiple times (once per dependency), and each time the format is repository::dependency. The dependency may have
              versions specifications, and the repository is optional (it will infer it). Examples:

                  requests
                  pypi::requests > 2.3
                  requests<=3
                  git+https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git#egg=requests
                  vcs::git+https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git#egg=requests

              See more examples below for real command line usage explanations.

       -r, --requirement
              Read the dependencies from a file. Format in each line is the same than dependencies specified with --dependency. This option can be specified multiple times.

       -p version, --python=version
              Select which Python version to be used; the argument can be just the number (2.7), the whole name (python2.7) or the whole path (/usr/bin/python2.7).  Of course, the  corresponding  version
              of Python needs to be installed in your system.

              The  dependencies  can be indicated in multiple places (in the Python source file, with a comment besides the import, in a requirementsfile, and/or through command line. In case of multiple
              definitions of the same dependency, command line overrides everything else, and requirements file overrides what is specified in the source code.

       -x, --exec
              Execute the child_program in the context of the virtualenv. The child_program, which in this case becomes a mandatory parameter, can be just the executable name (relative to the venv's  bin
              directory) or an absolute path.

       --rm UUID
              Remove a virtualenv by UUID.  See --get-venv-dir option to easily find out the UUID.

       --system-site-packages
              Give the virtual environment access to thesystem site-packages dir

       --virtualenv-options=VIRTUALENV_OPTION
              Extra options to be supplied to virtualenv. (this option can be used multiple times)

       --pip-options=PIP_OPTION
              Extra options to be supplied to pip. (this option can be used multiple times)

       --python-options=PYTHON_OPTION
              Extra options to be supplied to python. (this option can be used multiple times)

       --check-updates
              Will  check for updates in PyPI to verify if there are new versions for the requested dependencies. If a new version is available for a dependency, it will use it (if the dependency was re‐
              quested without version) or just inform which new version is available (if the dependency was requested with a specific version).

       --clean-unused-venvs=MAX_DAYS_TO_KEEP
              Will remove all virtualenvs that haven't been used for more than MAX_DAYS_TO_KEEP days.

       --get-venv-dir
              Show the virtualenv base directory (which includes the virtualenv UUID) and quit.

       --no-precheck-availability
              Don't check if the packages exists in PyPI before actually try to install them.

       -a, --autoimport
              Automatically import the dependencies when in interactive interpreter mode (ignored otherwise).

       --freeze FILEPATH
              Will operate exactly as without the command, but also it will dump the revisions of installed dependencies to the given filepath.

       -m, --module
              Run library module as a script (same behaviour than Python's -m parameter).

       --avoid-pip-upgrade
              Disable the automatic pip upgrade that happens after the virtualenv is created and before the dependencies begin to be installed.

EXAMPLES
       fades foo.py --bar

              Executes foo.py under fades, passing the --bar parameter to the child program, in a virtualenv with the dependencies indicated in the source code.

       fades -v foo.py

              Executes foo.py under fades, showing all the fades messages (verbose mode).

       fades -d dependency1 -d dependency2>3.2 foo.py --bar

              Executes foo.py under fades (passing the --bar parameter to it), in a virtualenv with the dependencies indicated in the source code and also dependency1 and dependency2 (any version > 3.2).

       fades -d dependency1

              Executes the Python interactive interpreter in a virtualenv with dependency1 installed.

       fades -r requirements.txt

              Executes the Python interactive interpreter in a virtualenv after installing there all dependencies taken from the requirements.txt file.

       fades -r requirements.txt -r requirements_devel.txt

              Executes the Python interactive interpreter in a virtualenv after installing there all dependencies taken from files requirements.txt and requirements_devel.txt.

USING CONFIGURATION FILES
       You can also configure fades using .ini config files. fades will search config files in /etc/fades/fades.ini, the path indicated by xdg for your system (for example  ~/config/fades/fades.ini)  and
       .fades.ini.  So you can have different settings at system, user and project level.

       The  config  files  are in .ini format. (configparser) and fades will search for a [fades] section.  You have to use the same configurations that in the CLI. The only difference is with the config
       options with a dash, it has to be replaced with a underscore.

       Check http://fades.readthedocs.org/en/latest/readme.html#setting-options-using-config-files for full examples.
