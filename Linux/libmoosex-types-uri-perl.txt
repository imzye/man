NAME
       MooseX::Types::URI - URI related types and coercions for Moose

VERSION
       version 0.10

SYNOPSIS
               use MooseX::Types::URI qw(Uri FileUri DataUri);

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides Moose types for fun with URIs.

TYPES
       The types are with "ucfirst" naming convention so that they don't mask the URI class.

   "Uri"
       Either URI or URI::WithBase

       Coerces from "Str" via "new" in URI.

       Coerces from Path::Class::File and Path::Class::Dir via "new" in URI::file (but only if MooseX::Types::Path::Class is installed)

       Coerces from "ScalarRef" via "new" in URI::data.

       Coerces from "HashRef" using URI::FromHash.

   "DataUri"
       A URI whose scheme is "data".

       Coerces from "Str" and "ScalarRef" via "new" in URI::data.

   "FileUri"
       A URI::file class type.

       Has coercions from "Str" (and optionally Path::Class::File and Path::Class::Dir) via "new" in URI::file

       It has slightly DWIMier types than the URI classes have due to implementation details, so the types should be more forgiving when ducktyping will work anyway (e.g. URI::WithBase does not inherit
       URI).

TODO
       Think about Path::Resource integration of some sort
