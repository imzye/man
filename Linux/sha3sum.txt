SHA3SUM(1)                                                                            User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                            SHA3SUM(1)

NAME
       sha3sum - Print or Check SHA-3 Checksums

SYNOPSIS
        Usage: sha3sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
        Print or check SHA-3 checksums.
        With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

          -a, --algorithm   224 (default), 256, 384, 512, 128000, 256000
          -b, --binary      read in binary mode
          -c, --check       read SHA-3 sums from the FILEs and check them
              --tag         create a BSD-style checksum
          -t, --text        read in text mode (default)
          -U, --UNIVERSAL   read in Universal Newlines mode
                                produces same digest on Windows/Unix/Mac
          -0, --01          read in BITS mode
                                ASCII '0' interpreted as 0-bit,
                                ASCII '1' interpreted as 1-bit,
                                all other characters ignored

        The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
              --ignore-missing  don't fail or report status for missing files
          -q, --quiet           don't print OK for each successfully verified file
          -s, --status          don't output anything, status code shows success
              --strict          exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
          -w, --warn            warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

          -h, --help        display this help and exit
          -v, --version     output version information and exit

        The sums are computed as described in the FIPS 202 SHA-3 submission.
        When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.
        The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a character
        indicating type (`*' for binary, ` ' for text, `U' for UNIVERSAL,
        `^' for BITS), and name for each FILE.  The line starts with a `\'
        character if the FILE name contains either newlines or backslashes,
        which are then replaced by the two-character sequences `\n' and
        `\\' respectively.

DESCRIPTION
       Running sha3sum is often the quickest way to compute SHA-3 message digests.  The user simply feeds data to the script through files or standard input, and then collects the results from standard
       output.

       The following command shows how to compute digests for typical inputs such as the NIST test vector "abc":

               perl -e "print qq(abc)" | sha3sum

       Or, if you want to use SHA3-256 instead of the default SHA3-224, simply say:

               perl -e "print qq(abc)" | sha3sum -a 256

       Unlike many other digest computation programs, sha3sum implements the full SHA-3 standard by allowing partial-byte inputs, which can be recognized through the BITS option (-0).  The following example
       computes the SHA3-384 digest of the 7-bit message 0001100:

               perl -e "print qq(0001100)" | sha3sum -0 -a 384
