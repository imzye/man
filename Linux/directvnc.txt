NAME
       directvnc-xmapconv - produce directvnc's xmodmap keyboard layout files

SYNOPSIS
       directvnc-xmodmap

DESCRIPTION
       directvnc-xmapconv reads an xmodmap syntax file from standard input, and writes the directvnc compatible syntax file to standard output. Inside, the script runs its standard input through the
       C  preprocessor  including  the  keysymdef.h file and prepending each keysym identifier with XK_. The directvnc keyboard layout file mentioned earlier was produced exactly this way out of the
       xmodmap file for Cyrillic input.
