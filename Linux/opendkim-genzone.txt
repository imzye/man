NAME
       opendkim-genzone - DKIM public key zone file generation tool

SYNOPSIS
       opendkim-genzone  [-C  address]  [-d  domain]  [-D]  [-E secs] [-F] [-N
       ns[,...]]  [-o file] [-r secs] [-R secs] [-s] [-S] [-t secs] [-T  secs]
       [-u] [-v] [-x conffile] [dataset]

DESCRIPTION
       opendkim-genzone  generates  a  file  suitable for use with named(8) to
       publish a set of public keys.

       The dataset parameter should specify a set of data as described in  the
       opendkim(8)  man page.  It can currently refer to flat files, Sleepycat
       databases, comma-separated lists, LDAP directories  or  SQL  databases.
       The  dataset may be omitted if a configuration file (via the -x command
       line flag) is specified referring to a configuration file that  sets  a
       KeyTable parameter, in which case that value will be used.

       The database contents should be formatted as described for the KeyTable
       parameter, described in the opendkim.conf(5) man page.

OPTIONS
       -C contact
              Uses contact as the contact information to be used when  an  SOA
              record  is  generated  (see  -S  below).   If not specified, the
              userid of the executing user and  the  local  hostname  will  be
              used;  if  the  executing user can't be determined, "hostmaster"
              will be used.

       -d domain
              Restricts output to those records for which the domain field  is
              the specified domain.

       -D     Adds a "._domainkey" suffix to selector names in the zone file.

       -E secs
              When  generating  an  SOA record (see -S below), use secs as the
              default record expiration time.  The default is 604800.

       -F     Adds a "._domainkey" suffix and the domainname to selector names
              in the zone file.

       -N nslist
              Specifies  a  comma-separated list of nameservers, which will be
              output in NS records before the TXT records.   The  first  name‐
              server  in  this list will also be used in the SOA record (if -S
              is also specified) as the authority hostname.

       -o file
              Sends output to the named file rather than standard output.

       -r secs
              When generating an SOA record (see -S below), use  secs  as  the
              zone refresh time.  The default is 10800.

       -R secs
              When  generating  an  SOA record (see -S below), use secs as the
              zone retry time.  The default is 1800.

       -s     Extends the logic of "-d" to include subdomains.

       -S     Asks for an SOA record to be generated at the top of the output.
              The  content  of this output can be controlled using the -E, -r,
              -R, -T options.  The serial number will be  generated  based  on
              the current time of day.

       -t ttl Puts  a  TTL  (time-to-live) value of ttl on all records output.
              The units are in seconds.

       -T secs
              When generating an SOA record (see -S below), use  secs  as  the
              default record TTL time.  The default is 86400.

       -u     Produce output suitable for use as input to nsupdate(8).

       -v     Increases  the verbosity of debugging output written to standard
              error.

       -x conffile
              Names an opendkim.conf(5) file  to  be  read  for  LDAP-specific
              parameters  when  an  LDAP dataset is given on the command line.
              Not  required  for  other  dataset  types.    The   default   is
              /etc/opendkim.conf.
