NAME
       LAM - introduction to Local Area Multicomputer (LAM)

DESCRIPTION
       LAM is an MPI programming environment and development system for a message-passing parallel machine constituted with heterogeneous UNIX computers on a network.  With LAM, a dedicated cluster or an ex‐
       isting network computing infrastructure can act as one parallel computer solving one compute-intensive problem.  LAM emphasizes productivity in the application development cycle with extensive control
       and monitoring functionality.  The user can easily debug the common errors in parallel programming and is well equipped to diagnose more difficult problems.

       LAM features a full implementation of the MPI communication standard, with the exception that the MPI_CANCEL function will not properly cancel messages that have been sent.

   User Information
       Users are strongly encouraged to read the LAM/MPI User's Guide that is included with the LAM/MPI distribution, and is provided on the main LAM/MPI web site (http://www.lam-mpi.org/).

   Up-to-Date Information
       The LAM home page can be found on the World Wide Web at: http://www.lam-mpi.org/.  It should be consulted for the most current information about LAM, as well as updates, patches, etc.
