DESCRIPTION
       vadm is a general purpose command to perform all sorts of actions upon parts of an AtFS object repository. It can be used to lock or unlock an AtFS object for modification, to delete a particular  ob‐
       ject  instance, to associate symbolic (alias) names with version objects, to promote or unpromote certain version objects from one status to another, to modify an objects access permissions, to set or
       modify a descriptive entry of particular version objects, to set or modify an eventual change intention, and to set or unset various object attributes such as  the  author  or  any  user  defined  at‐
       tributes.

       vattr and vrm are short forms for vadm -attr and vadm -delete. See the descriptions of the -attr and the -delete options for details.

       sbmt, publ, accs, and frze are alternate program names for vadm that represent status-change operations for version objects. See the description of option -promote for details.

       The  typical command invocation is supplemented by one or more command options, version binding options  defining the versions to be acted upon, an action specifier indicating the sort of action to be
       performed, and a set of object names defining the initial subset of the object base that's going to be manipulated.

       Object names may be given in bound version notation, i.e. a notation that identifies a particular version of an object (e.g.  mkattr.c[2.4]). It is also possible to use a previously assigned  symbolic
       name rather than a numerical version identification (e.g. mkattr.c[tools-V4R3]). Make sure to escape the bracket-symbols when using csh(1) or tcsh(1) because they have meaning to these shells.

OPTIONS
       For version selection, any version binding option, as described on the vbind(1) manual page, may be given, or a version bind directive may be given in brackets added to the file name.

       -?, -help
              print brief instructions about using vadm

       -cache apply the requested operation to objects residing in the derived object cache. The set of actions that may be performed on binary pool objects is limited.

       -f, -force
              don't ask for confirmation when deleting versions from a history.

       -nomail
              Suppress the notification mail to the user who holds the lock on a history when breaking this lock (-unlock option).

       -q, -quiet
              suppress any prompts, informal messages and user dialogues. Default values are assumed for everything that might otherwise be inquired interactively. This option is useful for batch operation.

       -stdin forces  vadm  to  read  a descriptive text, note or intent from standard input if action -set is selected. The note is used for all specified AtFS objects. Otherwise your favorite editor (taken
              from the EDITOR environment variable) is invoked.

       -version
              print version information about the vadm program itself. No action will be performed on the database.

       vadm will perform all of its operations upon a specified set of AtFS version objects. In case no such set is specified, the operation will be applied to the most recently saved versions of  the  named
       object(s).

ACTIONS
       The kind of action to be performed upon a specified set of AtFS objects is indicated by a keyword. The following actions are defined:

       -alias version alias name
              assigns  the  version alias name to the specified version. The name works as an alias for the version number, so it must be different from any other symbolic name assigned to any version object
              in a particular object history. It is, however, possible to assign the same symbolic name to version objects in different object histories. An object history is usually denoted by a name, simi‐
              larly to a files name.
              The  use of alias names is a simple but effective way to associate component members of a system configuration. Typical symbolic names will look something like Mysystem_Release_4.22, indicating
              that version objects with this name are part of release 4.22 of the system in question.

       -attr attrname
              Return rthe value of the named attribute. This may be a standard attribute or a user defined attribute. Check the list below for a complete list of standard attribute names.

       -attr attrname[+|-]=[@|^|!|*]value
              defines a user defined attribute with name attrname and sets it to the value value for all specified version objects.  This option may also be used to set the  value  of  certain  standard  at‐
              tributes  (see list below).  If attrname is followed by a single equal-symbol, the respective value of the object is set (or reset) to the specified value. Any previous values will be overwrit‐
              ten. If attrname is immediately followed by the symbols ``plus-equal'' (+=), the specified attribute value will be appended to the current value of the referenced attribute. Accordingly,  ``mi‐
              nus-equal'' (-=) should remove the specified value from the given attribute. In the current implementation, removal of single values is not supported.
              There are four basic kinds of user defined attribute values: genuine values, reference values, execution values, and pointer values. The kind of an attribute value is determined when it is set.
              If the first character of value is an at character (@), the rest of value is taken to be the name of a file the contents of which will be taken as the value of the attribute.  This substitution
              takes  place immediately, i.e. the attribute has a genuine value.  If the filename is specified as ``-'', the attributes value will be read from standard input. If the first character is a cir‐
              cumflex character (^), the rest of value is interpreted as the name of a file whose contents will be substituted for the attribute when it is cited. If the first character of value is an excla‐
              mation  mark  character (!), the rest of value is interpreted as the name of a program whose standard output will be substituted for the attribute when it is cited. Execution values can be used
              to generate highly dynamic attributes or even a primitive form of event triggers. An asterisk (*) as first character of value indicates a pointer to another version. In this case, the remainder
              of value must be a valid bound filename.
              User defined attributes may be of arbitrary length. Any sequence of ASCII characters - with the exception of \01 (control-A) - is allowed to make up an attribute value.  If attrname was already
              set to some value, the previous value will be replaced by the newly specified one.

       -attr @attrfile
              With a @filename argument, the -attr option reads names and values of user defined attributes from the named file Each entry (each line) in the attribute file must have a  format  as  described
              above. The files last character must be a newline character.

       -chaut user
              sets  user  the author of a particular revision. Normally, the author of a revision is considered the user who saved that revision. However, as certain permissions are tied to the author attri‐
              bute of a revision, circumstances may occur that make it necessary to change the author.

       -chmod protection
              changes the access permission code of the specified version objects to the supplied three-octal-digit protection. Currently, the access permissions are centered around UNIX' notions  of  owner,
              group,  and world access as well as the access categories read, write, and execute. These permissions are inherited upon save from the permissions of the file representing the busy object of an
              AtFS history. See chmod(2) for details.

       -chown user
              sets user the owner of an entire object history. This option is not supported on BSD type systems, as only the superuser may change the owner of a file.

       -delattr attrname
              deletes the user defined attribute attrname from the set of attributes associated with the specified version objects.

       -d, -delete
              removes the specified version objects from the object base, provided the objects' status is saved. Any other status indicates that some kind of project interaction concerning this object  might
              be in progress. If the programmer wants to delete such a version object anyway, he has to -unpromote the respective objects status to saved before it can actually be deleted.

       -l, -lock [version binding]
              tries to reserve the privilege to add a new version to an objects history, thus preventing multiple programmers working upon the same object base from interfering with each other by saving con‐
              current updates.  If the locking operation succeeds, write permission is given for the corresponding files in the development directory. When setting a new lock on an object  history,  the  re‐
              questing user is prompted for an optional description of the planned changes.
              In  order to lock an object history successfully, the history must not be locked by any other programmer, and the programmer requesting the lock must have write permission on the AtFS subdirec‐
              tory hosting the object base.
              As ShapeTools allows locking of single generations within a history, -lock optionally expects an argument denoting a generation.  Default is the most recent generation. The argument  may  be  a
              generation number (e.g. 2), a version number (e.g. 1.4), or a version alias (e.g. release-4.7).

       -newgen
              opens  a  new  generation  by duplicating the identified version. The version must be locked. Any existing busy versions are ignored by this action. If no version binding is specified, the last
              saved version is taken by default.

       -promote
              assigns the next-better value to the specified objects' state attribute.  There are six states that an object instance can be in: busy, saved, proposed, published, accessed, and frozen. Version
              states are intended to relate to visibility and operational restrictions (see for example -delete) within a complex project environment.
              Due  to the current lack of project library support, the version states have very little actual functionality. Implemented to its full extent, certain state transitions may only be triggered by
              appropriately authorized users. The transitions busy→saved and saved→proposed will be triggered by regular programmers, whereas the remaining transitions have to be initiated by the project ad‐
              ministrator.
              Each  transition  corresponds  to  a  specific  action or interaction within a general software project communication scheme. As these actions/interactions will be functionally supported by the
              project support system currently under development, the explicit manipulation of object states will no longer be necessary (except, perhaps for manual adjusting of ill situations).
              The following actions relate to the state transitions:
              save (busy→saved, performed by programmer)
              sbmt (saved→proposed, performed by programmer)
              accpt (proposed→published, performed by project administrator)
              accs (published→accessed, performed by any project member)
              release (accessed→frozen, performed by project administrator)
              A different interface to the status control facilities of vadm is provided by the program aliases sbmt, publ, accs, and frze. These commands correspond to conceptual project  interactions  like
              submit, publish, access, and freeze.
              Submit  is  the operation performed by a team programmer when a work result (such as a completed change request) is proposed for inclusion into the official system configuration. The associated
              status is proposed.
              Publish is an operation that is typically performed by members of the quality assurance group, when a work result, as proposed by a team programmer is approved and thus included into  the  cur‐
              rent official system configuration. The associated status is published.
              Access  is  an operation that is performed during configuration identification, when component versions of a (sub-)product are incorporated into some other (partial) (sub-)system configuration.
              The associated status is accessed.
              Freeze is an operation that is performed during configuration identification, when a global release of the entire system configuration is established. The associated status is frozen

       -set [description | note | intent]
              allows to set or modify the descriptive text for an AtFS history object (i.e. an entire version history), the note usually describing the differences of a version object  with  respect  to  its
              preceding  version,  or  an entry describing a planned change.  (Re-) setting the change intention may be appropriate, if a previously set change intent has been consumed by a sbmt command that
              retained the lock on an object history.
              vadm will check the callers environment for the EDITOR variable and invoke the program identified therein. If the EDITOR variable is not set, the systems default editor will be activated.   The
              user may write an arbitrary length descriptive or note entry using the editor. When the user leaves the editor, the resulting text is stored with the object history or the specified version ob‐
              jects.

       -setc comment_string
              sets commentstring as the (sequence of) character(s) that opens a comment line within the formalism of the document.  This comment_string will be prepended to the lines of the log history  when
              the $__log$ attribute is expanded within the text of a revision.

       -unlock
              gives  up  the  previously  reserved privilege to update the history of an AtFS object and clears the write-permission for the corresponding files. -unlock may be used by the owner of an object
              history to break a lock previously set by any programmer. This option is useful to resolve deadlock situations resulting from careless use of -lock, or exceptional  circumstances  that  require
              immediate  updating of an object history, even if the lock holder is not present.  The previous owner of a broken lock is notified by a mail message. Under some circumstances mail-notifications
              upon broken locks can be annoying (e.g. when a development tree has been moved to another system or domain with locked busy-versions; in this case the owner must break the locks  to  check  the
              busy-versions back into the version archives at the new site). To avoid this effect, the switch -nomail can be used to suppress mail notification.
              An eventually expressed change intention (see -lock) will be cleared.
              Technically, the owner of an objects history is the owner of the AtFS subdirectory hosting the object base.

       -unpromote
              reverses  a  state  transition  carried out through a prior -promote.  The same remarks about functional embedding (and thus hiding the state transitions) of state transitions made for -promote
              hold for -unpromote.
