       wmnet  [-h,--help]  [-v,--version]  [-T,--txrule=NUM]  [-R,--rxrule=NUM]  [-l,--logscale]  [-t,--txcolor=COLOR]  [-r,--rxcolor=COLOR] [-d DELAY] [-x,--maxrate=BYTES] [-F,--labelfg=COLOR] [-B,--la‐

DESCRIPTION
       wmnet polls network statistics and does a few things with the data it gets.  It has small blinking lights for the rx and tx of IP packets, a digital speedometer of your networks current speed  and
       a bar graph like xload plotting your throughput. It has a tx speed graph from bottom-up and rx speed graph from the top-down.  The speedometer keeps track of the current speed per second and shows
       it in a color corresponding to which of rx or tx that has the highest speed at the moment.  Also, the graph is drawn in a way that the highest speed is drawn on top of the other while the other is
       in the background.

   OPTIONS
       -h,--help
              displays a brief help message

       -v,--version
              displays version information

       -T,--txrule=NUM or NAME
              in the case of the ipfwadm driver, this is the accounting rule number to monitor for tx.  For the ipchains driver, this is the chain name to watch.

       -R,--rxrule=NUM or NAME
              in the case of the ipfwadm driver, this is the accounting rule number to monitor for rx.  For the ipchains, this is the chain name to watch.

       -t,--txcolor=COLOR
              specifies the tx color

       -r,--rxcolor=COLOR
              specifies the rx color

       -x,--maxrate=BYTES
              maximum  transfer  rate  for graph scale. Defaults to 6000, which should be in the right area for modem connections.  The key is to experiment with this setting and the --logscale option to
              get the kind of graph that fits your connection type.  A general rule of thumb is to set this to 4 to 5 times greater than your maximum throughput.  The author finds  using  --logscale  and
              --maxrate=10000000 to work nicely for the entire range of his dorms ethernet based connection to the internet.

       -l,--logscale
              sets logarithmic scale, which is good for fast connections.  This will allow, for example, the graph still being informative at extremely low speeds (telnet), and extremely fast speeds (lo‐
              cal FTP) simultaneously without the scale constantly being blank or solid at those respective extremes.

       -L,--label=LABEL
              prints a given text label on the bottom of the window

       -F,--labelfg=COLOR
              specifies the color for the text of the label

       -B,--labelbg=COLOR
              specifies the color for the background of the label text

       --withdrawn

       --normalstate
              sets  the  initial state of wmnet.  WMnet tries to automatically determine which state to start up in by starting up in withdrawn state if a WindowMaker defined atom is present, and in nor‐
              malstate otherwise.  This behavior is overridden by specifying one of these options.

       -e,--execute=COMMAND
              executes COMMAND on a single click from button 1 (left mouse button).

       -u,--unpromisc=DEVICE

       -p,--promisc=DEVICE
              put DEVICE in promiscuous mode to start applying accounting rules to all network packets on your network segment.  You either need to be root or have the wmnet binary suid root to use  this
              feature.  This option may be given more than once on the command line to specify more than one device.

       -d DELAY
              delay time for polling /proc/net/ip_account (in microseconds). Defaults to 25000, that is 0.025 seconds, or 40 Hz

       -D,--driver=DRIVER
              use DRIVER  to get the stats we monitor.  Compiled in drivers can be listed with the -h switch.

       -W,--device=DEVICE
              watch statistics for DEVICE .  This option is only used for certain stat drivers, namely: kmem, devstats, and pppstats.  The ipchains and ipfwadm stat drivers do not use this parameter.

       -X,--display=ISPLAY
              X display to use.

STAT DRIVERS
       wmnet uses different stat drivers to get the stats it needs to monitor your network.  Exactly what drivers are available is determined at compile time.  The driver wmnet ultimately uses at runtime
       is  dependent  on  your  system.   There  are  4  drivers specific to Linux and 1 to *BSD.  The driver used can be overridden by the --driver option.  The available drivers are pppstats, devstats,
       ipfwadm, ipchains and kmem.

       pppstats
              this driver works on Linux 2.0 or Linux 2.1 for ONLY ppp type devices.  Specify the --device option for the interface to monitor.  By default it uses interface ppp0.  Please note,  that  if
              the ppp device is not available or active, wmnet will continue to try in the hopes that it is only temporarily offline.

       devstats
              use  this  driver on Linux 2.1 kernels for any interface.  Pass the --device option for the device you want monitored, otherwise, the default is eth0.  This will be available for ONLY Linux
              2.1 kernels and will always be there on those kernels.

       ipfwadm
              use this driver on Linux 2.0 kernels compiled with IP accounting.  It won't work on Linux 2.1.  You'll also need to specify the --txrule and --rxrule options.  By default,  wmnet  uses  the
              first two rules it finds.

       ipchains
              this  driver  will only work in Linux 2.1 kernels with IP chains compiled in.  You'll want to also specify the --txrule and --rxrule options and specify the chain names.  By default it uses
              the chains "acctin" and "acctout" There must be at least one rule on the named ipchain, if there is more than one rule in the specified chain, it uses the first.  The chain must not immedi‐
              ately return to the parent chain, it has to pass through a rule first.  Otherwise, the kernel will not collect the stats we need.

       kmem   this driver is available on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems and must be passed a device through the --device option.  By default, it uses ec0 but will accept any valid device name.
