NAME
       udppm - UDP port mapper

SYNOPSIS
       pop3p [-ds] [-l[[@]logfile]] [-iinternal_ip] [-eexternal_ip] local_port remote_host remote_port

DESCRIPTION
       udppm forwards datagrams from local to remote UDP port

OPTIONS
       -I     Inetd mode. Standalone service only.

       -d     Daemonise. Detach service from console and run in the background.

       -t     Be silenT. Do not log start/stop/accept error records.

       -e     External address. IP address of interface proxy should initiate datagrams from.  By default system will deside which address to use in accordance with routing table.

       -i     Internal address. IP address proxy accepts datagrams to.  By default connection to any interface is accepted. It´s usually unsafe.

       -l     Log. By default logging is to stdout. If logfile is specified logging is to file. Under Unix, if ´@´ preceeds logfile, syslog is used for logging.

       -s     Single packet. By default only one client can use udppm service, but if -s is specified only one packet will be forwarded between client and server.  It allows to share service between multiple
              clients for single packet services (for example name lookups).

       -S     Increase or decrease stack size. You may want to try something like -S8192 if you experience 3proxy crashes.

ARGUMENTS
       local_port
              - port udppm accepts datagrams

       remote_host
              - IP address of the host datagrams are forwarded to

       remote_port
              - remote port datagrams are forwarded to

CLIENTS
       Any UDP based application can be used as a client. Use internal_ip and local_port as a destination in client application. All datagrams are forwarded to remote_host:remote_port
