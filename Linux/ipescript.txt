NAME
       ipescript - Run an Ipe script (written in Lua)

SYNOPSIS
       ipescript script { arguments }

DESCRIPTION
       ipescript runs an Ipe script written in Lua.  The Ipe bindings are automatically available in the script.  Ipescript looks for the script in any of the script directories.

       The script argument should not contain the .lua extension.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       ipescript respects the following environment variables:

       IPELATEXDIR
              the directory where ipetoipe runs Pdflatex.

       IPELATEXPATH
              the directory containing pdflatex and xelatex.  If not set, they are searched for on the path.

       IPESCRIPTS a list of directories where Ipescript will look for
              scripts.   When  this variable is not set, Ipe searches first the current directory, then ~/.ipe/scripts, and finally the system-wide Ipe script directory.  When this variable is set, it should
              contain a list of directories, separated by semicolons.  A single underscore is replaced by the system-wide Ipe script directory.

       IPEDEBUG
              set this to 1 for debugging output from ipescript.
