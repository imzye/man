NAME
       LuserNET - News Reader for GNUstep

SYNOPSIS
       LuserNET

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the LuserNET command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have
       a manual page.

       LuserNET is an NNTP-based news reader for GNUstep. It features good MIME conformance and  handling,  an  ability  to  handle  multiple  servers,  intelligent
       scrolling, complete asynchronicity, background read-ahead, and coloring of messages based on quoting depth.

SEE ALSO
       GNUstep(7).
