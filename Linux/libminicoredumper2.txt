NAME
       libminicoredumper - a library for registering application data for dumping with the minicoredumper(1)

DESCRIPTION
       libminicoredumper provides an interface for registering binary and text data for dumping with the minicoredumper(1).  The data can be dumped into a core(5) file (in case this application crashes),
       or into separate files for simple access.

       If any data is registered for dumping, an anonymous UNIX domain socket is used to send a message to minicoredumper_regd(1), thus registering this application with the minicoredumper(1).  When some
       other  application crashes, the minicoredumper(1) will dump the registered data from this application as well. This feature allows variable information from multiple applications to be dumped soon
       after any application crashes. To minimize the time between an application crash and the dumping of other registered applications, the minicoredumper(1) uses PTRACE_SEIZE and  PTRACE_INTERRUPT  to
       temporarily pause registered applications until all dumping is complete.
