NAME
       RTSP::Server - Lightweight RTSP/RTP server. Like icecast, for audio/video streams.

SYNOPSIS
         use AnyEvent;
         use RTSP::Server;

         # defaults:
         my $srv = new RTSP::Server(
             log_level             => 2,   # 0 = no output, 5 = most verbose
             max_clients           => 100,
             client_listen_port    => 554,
             source_listen_port    => 5545,
             rtp_start_port        => 20000,
             client_listen_address => '0.0.0.0',
             source_listen_address => '0.0.0.0',
         );

         # listen and accept incoming connections asynchronously
         # (returns immediately)
         $srv->listen;

         # main loop
         my $cv = AnyEvent->condvar;
         # ...
         $cv->recv;

         undef $srv;  # when the server goes out of scope, all sockets will
                      # be cleaned up

DESCRIPTION
       This server is designed to enable to rebroadcasting of RTP media streams to clients, controlled by RTSP. Please see README for more information.

USAGE
       After starting the server, stream sources may send an ANNOUNCE for a desired mountpoint, followed by a RECORD request to begin streaming.  Clients can then connect on the client port at the same
       mountpoint and send a PLAY request to receive the RTP data streamed from the source.

BUNDLED APPLICATIONS
       Includes rtsp-server.pl, which basically contains the synopsis.

   COMING SOON
       Priv dropping, authentication, client encoder, stats, tests
