NAME
       Linux::Distribution::Packages - list all packages on various Linux distributions

SYNOPSIS
         use Linux::Distribution::Packages qw(distribution_packages distribution_write);

         $linux = new Linux::Distribution::Packages({'format' => 'csv', 'output_file' => 'packages.csv'});
         $linux->distribution_write();

         # Or you can (re)set the options when you write.
         $linux->distribution_write({'format' => 'xml', 'output_file' => 'packages.xml'});

         # If you want to reload the package data
         $linux->distribution_packages();

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple module that uses Linux::Distribution to guess the linux distribution and then uses the correct commands to list all the packages on the system and then output them in one of three
       formats:  native, csv, and xml.

       Distributions currently working:  debian, ubuntu, fedora, redhat, suse, gentoo, slackware, redflag.

       The module inherits from Linux::Distribution, so can also use its calls.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

TODO
       * Add the capability to correctly get packages for all recognized distributions.  * Separate out parsing from writing.  Parse data to hash and give access to hash.  Then write the formatted data
       from the hash.
