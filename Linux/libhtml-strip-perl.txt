NAME
       HTML::Strip - Perl extension for stripping HTML markup from text.

SYNOPSIS
         use HTML::Strip;

         my $hs = HTML::Strip->new();

         my $clean_text = $hs->parse( $raw_html );
         $hs->eof;

DESCRIPTION
       This module simply strips HTML-like markup from text rapidly and brutally.  It could easily be used to strip XML or SGML markup instead - but as removing HTML is a much more common problem, this
       module lives in the HTML:: namespace.

       It is written in XS, and thus about five times quicker than using regular expressions for the same task.

       It does not do any syntax checking.  If you want that, use HTML::Parser.  Instead it merely applies the following rules:

       1.  Anything that looks like a tag, or group of tags will be replaced with a single space character.  Tags are considered to be anything that starts with a "<" and ends with a ">"; with the caveat
           that a ">" character may appear in either of the following without ending the tag:

           Quote
               Quotes  are considered to start with either a "'" or a """ character, and end with a matching character not preceded by an even number or escaping slashes (i.e. "\"" does not end the quote
               but "\\\\"" does).

           Comment
               If the tag starts with an exclamation mark, it is assumed to be a declaration or a comment.   Within such tags, ">" characters do not end the tag if they  appear  within  pairs  of  double
               dashes  (e.g.  "<!-- <a href="old.htm">old page</a> -->" would be stripped completely).  No parsing for quotes is performed within comments, so for instance "<!-- comment with both ' quote
               types " -->" would be entirely stripped.

       2.  Anything that appears between tags which we term strip tags is removed.  By default, these tags are "title", "script", "style" and "applet".

       HTML::Strip maintains state between calls, so you can parse a document in chunks should you wish.  If a call to parse() ends half-way through a tag, quote or comment;  the  next  call  to  parse()
       expects its input to carry on from that point.

       If  this is not the behaviour you want, you can either call eof() between calls to parse(), or set "auto_reset" to true (either on the constructor or with "set_auto_reset") so that the parser will
       reset after each call.

   METHODS
       new()
           Constructor.  Can optionally take a hash of settings (with keys corresponding to the "set_" methods below).

           Example:

            my $hs = HTML::Strip->new(
                striptags   => [ 'script', 'iframe' ],
                emit_spaces => 0
            );

       parse()
           Takes a string as an argument, returns it stripped of HTML.

       eof()
           Resets the current state information, ready to parse a new block of HTML.

       clear_striptags()
           Clears the current set of strip tags.

       add_striptag()
           Adds the string passed as an argument to the current set of strip tags.

       set_striptags()
           Takes a reference to an array of strings, which replace the current set of strip tags.

       set_emit_spaces()
           Takes a boolean value.  If set to false, HTML::Strip will not attempt any conversion of tags into spaces.  Set to true by default.

       set_emit_newlines()
           Takes a boolean value.  If set to true, HTML::Strip will output newlines after "<br>" and "<p>" tags.  Set to false by default.

       set_decode_entities()
           Takes a boolean value.  If set to false, HTML::Strip will not decode HTML entities.  Set to true by default.

       filter_entities()
           If HTML::Entities is available, this method behaves just like invoking HTML::Entities::decode_entities, except that it respects the current setting of 'decode_entities'.

       set_filter()
           Sets a filter to be applied after tags were stripped.  It may accept the name of a method (like 'filter_entities') or a code ref.  By default, its value is 'filter_entities' if  HTML::Entities
           is available or "undef" otherwise.

       set_auto_reset()
           Takes  a boolean value.  If set to true, "parse" resets after each call (equivalent to calling "eof").  Otherwise, the parser remembers its state from one call to "parse" to another, until you
           call "eof" explicitly.  Set to false by default.

       set_debug()
           Outputs extensive debugging information on internal state during the parse.  Not intended to be used by anyone except the module maintainer.

       decode_entities()
       filter()
       auto_reset()
       debug()
           Readonly accessors for their respective settings.

   LIMITATIONS
       Whitespace
           Despite only outputting one space character per group of tags, and avoiding doing so when tags are bordered by spaces or the start or end of strings, HTML::Strip can  often  output  more  than
           desired; such as with the following HTML:

            <h1> HTML::Strip </h1> <p> <em> <strong> fast, and brutal </strong> </em> </p>

           Which gives the following output:

           " HTML::Strip    fast, and brutal   "

           Thus,  you  may  want  to  post-filter the output of HTML::Strip to remove excess whitespace (for example, using "tr/ / /s;").  (This has been improved since previous releases, but is still an
           issue)

       HTML Entities
           HTML::Strip will only attempt decoding of HTML entities if HTML::Entities is installed.

   EXPORT
       None by default.
