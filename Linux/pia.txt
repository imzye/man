NAME
       pia - play media files

SYNOPSIS
       pia [ options ] movie

DESCRIPTION
       pia is a small X11 tool which plays movie files.

OPTIONS
       pia understands the usual toolkit options (-geometry + friends).  Additional options are:

       -h     display help text

       -v     be verbose.

       -debug enable debug messages.

       -dsp <dev>
              Use OSS device <dev> for sound.

       -noxv  Disable Xvideo extension.

       -nogl  Disable OpenGL.

       -noaudio
              Don't play sound.

       -novideo
              Don't play video.

       -slow n
              Slowdown video playback by factor n.  n=2 doubles playback time, ...  This also turns off audio playback.

SUPPORTED MOVIE FORMATS
       Main purpose of this utility is to playback movie files recorded by xawtv, motv and streamer.  It should be able to playback every AVI or QuickTime movie written by one of the mentioned utilities.
       Feel free to submit a bug report if this doesn't work for some file.

   QuickTime
       pia uses libquicktime to decode quicktime movies, thus it should be able to decode and playback all movies with codecs supported by libquicktime.

   AVI
       AVI support is very limited.  Video: uncompressed RGB data (15 and 24 bpp) and mjpeg is supported.  Audio: only uncompressed PCM data works.

   WAV
       WAV files are playable too, with the same limitation like AVI audio: only uncompressed PCM data.
