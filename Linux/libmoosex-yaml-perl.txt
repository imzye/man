NAME
       MooseX::YAML - DWIM loading of Moose objects from YAML

SYNOPSIS
               # given some class:

               package My::Module;
               use Moose;

               has package => (
                       is => "ro",
                       init_arg => "name",
               );

               has version => (
                       is  => "rw",
                       init_arg => undef,
               );

               sub BUILD { shift->version(3) }

               # load an object like so:

               use MooseX::YAML qw(Load -xs);

               my $obj = Load(<<'YAML');
               --- !My::Module # this syntax requires YAML::XS
               name: "MooseX::YAML"
               YAML

               $obj->package; # "MooseX::YAML"
               $obj->version; # 3, BUILD was called

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides DWIM loading of Moose based objects from YAML documents.

       Any hashes blessed into a Moose class will be replaced with a properly constructed instance (respecting init args, "BUILDALL", and the meta instance type).

       This is similar to YAML::Active in that certain nodes in the loaded YAML documented are treated specially.

EXPORTS
       All exports are setup by Sub::Exporter using currying.

       "-xs", "-syck" or "-pp" can be specified to specify YAML::XS, YAML::Syck or YAML on a per import basis.

       If no driver is explicitly chosen YAML::XS will be tried first, falling back to YAML.

       Load
       LoadFile
