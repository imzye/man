NAME
       monotone - a distributed version control system

SYNOPSIS
       mtn [options...] command [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION
       monotone  is  a highly reliable, very customizable distributed version control system that provides lightweight branches, history-sensitive merging and a flexible trust setup. monotone has an easy-to-
       learn command set and comes with a rich interface for scripting purposes and thorough documentation.

       For more information on monotone, visit http://www.monotone.ca.

       The complete documentation, including a tutorial for a quick start with the system, can be found online on http://www.monotone.ca/docs.

           don't have the correct key for. This should only be needed if you had such certs in your db when upgrading from 0.44 or earlier, or if you loaded such certs with 'mtn read'.

       db load
           Loads the contents of the database.  Reads a list of SQL instructions that regenerate the contents of the database.  This is supposed to be used in conjunction with the  output  generated  by  the
           'dump' command.

       db migrate
           Migrates the database to a newer schema.  Updates the database's internal schema to the most recent one.  Needed to automatically resolve incompatibilities that may be introduced in newer versions
           of monotone.

           Regenerates the caches stored in the database.

       attr get  PATH [ATTR]
           Gets  the  values of a file's attributes.  If no attribute is specified, this command prints all attributes attached to the file given in PATH.  Otherwise it only prints the attribute specified in

           --message-file <arg>
               set filename containing commit changelog message

       drop  [PATH]...
       rm  [PATH]...
           Drops files from the workspace.

           --bookkeep-only
               only update monotone's internal bookkeeping, not the filesystem

           --missing
               perform the operations for files missing from workspace

           --recursive [ -R ] / --no-recursive
               also operate on the contents of any listed directories

       mkdir  [DIRECTORY...]
           Creates directories and adds them to the workspace.

           --no-respect-ignore / --respect-ignore
               do not ignore any files

       pivot_root  NEW_ROOT PUT_OLD
           Renames the root directory.  After this command, the directory that currently has the name NEW_ROOT will be the root directory, and the directory that is currently the  root  directory  will  have
           name PUT_OLD.  Use of '--bookkeep-only' is NOT recommended.

           --bookkeep-only
               only update monotone's internal bookkeeping, not the filesystem

           --move-conflicting-paths / --no-move-conflicting-paths
               move conflicting, unversioned paths into '_MTN/resolutions' before proceeding with any workspace change

       pluck  [PATH...]
           Applies changes made at arbitrary places in history.  This command takes changes made at any point in history, and edits your current workspace to include those changes.  The end result is identi‐
           cal to 'mtn diff -r FROM -r TO | patch -p0', except that this command uses monotone's merger, and thus intelligently handles renames, conflicts, and so on.  If one revision is given,  applies  the
           changes made in that revision compared to its parent.  If two revisions are given, applies the changes made to get from the first revision to the second.

           --depth <arg>
               limit the number of levels of directories to descend

           --exclude <arg>
               leave out anything described by its argument

               select revision id for operation

       mv  SRC DEST
       mv  SRC1 [SRC2 [...]] DEST_DIR
       rename  SRC DEST
       rename  SRC1 [SRC2 [...]] DEST_DIR
           Renames entries in the workspace.

           --bookkeep-only
               only update monotone's internal bookkeeping, not the filesystem

       revert  [PATH]...
           Reverts files and/or directories.  In order to revert the entire workspace, specify '.' as the file name.

           --depth <arg>
               limit the number of levels of directories to descend

           --exclude <arg>
               leave out anything described by its argument

           --missing
               perform the operations for files missing from workspace

       undrop  PATH...
           Reverses a mistaken 'drop'.  If the file was deleted from the workspace, this is the same as 'revert'. Otherwise, it just removes the 'drop' from the manifest.

       update
           Updates the workspace.  This command modifies your workspace to be based off of a different revision, preserving uncommitted changes as it does so.  If a revision is given, update the workspace to
           that revision.  If not, update the workspace to the head of the branch.

           --branch [ -b ] <arg>
               select branch cert for operation

           --move-conflicting-paths / --no-move-conflicting-paths
               move conflicting, unversioned paths into '_MTN/resolutions' before proceeding with any workspace change

           --revision [ -r ] <arg>
               select revision id for operation
