NAME
       kea-lfc - Lease File Cleanup process in Kea

SYNOPSIS
       kea-lfc [-4**|-6**] [-c config-file] [-p pid-file] [-x previous-file] [-i copy-file] [-o output-file] [-f finish-file] [-v] [-V] [-W] [-d] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       The  kea-lfc  service  process  removes  redundant  information  from  the files used to provide persistent storage for the memfile database backend. The service is written to run as a stand-alone
       process. While it can be started externally, there is usually no need to do this. It is run periodically by the Kea DHCP servers.

ARGUMENTS
       The arguments are as follows:

       -4 | -6
              Indicates the protocol version of the lease files; must be either 4 or 6.

       -c config-file
              Specifies the file with the configuration for the kea-lfc process. It may also contain configuration entries for other Kea services. Currently kea-lfc gets all of  its  arguments  from  the
              command line.

       -p pid-file
              Specifies  the  PID  file. When the kea-lfc process starts, it attempts to determine if another instance of the process is already running, by examining the PID file. If one is already run‐
              ning, the new process is terminated. If one is not running, Kea writes its PID into the PID file.

       -x previous-file
              Specifies the previous or ex-lease file. When kea-lfc starts, this is the result of any previous run of kea-lfc; when kea-lfc finishes, it is the result of the current run.  If  kea-lfc  is
              interrupted before completing, this file may not exist.

       -i copy-file
              Specifies the input or copy of lease file. Before the DHCP server invokes kea-lfc, it moves the current lease file here and then calls kea-lfc with this file.

       -o output-file
              Specifies the output lease file, which is the temporary file kea-lfc should use to write the leases. Once this file is finished writing, it is moved to the finish file (see below).

       -f finish-file
              Specifies  the  finish  or  completion file, another temporary file kea-lfc uses for bookkeeping. When kea-lfc finishes writing the output file, it moves it to this file name. After kea-lfc
              finishes deleting the other files (previous and input), it moves this file to the previous lease file. By moving the files in this fashion, the kea-lfc and the DHCP server processes can de‐
              termine the correct file to use even if one of the processes was interrupted before completing its task.

       -v     Displays the Kea version.

       -V     Displays the extended Kea version.

       -W     Displays the configuration report.

       -d     Sets the logging level to debug with extra verbosity. This is primarily for development purposes in stand-alone mode.

       -h     Causes the usage string to be printed.

DOCUMENTATION
       Kea comes with an extensive Kea Administrator Reference Manual that covers all aspects of running the Kea software - compilation, installation,  configuration,  configuration  examples,  and  much
       more.  Kea  also  features  a Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea can print with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are available in various formats (.txt,
       .html, .pdf) with the Kea distribution. The Kea documentation is available at https://kea.readthedocs.io.

       Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer's Guide, available at https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/.

       The Kea project website is available at https://kea.isc.org.

MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT
       There are two public mailing lists available for the Kea project. kea-users (kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while kea-dev (kea-dev at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea de‐
       velopers, prospective contributors, and other advanced users. Both lists are available at https://lists.isc.org. The community provides best-effort support on both of those lists.

       ISC provides professional support for Kea services. See https://www.isc.org/kea/ for details.

HISTORY
       The kea-lfc process was first coded in January 2015 by the ISC Kea/DHCP team.
