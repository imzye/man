NAME
       Wharf - AfterStep module for launching or docking applications aka button bar

MyStyle DEFINITIONS
       MyStyle "*WharfTile"

              Specifies  the  style  of  the wharf button tiles, including background color, background pixmap (which may be transparent), and background gradient. This method of specifying the background is
              preferred over the BgColor, MaxColors, Pixmap, TextureColor, and TextureType options, although those (older) options do still work. See MyStyle format for details.

       MyStyle "*WharfOddTile"

              Specifies the style of every odd wharf button tile. See MyStyle format for details.

       MyStyle "*WharfFocusedTile"

              Specifies the style of the wharf button tile under the mouse pointer, including background color, background pixmap (which may be transparent), and background gradient. See MyStyle  format  for
              details.

       MyStyle "*WharfOddFocusedTile"

              Specifies the style of every odd wharf button tile under the mouse pointer. See MyStyle format for details.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       AlignContents Left,Top,Right,Bottom,HTiled,VTiled,HScaled,VScaled,HCenter,VCenter

              That will force contents of each Wharf's button to be aligned to either side of the button, when FitContents is not used.

              See Also: Alignment flags for further details.

       Animate

              If specified, the opening and closing of Folders will be animated, rather than simply drawn in one frame.

       AnimateDelay

              Specifies the delay in milliseconds that the animation will pause between each move when opening or closing a folder.

       AnimateMain

              Designates that full-length Wharf withdraws will be animated.

       AnimateSteps

              Specifies the steps a Folder takes in animating while opening or closing. This translates into the Folder button moving button-size/ steps pixels each step.

       AnimateStepsMain

              Specifies  the  steps  the  main  Wharf takes in iconification or de-iconification upon mouse button 3 being pressed. This translates into the main Wharf moving <button-size>/ steps pixels each
              step.

       BalloonBorderHilite

              Defines bevel to be drawn around balloons - replaces the BorderWidth setting.

              See Also: Bevel flags for further details.

       BalloonCloseDelay number

              Specifies the period in milliseconds to delay the disappearance of the balloon when leaving window with the mouse.

       BalloonDelay number

              Specifies the period in milliseconds to delay the appearance of the balloon.

       BalloonStyle MyStyle

              MyStyle to be used to draw balloon. Note that balloons could be shaped (BackPixmap 125 and 126).

       BalloonTextPaddingX size

              width of the border around the text in balloons.

       BalloonTextPaddingY size

              height of the border around the text in balloons.

       BalloonXOffset

              The balloon window is positioned to be horizontally centered against the Wharf window it is describing. The horizontal position may be set as an offset. Negative offsets of-Nare placed N pixels
              left of the Wharf window, positive offsets of +N are placed N pixels right of the window. Defaults to +2.

       BalloonYOffset

              The  balloon  window is positioned to be horizontally centered against the Wharf window it is describing. The vertical position may be set as an offset. Negative offsets of-Nare placed N pixels
              above the Wharf window, positive offsets of +N are placed N pixels below. Defaults to +2.

       Balloons

              Turns on the balloon feature. A "balloon" is displayed showing the name of the button the pointer is resting on in the Wharf . The balloon background and text are configured  with  the  MyStyle
              "*WharfBalloon". See afterstep(1x) for more information on MyStyles.

       Bevel None|[Left,Top,Right,Bottom,Extra,NoOutline]

              Determines  exact  size and shape of the 3D bevel drawn around each button. This option is somewhat synonymous to NoBorder. If NoBorder is encountered after Bevel - then it will override Bevel,
              otherwise Bevel will override NoBorder.

              See Also: Bevel flags for further details.

       Columns

              Specifies the number of columns of buttons to be created. This will give your Wharf a vertical layout, with the number of columns equal to the number specificed in columns . If unspecified, the
              number  of  columns  will  be set to 1. If the columns are set to a number greater than 1, then there will be that number of columns with enough rows to satisfy the requested number of buttons.
              Only one of *WharfRows or *WharfColumns should be specified.

       CompositionMethod testure_type

              Determines algorithm used to blend all the icons and Wharf background to form the button's image. Valid es are 130-145 ( see MyStyles section ). The default value is 131 ( alpha-blending )

       FitContents

              Wharf will draw each button so that it fits its contents perfectly (icon or swallowed app ). That will cause some of the Wharf's buttons to differ in size from others. Use in  conjunction  with
              ShapeToContents.

       FlipLabel

              Will cause Wharf to draw vertical label text.

       FolderOffset size

              sets the distance between opened folder and its parent.

       ForceSize Size

              If specified, will force pixmaps to Size instead of the default of 64x64. This has no effect on the Size of the displayed icons (they will be croped if larger).

       Geometry

              Specifies  the Wharf window location and/or size. If the size is not specified, Wharf will auto-size itself in a reasonable manner. The geometry is a standard X11 window geometry specification;
              see XParseGeometry(3x) , and EXAMPLES (below) for further details.

       LabelLocation number

              Specifies the location of the label. Correct values are integers from 0-32. label could be drawn on each side of the button and just on top of icon. It could also be aligned to different sides.

       MyStyle

              Specifies the style of the wharf button tiles, including background color, background pixmap (which may be transparent), and background gradient. This method of  specifying  the  background  is
              preferred over the BgColor, MaxColors, Pixmap, TextureColor, and TextureType options, although those (older) options do still work.

              See Also: MyStyle definition for further details.

       NoBalloons

              Do not show Balloons in Wharf.

       OrthogonalFolderOffset size

              sets the offset of an opened folder relative to its parent orthogonal to the opening direction. In other words this can be used to move the opened folder parallel to its parent

       Rows

              Specifies  the number of rows of buttons to be created. This will give your Wharf a horizontal layout, with the number of rows equal to the number specified in rows . If unspecified, the number
              of rows will be set to 1. If the rows are set to a number greater than 1, then there will be that number of rows with enough columns to satisfy the requested number  of  buttons.  Only  one  of
              *WharfRows or *WharfColumns should be specified.

       ShapeToContents

              Will  cause Wharf to use X Shaped extensions and have a window of non-rectangular shape. Shape is composed from the overall geometry of buttons ( see FitContents ), shape of the MyStyle used to
              draw Wharf background ( if BackPixmap 126 or 125 is used ), contents of each button - such as swallowed app's shape, label and icons.

       ShowHints

              FIXME: add proper description here.

              See Also: Balloon Contents flags for further details.

       ShowLabel

              Tells Wharf to render a label on each of its buttons, effectively immitating the behaviour of the discontinued Zharf module.

       Sound

              FIXME: add proper description here.

              See Also: Wharf sound definition for further details.

       StretchBackground

              This should allow for all kinds of skins where each button is just a part of large shaped figure.

       WithdrawStyle

              Specifies the circumstances under which button 3 should cause the Wharf to withdraw to a corner. If style is 0, button 3 will do nothing. If style is 1 (the default), a click on any  button  in
              the toplevel bar will cause Wharf to withdraw to the nearest corner. If style is 2, a click on either the first or the last button in the toplevel bar will cause the withdrawal.
