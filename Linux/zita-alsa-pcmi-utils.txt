NAME
       alsa_delay - measure round-trip latency of a soundcard

SYNOPSIS
       alsa_delay playdev captdev fsamp frsize nfrags

DESCRIPTION
       This tool can be used to measure the round-trip latency of a soundcard.  To do this, start the program and connect like this:
         alsa_delay -> playdev -> cable from soundcard output to input -> captdev -> alsa_delay

       alsa_delay  should  be able to measure the round-trip latency with an accuracy of around 1/1000 of a sample.  The assumption is, that the latency is more or less independent of frequency, and that
       the cable between soundcard output and input has virtually zero latency.

ARGUMENTS
       playdev
              ALSA playback device (e.g.: hw:0)

       captdev
              ALSA capture device (e.g.: hw:0)

       fsamp  Sample rate (e.g.: 48000)

       frsize Period size (e.g.: 256)

       nfrags Number of fragments (e.g.: 2)

EXAMPLES
       This will measure and display the round-trip latency of soundcard hw:0 using 48kHz samplerate, and 10 fragments each 2048 samples.
         alsa_delay hw:0 hw:0 48000 2048 10

NOTES
       alsa_delay is a port of jack_delay (by the same author) to ALSA.
