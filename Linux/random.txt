RANDOM(6)                      BSD Games Manual                      RANDOM(6)

NAME
     random — random lines from a file or random numbers

SYNOPSIS
     random [-er] [denominator]

DESCRIPTION
     random reads lines from the standard input and copies them to the stan‐
     dard output with a probability of 1/denominator.  The default value for
     denominator is 2.

     The options are as follows:

     -e      If the -e option is specified, random does not read or write any‐
             thing, and simply exits with a random exit value of 0 to
             denominator-1, inclusive.

     -r      The -r option guarantees that the output is unbuffered.
