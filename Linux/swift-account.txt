NAME
       account-server.conf - configuration file for the OpenStack Swift account server

SYNOPSIS
       account-server.conf

DESCRIPTION
       This is the configuration file used by the account server and other account background services, such as; replicator, auditor and reaper.

       The  configuration file follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided into sections, which are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a certain number of key/value pa‐
       rameters which are described later.

       Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.

       You can find more information about python-pastedeploy configuration format at https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pastedeploy/en/latest/#config-format

GLOBAL SECTION
       This is indicated by section named [DEFAULT]. Below are the parameters that are acceptable within this section.

       bind_ip
              IP address the account server should bind to. The default is 0.0.0.0 which will make it bind to all available addresses.

       bind_port
              TCP port the account server should bind to. The default is 6202.

       keep_idle
              Value to set for socket TCP_KEEPIDLE. The default value is 600.

       bind_timeout
              Timeout to bind socket. The default is 30.

       backlog
              TCP backlog.  Maximum number of allowed pending connections. The default value is 4096.

       workers
              The number of pre-forked processes that will accept connections.  Zero means no fork.  The default is auto which will make the server try to match the  number  of  effective  cpu  cores  if
              python  multiprocessing  is  available  (included with most python distributions >= 2.6) or fallback to one.  It's worth noting that individual workers will use many eventlet co-routines to
              service multiple concurrent requests.

       max_clients
              Maximum number of clients one worker can process simultaneously (it will actually accept(2) N + 1). Setting this to one (1) will only handle one request at a time, without accepting another
              request concurrently.  The default is 1024.

       user   The system user that the account server will run as. The default is swift.

       swift_dir

              Logging address. The default is /dev/log.

       log_max_line_length
              The following caps the length of log lines to the value given; no limit if set to 0, the default.

       log_custom_handlers
              Comma separated list of functions to call to setup custom log handlers.  functions get passed: conf, name, log_to_console, log_route, fmt, logger, adapted_logger. The default is empty.

       log_udp_host
              If set, log_udp_host will override log_address.

       log_udp_port
              UDP log port, the default is 514.

       log_statsd_host

       log_statsd_default_sample_rate
              The default is 1.

       log_statsd_sample_rate_factor
              The default is 1.

       log_statsd_metric_prefix
              The default is empty.

       db_preallocation
              If you don't mind the extra disk space usage in overhead, you can turn this on to preallocate disk space with SQLite databases to decrease fragmentation.  The default is false.

       eventlet_debug
              Debug mode for eventlet library. The default is false.

       fallocate_reserve
              You can set fallocate_reserve to the number of bytes or percentage of disk space you'd like fallocate to reserve, whether there is space for the given file size or not. Percentage  will  be

PIPELINE SECTION
       This is indicated by section name [pipeline:main]. Below are the parameters that are acceptable within this section.

       pipeline
              It is used when you need apply a number of filters. It is a list of filters ended by an application. The normal pipeline is "healthcheck recon account-server".

APP SECTION
       This is indicated by section name [app:account-server]. Below are the parameters that are acceptable within this section.

       use    Entry point for paste.deploy for the account server. This is the reference to the installed python egg.  This is normally egg:swift#account.

       set log_name
              Label used when logging. The default is account-server.

       replication_server
              Configure parameter for creating specific server.  To handle all verbs, including replication verbs, do not specify "replication_server" (this is the default). To only  handle  replication,
              set  to a true value (e.g. "true" or "1"). To handle only non-replication verbs, set to "false". Unless you have a separate replication network, you should not specify any value for "repli‐
              cation_server". The default is empty.

       nice_priority
              Modify scheduling priority of server processes. Niceness values range from -20 (most favorable to the process) to 19 (least favorable to the process).  The default does not modify priority.

       ionice_class
              Modify I/O scheduling class of server processes. I/O niceness class values are IOPRIO_CLASS_RT (realtime), IOPRIO_CLASS_BE (best-effort) and IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE (idle).  The default does  not
              modify class and priority.  Work only with ionice_priority.

       ionice_priority
              Modify I/O scheduling priority of server processes. I/O niceness priority is a number which goes from 0 to 7. The higher the value, the lower the I/O priority of the process. Work only with
              ionice_class.  Ignored if IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE is set.

FILTER SECTION
       Any  section that has its name prefixed by "filter:" indicates a filter section.  Filters are used to specify configuration parameters for specific swift middlewares.  Below are the filters avail‐
       able and respective acceptable parameters.

       [filter:healthcheck]

          use    Entry point for paste.deploy for the healthcheck middleware. This is the reference to the installed python egg.  This is normally egg:swift#healthcheck.

          disable_path
                 An optional filesystem path which, if present, will cause the healthcheck URL to return "503 Service Unavailable" with a body of "DISABLED BY FILE".

       [filter:recon]

          use    Entry point for paste.deploy for the recon middleware. This is the reference to the installed python egg.  This is normally egg:swift#recon.

          recon_cache_path
                 The recon_cache_path simply sets the directory where stats for a few items will be stored.  Depending on the method of deployment you may need to create this directory manually  and  en‐
                 sure that swift has read/write. The default is /var/cache/swift.

       [filter:xprofile]

          use    Entry point for paste.deploy for the xprofile middleware. This is the reference to the installed python egg.  This is normally egg:swift#xprofile.

          profile_module
                 This option enable you to switch profilers which should inherit from python standard profiler. Currently the supported value can be 'cProfile', 'eventlet.green.profile' etc.

          log_filename_prefix
                 This  prefix  will  be used to combine process ID and timestamp to name the profile data file.  Make sure the executing user has permission to write into this path (missing path segments
                 will be created, if necessary).  If you enable profiling in more than one type of daemon, you must override it with an  unique  value  like,  the  default  is  /var/log/swift/profile/ac‐
                 count.profile.

          dump_interval
                 The profile data will be dumped to local disk based on above naming rule in this interval. The default is 5.0.

          dump_timestamp
                 Be careful, this option will enable profiler to dump data into the file with time stamp which means there will be lots of files piled up in the directory.  The default is false

          path   This is the path of the URL to access the mini web UI. The default is __profile__.

          flush_at_shutdown
                 Clear the data when the wsgi server shutdown. The default is false.

          unwind Unwind the iterator of applications. Default is false.

                 of this value and the container-updater interval should be less than the account-replicator reclaim_age. This ensures that once the account-reaper has deleted a container there is suffi‐
                 cient time for the container-updater to report to the account before the account DB is removed.

          reap_warn_after
                 If the account fails to be reaped due to a persistent error, the account reaper will log a message such as:
                     Account  <name>  has  not  been  reaped since <date> You can search logs for this message if space is not being reclaimed after you delete account(s).  Default is 2592000 seconds (30
                 days). This is in addition to any time requested by delay_reaping.

          nice_priority
                 Modify scheduling priority of server processes. Niceness values range from -20 (most favorable to the process) to 19 (least favorable to the process).  The default does not modify prior‐
                 ity.

                 not modify class and priority.  Work only with ionice_priority.

          ionice_priority
                 Modify  I/O  scheduling priority of server processes. I/O niceness priority is a number which goes from 0 to 7. The higher the value, the lower the I/O priority of the process. Work only
                 with ionice_class.  Ignored if IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE is set.
