NAME
       nethogs - Net top tool grouping bandwidth per process

SYNOPSIS
       nethogs [-V] [-h] [-x] [-d seconds] [-v mode] [-c count] [-t] [-p] [-s] [-a] [-l] [-f filter] [-C] [-b] [-g period] [-P pid] [device(s)]

DESCRIPTION
       NetHogs  is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down per protocol or per subnet, like most such tools do, it groups bandwidth by process - and does not rely on a special kernel
       module to be loaded. So if there's suddenly a lot of network traffic, you can fire up NetHogs and immediately see which PID is causing this, and if it's some kind of spinning process, kill it.

   Options
       -V     prints version.

       -h     prints available commands usage.

       -x     bughunt mode - implies tracemode.

       -d     delay for update refresh rate in seconds. default is 1.

       -v     view mode (0 = kB/s, 1 = total kB, 2 = total bytes, 3 = total MB, 4 = MB/s, 5 = GB/s). default is 0.

              kB: 2e10 bytes, MB: 2e20 bytes, GB: 2e30 bytes

       -c     number of updates. default is 0 (unlimited).

       -t     tracemode.

       -p     sniff in promiscuous mode (not recommended).

       -s     sort output by sent column.

       -l     display command line.

       -a     monitor all devices, even loopback/stopped ones.

       -C     capture TCP and UDP.

       -b     Display the program basename.

       -g     garbage collection period in number of refresh. default is 50.

       -P     Show only processes with the specified pid(s).

       -f     EXPERIMENTAL: specify string pcap filter (like tcpdump). This may be removed or changed in a future version.

              device(s)
              to monitor. default is all interfaces up and running excluding loopback

INTERACTIVE CONTROL
       q      quit

       s      sort by SENT traffic

       r      sort by RECEIVED traffic

       l      display command line

       b      display the program basename

       m      switch between total (KB, B, MB) and throughput (KB/s, MB/s, GB/s) mode

RUNNING WITHOUT ROOT
       In order to be run by an unprivileged user, nethogs needs the cap_net_admin and cap_net_raw capabilities. Additionally, to display process names, cap_dac_read_search and  cap_sys_ptrace  capabili‐
       ties are required.  These can be set on the executable by using the setcap(8) command, as follows:

           sudo setcap "cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_dac_read_search,cap_sys_ptrace+pe" /usr/local/sbin/nethogs

Notes
       1.  When using the -P <pid> option, in a case where a process exited (normally or abruptly), Nethogs does not track that it exited. So, the operating system might create a new process (for another
       program) with the same pid. In this case, this new process will be shown by Nethogs.
