NAME
       unaccent - remove accents from input stream or a string

SYNOPSIS
       unaccent [--debug_low] [--debug_high] [-h] charset [string] [expected]

DESCRIPTION
       With a single argument, unaccent reads data from stdin, replaces accented letters by their unaccented equivalent and writes the result on stdout.  If the second argument ('string') is provided un‐
       accent  transforms  it  by  replacing accented letters by their unaccented equivalent. The result is printed on the standard output.  The charset of the input string or the data read from stdin is
       specified by the 'charset' argument (ISO-8859-15 for instance). The output is printed using the same charset.

       If the 'expected' argument is provided, the output string is compared to it. If they are not equal unaccent exits on error.

       unaccent relies on the iconv(3) library to convert from the specified charset to UTF-16BE (or UTF-16 if UTF-16BE is not available). You should check the manual pages  for  available  charsets.  On
       GNU/Linux the command

       iconv -l

       shows all available charsets.

OPTIONS
       --debug_low
              Prints human readable information about the unaccentuation process. See unac(3) for more information.

       --debug_high
              Prints very detailed information about the unaccentuation process.  See unac(3) for more information.

       --help -h
              Prints a short usage and exits.

EXAMPLES
       Remove accents from the string été and check that the result is ete.

       unaccent ISO-8859-1 été ete

       Remove accents from file myfile and put the result in file myfile.unaccent

       unaccent ISO-8859-1 < myfile > myfile.unaccent
