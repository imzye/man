NAME
       datalog - a lightweight deductive database system

SYNOPSIS
       datalog [OPTIONS] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       The  datalog  program provides a lightweight deductive database system.
       Queries and database updates are expressed using Datalog-a  declarative
       logic  language  in  which each formula is a function-free Horn clause,
       and every variable in the head of a clause must appear in the  body  of
       the  clause.   The use of Datalog syntax and an implementation based on
       tabling intermediate results, ensures that all queries terminate.   The
       program  reads  and executes the assertions and queries in FILE, or en‐
       ters interactive mode if an input file is not given.

OPTIONS
       -o FILE
              Send output to a file (default is standard output).

       -i     Enter interactive mode after loading input file.

       -l FILE
              Load extensions written in Lua.

       -t     Print output as tab separated values.

       -h     Display command usage info.

       -v     Display command version info.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is non-zero if there is a syntax  error  in  the  input
       file or an internal error is detected.

SEE ALSO
       The  full  documentation for datalog is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If the info and datalog programs are properly installed at  your  site,
       the command

              info datalog

       should give you access to the complete manual.
