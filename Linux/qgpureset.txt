NAME
        qgpureset - reset GPU error counts

SYNOPSIS
        qgpureset -H host -g gpuid -p -v

DESCRIPTION
       The qgpureset command will request a MOM to reset the ECC counts on one of it's Nvidia GPUs. The GPU's error count is reset by sending a GPU Control batch request to the batch server.

       Changing the GPU mode requires PBS Operator or Manager privilege.  It also requires that Torque be configured with --enable-nvidia-gpu.

OPTIONS
       -H host        Specifies the host within the cluster on which the GPU is located. The argument is the name of a host that is a member of the cluster of hosts managed by the server.

       -g gpuid       Specifies the ID of the GPU.

       -p             Specifies to reset the GPU's permanent ECC error count.

       -v             Specifies to reset the GPU's volatile ECC error count.

OPERANDS
       None

STANDARD ERROR
       The  qgpureset command will write a diagnostic messages to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
        qgpureset command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the  qgpureset command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
