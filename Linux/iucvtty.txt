NAME
       iucvtty - allow remote logins over z/VM IUCV

SYNOPSIS
       iucvtty [-h|--help]
       iucvtty [-v|--version]
       iucvtty [-a|--allow-from regex] terminal_id [-- login_program [login_options]]

DESCRIPTION
       The  iucvtty application provides full-screen terminal access to a Linux instance running as a z/VM guest operating system.  The iucvconn application is used
       to connect to a running iucvtty instance.

       The terminal connection is based on the z/VM Inter-User Communication Vehicle (IUCV). z/VM IUCV establishes a communication path between two z/VM guest  vir‐
       tual machines on the same z/VM instance.  Because z/VM IUCV is independent from TCP/IP, Linux instances with no external network can be accessed.

       terminal_id  identifies  the z/VM IUCV connection and is similar to a port number in TCP/IP communications.  terminal_id is case-sensitive and consists of up
       to 8 alphanumeric characters.  It must be specified as a parameter in connection requests against a iucvtty instance.

       When a connection is established, iucvtty starts a login program.  When the login program ends, iucvtty also exits. Consider an inittab(5)  entry  to  ensure
       that iucvtty is restarted and ready for the next terminal session.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display a short help text and exit.

       -v, --version
              Display the version number of iucvtty, then exit.

       -a, --allow-from regex
              Limit  permissions  for  incoming  connections  to z/VM user IDs that match the regular expression regex. The connection is refused if the ID does not
              match. If this parameter is omitted, connections are permitted from any z/VM user ID.

       login_program
              login_program specifies the absolute path to the login program to be started when a connection is established.  The default is /bin/login(1).
              The login_program must be separated by two dashes (--).

       login_options
              Depending on the particular login program used, login_options specifies additional options.

EXAMPLES
       To allow remote logins using the terminal identifier "lnxterm":

         iucvtty lnxterm

       To only allow users from LNXSYS01 to connect to terminal "lnxterm":

         iucvtty -a LNXSYS01 lnxterm

       To only allow users from LNXSYS10 through LNXSYS19 to connect to terminal "lnxterm":

         iucvtty -a "LNXSYS1[0-9]" lnxterm

       To use /sbin/sulogin instead of /bin/login for terminal "suterm":

         iucvtty suterm -- /sbin/sulogin

       An entry in /etc/inittab to facilitate user logins on terminal "lnxterm" with /bin/login could be:

         t1:2345:respawn:/sbin/iucvtty lnxterm

       An entry in /etc/inittab to facilitate user logins on terminal "suterm" with /sbin/sulogin in single user mode could be:

         s1:S:respawn:/sbin/iucvtty suterm -- /sbin/sulogin

DIAGNOSTICS
       If the Linux kernel does not include kernel support for the AF_IUCV network addressing family, iucvtty exits and displays the message 'AF_IUCV address family
       is not available: Address family not supported by protocol'.

SECURITY
   Linux
       The  iucvtty program can be used by regular users.  Depending on the particular login program, iucvtty must be started with superuser privileges for user au‐
       thentication and authorization. For instance, /bin/login requires superuser privileges and, thus, regular users must use a different login program.

       Each connection attempt is logged to the authpriv syslog facility.

       iucvtty uses pseudo-terminal (pts) devices to communicate with the login program. For security reasons, some login programs, like /bin/login, do  not  permit
       root logins on pseudo-terminal devices (see also /etc/securetty(5)).

       To permit root logins, consider using HVC terminal devices that are provided by the z/VM IUCV hypervisor console (HVC) device driver.
