NAME
       qb-blackbox - Display "flight data" from the "blackbox".

SYNOPSIS
       qb-blackbox [blackbox-file...]

DESCRIPTION
       qb-blackbox prints out the logs (including debug logs) that were recorded using libqb's blackbox mechanism.

   Portability notes
       Due  to  variations  amongst platforms, some of which directly impact the libqb's blackbox format handling (e.g. page size), there's currently only the commitment that qb-blackbox shall decode the
       blackbox files recorded at the same platform (plus the same page size) while using libqb compiled with the same relevant compile-time options (e.g. USE_CACHE_LINE_ALIGNMENT) as linked to this  de‐
       coder.  Otherwise, your mileage may vary.
