NAME
       procmeter3-lcd - A system monitoring program with LCDproc display.

SYNOPSIS
       procmeter3-lcd [-h|--help] [--rc=<filename>] [--...]  [...]

DESCRIPTION
       ProcMeter Displays one or more pieces of information about the operating system and other resources.  Most of the information that is displayed comes from the /proc filesystem.  The program is modular
       and very configurable.

OPTIONS
       The command line options are described below.

       -h     Provides a help message listing the available outputs.  This will be different for different computers depending on the Linux kernel version that is being used and the hardware/software that is
              configured.

       --rc=<filename>
              Load the specified .procmeterrc file in stead of the searching in the usual places.

       --...  A  list of configuration file options that will override the values in the .procmeterrc file.  The format of these options is (for example) --LCD.host=localhost which is equivalent to the entry
              in the .procmeterrc file of

               [LCD]
               host = localhost

              All spaces around the equal sign must be removed and if spaces are required in the value on the right hand side then quotes must be used around the entire command line option.

       ...    A list of names of outputs that are to be displayed.  This can include any of the outputs that are available (see the -h option).  For the CPU usage is in a module named Statistics with an out‐
              put named CPU and there are graph (-g), text (-t) and bar (-b) options.  To display the CPU usage graph you would use the command line option Statistics.CPU-g

USAGE
       When started the program will display on an attached LCD display using the LCDd daemon program (from http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net).  The outputs that are displayed are those from the command line and
       those from the .procmeterrc configuration file.

       The modules that are available for procmeter3-lcd are described in the procmeter3_modules(1) manual page.
