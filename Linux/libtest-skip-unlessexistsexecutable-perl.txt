NAME
       Test::Skip::UnlessExistsExecutable - skips tests unless executable exists

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::More tests => 1;
           use Test::Skip::UnlessExistsExecutable qw(
               /usr/bin/rsync
               perl
           );
           use_ok 'Mouse';

           # or

           use Test::More tests => 1;
           use Test::Skip::UnlessExistsExecutable;

           skip_all_unless_exists '/bin/sh';
           skip_all_unless_exists 'perl';
           ok 1;

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Skip::UnlessExistsExecutable checks if an executable exist and skips the test if it does not. The intent is to avoid needing to write this sort of boilerplate code:

           Test::More;
           BEGIN {
               do_i_have_all_my_optional_deps() ? plan skip_all : plan tests => 42
           }

INTERFACE
       Both Test::Skip::UnlessExistsExecutable import method and test_exists_executable method take the name of a program or the file path of executable.  It checks if the program exists and is
       executable.
