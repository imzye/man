NAME
       ethfabricinfo

       Provides a brief summary of the components in the fabric.

       ethfabricinfo can be very useful as a quick assessment of the fabric state. It can be run against a known good fabric to identify its components and then later run to see if anything has changed about
       the fabric configuration or state.

       For more extensive fabric analysis, use ethreport. These tools can be found in the Intel(R) Ethernet Fabric Suite FastFabric User Guide
