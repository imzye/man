NAME
       ncdt - directory tree printer with extended capabilities

SYNOPSIS
       ncdt [-db?]  [--dirs] [--bitrate] [--prefix text ] [--help] [ directory [ name ]]

DESCRIPTION
       ncdt is a small utility for printing directory trees. It has some additional features not found in tree(1). Additional capabilities are:

       -      size field for directories displays the summary size of directory subtree instead of the size of the special file (which is somewhat more useful)

       -      sizes are displayed in a more readable format (that's a minor improvement, but it helps a little)

       -      MP3 files are detected; additional info is displayed for them (which is probably the nicest thing about NcdT) The info is displayed in a compact form, like <2:53 v168JR+> where 2:53 is play
              time,  v  (if  present)  means  the file is encoded using VBR, 168 is bitrate (average bitrate for VBR files), J describes channel encoding (Mono, Stereo, Joint-Stereo, Dual channel), R (if
              present) means the file has a RIFF header at the beginning, + (if present) means the file has ID3v2 tag attached - (if present) means there's no ID3 tag at all (none of these means  there's
              only ID3v1 tag present).

       NcdT is particularily nice for indexing CDs.

OPTIONS
       -d --dirs
              Print only directories, omit files. This mode is a rough equivalent of du(1).

       -b --bitrate
              Print  bitrate  info  for directories. Bitrates are displayed both for ordinary files and directories. If all MP3 files in a given directory subtree have the same bitrate only one number is
              printed, if they have various bitrates the range is printed.

       --prefix text
              Prefix listing with given text. This option is not intended for general use.  It might be used by programs using NcdT to index CDsor doing similar operations to record  additional  informa‐
              tion.

       -? --help
              Display usage summary.

USAGE
       When called without any parameters ncdt displays directory tree for current directory (.).

       When called with one parameter ncdt displays directory tree for specified directory.

       When  called  with two parameters ncdt displays directory tree for the directory specified as its first parameter.  Second parameter is used as directory label for the top level directory (instead
       of directory name from parameter 1).

EXAMPLES
       ncdt   prints directory tree for the current directory. It will be labeled .

       ncdt /usr
              prints directory tree of /usr. It will be labeled /usr

       ncdt /cdrom 'CD #21'
              prints directory tree of /cdrom. It will be labeled CD #21

       ncdt -db /cdrom
              lists directory sizes, play times and bitrate ranges

SEE ALSO
       tree(1), du(1)

BUGS
       NcdT uses quite a lot of memory. It's also not very fast, but on a decent CPU it should not be noticeable.

       There are no real bugs I'm aware of. I don't think there are any now.
