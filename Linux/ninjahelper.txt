NAME
       NINJAHELPER - A menu driven curses-based interface to walk you through backupninja configuration.

SYNOPSIS
       ninjahelper

DESCRIPTION
       Ninjahelper is an helper script to walk you through configuration of the backup tasks for backupninja. It is a curses based "wizard" with an intuitive menu-driven interface.

ADDING NEW HELPERS
       To add an additional 'wizard' to ninjahelper, follow these steps:

       (1)    create  a  file  in  the  handlers  directory  (eg.  /usr/share/backupninja)  using  the  .helper  extension. For example, if you wish to create a helper for the handler "blue", create the file
              /usr/share/backupninja/blue.helper.

       (2)    next, add your helper to the global HELPERS variable and define the main function for your helper (the function  name  is  always  <helper>_wizard).  To  use  the  blue.helper  as  an  example:
              HELPERS="$HELPERS blue:description_of_this_helper"
                     blue_wizard() {
                       ... do work here ...
                     }

       (3)    look  at  the  existing  helpers  to  see  how  they  are  written.  Try to re-use functions, such as the dialog functions that are defined in easydialog.sh, or the vserver functions defined in
              lib/vserver.

       (4)    test, re-test, and test again. Try to break the helper by going backwards, try to think like someone who has no idea how to configure your handler would think, try to make your helper as simple
              as possible. Walk like a cat, become your shadow, don't let your senses betray you.
