NAME
       csdp - Semidefinite Programming solver

SYNOPSIS
       csdp PROBLEM [FINAL_SOLUTION [INITIAL_SOLUTION]]

DESCRIPTION
       CSDP  is  a  library of routines that implements a predictor corrector variant of the semidefinite programming algorithm of Helmberg, Rendl, Vanderbei, and Wolkowicz.  The main advantages of this code
       are that it is written to be used as a callable subroutine, it is written in C for efficiency, the code runs in parallel on shared memory multi-processor systems, and it makes effective use  of  spar‐
       sity in the constraint matrices.

       The csdp binary is a simple command-line interface to the library.

EXIT STATUS
       The output is a solution, together with some timing information.  The exit status indicates the following:

       0      A solution to the problem was found.

       1      The problem is primal infeasible.

       2      The problem is dual infeasible.

       3      The problem was solved with reduced accuracy.

       4      The maximum number of iterations was reached without finding a solution.

       5      The search got stuck at the edge of primal feasibility.

       6      The search got stuck at the edge of dual feasibility.

       7      Lack of progress in finding a solution was detected.

       8      The system matrix is singular, factorization of the matrix failed, or solving for dy or dy1 failed.

       9      Too many line search failures were encountered.

       10     An input problem or solution could not be read.

       12     The gap became infinite or NaN.
