NAME
       dexdeps - DEX external dependency dump

SYNOPSIS
       dexdeps options <file.{dex,apk,jar}> ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  dexdeps tool dumps a list of fields and methods that a DEX file uses but does not define.  When combined with a list of public APIs, it can be used to determine whether an APK is access‐
       ing fields and calling methods that it shouldn't be.  It may also be useful in determining whether an application requires a certain minimum API level to execute.

       For zip archives (including .jar and .apk), dexdeps will look for a "classes.dex" entry.

OPTIONS
       --format={brief,xml}
              Specifies the output format.

       • "brief" produces one line of output for each field and method.  Field and argument types are shown as descriptor strings.

       • "xml" produces a larger output file, readable with an XML browser.  Types are shown in a more human-readable form (e.g.  "[I" becomes "int[]").

       --just-classes
         Indicates that output should only include a list of classes, as opposed to also listing fields and methods.
