NAME
       pg_buildext - Build and install a PostgreSQL extension

SYNOPSIS
       pg_buildext [options] action [src-dir] [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       pg_buildext is a script that will build a PostgreSQL extension in a VPATH way, for potentially several PostgreSQL server versions in parallel.  It builds for the intersection of versions known in
       debian/pgversions (versions supported by the package) and in /usr/share/postgresql-common/supported-versions (versions supported in this release).

USAGE
       Packages using pg_buildext should be prepared to build binaries for PostgreSQL versions that are not present in Debian unstable, e.g. for older releases when building backports for Debian (old)stable
       (possibly including backports of newer PostgreSQL releases), or for all PostgreSQL releases when the package is built for apt.postgresql.org.

       As the set of binary packages depends on the target PostgreSQL versions, debian/control is generated from a template in debian/control.in when pg_buildext updatecontrol is run. Occurrences of
       PGVERSION in package sections are replaced by the target PostgreSQL version. Include /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgxs_debian_control.mk in debian/rules to run a check at build time if updating
       debian/control is required.

       As pg_buildext invokes make for the build, install, and clean actions, invocations from debian/rules (which is a makefile) should be prefixed with + so the sub-makes can talk with the make jobserver.
       Additional makefile variables can be passed to make via the -m option.

       Many extensions support make installcheck testing using pg_regress. As this needs the package to be installed, it cannot be run at build time.  Instead, the tests should be run using autopkgtest from
       debian/tests/*.

       If debian/tests/control.in exists, occurrences of package names containing PGVERSION are replaced by lists of package names with the target PostgreSQL versions filled in. (If no replacing is needed in
       debian/tests/control, it is fine to provide the tests control file directly.)

OPTIONS
       -cio arg
       -s  Passed to pg_virtualenv when running installcheck.

       -m arg
           Passed to make.

ACTIONS
       Most actions expect a directory name where to build the sources. It will get created for you if it does not exist. If the build-dir contains a %v sign, it will get replaced by the specific version of
       PostgreSQL being built against. (Usually this parameter is build-%v.)

       supported-versions
           Print effective list of supported versions, i.e. the intersection of the sets of versions supported by the system (from /usr/share/postgresql-common/supported-versions) and the package (from
           debian/pgversions).

           Use this when building packages.

       installed-versions
           In the list of installed packages, look for packages matching the PGVERSION package name templates from debian/control.in, and print the PostgreSQL major version number part.

           Use this when testing packages.

       checkcontrol
           Check if debian/control needs updating from debian/control.in. This is invoked from /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgxs_debian_control.mk. When building for a backports or pgdg suite as determined
           by debian/changelog, this action also updates the control file. Otherwise, updatecontrol needs to be run manually.

       updatecontrol
           Update debian/control from debian/control.in, and debian/tests/control from debian/tests/control.in if the latter exists.

       configure [src-dir] build-dir [extra-configure-options]
           For every supported version, call ../configure from the build-dir directory. (Most PostgreSQL extensions do not have a configure script.)

       build [src-dir] build-dir [extra-cflags]
           Build the extension in the build-dir directory.

       install [src-dir] build-dir package-pattern
           Invoke make install from the build-dir directory.  The third parameter specifies the package name to use. Most packages use postgresql-%v-pkgname. Make will be called with
           DESTDIR="$(CURDIR)/debian/package".

       clean [src-dir] build-dir
           Clean the build directory.

       loop [src-dir] package-pattern
           As a variant to calling build and install separately for VPATH builds, loop over the supported PostgreSQL versions in the top source directory. This should be used if the package does not support
           VPATH builds. As it also invokes make install, it should be placed were installation happens in debian/rules, rather than where build would normally be called.

       installcheck [src-dir] [build-dir]
           Use pg_virtualenv make installcheck to run the extension regression tests.  This is meant to be run from debian/tests/control using autopkgtest. If build-dir is omitted, the top source directory
           is used.

           Other than the other actions which run on the "supported" versions, if debian/control.in exists, this one runs on the "installed" versions as reported by installed-versions.

       Sometimes it is desirable to run extra code per version before invoking the action, in that case the loop over supported versions needs to be in the calling script. To facilitate this mode, actions
       can also be called as action-version. See the installcheck example below.

SUPPORTED VERSIONS
       pg_buildext reads debian/pgversions to decide which PostgreSQL to build modules/extensions for. This file contains one PostgreSQL version number per line, in the following formats:

       all Support all versions. This is recommended unless there are known incompatibilities.

       NN  Support this version.

       NN+ Support this and all greater versions.

       #...
           Comment.

       For a version to be used, it must also be listed in the output of /usr/share/postgresql-common/supported-versions. See this file for how to configure the list of supported versions on your system.

EXAMPLE
       debian/control.in:
             Source: postgresql-foobar
             Build-Depends: debhelper, postgresql-server-dev-all (>= 153~)

             Package: postgresql-PGVERSION-foobar
             Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, postgresql-PGVERSION

       debian/pgversions:
             all

             # alternatives:
             #9.6
             #11+

       debian/rules:
             #!/usr/bin/make -f

             include /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgxs_debian_control.mk

             # omit this if the package does not use autoconf
             override_dh_auto_configure:
                     +pg_buildext configure build-%v "--libdir=/usr/lib/postgresql/%v/lib --datadir=/usr/share/postgresql-%v-foobar"

             override_dh_auto_build:
                     +pg_buildext build build-%v

             override_dh_auto_test:
                     # nothing to do here, see debian/tests/* instead

             override_dh_auto_install:
                     +pg_buildext install build-%v postgresql-%v-foobar

             override_dh_installdocs:
                     dh_installdocs --all README.*

             override_dh_auto_clean:
                     +pg_buildext clean build-%v

             %:
                     dh $@

       debian/tests/control:
             Depends: @, postgresql-server-dev-all
             Tests: installcheck
             Restrictions: allow-stderr

       debian/tests/control.in: (optional)
             Depends: @, postgresql-contrib-PGVERSION, postgresql-PGVERSION-bar
             Tests: installcheck
             Restrictions: allow-stderr

       debian/tests/installcheck:
             #!/bin/sh
             pg_buildext installcheck
             # alternatively: pg_buildext installcheck build-%v

             # Running extra code before invoking the actual action:
             set -e
             for v in $(pg_buildext installed-versions); do
                     test -L build-$v/sql || ln -s ../sql build-$v/
                     test -L build-$v/expected || ln -s ../expected build-$v/
                     pg_buildext installcheck-$v build-$v
             done

SOURCE DIRECTORY
       If the package source code is not in the top level directory (i.e. the directory which has debian/ as subdirectory), use the src-dir argument, where src-dir must be an absolute path. Example:

         override_dh_auto_build:
                 +pg_buildext build $(CURDIR)/postgresql-module build-%v
