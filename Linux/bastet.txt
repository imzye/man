NAME
       bastet - Tetris(r) clone with "bastard" block-choosing AI

SYNOPSIS
       bastet

DESCRIPTION
       bastet  (short for "bastard tetris") is a Tetris(r) clone which tries to give you the worst possible block. Playing bastet can be a painful experience, especially if you usually make "canyons" and
       wait for the long I-shaped block.

USAGE
       bastet tries to conform as much as possible to the tetris guidelines. We refer to those for the rules of the game. In the starting menu, you can configure the key bindings; the default ones are:

       DOWN   moves the tetromino down (one single step)

       LEFT   moves the tetromino left

       RIGHT  moves the tetromino right

       SPACE  rotates CW

       UP     rotates CCW

       ENTER  drops the tetromino as far down as possible (hard drop)

       P      pauses the game

       CTRL+C exits the game without any further prompt

PLAYING MODES
       The game includes two playing modes. In the second one (harder), you do not get the preview of the next tetromino, and the algorithm is modified to take advantage of this.
