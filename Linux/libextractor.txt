DESCRIPTION
       GNU libextractor is a simple library for keyword extraction.  libextractor does not support all formats but supports a simple plugging mechanism such that you can quickly add extractors for additional
       formats,  even without recompiling libextractor.  libextractor typically ships with dozens of plugins that can be used to obtain meta data from common file-types.  If you want to write your own plugin
       for some filetype, all you need to do is write a little library that implements a single method with this signature:

        void EXTRACTOR_XXX_extract_method (struct EXTRACTOR_ExtractContext *ec);

       ec contains function pointers for reading, seeking, getting the overall file size and returning meta data.  There is also a field with options for the plugin.  New plugins will  be  automatically  lo‐
       cated and used once they are installed in the respective directory (typically something like /usr/lib/libextractor/).

       The application extract gives an example how to use libextractor.

       The basic use of libextractor is to load the plugins (for example with EXTRACTOR_plugin_add_defaults), then to extract the keyword list using EXTRACTOR_extract, and finally unloading the plugins (with
       EXTRACTOR_plugin_remove_all).

       Textual meta data obtained from libextractor is supposed to be UTF-8 encoded if the text encoding is known.   Plugins  are  supposed  to  convert  meta-data  to  UTF-8  if  necessary.     The  EXTRAC‐
       TOR_meta_data_print function converts the UTF-8 keywords to the character set from the current locale before printing them.
