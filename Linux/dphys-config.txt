NAME
       dphys-config - daily auto-install/update and/or remove config files

SYNOPSIS
       dphys-config [-f filter] [-cqvD]

       dphys-config -h

DESCRIPTION
       dphys-config  installs/updates  and/or removes config files. It also triggers commands after an new/updated config file is available or before an existing config file will disappear. It can be run
       by hand, from cron and/or from init.d.

       Get an list of config files from an configuration server. For each file in the list retrieve that file from the same server, and only install it if it is new or changed relative to what is already
       here. If a file is newly installed (or changed) then run an postinstall script, which may trigger actions which are wanted to process the new config (such as inserting data  from  an  config  file
       into an database). Also remove unwanted files. If doing so first run an preremove script to tidy up stuff.

       This is part of the D-PHYS (ETH Zuerich, Departement of Physics) automatic system operation and maintenance setup.

OPTIONS
       -c     configname: Use this set of config files instead of hostname set. Useful for chroot or vhost installs, or for tests.

       -f  filter
              filter: Only process lines which match the filter spec.

       -q     quiet: Don't produce an running report of activities.

       -v     verbose: Give large volume output, where sensible.

       -D     Debug: Activate an debug option. See source for how to use this.

       -h     help: Output help text, and then abort operation.

CONFIG
       The config files /etc/dphys-config (sitewide) and ~/.dphys-config (personal) allow the admin and users to set up the working environment for dphys-config.

       These  config  files  are sh script fragments full of assignments, which are sourced, in above row, later config files assignments overriding earlier ones.  Standard sh syntax rules apply. Assign‐
       ments are:

       CONF_TMP_DIR
              Sets the base directory in which all temporary files are stored. It defaults to /var/tmp (for enough size and safe operation). Some users may like to use /tmp for higher  speed  (tmpfs)  or
              automatic deletion at boot time.  Standard sh syntax rules apply. Assignments are:

       CONF_BASEURL
              Sets  the  base URL to which all */<hostname>/<filename> combinations are added when wget-ing config files. This can be an http: or ftp: or whatever other type of URL which wget understands
              and can fetch an file from. Additionally it can be an file: (this may be from an NFS server) URL, in which case wget is bypassed and the files fetched directly using cp. It defaults to  the
              error  message  generating  and aborting invalid setting of http://not-configured-server.example.net/not/configured/directory, as there is no sensible default possible. You must set this to
              where ever your config files should be taken from.

       CONF_CONFNAME
              Selects the name for which set of configuration files shall be used for this host. Defaults to `hostname`.

       CONF_LINEFILTER
              Sets an regexp which selects which lines from the config file list are processed. Defaults to .* (all).

       CONF_LOG_DONE
              Log to syslog that dphys-config has run. Good to see if cron and/or init.d have done their job. Defaults to yes.

       The config file list dphys-config.list, which is found via above settings, and is downloaded to /etc/dphys-config.list or ~/.dphys-config.list, then allows the admin to list what config files  are
       to  be  fetched  and  installed/updated  or  removed, and what scripts to run for them. These can be each given for the entire site (= all hosts) and/or group and/or each host, or even merged from
       site+group+host subsections.

FILES
       /etc/dphys-config
              site admin config

       ~/.dphys-config
              users personal config

       /etc/dphys-config.list
              roots config file list gets stored here

       ~/.dphys-config.list
              users config file list gets stored here

       $CONF_BASEURL/`hostname`/dphys-config.list
              site-global (all hosts) common (usually, or group-global or host specific) config file list

       $CONF_BASEURL/`hostname`/dphys-config.list.*
              facultative host-specific (usually) or group-specific include-able subsection(s) to be added to above config file list dphys-config.list. We often use *.group (one per group of  users)  and
              *.host (per host), sometimes also *.base (all host types) and *.workstation (only workstation hosts) subsections $CONF_BASEURL/`hostname`/<file-name> actual config files referred to in con‐
              fig file list, common section (usually the only section) $CONF_BASEURL/`hostname`/<file-name>.*  facultative host-specific (usually) or group-specific include-able subsection(s) to be added
              to above config file <file-name>

CONFIG FILE LIST
       The config file list to be used for checking what files need to be installed/updated or removed and its subsections included by #@include lines are merged to one list file, analog to cpp #include.

       These  are  all  fetched via wget (or cp for file:), adding their names to the user-defined base URL in CONF_BASEURL, and then merged. So CONF_BASEURL can be any URL that wget understands http: or
       ftp: or whatever else, or file:.

       The format of the resulting concatenated file must consist of lines, one per config file, of following format:

       file-name:place-on-target:command-to-trigger

       Where the 3 fields have following meanings:

              file-name
                     Name of the config file to be installed/updated. Must be only the base part of the filename on the server, without URL and hostname before it, and without any .*  subsection  endings
                     after it, as these are all auto-added whenever they are needed. If this is set to - the line specifies an config file to be removed

              place-on-target
                     Full  directory  or full filename (directory+filename) of where the file is to be placed on the target system. If only an directory is given (any name that ends in /), then the above
                     file-name (inclusive any directories in it) will be automatically added to it. For removing this must be the full filename (or an directory name (without an /) if an entire directory
                     and its contents shall disappear). An directory name ending with / is not processed, to prevent incomplete edits (filename replaced by -, but not added to directory) from killing en‐
                     tire directories (such as say all of /etc/ :-))

              command-to-trigger
                     Full command (directory+filename, with parameters) of an command to be run, after this config file has been newly installed or changed/updated, or before this config file is removed.
                     This can also be multiple commands separated by ; separators. Useful for doing chown/chmod to files that need it. If the marker {} appears in the command, this will be substituted by
                     the filename the config file is going to be installed as. This is analog to find -exec filename substitution

       Lines which begin with an # are regarded as comments, and don't have any effect anything (Lines extended with one are chopped off at that point). The same applies for empty lines.

PREPROCESSOR
       If the first line of the config file list, or any config file fetched on its behalf, has the special format #@dphys-config-preprocess [action...] then this line will be stripped, and the  rest  of
       the file will be preprocessed. Depending on the list of actions present and their order (repeats are allowed) the file will be processed. Valid actions are:

              backtick
                     Anything inside backticks (``) will be executed as a command, and its stdout will then be substituted for the `` expression. This is analog to sh backtick substitution

              if     For  any  line beginning with #@if the stuff between the #@if and the first ; character will be executed as command, and if it returns true, everything after the ; will be left, else
                     the entire line will be removed. This is analog to shell if ... ; conditional execution

              include
                     For any line beginning with #@include the rest of the line is regarded as an subsection name, which will be added to the base filename, and then the resulting subsection file fetched
                     (also by wget or cp) and substituted for the line. This is analog to an C preprocessor #include oder an shell .  include

EXAMPLES
       The following allows you to fetch all your config file lists from an HTTP VirtualHost called www.admin.example.net under its subdirectory dphys-config.

       In file /etc/dphys-config, on every host, so it can find the config file server:

       # system will use ${CONF_BASEURL}/`hostname`/<file-name>*
       CONF_BASEURL=http://www.admin.example.net/dphys-config

       We advise using an subdirectory here, because other /http://www.admin.example.net/* directories may already contain other admin stuff you put on the same VirtualHost. Such  as  software  packages,
       site news, etc.

       For dphys-config to be useful you then need to make config file lists for it.  And provide the actual config files that can be installed, driven by the lists.  This is the largest job, as it basi‐
       cally amounts to extracting all your relevant config work from your site. Also known as reengineering your site.

       Assuming  your  VirtualHost  on  www.admin.example.net  has  as  its  DocumentRoot /vhost/www.admin, you would then begin with an pseudo-host Directory for site-global common stuff: /vhost/www.ad‐
       min/dphys-config/SITE/.

       If your hosts are organised in groups with group-global common configs (such as professors, students, staff), make an pseudo-host for each group, such as: /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/PROFS/  and
       */STUDENTS/ and */STAFF/.

       Then  for  host  specific  stuff,  assuming  systems  called  prof1.example.com  to  prof3.example.com,  stud1  to  stud20,  staff1 to staff5, server1 and server2, make for each its own directory:
       /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/prof1/ (and so on).

       Note that we suggest using CAPITALS for pseudo-hosts and lowercase for actual hosts. This avoids name space collisions. You can also use loops like for host in [a-z]* ; do ... ; done to work  (say
       generating symlinks to an new config file in all hosts). Well at least you can do this so long no one goes and sets LANGUAGE= or similar junk, then bash (or libc?) will hapily screw up case sensi‐
       tivity and produce random lossage (yes, it was painfull).

       After  this  add  to  /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/SITE/,  the  actual  config  files  as far as they are not host specific, or at least have an common section to all hosts. Example this would be
       /etc/hosts for all, an common section for /etc/motd, common or all for sendmail.cf, common for inetd.conf, nothing for the ssh hostkeys.

       Then add, to an group, say /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/STUDENTS/, whatever is specific to that group. Example this may be an entire  special  motd  for  the  many  changing  users,  or  just  an
       motd.group to #@include into the common one.

       Then  for  each host in its /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/prof1/ (or so) add all that is specific to it. Such as its ssh key files. And its own motd.host, it it needs one. Same its inetd.conf.host
       if it is going to offer special stuff. An configs for services only this host has such as httpd.conf.

       Then for each host add symlinks to the SITE or group versions that it is to use for common stuff, like on /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/stud1/:

        .../dphys-config/stud1/dphys-config.list -> ../SITE/dphys-config.list
        .../dphys-config/stud1/hosts -> ../SITE/hosts
        .../dphys-config/stud1/inetd.conf -> ../SITE/inetd.conf
        .../dphys-config/stud1/motd -> ../SITE/motd
        .../dphys-config/stud1/motd.group -> GROUP/motd
        .../dphys-config/stud1/GROUP -> ../STUDENTS
        .../dphys-config/stud1/sendmail.cf -> ../SITE/sendmail.cf

       In the /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/SITE/ directory place the site-global common dphys-config.list for all your hosts, containing stuff like this:

       # SITE dphys-config.list - just example stuff, for our exemplaric site
       # basics
       hosts:/etc/                      # simply works, no command
       motd:/etc/                       # this will be assembled group specific
       inetd.conf:/etc/:/etc/init.d/inetd restart  # needs an command to reload
       sendmail.cf:/etc/mail/:/etc/init.d/sendmail restart  # not in /etc
       # ssh restart only after last file, and ensure file modes for each file
       ssh_host_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {}
       ssh_host_rsa_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {}
       ssh_host_dsa_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {}; /etc/init.d/sshd restart
       # load stuff into an existing database file
       seed.debconf:/etc/:debconf-set-selections {}
       # other stuff
       daemon1-conf:/etc/daemon1/conf   # rename so names can differ on server
       daemon2-conf:/etc/daemon2/conf
       daemon1/conf:/etc/               # same as above, but with directories on server
       daemon2/conf:/etc/
       testing:/etc/                    # put something in there for an test
       # delete some stuff
       -:/etc/testing                   # change to above test to get rid of it again
       -:/etc/                          # you will get a warning if you leave this
       #-:/etc                          # you would reinstall your system after the resulting  rm -rf /etc  :-)
       # and some errors
       #only-an-name                    # you would get an error: no place on target
       #only-an-name:                   # you would get an error: no place on target
       #:only-an-place                  # you would get an error: no file to install

       For special services add an dphys-config.list.host on each host that has special config files not present on others, such as on /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/server2/:

       # server2 dphys-config.list.host - only used on our web server
       httpd.conf:/etc/apache/httpd.conf:/etc/init.d/apache restart

       You can also use dphys-config to run arbitrary commands, whenever config files are installed/updated or removed, to modify existing config files, or more likely  modify  complex  config  databases
       which can not be provided as files, but where one can provide edit info as files.

       dphys-config can even install scripts to use as above commands (or even just to run scripts while installing), such as into /usr/local/sbin/.

       For  this make an ../SITE/local/sbin/ directory, place the scripts in there (such as ../SITE/local/sbin/dphys-config-<whatever>), and symlink local to ../SITE/local on each host, and then add con‐
       fig lines for the scripts, with the command to trigger them, giving something like this:

       local/sbin/dphys-config-<whatever>:/usr/:chmod 755 {}; {}  # chmod and run

       It this script processes an config file your will want it to be run if either the script or the config file is updated, so add the script to the laters line as well:

       dphys-config-<whatever>:/etc/:if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/dphys-config-<whatever> ] ; then /usr/local/sbin/dphys-config-<whatever> ; fi  # run also here

       Finally, new hosts can then later simply be added, by making the new hosts directory and copying all files and symlinks from an existing host of the same group. Such as by doing:

       mkdir student21
       tar -cf - -C student1 . | tar xpf - -C student21

       To then run dphys-config by hand (say for tests), type on the host:

       dphys-config

       But usually you will want to run dphys-config automatically, every night (or if a machine was/is switched off, at every boot), to keep your configs up to date.

       For nightly updates the best thing is to use an cron job on every host. 03:00 to 03:59 is most likely idle time. Use an line like this one, with the cron option to avoid an load peak on the config
       file server, by random delaying the run by 0..3599 seconds, and with stdout and strerr thrown away to avoid getting an mail from every host, as error messages are also allways sent to syslog:

       0 3 * * * root dphys-config cron > /dev/null 2>&1

       To catch machines switched off over night, with no cron run on them, also run an init.d script. Use an script like this one, also with stdout and stderr thrown away to avoid cluttering  your  boot
       console output:

       #!/bin/sh
       # /etc/init.d/dphys-config - boot time automatic config updates, if no cron
       case "$1" in
         start)
           dphys-config init > /dev/null 2>&1
           ;;
       esac
       exit 0

SECURITY
       If  dphys-config  is  to  be used to distribute all config files, this will also include files which are security relevant, such as ssh private keys (host key or (root) user authentification), SSL
       certificates, passwd and shadow, lilo.conf, software license keys, etc.

       As all files are most likely fetched from an http: URL, measures must be taken to secure the config website from other people downloading them. We here use an restriction to only IP addresses reg‐
       istered as hosts in our NIS server, and additionally run identd on all allowed hosts, and require the wget process opening the HTTP connection to be running by  user  root,  and  so  also  require
       dphys-config to run as root.

       To avoid sniffing it is recommended to give wget an https: URL.

GOTCHAS
       Config files are read by wget from an webserver, so they lose their owners and modes. So the commands triggered on their lines must be used to chown/chmod them to proper values.

       When  used  together  with  dphys-admin, dphys-config should run as first (earlier cron and init.d entries). This is needed to provide configs before new packages are installed, so dphys-admin can
       pretend that the packages were already once installed (and then non-purge removed), and so prevent questions on install, which is required for unattended installs. [Note that this pretending  does
       not go as far as setting debconf up. Broken packages that ignore config files and only look at debconf will still ask questions.]

       As  result  of  this,  when  installing for the first time on an new system (such as installing Debian by the dphys3 end2stage feature, which installs first dphys-config and then dphys-admin), any
       scripts installed by packages by dphys-admin, to be called on config file install/update will still be missing, and so not runnable. Either ignore the warnings, or better call the scripts by some‐
       thing like this:

       file:place:if [ -x script ]; then script; fi

       Note that in this case, trying to run dphys-config for a second time after dphys-admin has installed packages and scripts, will not automatically mend this, as the config files have  not  changed,
       and  so  dphys-config  will  not (re-)run their scripts. Therefore packages containing such scripts must also, as part of their postinst (or init.d which is called by postinst), check for existing
       config files and then run their scripts. This is the normal behaviour of quite a few packages anyway. Of course this requires the scripts to be idempotent, which is official Debian policy anyway.
