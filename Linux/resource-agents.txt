NAME
       ocf_heartbeat_SendArp - Broadcasts unsolicited ARP announcements

SYNOPSIS

       SendArp [start | stop | monitor | meta-data | validate-all]

DESCRIPTION
       This RA can be used _instead_ of the IPaddr2 or IPaddr RA to send gratuitous ARP for an IP address on a given interface, without adding the address to that interface. For example, if for some
       reason you wanted to send gratuitous ARP for addresses managed by IPaddr2 or IPaddr on an additional interface.

SUPPORTED PARAMETERS
       ip
           The IP address for sending ARP packet.

           (required, string, no default)

       nic
           The NIC for sending ARP packet.

           (required, string, no default)

       background
           Send ARPs in background. Set to false if you want to test if sending ARPs succeeded.

           (optional, boolean, default true)
