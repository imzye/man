NAME
       sup-recover-sources - rebuild a lost Sup source configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       sup-recover-sources [options] [source uri...]

DESCRIPTION
       Rebuilds a lost sources.yaml file by reading messages from a list of sources and determining, for each source, the most prevalent `source_id' field of messages from that source in the index.

       The only non-deterministic component to this is that if the same message appears in multiple sources, those sources may be mis-diagnosed by this program.

       If the first N messages (--scan-num below) all have the same source_id in the index, the source will be added to sources.yaml.  Otherwise, the distribution will be printed, and you will have to add it
       by hand.

       The offset pointer into the sources will be set to the end of the source, so you will have to run sup-import --rebuild for each new source after doing this.

OPTIONS
       --unusual
              Mark sources as `unusual'.  Only usual sources will be polled by hand (default: false)

       --archive
              Mark sources as `archive'.  New messages from these sources will not appear in the inbox (default: false)

       --scan-num N
              Number of messages to scan per source (default: 10)

       -h, --help
              Show help message

FILES
       $HOME/.sup/sources.yaml
              Configuration file for Sup mail sources
