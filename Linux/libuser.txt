NAME
       libuser.conf - configuration for libuser and libuser utilities

FILE FORMAT
       libuser.conf is a text file.  Leading and trailing white space on each line is ignored.  Lines starting with # are ignored.

       The file defines variables grouped into sections.  Each section starts with a section header:
              [section name]
       A single section header can appear more than once in the file.

       The lines following a section header define variables from that section:
              variable = value
       The value can be empty.

       A variable can have more than one value, specified by using more than one line defining that variable.  All currently defined variables accept only the first value and ignore the others, if any.

[defaults]
       create_modules
              A  list  of  module  names  to use when creating user or group entries, unless the application specifies a different list.  The module names in the list can be separated using space, tab or
              comma.  Default value is files shadow.

       crypt_style
              The algorithm to use for password encryption when creating new passwords.  The current algorithm may be retained when changing a password of an existing user, depending on the application.

              Possible values are des, md5, blowfish, sha256, sha512, and yescrypt, all case-insensitive.  Unrecognized values are treated as des.  Default value is des.

       hash_rounds_min, hash_rounds_max
              These variables specify an inclusive range of hash rounds used when crypt_style is sha256 or sha512.  A number of hash rounds is chosen from this interval  randomly.   A  larger  number  of
              rounds  makes  password  checking,  and  brute-force  attempts  to  guess  the password by reversing the hash, more CPU-intensive.  The number of rounds is restricted to the interval [1000,
              999999999].

              If only one of the above variables is specified, the number of rounds used is specified by the other variable.  If neither variable is specified, the number of rounds is chosen by libc.

       mailspooldir
              The directory containing user's mail spool files.  Default value is /var/mail.

       moduledir
              The directory containing libuser modules.  Default value uses the modules installed with libuser, corresponding to  the  architecture  of  the  libuser  library,  e.g.  /usr/lib/libuser  or
              /usr/lib64/libuser (assuming libuser was configured with --prefix=/usr).

       modules
              A  list of module names to use when not creating user or group entries, unless the application specifies a different list.  The module names in the list can be separated using space, tab or
              comma.  Default value is files shadow.

       skeleton
              The directory containing files to copy to newly created home directories.  Default value is /etc/skel.

[import]
       login_defs
              A path to the login.defs file from shadow.  If this variable is defined, the variables from the named file are used in place of some libuser  variables.   Variables  explicitly  defined  in
              libuser.conf are not affected by contents of login.defs.

              The following variables are imported:

       default_useradd             │
              A path to the default/useradd file from useradd in shadow.  If this variable is defined, the variables from the named file are used in place of some libuser variables.  Variables explicitly
              defined in libuser.conf are not affected by contents of default/useradd.

[userdefaults]                     │
       This section defines attribute values of newly created user entities.  There is one special variable:
                                   │
                                   │
       LU_UIDNUMBER                │
              A decimal number, the│first allowed UID value for regular users (not system users).  Default value is 500.
                                   │
                                   │
       All  other variables have the same names as the attribute names from <libuser/entity.h> and define attribute values.  Either the macro name (e.g. LU_GECOS) or the macro content (e.g. pw_gecos) can
       be used; if both are used, the one appearing later in the configuration file is used.
                                   │
       The % character in the value│of the variable introduces an escape sequence: %n is replaced by the user name, %d is replaced by current date in days since the epoch, %u is replaced  by  the  user's
       UID.  There is no way to escape the % character and avoid this substitution.
                                   │
       After the userdefaults section is processed, modules may define additional attributes or even override the attributes defined in this section.

                                   │
[groupdefaults]                    │
       The groupdefaults section is│similar to userdefaults.  There is one special variable:
                                   │
                                   │
       LU_GIDNUMBER                │
              A decimal number, the│first allowed GID value for regular groups (not system groups).  Default value is 500.
                                   │
                                   │
       The other variables follow the same rules as in the userdefaults section, except that %n and %u are replaced by the group name and group's GID, respectively.
                                   │
       After the groupdefaults section is processed, modules may define additional attributes or even override the attributes defined in this section.

[files]                            │
       Configures the files module,│which manages /etc/group and /etc/passwd.  The configuration variables are probably useful only for libuser development.
                                   │
                                   │
       directory
              The directory containing the group and passwd files.  Default value is /etc.

       nonroot
              Allow module initialization when not invoked as the root user if the value is yes.

       allow_id_duplicates
              Allow to use duplicate uid/gid.The default value is no.

[shadow]
       Configures the files module, which manages /etc/gshadow and /etc/shadow.  The configuration variables are probably useful only for libuser development.

       directory
              The directory containing the gshadow and shadow files.  Default value is /etc.

       nonroot
              Allow module initialization when not invoked as the root user if the value is yes.

[ldap]
       Configures the ldap module, which manages an user database accessible using LDAP.

       userBranch
              The LDAP suffix for user entities.  Default value is ou=People.

       groupBranch
              The LDAP suffix for group entities.  Default value is ou=Group.

       server A  domain  name or an URI of the LDAP server.  The URI can use the ldap, ldapi or the ldaps protocol.  When a simple domain name is used, the connection fails if TLS can not be used; an URI
              using the ldap protocol allows connection without TLS.  TLS is never used with the ldapi protocol.  Default value is ldap.

       basedn The base DN of the server.  Default value is dc=example,dc=com.

       binddn A DN for binding to the server.  If the value is empty or binding using this DN fails, a DN of uid=user,userBranch,basedn is used, where userBranch and basedn are variables from  this  sec‐
              tion and user is the user name of the invoking user, unless overridden by the user variable from this section.  Default value is cn=manager,dc=example,dc=com.

       user   The SASLv2 identity for authenticating to the LDAP server, also overrides the user name for generating a bind DN.  Default value is the name of the invoking user.

       password
              The password used for a simple bind by default.  If not specified, there is no default and the user must supply the password each time.

              IT  IS  STRONGLY  RECOMMENDED  NOT TO STORE A PASSWORD IN THE SYSTEM-WIDE /etc/libuser.conf FILE.  The configuration file is world-readable by default, and setuid programs that prompt for a
              server name could be used to send the password to an attacker-controlled server.

       authuser
              The SASLv2 authorization user, if non-empty.  Default value is empty.

       bindtype
              The list of bind types to use, separated by commas.  Allowed bind types are simple, sasl, and sasl/mechanism, where mechanism is a SASL mechanism.  The bind types (but not necessarily mech‐
              anism) are case-insensitive.  If more than one bind type is specified, their relative order is ignored.  Default value is simple,sasl.

[sasl]
       Configures the sasl module, which manages a SASLv2 user database.

       appname
              Name of the SASLv2 application.  Default value is empty.

       domain Domain used by libuser for the SASLv2 authentication object.  Default value is empty.

BUGS
       Invalid lines in the configuration file (or the imported shadow configuration files) are silently ignored.

FILES
       /etc/libuser.conf
              The default location of the configuration file. Can be overridden by the LIBUSER_CONF environment variable, except in set-uid or set-gid programs.
