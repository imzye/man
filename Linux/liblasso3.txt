NAME
       LaTeX::ToUnicode::Tables - Character tables for LaTeX::ToUnicode

VERSION
       version 0.11

CONSTANTS
   @LIGATURES
       Standard TeX character sequences (not \commands) which need to be replaced: "---" with U+2014 (em dash), etc.  Includes: em dash, en dash, inverted
       exclamation, inverted question, left double quote, right double quote, left single quote, right single quote.

   @SPECIALS
       Most of TeX's metacharacters, i.e., those for which "\char" typesets char: "$ % & _ { } #". TeX has other special characters which are not included here, for
       instance: "\ ^ ~".

   %COMMANDS
       Names of argument-less commands like "\LaTeX" as keys.  Values are the replacements.

   %SYMBOLS
       Predefined escape commands for extended characters.

   %ACCENTS
       Two-level hash of accented characters like "\'{a}". The keys of this hash are the accent symbols, e.g "`", """ or "'". The corresponding values are
       references to hashes, where the keys are the base letters and the values are the decoded characters. As an example, "$ACCENTS{'`'}->{a} eq 'à'".

   %GERMAN
       Character sequences (not necessarily commands) as defined by the package `german'/`ngerman', e.g. ""a" (a with umlaut), ""s" (german sharp s) or "`" (german
       left quote). Note the missing backslash.

       The keys of this hash are the literal character sequences.

   @MARKUPS
       Command names of formatting commands like "\tt", namely: "bf cal em it rm sc sl small tt".
