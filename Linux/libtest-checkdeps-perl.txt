NAME
       Test::CheckDeps - Check for presence of dependencies

VERSION
       version 0.010

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More 0.94;
        use Test::CheckDeps 0.007;

        check_dependencies();

        done_testing();

DESCRIPTION
       This module adds a test that assures all dependencies have been installed properly. If requested, it can bail out all testing on error.

FUNCTIONS
   check_dependencies( [ level ])
       Check dependencies based on a local MYMETA or META file.

       The "level" argument is optional. It can be one of:

       •   requires

           All 'requires' dependencies are checked (the configure, build, test and runtime phases are always checked, and the develop phase is also tested when AUTHOR_TESTING is set)

       •   classic

           As "requires", but 'conflicts' dependencies are also checked.

       •   recommends

           As "classic", but 'recommends' dependencies are also checked, as TODO tests.

       •   suggests

           As "recommends", but 'suggests' dependencies are also checked, as TODO tests.

       When not provided, "level" defaults to "classic" ('requires' and 'conflicts' dependencies are checked).

   check_dependencies_opts($meta, $phase, $type)
       Check  dependencies  in CPAN::Meta object $meta for phase $phase (configure, build, test, runtime, develop) and type $type(requires, recommends, suggests, conflicts). You probably just want to use
       "check_dependencies" though.
