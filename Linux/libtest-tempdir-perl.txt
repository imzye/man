NAME
       Test::TempDir::Handle - A handle for managing a temporary directory root

VERSION
       version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::TempDir::Handle;

           my $h = Test::TempDir::Handle->new( dir => dir("t/tmp") );

           $h->empty;

           # ...

           $h->cleanup; # will delete on success by default

DESCRIPTION
       This class manages a temporary directory.

ATTRIBUTES
   "dir"
       The Path::Class::Dir that is being managed.

   "lock"
       No longer used.

   "cleanup_policy"
       One of "success", "always" or "never".

       "success" means that "cleanup" deletes only if "test_builder" says the tests have passed.

   "test_builder"
       The Test::Builder singleton.

METHODS
   "empty"
       Cleans out the directory but doesn't delete it.

   "delete"
       Cleans out the directory and removes it.

   "cleanup"
       Calls "delete" if the "cleanup_policy" dictates to do so.

       This is normally called automatically at destruction.
