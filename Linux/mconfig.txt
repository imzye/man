Mono(mconfig)                                                    Mono(mconfig)

NAME
       mconfig, - Utility for modifying .NET configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       mconfig [options] command [command_parameters]

DESCRIPTION
       mconfig  can  be used to edit .NET configuration files, by adding "fea‐
       tures" (that is sets of xml statements) defined in one  of  the  config
       files  read  by  mconfig.  The  config  file can also define layouts of
       default configuration files, which may be useful for bootstrapping your
       .NET projects.

       To see the list of recognized commands, default configuration files and
       features, run mconfig without passing any parameters.

OPTIONS
       -c <config_file>, --config=<config_file>
              Read the specified config file after reading the other,  precon‐
              figured, config files for the utility. Settings in the specified
              file override those found in the other configuration locations.

       -t {any | web | application}, --target={any | web | application}
              Features and default configuration files defined in the  mconfig
              config file(s) can be assigned to one of the three targets - web
              (for ASP.NET features/config  files),  application  -  for  .NET
              applications,  any - applicable in both of the previous targets.
              Defaults to any.

       -?, -h, --help
              Show a summary usage screen.

       -v, --version
              Show the mconfig version

COMMANDS
       {addfeature, af} <feature_name> [config_file_path]
              Adds the feature named <feature_name> to  the  specified  config
              file.  If  [config_file_path] is omitted, the name of the output
              configuration file will be chosen based on the  selected  target
              (see  the  -t  option).  The web target outputs configuration to
              file named Web.config, and the  application  target  outputs  to
              file  named application.exe.config. The any target does not have
              a default output file.

              If the  specified  config  file  exists,  the  feature  will  be
              injected  into it at the locations specified by mconfig configu‐
              ration. If the target config file does not  exist,  it  will  be
              created  and will contain only the specified feature and all its
              dependencies.

       {defaultconfig, dc} [config_name [target_directory]]
              Generates a default config file using  the  configuration  entry
              named [config_name] and outputs the resulting configuration file
              to the directory given by  the  [target_directory]  option.   If
              [config_name]  is omitted, it defaults to Web.config for the web
              target and application target. The any target does  not  specify
              any default output configuration name. If the [target_directory]
              parameter is omitted, it defaults to the current directory.

              Name of the output config file created in [target_directory]  is
              given in the config file layout definition.

FILES
       Config  files  are  read in the order given below. Each subsequent file
       may override settings found in the files read before it.

       $prefix/etc/mono/mconfig/config.xml
              The default configuration file, distributed with mconfig.  $pre‐
              fix is the mconfig installation prefix specified on the compila‐
              tion time.

       $config_dir/mconfig/config.xml
              $config_dir is the directory specified  in  the  XDG_CONFIG_HOME
              environment variable or,
               if  it is empty, in the .config directory located in the user's
              home directory. This file is not distributed with Mono.

       ./mconfig.xml
              Local configuration file which can contain per-application  set‐
              tings.
