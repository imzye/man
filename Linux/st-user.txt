NAME
       st-user - st reconfiguration helper and launcher script

SYNOPSIS
       st-user

DESCRIPTION
       st-user is a helper script for running and reconfiguring st if neccessarry.

       Running st-user starts the Fedora build by default.  If you wish to customize your configuration, put your st configuration header file to $HOME/.st/config.h and adjust it according to your needs. The
       official Fedora configuration file might be a useful template.  See the FILES section of this manual.

       Every time the user configuration file has changed or new patches have been added, st-user will rebuild the user st binary prior to its execution.

       Fedora utilizes alternatives to choose whether the system build, also installed as st-fedora, or the custom build is run.  If available, custom builds are preferred.
