NAME
       simstring - build database and find similar words

SYNOPSIS
       simstring [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       This  utility finds strings in the database (DB) such that they have similarity, in the similarity measure (SIM), no smaller than the threshold (TH) with queries read from STDIN. When -b (--build)
       option is specified, this utility builds a database (DB) for strings read from STDIN.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the Info files.

       -b, --build
              build a database for strings read from STDIN

       -d, --database=DB
              specify a database file

       -u, --unicode
              use Unicode (wchar_t) for representing characters

       -n, --ngram=N
              specify the unit of n-grams (DEFAULT=3)

       -m, --mark
              include marks for begins and ends of strings

       -s, --similarity=SIM
              pecify a similarity measure (DEFAULT='cosine'):

              exact     exact match
              dice      dice coefficient
              cosine]   cosine coefficient
              jaccard   jaccard coefficient
              overlap   overlap coefficient

       -t, --threshold=TH
              specify the threshold (DEFAULT=0.7)

       -e, --echo-back
              echo back query strings to the output

       -q, --quiet
              suppress supplemental information from the output

       -b, --benchmark
              show benchmark result (retrieved strings are suppressed)

       -v, --version
              show this version information and exit

       -h, --help
              show summary of options and exit
