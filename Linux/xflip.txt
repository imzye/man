NAME
       xflip, meltdown - astonish your friends with interesting X effects

SYNOPSIS
       xflip [-planes] [-vert] [-oblic] [-fast | -random] [-times number] [-display displayname]
       meltdown [-planes] [-display displayname] [-delay x] [-wait n | -wait 0]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xflip, and meltdown commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because the original pro‐
       gram does not have a manual page.

       The programs play with the X display, producing some interesting effects.  One traditional use of these commands is to have them run and affect someone else's X display, as a practical joke.

OPTIONS
       -display displayname
              The X display to operate on.

       -planes
              Operate on a singleplane at a time.

       -vert  Flip the screen vertically.

       -oblic Flip the screen vertically and horizontally at the same time.

       -random
              Flip small random pieces of the screen instead of the while display.

       -times number
              Specifies the number of pieces of the screen to flip when -random is used.  Default is 300.

       -delay x
              Meltdown may run too fast on fast computers to be fully appreciated; this can be used to slow it down. If specified, every x times the display is updated, a 1 microsecond delay will be
              inserted. The default is no delay at all. Reasonable values for x are in the 20 to 200 range.

       -wait n
              Makes meltdown wait for n seconds after the screen is totally black. If you pass 0 to -wait, it will wait until you press a key or mouse button.
