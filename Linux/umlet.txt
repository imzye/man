NAME
       umlet - simple, text driven UML drawing tool

SYNOPSIS
       umlet [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the umlet command.

       UMLet  is  a  UML  tool aimed at providing a fast way of drawing UML diagrams. UML elements are modified using text input instead of pop-up dialogs. Elements can be modified and used as templates;
       this way, users can easily tailor UMLet to their modeling needs. UMLet supports a variety of UML diagram types: class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, deployment di‐
       agrams, activity diagrams, etc.

       UMLet can only be used for drawing UML diagrams. It does not support code export nor the XMI format. UMLet allows one to export diagrams as images or PDF.
