NAME
       watchman - a file watching service

SYNOPSIS
       watchman [--OPTION ...]  COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       watchman  can recursively watch one or more directory trees (also referred to as roots).  Watchman does not follow symlinks; it knows they exist, but they show up the same as any other file in its
       reporting and it will wait for a root to settle down before it will start to trigger notifications or command execution. Watchman is conservative, preferring to err on the side of caution; it con‐
       siders files to be freshly changed when you start to watch them or when it is unsure. You can query a root for file changes since you last checked, or the current state of the tree.  Watchman  al‐
       lows you to subscribe to file changes that occur in a root.

USAGE
       The  following  example  establishes  a  watch on a source directory and then sets up a trigger named buildme that will run a tool named minify-css whenever a CSS file is changed. The tool will be
       passed a list of the changed filenames.

              watchman watch ~/src

       the single quotes around '*.css' are important:

              watchman -- trigger ~/src buildme '*.css' -- minify-css

       The output for buildme will land in the Watchman log file unless you send it somewhere else.  To use
