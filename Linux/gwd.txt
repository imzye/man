NAME
       gwd - Launches the GeneWeb Process

SYNOPSIS
       gwd [ command-line switches ]

DESCRIPTION
       gwd launches the GeneWeb "daemon" process.  Once this is done, you can attach to it using a web browser to view your genealogical data.
       Connect to the GeneWeb process using a standard web browser using the following:
           http://localhost:2317/base
           http://127.0.0.1:2317/base
           http://address:2317/base
           http://address:port/base
       where "base" is the name of the database file.
       GeneWeb is coded in the functional language Objective CAML, and can be extended with byte-code or compiled code written in that language.

       The primary documentation of gwd is in the HTML , documentation, which you can find in the documentation directory (/usr/share/doc/geneweb on Debian systems).
       Please look there for complete and up-to-date documentation.
