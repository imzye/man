NAME
       wxEDID - Graphical editor for EDID data presented by computer displays

SYNOPSIS
       wxedid [-t] file

DESCRIPTION
       wxEDID is a wxWidgets based editor for Extended Display Identification Data (EDID). It operates on offline files that can be flashed to a monitor using the technique described here.

       This tool can modify the base EDID v1.3+ structure and the CEA/CTA-861-G, as the first extension block. The program also provides a DTD constructor to aid with the selection of suitable timings.

       The tool can import and export EDID data in binary blob and in hexadecimal formats.

ARGUMENT
       As its sole argument, the program accepts a file with EDID information to be edited.

OPTIONS
       -t, --text
              Assume the file argument is a DTD text file (and not binary EDID data)

BUGS
       No known bugs.
