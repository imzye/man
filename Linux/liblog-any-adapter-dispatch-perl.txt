NAME
       Log::Any::Adapter::Dispatch - Adapter to use Log::Dispatch with Log::Any

VERSION
       version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
           use Log::Any::Adapter;

           Log::Any::Adapter->set('Dispatch', outputs => [[ ... ]]);

           my $dispatcher = Log::Dispatch->new( ... );
           Log::Any::Adapter->set('Dispatch', dispatcher => $dispatcher);

DESCRIPTION
       This Log::Any adapter uses Log::Dispatch for logging.

       You may either pass parameters (like outputs) to be passed to "Log::Dispatch->new", or pass a "Log::Dispatch" object directly in the dispatcher parameter.
