NAME
       boolstuff - Disjunctive Normal Form boolean expression C++ library

SYNOPSIS
       g++ prog.cpp -lboolstuff

DESCRIPTION
       boolstuff  is a C++ library that contains an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree into the Disjunctive Normal Form.  The NOT operator is supported.  A C API covers most of the li‐
       brary's functionality.

       The Disjunctive Normal Form is an ORing of ANDed terms.  In other words, if the OR is considered an additive operation and the AND a multiplicative operation, then the DNF is a sum of products.

       For example, the DNF of the expression a&(b|c) is a&b|a&c

       The DNF eliminates parentheses and provides a normalized form of the original expression.  This normalized form is easier to execute.

       The DNF produced by BoolStuff is devoid of any "useless" terms, which are always false (e.g., x&y&!x), but the terms that form the DNF are not necessarily simplified (e.g., x&y&x).  When executing
       an expression in DNF, it is recommended to obtain the list of terms and then to obtain the set of variables used in each term.  In the case of the term x&y&x, the set will only contain x once.

EXAMPLES
       The library's source archive comes with an example program (in the 'examples' subdirectory) and with two testing programs (in the src/boolstuff subdirectory).

BUGS
       Version 0.1.x is an unstable development version.  The programming interface of the library and the command-line options of the accompanying commands are not necessarily fixed.  The  documentation
       has not been reviewed for completeness.

HISTORY
       George  Boole  (1815-1864) is an English mathematician who helped establish modern symbolic logic and whose algebra of logic, now called Boolean algebra, is basic to the design of digital computer
       circuits.
