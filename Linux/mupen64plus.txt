NAME
     mupen64plus — console front‐end for the Mupen64Plus N64 emulator

SYNOPSIS
     mupen64plus [parameters] romfile

DESCRIPTION
     mupen64plus is a plugin‐based N64 emulator for Linux/Unix, OSX, and Windows which is capable of accurately playing many games.  Included are four MIPS R4300 CPU emulators, with dynamic recompilers for
     32‐bit x86 and 64‐bit amd64 systems, and necessary plugins for audio, graphical rendering (RDP), signal co‐processor (RSP), and input.  There are several OpenGL video plugins available:

     •   Rice, included with the distribution

     •   Glide64Mk2, included with the distribution

     •   Arachnoid: https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-video-arachnoid

     •   Glide64: https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-video-glide64 (old)

     •   Z64: https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-video-z64 (must be used with the rsp-z64 plugin)

     The most current documentation can be found at the project’s homepage: https://code.google.com/p/mupen64plus/

     The options are as follows:

     -h, --help

     --datadir directory
        Specifies a directory to search for shared data files (fonts, cheat codes, .ini files).  Default is ${PREFIX}/share/mupen64plus/.

     --plugindir directory
        Specifies a directory to search for plugin files.  Default is ${PREFIX}/lib/mupen64plus/.

     --sshotdir directory
        Specifies a directory to save screenshots captured during gameplay.  Default is ~/.local/share/mupen64plus/screenshot/.

     --gfx plugin‐spec

     --audio plugin‐spec
        Specifies a plugin‐spec to select an audio plugin for use during emulation.

     --input plugin‐spec
        Specifies a plugin‐spec to select an input plugin for use during emulation.

     --rsp plugin‐spec

     --nosaveoptions
        Do not save the given command‐line options into the mupen64plus configuration file to use as defaults in the future.
