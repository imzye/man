NAME
       debbugs-dbhash - migrate a debbugs database to hashed format

SYNOPSIS
       debbugs-dbhash old-db-directory new-db-directory

DESCRIPTION
       debbugs-dbhash converts an old-style flat debbugs database into a new-style hashed-directory debbugs database, for use with debbugs 2.4 and above.

       The old database is simply copied, and otherwise left untouched.  The directory given for the new database must not already exist.

       In  the  hashed  format, files with names of the form 1023.log are now stored as 23/1023.log instead.  This improves performance on many filesystems for debbugs installations with large numbers of
       bug reports.

WARNINGS
       debbugs-dbhash will print a warning message for each file whose name is of a form that cannot be hashed as above.  Typical debbugs installations will have a few of these, usually index  files  and
       the like.

AUTHORS
       Adam Heath is primarily responsible for the hashed directory support in debbugs.  Colin Watson wrote debbugs-dbhash and this man page.
