NAME
       jigdo-lite - Download jigdo files using wget

SYNOPSIS
       jigdo-lite [ URL ]

DESCRIPTION
       See jigdo-file(1) for an introduction to Jigsaw Download.

       Given the URL of a `.jigdo' file, jigdo-lite downloads the large file (e.g. a CD image) that has been made available through that URL.  wget(1) is used to download the necessary pieces of adminis‐
       trative data (contained in the `.jigdo' file and a corresponding `.template' file) as well as the many pieces that the large file is made from. The jigdo-file(1) utility is used to reconstruct the
       large file from the pieces.

       `.jigdo' files that contain references to Debian mirrors are treated specially: When such a file is recognized, you are asked to select one mirror out of a list of all Debian mirrors.

       If URL is not given on the command line, the script prompts for a location to download the `.jigdo' file from. The following command line options are recognized:

       -h --help
              Output short summary of command syntax.

       -v --version
              Output version number.

       --scan FILES
              Do not ask for "Files to scan", use this path.

       --noask
              Do  not  ask  any  questions, instead behave as if the user had pressed Return at all prompts. This can be useful when running jigdo-lite from cron jobs or in other non-interactive environ‐
              ments.
