NAME
       oggfwd — pipe an Ogg stream from stdin to an Icecast server

SYNOPSIS
       oggfwd [-hp] [-m metadata file] [-d description] [-g genre] [-n name] [-u URL] [-T TLS mode] address port password mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       The oggfwd utility acts as a minimal source client for Icecast servers.  It reads an Ogg stream from stdin and forwards it to a server specified on the command line.

       The address, port, password and mountpoint arguments are mandatory and have to be given in that order.

   Optional command line parameters
       -m metadata file
               Sets a file holding stream meta data.

       -d description
               Set the stream description.

       -g genre
               Set the stream genre.

       -h      Print a short usage summay.

       -n name
               Set the stream (i.e. radio) name.

       -p      Allow the stream to be made public in stream directories.

       -u URL  Set the stream URL.

       -T TLS mode
               This  sets  the  TLS  (encryption) mode. Valid values are "disabled" (no encryption), "auto" (any encryption if available), "auto_no_plain" (any encryption), "rfc2818" (encryption based on
               RFC2818) and "rfc2817" (encryption based on RFC2817). For most users the default mode "auto" should work just fine.

       oggfwd reacts to the hangup signal, SIGHUP, by printing the amount of bytes read from stdin to stdout at the next given opportunity.  How fast it reacts depends on the stream's current bitrate.

EXAMPLES
       To forward a public Ogg stream with the name “Test radio” to an Icecast server, one would pipe that stream to an oggfwd command line such as

           oggfwd -p -n "Test radio" radio.example.com 8000 password /stream.ogg

       Encode an Ogg Vorbis stream, dump it to disk and stream it at the same time:

           oggenc - < input.wav | tee streamdump.ogg \
               | oggfwd radio.example.com 8000 password /stream.ogg

CAVEATS
       Since the password to the Icecast server is given in clear text on the command line, other (local) users will probably be able to see it very easily.
