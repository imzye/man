NAME
       testdbfawk - scan dbfawk files for matching dbf file for map rendering in xastir

SYNOPSIS
       testdbfawk [-f file.awk| -D dir] -d file.dbf

DESCRIPTION
       Scan dbfawk files for matching dbf file for map rendering in xastir

       --help prints command line usage
       -D for dir containing *.dbfawk files.
       -f for file containing awk rules.
       -d for dbf file to parse

EXAMPLES
       testdbfawk -D . -d tgr36119lkA.dbf 2>&1|less

       testdbfawk  scans  the  current  directory  for dbfawk files with signatures that match tgr36119lkA.dbf's signature.  testdbfawk dumps its output to standard error, so in the example standard error is
       redirected to standard out and piped into "less" for paging.

NOTES
       Dbfawk hints and kinks:  You have to think like an awk programmer and realize that the order that rules are listed matters, that it's important to use "next" as soon as it makes sense so  other  rules
       aren't looked at unnecessarily and, to use "skip" when you want to fix bad dbf data.
