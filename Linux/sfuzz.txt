NAME
       sfuzz - Simple Fuzzer

SYNOPSIS
       sfuzz [-ORTUVXdelnqrsu] [-D key=val]...
                   [-b testid] [-t timeout] [-L filename]
                   -f config [-S host] [-p port]
       sfuzz -h
       sfuzz -V

DESCRIPTION
       sfuzz  is  a  generic  application input permutation generator. It works by reading the specified configuration file in combination with the command-line options to generate large permutations of pat‐
       terned data feeding the program's input.  sfuzz's behavior is deterministic, and config file driven, making it easy to reproduce bugs and record the steps to reproduce.

USAGE
       sfuzz will parse the file specified, along with the arguments, and connect to a network port sending the data and listening for a response. The relevant behavior will be reported in the standard  out‐
       put as well as the standard error channel, and optionally a specified log file.

OPTIONS
       -b Test ID
              Begin fuzzing at a particular permutation (test-case ID). sfuzz will skip tests until it gets the test specified.

       -D key=value
              Define a key:value pair. This can be repeated any number of times.

       -d     Use Unix Datagram sockets NOTE: Support for this is experimental.

       -e     Stop fuzzing when an error is detected. Without this option, sfuzz will continue to try and execute test cases. This is useful when certain types of errors are triggered.

       -f filename
              Configuration file, which contains the file format to use.

       -h     Prints help and exits

       -L filename
              Log to the specified file. If filename doesn't exist, it will be created.  Otherwise, it will be truncated.

       -l     Only include 'literal' fuzz strings (no sequences).

       -n     Create a new log file ending with .id where id is the test id executed.

       -O     Log to standard output

       -p port
              Connect to the port specified at port

       -q     Quiet mode (not much information printed to standard out)

       -R     Leak connections

       -r     Trim newlines when sending data

       -S hostname
              Hostname to which sfuzz will connect. This can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or a hostname to be resolved via dns.

       -s     Only include 'sequence' fuzz string (no literals).

       -T     Use TCP sockets to connect

       -t time in ms
              Wait time between test cases, in milli-seconds

       -U     Use UDP sockets to 'connect' (send data)

       -u     Use Unix stream sockets to connect

       -V     Print version and exit

       -v     Set output to be VERBOSE

       -X     Print responses as ascii-hex

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero on normal exit, and -1 if there was an error detected.

EXAMPLES
       See the README file for examples

BUGS
       sfuzz strives to be error free. If you think you've found a bug, please report it to sfuzz-devel@googlegroups.com.

HISTORY
       sfuzz started in 2009 as a small ascii only fuzzer generator in the same style as easy-fuzz. It has since acquired several useful functions, including block based fuzzing and some analysis routines.
