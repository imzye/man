NAME
       ascommand - send commands to AfterStep

SYNOPSIS
       ascommand [-f file] [-h] [-i] [-v] [-w id] [--] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ascommand command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       ascommand is a program, which sends commands to the AfterStep Window Manager.

OPTIONS
       -f --file
              input commands from file (- means stdin)

       -h --help
              this help

       -i --interactive starts interactive communication with AfterStep

       -v --version
              print version information

       -w --window-id
              window id to send to AfterStep (in hex)

       --     end parsing of command line options

       command
              command to send to AfterStep

       If -f - or -i is specified, ascommand will read commands from standard input, and print results on standard output.  -i is noisier than -f -.
