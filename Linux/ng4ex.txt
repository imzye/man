       ng4ex - NCAR Graphics High Level Utilities Example Programs

SYNOPSIS
       ng4ex  [-A]  [-C]  [-Fortran]  [-NCL] [-cdf] [-csagrid] [-cssgrid] [-gui] [-anno] [-gsun] [-W workstation_type] [-app] [-basic] [-contourplot] [-fitgrid] [-labelbar] [-legend] [-primitives] [-mapplot]
       [-natgrid] [-ngmath] [-streamplot] [-shgrid] [-textitem] [-tickmark] [-title] [-vectorplot] [-xyplot] [-list] [-clean] [-n] name ...

DESCRIPTION
       ng4ex provides the user with access to several C, Fortran, and NCL examples illustrating the use of the NCAR Graphics HLUs (High Level Utilities) and NCL.  Please note that NCL is  not  available  for
       Cray systems.

       ng4ex  copies  the source code for the specified example(s) into the current directory and then compiles, links, and executes the example (if it's a Fortran or C program) or runs NCL on it (if it's an
       NCL script file).  Depending on the example, the output may be sent to an NCGM (NCAR Graphics Metafile) file and/or displayed to an X window on your screen.  You  must  be  running  X  and  have  your
       DISPLAY environment set correctly in order for the X window examples to execute properly.

       If  the requested example creates an NCGM file, it will have the same name as the example, suffixed with ".ncgm". An option allows you to request that only the source code be copied to your directory,
       without compiling or running the example.  Another option allows you to request that only the NCGM file be left in your directory and that all other files created by ng4ex be  deleted.   The  argument
       name may be selected from the lists that appear below.

                         selects a particular subset of examples.  For example, if you want to see a list of all the available examples, then use -list in conjunction with the -A option.  If you want to  see
                         a list of all the ContourPlot examples, then use -list with the -contourplot option (and so on).
