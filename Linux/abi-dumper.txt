NAME
       abi-dumper - a tool to dump ABI of an ELF object containing DWARF debug info

DESCRIPTION
   NAME:
              ABI Dumper EE (abi-dumper) Dump ABI of an ELF object containing DWARF debug info

   DESCRIPTION:
              ABI Dumper is a tool for dumping ABI information of an ELF object containing DWARF debug info.

              The tool is intended to be used with ABI Viewer or ABICC tool for tracking ABI changes of a C/C++ library or kernel module.

              This tool is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU LGPL 2.1.

   USAGE:
              abi-dumper [options] [object]

   EXAMPLES:
              abi-dumper libTest.so -o ABI.dump

              abi-dumper Module.ko.debug -o ABI.dump

   INFORMATION OPTIONS:

       -h|-help

              Print this help.

       -v|-version

              Print version information.

       -dumpversion

              Print the tool version (1.4) and don't do anything else.

   GENERAL OPTIONS:

       -o|-output PATH

              Path to the output ABI dump file.  Default: ./ABI.dump

       -sort

              Sort data in ABI dump.

       -stdout

              Print ABI dump to stdout.

       -loud

              Print all warnings.

       -vnum NUM

              Set version of the library to NUM.

       -extra-info DIR

              Dump extra analysis info to DIR.

       -bin-only

              Do not dump information about inline functions, pure virtual functions and non-exported global data.

       -all-types

              Dump unused data types.

       -all-symbols

              Dump symbols not exported by the object.

       -symbols-list PATH

              Specify a file with a list of symbols that should be dumped.

       -skip-cxx

              Do not dump stdc++ and gnu c++ symbols.

       -all

              Equal to: -all-types -all-symbols.

       -dump-static

              Dump static (local) symbols.

       -compare OLD.dump NEW.dump

              Show added/removed symbols between two ABI dumps.

       -alt PATH

              Path to the alternate debug info (Fedora). It is detected automatically from gnu_debugaltlink section of the input object if not specified.

       -dir

              Show full paths of source files.

       -vt-dumper PATH

              Path to the vtable-dumper executable if it is installed to non-default location (not in PATH).

       -public-headers PATH

              Path to directory with public header files or to file with the list of header files. This option allows one to filter out private symbols from the ABI dump.

       -ignore-tags PATH

              Path to ignore.tags file to help ctags tool to read symbols in header files.

       -ctags-def DEF

              Add -D DEF option to the ctags call. This option may be specified multiple times.

       -reimplement-std

              Do nothing.

       -mixed-headers

              This option should be specified if you are using -public-headers option and the names of public headers intersect with the internal headers.

       -kernel-export

              Dump symbols exported by the Linux kernel and modules, i.e.  symbols declared in the ksymtab section of the object and system calls.

       -search-debuginfo DIR

              Search for debug-info files referenced from gnu_debuglink section of the object in DIR.

       -keep-registers-and-offsets

              Dump used registers and stack offsets even if incompatible build options detected.

       -all-units

              Extract ABI info after reading all compilation units from the debug info. This may require a lot of extra RAM memory.  By default all compilation units are processed separately.

       -quiet

              Do not warn about incompatible build options.

       -debug

              Enable debug messages.

   EXTRA OPTIONS:

       -use-tu-dump

              Use g++ -fdump-translation-unit instead of ctags to list symbols in headers. This may be useful if all functions are declared via macros in headers and ctags can't recognize them.

       -include-preamble PATHS

              Specify header files (separated by semicolon) that should be included before others to compile without errors.

       -include-paths DIRS

              Specify  include  directories (separated by semicolon) that should be passed to the compiler by -I option in order to compile headers without errors. If this option is not set then the tool
              will try to generate include paths automatically.

       -cache-headers DIR

              Cache headers analysis results to reuse later.

       -lambda

              Enable support for lambda and checking of lexical blocks. Define it if your C++ library API functions use lambda expressions.

       -ld-library-path PATHS

              Specify paths to add to LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable before executing vtable-dumper (separated by colon).

              By default lexical blocks are not analyzed to improve performance.
