NAME
       gimagereader - Graphical GTK+/Qt front-end to tesseract-ocr

SYNOPSIS
       gimagereader-qt [image-file]

DESCRIPTION
       gImageReader is a simple GTK+/Qt front-end to tesseract-ocr. It supports automatic page layout detection but the user can also manually define and adjust the recognition regions. It is possible to
       import  images  from  disk,  scanning devices, clipboard and screenshots. gImageReader also supports multipage PDF documents. Recognized text is displayed directly next to the image and basic text
       editing including search/replace and removing of line breaks is possible.  Spellchecking for the output text is also supported if the corresponding dictionaries are installed.

SEE ALSO
       The documentation of gImageReader can be found from the "Options" menu.
