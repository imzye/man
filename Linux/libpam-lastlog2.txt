NAME
       pam_lastlog2 - PAM module to display date of last login

SYNOPSIS
       pam_lastlog2.so [debug] [silent] [silent_if=<services>] [database=<file>]

DESCRIPTION
       pam_lastlog2 is a PAM module to display a line of information about the last login of the user. The module uses the /var/lib/lastlog/lastlog2.db database file to store all information.

       Compared to pam_lastlog this PAM module is Y2038 safe and uses sqlite3 to store the information.

OPTIONS
       debug
           Print debug information.

       silent
           Avoid all messages except errors and don’t inform the user about any previous login, only update the /var/lib/lastlog/lastlog2.db database.

       silent_if=<services>
           The argument services is a comma separated list of PAM services. If a service is listed here, the last login message will not be shown.

       database=<file>
           Use file instead of /var/lib/lastlog/lastlog2.db.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       The session module type is provided for displaying the information about the last login and updating the lastlog file.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SUCCESS
           Everything was successful.

       PAM_SERVICE_ERR
           Internal service module error. This includes error reading from or writing to the database.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User not known.

       PAM_IGNORE
           Returned by service types which do nothing.

EXAMPLES
       Add the following line to e.g. /etc/pam.d/login to display the last login time of a user:

       session  optional pam_lastlog2.so silent_if=gdm,gdm-password

       It is up to the administrator to decide if the user can login (optional/required) when pam_lastlog2 has returned an error.
