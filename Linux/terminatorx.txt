NAME
       terminatorX - Realtime Audio Synthesizer

SYNOPSIS
       terminatorX [options]

DESCRIPTION
       terminatorX  is a realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to "scratch" on digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.mp3, etc.) the way hiphop-DJs scratch on vinyl records. It features multi‐
       ple turntables, realtime effects (buit-in as well as LADSPA plugin effects), a sequencer and an easy-to-use gtk+ GUI.

       -r, --rc-file [file]

       -d, --dont-save
              Do not save settings at exit
