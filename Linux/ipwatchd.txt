NAME
       ipwatchd.conf - Configuration file of IPwatchD daemon

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/ipwatchd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       IPwatchD daemon reads configuration from file specified with -c on command line. The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line. Lines beginning with # sign and empty lines are ignored.

       Possible keywords and their meanings are as follows:

       iface_configuration
              Specifies configuration mode for network interfaces. In automatic configuration mode IPwatchD detects all network interfaces automatically and sets passive protection mode for them. In man‐
              ual mode it is up to administrator to specify list of interfaces and protection modes. Accepted values are automatic or manual. Default is automatic.

       iface  Specifies network interface and its protection mode. Value is accepted only in manual configuration mode. In active protection mode IPwatchD protects your host before IP takeover by answer‐
              ing Gratuitous ARP requests received from conflicting system. In passive protection mode it just records information about IP conflict through standard syslog interface. Specified interface
              must exist and protection mode must be passive or active.

       defend_interval
              Specifies minimum interval between defensive ARPs in seconds. Accepted value is number from 0 to 600. Default value is 0.

       user_script
              Specifies  absolute  path  to  user-defined  script called by IPwatchD when IP conflict occurs. When there is no script specified IPwatchD just generates syslog event for every IP conflict.
              Specified file must exist. There is no default value.

       syslog_facility
              Specifies facility for logging. Accepted values are auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail, news, syslog, user, uucp, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6  and  lo‐
              cal7. Default value is daemon.

EXAMPLES
       Automatic configuration mode:

              iface_configuration automatic
              defend_interval 10
              user_script /usr/sbin/ipwatchd-script
              syslog_facility daemon

       Manual configuration mode:

              iface_configuration manual
              iface eth0 active
              iface eth0:0 passive
              defend_interval 10
              user_script /usr/sbin/ipwatchd-script
              syslog_facility daemon
