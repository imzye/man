NAME
       zhcon - fast CJK console environment for GNU/Linux and BSD

SYNOPSIS
       zhcon [OPTIONS]... [FILES]...

DESCRIPTION
       Zhcon is a fast Linux console system which supports framebuffer device. It can display Chinese, Japanese and Korean double byte characters.

       Supported encodings are: GB2312, GBK, BIG5, JIS and KSC.

       It can also use input methods (table based) from MS pwin98 and UCDOS for MS-DOS.

       -h, --help
              Print help and exit

       -V, --version
              Print version and exit

       --utf8 use iconv filter to convert UTF-8 stream from/to system encoding  (default=off)

       --drv=STRING
              specify video driver (auto, fb, ggi, vga)  (default=`auto')

              If a program name is given as a command line argument, zhcon will run this program on start instead of a shell, and quit when the program exits.  For example:
              zhcon screen
              will run screen in zhcon insteal of default user shell.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       On  startup, zhcon first try to load configuration from ~/.zhconrc.  If failed, it will use /etc/zhcon.conf by default. The configure file has many options that can be used to control the behavior
       of zhcon. See the comments in the file for instruction on customizing zhcon.
