NAME
       aemenu, aepanel, aesession, switch-desk - programs for use with aewm(1x)

SYNOPSIS
       aemenu [--config|-rc <file>] [-s|--switch]
       aepanel [--config|-rc <file>] [-b|--bottom]
       aesession
       aedesk [-n <num>] [[+|-]<num>]

DESCRIPTION
       The programs listed above provide several window and session management features to complement aewm(1x).  aemenu and aepanel launch programs and raise existing windows (or unhide iconified ones).  ae‐
       menu uses a popup menu to accomplish this (the --switch option changes the function of this menu), while aepanel stays on the screen inbetween uses (launching and switching functionality are both  al‐
       ways available).

       Each program comes in both a GTK+ and a Xaw version; aemenu is actually a symlink to either aemenu-gtk or aemenu-xaw (likewise for aepanel).

       The list of programs to be run by both clients is read from $HOME/.aewm/clientsrc.  There are two kinds of directives that may be used in this file:

              cmd "Description" "command"

       defines a command, which whill be interpreted by sh(1).

              menu "Title"
              (...)
              end

       defines  a  submenu.  The number of submenus that can be nested within each other is limited only by stack space. Double quotes may be included within quoted strings by escaping them with a blackslash
       (\"), and quotes may be omitted around single-word descriptions or commands. Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

       aesession is a do-nothing program; it will simply reap any children it inherits and then sleep. By ending your $HOME/.xsession script with "exec aesession", you can exit and restart  aewm(1x)  without
       killing your X session. The author does not really expect anyone except WM hackers to find this useful.

       aedesk changes to a new virtual desktop, specified by num, or sets the number of available desktops, with -n.
