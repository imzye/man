NAME
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response - A set of classes for implementing responses from a CAS server

DESCRIPTION
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response implements a base class that is used to build a hierarchy of response objects that are returned from methods in Authen::CAS::Client.  Most response objects are meant
       to encapsulate a type of response from a CAS server.

CLASSES AND METHODS
   Authen::CAS::Client::Response
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response is the base class from which all other response classes inherit.  As such it is very primitive and is never used directly.

       new( %args )

       "new()" creates an instance of an "Authen::CAS::Client::Response" object and assigns its data members according to the values in %args.

       is_error()

       "is_error()" returns true if the response represents an error object.

       is_failure()

       "is_failure()" returns true if the response represents a failure object.

       is_success()

       "is_success()" returns true if the response represents a success object.

       doc()

       "doc()" returns the response document used to create the response object.  For errors and CAS v1.0 requests this will be the raw text response from the server.  Otherwise an XML::LibXML object
       will be returned.  This can be used for debugging or retrieving additional information from the CAS server's response.

   Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Error
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Error is used when an error occurs that prevents further processing of a request.  This would include not being able connect to the CAS server, receiving an
       unexpected response from the server or being unable to correctly parse the server's response according to the guidelines in the CAS protocol specification.

       new( error => $error, doc => $doc )

       "new()" creates an instance of an "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Error" object.  $error is the error string.  $doc is the response document.

       error()

       "error()" returns the error string.

   Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Failure
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Failure is used as a base class for other failure responses.  These correspond to the "cas:authenticationFailure" and "cas:proxyFailure" server responses outlined in
       the CAS protocol specification.

       new( code => $code, message => $message, doc => $doc )

       "new()" creates an instance of an "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Failure" object.  $code is the failure code.  $message is the failure message.  $doc is the response document.

       code()

       "code()" returns the failure code.

       message()

       "message()" returns the failure message.

   Authen::CAS::Client::Response::AuthFailure
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response::AuthFailure is a subclass of "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Failure" and is used when a validation attempt fails.  When using the CAS v2.0 protocol, $code, $message
       and $doc are set according to what is parsed from the server response.  When using the CAS v1.0 protocol, $code is set to 'V10_AUTH_FAILURE', $message is set to the empty string and $doc is set to
       the server's response content.

       No additional methods are defined.

   Authen::CAS::Client::Response::ProxyFailure
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response::ProxyFailure is a subclass of "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Failure" and is used when a "cas:proxyFailure" response is received from the CAS server during a proxy
       attempt.  $code, $message and $doc are set according to what is parsed from the server response.

       No additional methods are defined.

   Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Success
       "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Success" is used as base class for other success responses.  These correspond to the "cas:authenticationSuccess" and "cas:proxySuccess" server responses.

       new( doc => $doc )

       "new()" creates an instance of an "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Success" object.  $doc is the response document.

   Authen::CAS::Client::Response::AuthSuccess
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response::AuthSuccess is a subclass of "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Success" and is used when validation succeeds.

       new( user => $user, iou => $iou, proxies => \@proxies, doc => $doc )

       "new()" creates an instance of an "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::AuthSuccess" object.  $user is the username received in the response.  $iou is the proxy granting ticket IOU, if present.
       "\@proxies" is the list of proxies used during validation, if present.  $doc is the response document.

       user()

       "user()" returns the user name that was contained in the server response.

       iou()

       "iou()" returns the proxy granting ticket IOU, if it was present in the server response.  Otherwise it is set to "undef".

       proxies()

       "proxies()" returns the list of proxies present in the server response.  If no proxies are found, an empty list is returned.  In scalar context an array reference will be returned instead.

   Authen::CAS::Client::Response::ProxySuccess
       Authen::CAS::Client::Response::ProxySuccess is a subclass of "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::Success" and is used when a "cas:proxySuccess" response is received from the CAS server during a proxy
       attempt.

       new( proxy_ticket => $proxy_ticket, doc => $doc )

       "new()" creates an instance of an "Authen::CAS::Client::Response::ProxySuccess" object.  $proxy_ticket is the proxy ticket received in the response.  $doc is the response document.

       proxy_ticket()

       "proxy_ticket()" returns the proxy ticket that was contained in the server response.
