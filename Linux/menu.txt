MENUFILE(5)                                                                                 File Formats Manual                                                                                 MENUFILE(5)

NAME
       menufile - entry in the Debian menu system

SYNOPSIS
       ~/.menu/*

       /etc/menu/*

       /usr/lib/menu/*

       /usr/share/menu/*

       /usr/share/menu/default/*

DESCRIPTION
       Menu  files  add  entries  to the Debian menu system.  The system administrator can place menu files in /etc/menu/ to override menu files that packages add to /usr/share/menu/.  The user can place
       menu files in ~/.menu/ to override all other menu files.

       Please read the Debian menu manual available in /usr/share/doc/menu/html for the complete specification of menu files.

       The menu files are usually named after the Debian package that contains the programs listed in them.  In it, you can list several "menu entries" that specify a specific item in the menu structure.
       Each menu entry specifies which packages it depends on; if that package are not installed, the menu entry will be ignored by update-menus(1).  (In a menu entry you can specify pseudo-packages that
       start with "local."; update-menus will always use those menu entries).  If you wish to remove an item from the menu entirely, make an empty menu file with the same name as the  file  you  want  to
       override.

Examples
       Dosemu could install the following menu file as /usr/share/menu/dosemu:

        ?package(dosemu):needs="text" section="Applications/Emulators" \
       title="Dosemu" command="dosemu"
        ?package(dosemu):needs="X11" section="Applications/Emulators" \
       title="Dosemu" command="xdos"

       The system administrator wants to override this file to change how dosemu is run, so /etc/menu/dosemu is created:

        ?package(dosemu):needs="text" section="Applications/Emulators" \
       title="Dosemu" command="dosemu -A"
        ?package(dosemu):needs="X11"  section="Applications/Emulators" \
       title="Dosemu" command="xdos -A"

       A user does not want Dosemu to appear in the menus at all, so the user creates an empty file named ~/.menu/dosemu.

FORMAT
       A menu file consists of 0 or more lines of the following format:

              ?package(package-name):var1=value1 var2=value2  ...

              needs  Specify what kind of environment the program require.  This variable must be defined, and should be one of the following:

                     needs="text"
                            Program requires a terminal

                     needs="x11"
                            Program requires a X server

                     needs="vc"
                            Program requires a Linux console (i.e.: svgalib programs)

                     needs="wm"
                            The program is a window manager.

                     needs="fvwmmodule"
                            The program is a fvwm compatible module.

              section
                     The section in which the menu entry should appear.  See MENU LAYOUT for preferred section names.

              icon   An icon for this menu entry.  If no icon is available, just don't define this.

              title  The  title  of  the program that will appear on the menus.  Keep it short.  If two menu entries share the same title and section, the one that best fits the available display will be
                     used.  So in the example above with two menu entries that both have the menu id "title", if X is available, the X11 one will be used; otherwise the text one will be  used.   Must  be
                     defined.

              command
                     The command to be executed when this menu entry is selected.

              hints  A comma-separated list of hints on how grouping menu entries; see the manual.

MENU LAYOUT
       The  authoritative  list  of Debian's menu structure is maintained in the Debian Menu sub-policy document which is part of the Debian Policy package.  The menu structure below is included only for
       convenience.  Please do not put your packages into any other sections.

       Use `/' to separate sub-menu names, for example, "Applications/Editors" or "Games/Arcade".

NOTES
       If you want to specify an icon or hotkey for a sub-menu (for example, the Editors sub-menu), just use the same syntax but leave the command empty:

       ?package(mypackage):needs="X11" section="Applications" \
        icon="/usr/share/pixmaps/icon.xpm" hotkey="E" title="Editors"

       Whenever any menu files are changed, you must run update-menus(1)
