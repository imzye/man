NAME
       wavmerge - Merge multiple wave files into a single file

SYNOPSIS
       wavmerge [-o merged.wav] file1.wav file2.wav [...]

DESCRIPTION
       wavmerge  can  merge wave files that are in the same format (i.e. same sample rate, same bits per sample, ...). If you want to merge wave files from different formats, you will have to convert them to
       the same format using, for example, sox(1).

OPTIONS
       -o merged.wav
              Specify the filename of the merged wave file; if not specified, merged.wav will be used as the filename for the output

SEE ALSO
       wavbreaker(1), wavinfo(1), sox(1).
