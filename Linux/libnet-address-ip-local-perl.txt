NAME
       Net::Address::IP::Local - A class for discovering the local system's IP address

VERSION
       0.1.2

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::Address::IP::Local;

           # Get the local system's IP address that is "en route" to "the internet":
           my $address      = Net::Address::IP::Local->public;
           my $address_ipv4 = Net::Address::IP::Local->public_ipv4;
           my $address_ipv6 = Net::Address::IP::Local->public_ipv6;

           # Get the local system's IP address that is "en route" to the given remote
           # IP address:
           my $address = Net::Address::IP::Local->connected_to($remote_address);

DESCRIPTION
       Net::Address::IP::Local discovers the local system's IP address that would be used as the source address when contacting "the internet" or a certain specified remote IP address.

   Class methods
       This class just provides the following class methods:

       public: returns string; throws Net::Address::IP::Local::Error
           Returns  the  textual  representation  of  the  local  system's IP address that is "en route" to "the internet".  If the system supports IPv6 and has an IPv6 address that is "en route" to "the
           internet", that is returned.  Otherwise, the IPv4 address that is "en route" to "the internet" is returned.  If there is no route at  all  to  the  internet,  a  Net::Address::IP::Local::Error
           exception is thrown.

       public_ipv4: returns string; throws Net::Address::IP::Local::Error
           Returns  the  textual  representation  of  the  local  system's  IPv4 address that is "en route" to "the internet".  If there is no IPv4 route to the internet, a Net::Address::IP::Local::Error
           exception is thrown.

       public_ipv6: returns string; throws Net::Address::IP::Local::Error
           Returns the textual representation of the local system's IPv6 address that is "en route" to "the internet".  If there is  no  IPv6  route  to  the  internet,  a  Net::Address::IP::Local::Error
           exception is thrown.

       connected_to($remote_address): returns string; throws Net::Address::IP::Local::Error
           Returns  the  textual  representation  of  the  local  system's  IP  address  that  is  "en  route"  to  the  given  remote  IP address.  If there is no route to the given remote IP address, a
           Net::Address::IP::Local::Error exception is thrown.
