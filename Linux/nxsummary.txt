NAME
       nxdiff - Generate summary of a NeXus file

SYNOPSIS
       nxsummary [--xml] [--value label] [--writeconfig config]
                       [--config config] [--verbose] [--] [--version] [-h]
                       [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       The  nxsummary utility prints summary information about NeXus files. This program relies heavily on the configuration file that is located in "${HOME}/.nxsummary.conf" or "/etc/nxsummary.conf". A sam‐
       ple configuration file can be obtained using the "--writeconfig" flag. Each item tag in the file describes a node to print from the NeXus file. The path attribute describes where in the NeXus file  to
       get  information  from.  The label attributes is what will be printed when showing the value of the specified field. The optional operation attribute provides for certain operations to be performed on
       the data before printing out the result. Valid operations are:

          COUNT - The number of elements in the requested field.

          DIMS - The dimensions of the requested field.

          SUM - Add together all of the array elements and print the
          result.

          UNITS:newunits - Specify the units to print the result in.
