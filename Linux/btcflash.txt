NAME
       BTCFLASH - firmware flash utility for BTC DRW1008 DVD+/-RW recorder.

SYNOPSIS
       btcflash DEVICE FILE

DESCRIPTION
       BTCFLASH may also work with other BTC DVD recorders, such as the DRW1004 and DRW1108, but they have not been tested. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

       Firmware  files  may  be  obtained  by  running  BTC's  Windows  flash  utility,  then searching in the WINDOWSTEMP or WINNTTEMP directory for a *.HEX file. It will probably be in a subdirectory named
       PAC*.tmp.DIR, and the HEX file will be named Vnnnn.HEX, where nnnn is the firmware version number. You'll also find IDEFLASH.EXE or BTCFLASH.EXE in the same directory.

OPTIONS
       DEVICE Write the firmware to the given device.

       FILE   Read the firmware from the given file. This utility will also accept firmware files in ".BIN" format.
