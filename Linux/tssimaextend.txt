NAME
       tssimaextend - Replay the IMA event log

DESCRIPTION
       Replays the provided IMA event log.

       Without -sim, uses TPM2_PCR_Extend to extend the events into the TPM.
       With    -sim, extends into simulated PCRs and traces the result.

       Without -sim, hash algorithms not allocated are ignored, the TPM behavior.
       With    -sim, all specified hash algorithms are used.  If no hash algorithms are specified, defaults to sha1 and sha256.

       Two IMA log formats are currently supported:

       1: SHA1 - A zero padded measurement is extended into other PCR banks.
       2: SHA1 - A digest of the template data is extended into other PCR banks.

       This handles the case where a zero measurement extends ones into the IMA PCR.

       -if    IMA event log file name

       [-of   With -sim, PCR 10 of first algorithm specified]

       [-le   input file is little endian (default big endian)]

       [-halg (sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512)]
              -halg may be specified more than once

       [-ty   IMA log format (default type 1)]

       [-tpm  extend TPM PCRs (default)]

       [-sim  calculate simulated PCRs]

       [-checkhash
              verify IMA event log hashes]

       [-b    beginning entry (default 0, beginning of log)] A beginning entry after the end of the log becomes a noop

       [-e    ending entry (default end of log)] E.g., -b 0 -e 0 sends one entry

       [-l    time  -  run  in  a continuous loop, sleep 'time' seconds betwteen loops] The intent is that this be run without specifying -b and -e Afer each pass, the next beginning entry is set to the last
              entry +1
