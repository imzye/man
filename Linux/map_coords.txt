NAME
       map_coords - Map coordinates from one genome to another using a Mercator multiple alignment

SYNOPSIS
       map_coords [options] <source genome> <chromosome> <start> <end> <strand> <target genome>

DESCRIPTION
       map_coords from FSA 1.15.9

       Map coordinates from one genome to another using a Mercator multiple alignment.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show this message

       -D, --data <directory>
              path to map, genome and alignment files

       -M, --map <directory>
              path to map and genome files

       -A, --align <directory>
              path to alignment files

       -L, --lazy
              warn, rather than die, if the subalignment can't be obtained

       -U, --truncate
              truncate unmappable sequence (rather than skipping) and show truncated subalignment

       Assumes that coordinates are 1-based and fully-closed, therefore representing the interval [start, end].

       If requested, unmappable sequence will be truncated to the mappable portion; note that the truncation will favor the beginning of the requested sequence.
