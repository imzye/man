GIT-STRIP-MERGE(1)          General Commands Manual         GIT-STRIP-MERGE(1)

NAME
       git-strip-merge - A git-merge wrapper that deletes files on a "foreign"
       branch before merging

SYNOPSIS
       git-strip-merge [git-merge options] [-M <commitmsg>] <branch> FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       git-merge that deletes files on "foreign" <branch> before merging.

       Useful for ignoring a folder in <branch> before merging it with current
       branch. Works by deleting FILE(S) in a detached commit based on
       <branch>, and then performing the merge of this new commit in the
       current branch. Note that <branch> is not changed by this procedure.
       Also note that <branch> may actually be any reference, like a tag, or a
       remote branch, or even a commit SHA.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               show help message and exit

       -v, --verbose
               do not use -q to suppress normal output of internal steps from
               git checkout, rm, commit. By default, only git merge output is
               shown.  Errors, however, are never suppressed.

       -M <message>, --msgcommit=<message>
               message for the removal commit in <branch>. Not to be confused
               with the message of the merge commit, which is set by -m.
               Default message is: "remove files from '<branch>' before
               merge".

       -m <message>, --message=<message>
               message for the merge commit. Since we are not merging <branch>
               directly, but rather a detached commit based on it, we forge a
               message similar to git's default for a branch merge. Otherwise
               git would use in message the full and ugly SHA1 of our commit.
               Default message is: "Merge stripped branch '<branch>'".

       For both commit messages, the token "<branch>" is replaced for the
       actual <branch> name.

       Additional options are passed unchecked to git merge.

       All options must precede <branch> and FILE(s), except -h and --help
       that may appear anywhere on the command line.
