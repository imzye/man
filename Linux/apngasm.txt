NAME
       apngasm - assemble individual PNG files int to animated PNG file.

SYNOPSIS
       apngasm output.png frame001.png [options]

       apngasm output.png frame*.png   [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Assemble individual PNG files into animated PNG file.

       Some optimizations used in APNG Assembler might re-sort the palette, or change the color type from RGBA and RGB modes to RGB and indexed modes. Those optimizations are only performed when they are
       lossless, but if you want to avoid changing the palette or colortype, see options to turn them off.

       The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) file format is an extension to the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification. It allows for animated PNG files that work similarly to animated GIF
       files, while retaining backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files and adding support for 8-bit transparency and 24-bit images.

OPTIONS
       /kp Keep the original palette and do do not optimize for created APNG.

       /kc Keep the original color type.

EXAMPLES
       [Example 1] With following files, to have 3/4 seconds delay between the frames:

           frame01.png
           frame02.png
           frame03.png

           apngasm output.png frame01.png 3 4

       You can control individual frame by creating control files, like for "frame02.txt":

           delay=25/100

       [Example 2] The same as above, but the with frame00.png, which is "invisible". Notice the use of option /f:

           frame00.png - invisible
           frame01.png
           frame02.png
           frame03.png

           apngasm output.png frame00.png 3 4 /f

       That way APNG supported browsers and image viewers will show frame01-frame02-frame03 animation, while IE and Chrome will display static frame00.png image.

       [Example 3] This way you'll get 1/10 sec delay:

           apngasm output.png frame01.png

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.
