NAME
       SciteProj - a Project Manager for the SciTE editor

DESCRIPTION
       SciteProj  is  a Project Manager for the SciTE editor - It is used to group a bunch of files into a project for easy access in SciTE giving the possibility to group files in folders, and saves the
       project to disc in XML format.  It is based on the program ScitePM by Roy Wood. It uses the director interface of SciTE to communicate between SciTE and SciteProj.

OPTIONS
       -s, --scite FILENAME
              Sets the filename for the instance of SciTE to open.

       -v, --version
              Displays the version number of SciteProj

       -h, --help
              Display a short help

CONFIG FILE
       The config file that SciteProj is using is named sciteprojrc.lua, and is loaded from the directory where sciteproj is started in. - If this file isn't found, sciteproj searches for the file in the
       users $HOME/.config/ directory. It is loaded on every program start. There is a menuitem in the program to open the file directly in SciTE for editing.  If there isn't a  .sciteproj  in  the  user
       home when starting SciteProj, one will be created filled with default values.  The following options are supported in the config file:

       xpos, ypos, width and height
              Specifies the position and size of the program window on start
