List::Util::XS(3pm)                                              User Contributed Perl Documentation                                             List::Util::XS(3pm)

NAME
       List::Util::XS - Indicate if List::Util was compiled with a C compiler

SYNOPSIS
           use List::Util::XS 1.20;

DESCRIPTION
       "List::Util::XS" can be used as a dependency to ensure List::Util was installed using a C compiler and that the XS version is installed.

       During installation $List::Util::XS::VERSION will be set to "undef" if the XS was not compiled.

       Starting with release 1.23_03, Scalar-List-Util is always using the XS implementation, but for backwards compatibility, we still ship the "List::Util::XS"
       module which just loads "List::Util".
