KERNEL-IMG.CONF(5)                                                                        Debian GNU/Linux manual                                                                        KERNEL-IMG.CONF(5)

NAME
       kernel-img.conf - configuration file for Linux kernel packages

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/kernel-img.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/kernel-img.conf is used by the kernel package installation and removal process to allow local options for handling some aspects of the installation.

       Not all kernel image package creators support this file:
       Package creator               Status
       Debian linux source package   supported
       Ubuntu linux source package   supported
       make deb-pkg                  ignored

       The format of the file is a simple VAR=VALUE pair. Boolean values may be specified as Yes, True, 1, and No, False, 0, and are case insensitive.  This file is automatically created by the installa‐
       tion script in certain circumstances.

       At the moment, the user modifiable variables supported are:

       do_symlinks
              If set, the postinst and postrm scripts will maintain symlinks to default kernel and initramfs images, as described in linux-update-symlinks(8).  This variable is set by default.

       image_dest
              Set this variable to the directory in which symlinks to the default kernel and initramfs images should be maintained.  The default value is /.

       link_in_boot
              If set, this has the same effect as image_dest = /boot and overrides any other setting of image_dest.  This variable is unset by default.

FILES
       The file described here is /etc/kernel-img.conf.
