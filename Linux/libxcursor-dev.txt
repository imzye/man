NAME
       Xcursor - Cursor management library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <X11/Xcursor/Xcursor.h>

DESCRIPTION
       Xcursor  is  a  simple  library designed to help locate and load cursors.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory.  A library of common cursors exists which map to the standard X cursor names.
       Cursors can exist in several sizes and the library automatically picks the best size.

FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
       Xcursor is built in a couple of layers; at the bottom layer is code which can load cursor images from files.  Above that is a layer which locates cursor files based on the library path and  theme.
       At  the  top  is  a  layer  which builds cursors either out of an image loaded from a file or one of the standard X cursors.  When using images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render
       extension CreateCursor request if supported by the X server.  Where not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses the core CreateCursor request.

   CURSOR FILES
       Xcursor defines a new format for cursors on disk.  Each file holds one or more cursor images.  Each cursor image is tagged with a nominal size so that the best size can be selected  automatically.
       Multiple cursors of the same nominal size can be loaded together; applications are expected to use them as an animated sequence.

       Cursor files are stored as a header containing a table of contents followed by a sequence of chunks.  The table of contents indicates the type, subtype and position in the file of each chunk.  The
       file header looks like:

         magic:    CARD32 "Xcur" (0x58, 0x63, 0x75, 0x72)
         header:   CARD32 bytes in this header
         version:  CARD32 file version number
         ntoc:     CARD32 number of toc entries
         toc:      LISTofTOC table of contents

       Each table of contents entry looks like:

         type:     CARD32 entry type
         subtype:  CARD32 type-specific label - size for images
         position: CARD32 absolute byte position of table in file

       Each chunk in the file has set of common header fields followed by additional type-specific fields:

         header:   CARD32 bytes in chunk header (including type-specific fields)
         type:     CARD32 must match type in TOC for this chunk
         subtype:  CARD32 must match subtype in TOC for this chunk
         version:  CARD32 version number for this chunk type

       There are currently two chunk types defined for cursor files; comments and images.  Comments look like:

         header:   20 Comment headers are 20 bytes
         type:     0xfffe0001 Comment type is 0xfffe0001
         subtype:  { 1 (COPYRIGHT), 2 (LICENSE), 3 (OTHER) }
         version:  1
         length:   CARD32 byte length of UTF-8 string
         string:   LISTofCARD8 UTF-8 string

       Images look like:

         header:   36 Image headers are 36 bytes
         type:     0xfffd0002 Image type is 0xfffd0002
         subtype:  CARD32 Image subtype is the nominal size
         version:  1
         width:    CARD32 Must be less than or equal to 0x7fff
         height:   CARD32 Must be less than or equal to 0x7fff
         xhot:     CARD32 Must be less than or equal to width
         yhot:     CARD32 Must be less than or equal to height
         delay:    CARD32 Delay between animation frames in milliseconds
         pixels:   LISTofCARD32 Packed ARGB format pixels

   THEMES
       Xcursor (mostly) follows the freedesktop.org spec for theming icons.  The default search path it uses is

              ~/.icons, /usr/share/icons, /usr/share/pixmaps

       Within each of these directories, it searches for a directory using the theme name:

       •   Within the theme directory, it looks for cursor files in the “cursors” subdirectory.

           Xcursor looks for a specific file, which must be one of the cursor shape names, e.g., as used in XcursorLibraryLoadImage or XcursorLibraryShape.

       •   If  it  finds no matching cursor file in the “cursors” subdirectory, Xcursor next looks for an “index.theme” file in each theme directory to look for inherited themes.  Those are lines in this
           format:

           Inherits = theme-name

           Xcursor uses the first inherited theme-name, ignoring others which may exist in a given “index.theme” file.  If it finds an inherited theme, Xcursor searches along the  path  to  use  that  as
           well.  Xcursor ignores other keys in the “index.theme” file, including “Name” (i.e., the name which a graphical application may use as the presentation name).

           More  than one theme-name may be listed on the Inherits= line.  The freedesktop.org spec states that list items are separated by commas.  Xcursor also accepts semicolon, but translates both to
           colon when searching the path.  Xcursor expects only one Inherits= line; the freedesktop.org spec is unclear whether multiple keys are allowed.

       If no theme is set, or if no cursor is found for the specified theme anywhere along the path, Xcursor checks the “default” theme.

       When Xcursor finds a cursor file, it stops searching.  It always uses the first cursor file found while searching along the path.

DATATYPES
       XcursorImage
              holds a single cursor image in memory.  Each pixel in the cursor is a 32-bit value containing ARGB with A in the high byte.

                typedef struct _XcursorImage {
                    XcursorDim           size;    /* nominal size for matching */
                    XcursorDim           width;   /* actual width */
                    XcursorDim           height;  /* actual height */
                    XcursorDim           xhot;    /* hot spot x (must be inside image) */
                    XcursorDim           yhot;    /* hot spot y (must be inside image) */
                    XcursorPixel        *pixels;  /* pointer to pixels */
                } XcursorImage;

       XcursorImages
              holds multiple XcursorImage structures.  They are all freed when the XcursorImages is freed in XcursorImagesDestroy.

                typedef struct _XcursorImages {
                    int                  nimage;  /* number of images */
                    XcursorImage        **images; /* array of XcursorImage pointers */
                } XcursorImages;

       XcursorCursors
              Holds multiple Cursor objects.  They are all freed when the XcursorCursors is freed.  These are reference counted so that multiple XcursorAnimate structures can use the same XcursorCursors.

                typedef struct _XcursorCursors {
                    Display             *dpy;     /* Display holding cursors */
                    int                  ref;     /* reference count */
                    int                  ncursor; /* number of cursors */
                    Cursor              *cursors; /* array of cursors */
                } XcursorCursors;

       XcursorAnimate
              References a set of cursors and a sequence within that set.  Multiple XcursorAnimate structures may reference the same XcursorCursors; each holds a  reference  which  is  removed  when  the
              XcursorAnimate is freed.

                typedef struct _XcursorAnimate {
                    XcursorCursors      *cursors; /* list of cursors to use */
                    int                  sequence; /* which cursor is next */
                } XcursorAnimate;

       XcursorFile
              Xcursor  provides  an  abstract  API  for accessing the file data.  Xcursor provides a stdio implementation of this abstract API; applications are free to create additional implementations.
              These functions parallel the stdio functions in return value and expected argument values; the read and write functions flip the arguments around to match the POSIX versions.

                typedef struct _XcursorFile {
                    void *closure;
                    int (*read)  (XcursorFile *file, unsigned char *buf, int len);
                    int (*write) (XcursorFile *file, unsigned char *buf, int len);
                    int (*seek)  (XcursorFile *file, long offset, int whence);
                };

              Allocate and free arrays to hold multiple cursors.  On allocation, ncursor is set to zero, ref is set to one.

   Reading and writing images
       XcursorImage *XcursorXcFileLoadImage (
                      XcursorFile           *file,
                      int                    size)

       XcursorImages *XcursorXcFileLoadImages (
                      XcursorFile           *file,
                      int                    size)

       XcursorImages *XcursorXcFileLoadAllImages (
                      XcursorFile           *file)

       XcursorBool XcursorXcFileLoad (
                      XcursorFile           *file,
                      XcursorComments       **commentsp,
                      XcursorImages         **imagesp)

       XcursorBool XcursorXcFileSave (
                      XcursorFile           *file,
                      const XcursorComments *comments,
                      const XcursorImages   *images)

              These read and write cursors from an XcursorFile handle.  After reading, the file pointer will be left at some random place in the file.

       XcursorImage *XcursorFileLoadImage (
                      FILE                  *file,
                      int                    size)

       XcursorImages *XcursorFileLoadImages (
                      FILE                  *file,
                      int                    size)

       XcursorImages *XcursorFileLoadAllImages (
                      FILE                  *file)

       XcursorBool XcursorFileLoad (
                      FILE                  *file,
                      XcursorComments       **commentsp,
                      XcursorImages         **imagesp)

       XcursorBool XcursorFileSaveImages (
                      FILE                  *file,
                      const XcursorImages   *images)

       XcursorBool XcursorFileSave (
                      FILE                  *file,
                      const XcursorComments *comments,
                      const XcursorImages   *images)

              These read and write cursors from a stdio FILE handle.  Writing flushes before returning so that any errors should be detected.

       XcursorImage *XcursorFilenameLoadImage (
                      const char            *filename,
                      int                    size)

       XcursorImages *XcursorFilenameLoadImages (
                      const char            *filename,
                      int                    size)

       XcursorImages *XcursorFilenameLoadAllImages (
                      const char            *file)

       XcursorBool XcursorFilenameLoad (
                      const char            *file,
                      XcursorComments       **commentsp,
                      XcursorImages         **imagesp)

       XcursorBool XcursorFilenameSaveImages (
                      const char            *filename,
                      const XcursorImages   *images)

       XcursorBool XcursorFilenameSave (
                      const char            *file,
                      const XcursorComments *comments,
                      const XcursorImages   *images)

              These parallel the stdio FILE interfaces above, but take filenames.

   Reading library images
       XcursorImage *XcursorLibraryLoadImage (
                      const char            *name,
                      const char            *theme,
                      int                    size)

       XcursorImages *XcursorLibraryLoadImages (
                      const char            *name,
                      const char            *theme,
                      int                    size)

              These search the library path, loading the first file found of the desired size, using a private function (XcursorScanTheme) to find the appropriate theme:

              •   If theme is not NULL, use that.

              •   If theme is NULL, or if there was no match for the desired theme, use “default” for the theme name.

              •   If neither search succeeds, these functions return NULL.

              The two functions differ by more than the number of images loaded:

              •   XcursorLibraryLoadImage calls XcursorFileLoadImage but

              •   XcursorLibraryLoadImages calls XcursorFileLoadImages, and (on success) it calls XcursorImagesSetName to associate name with the result.

   Library attributes
       const char * XcursorLibraryPath (void)

              Returns the library search path:

              •   If the environment variable XCURSOR_PATH is set, return that value.

              •   Otherwise, return the compiled-in search path.

       int XcursorLibraryShape (
                      const char            *library)

              Search Xcursor's table of cursor font names for the given “shape name” (library):

              •   If found, return the index into that table, multiplied by two (to account for the source- and mask-values used in an X cursor font).

              •   If not found, return -1.

   Cursor APIs
       Cursor XcursorFilenameLoadCursor (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      const char            *file)

       XcursorCursors *XcursorFilenameLoadCursors (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      const char            *file)

              These load cursors from the specified file.

       Cursor XcursorLibraryLoadCursor (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      const char            *name)

       XcursorCursors *XcursorLibraryLoadCursors (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      const char            *name)

              These load cursors using the specified library name.  The theme comes from the display.

       Cursor XcursorImageLoadCursor(
                      Display               *dpy,
                      const XcursorImage    *image)

              This creates a cursor, given the image to display.  It calls XcursorSupportsARGB to decide what type of cursor to create:

              •   XRenderCreateCursor is used if ARGB is supported on the display, and

              •   XCreatePixmapCursor is used otherwise.

       Cursor XcursorImagesLoadCursor(
                      Display               *dpy,
                      const XcursorImages   *images)

              This provides an interface for creating animated cursors, if the images array contains multiple images, and if XcursorSupportsAnim returns true.  Otherwise, it calls XcursorImageLoadCursor.

       XcursorCursors *XcursorImagesLoadCursors(
                      Display               *dpy,
                      const XcursorImages   *images)

              This calls XcursorCursorsCreate to create an array of XcursorCursors, to correspond to the XcursorImages images array, and uses XcursorImageLoadCursor to load the corresponding cursor data.

              Normally it returns the resulting array pointer.  On any failure, it discards the result XcursorCursorsDestroy, and returns NULL.

   X Cursor Name APIs
       XcursorImage *XcursorShapeLoadImage (
                      unsigned int           shape,
                      const char            *theme,
                      int                    size)

       XcursorImages *XcursorShapeLoadImages (
                      unsigned int           shape,
                      const char            *theme,
                      int                    size)

              These map shape to a library name using the standard X cursor names and then load the images.

       Cursor XcursorShapeLoadCursor (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      unsigned int           shape)

       XcursorCursors *XcursorShapeLoadCursors (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      unsigned int           shape)

              These map shape to a library name and then load the cursors.

   X Cursor Comment APIs
       XcursorComment *XcursorCommentCreate (
                      XcursorUInt            comment_type,
                      int                    length)

              XcursorXcFileLoad uses this function to allocate an XcursorComment structure for a single cursor.  The comment_type parameter is used as the subtype field, e.g., COPYRIGHT.  The  length  is
              the number of bytes to allocate for the comment text.

       void XcursorCommentDestroy(
                      XcursorComment        *comment)

              Deallocates the given XcursorComment structure.

       XcursorComments * XcursorCommentsCreate (
                      int                    size)

              XcursorXcFileLoad uses this function to allocate an index of XcursorComment structure pointers.  The size parameter tells it how many pointers will be in the index.

       void XcursorCommentsDestroy (
                      XcursorComments       *comments)

              Deallocates the given XcursorComments structure as well as the XcursorComment structures which it points to.

   Animated Cursors
       XcursorAnimate * XcursorAnimateCreate (
                      XcursorCursors        *cursors)

              Wrap the given array of cursors in a newly allocated XcursorAnimate structure, which adds a sequence number used in XcursorAnimateNext.

       void XcursorAnimateDestroy (
                      XcursorAnimate        *animate)

              Discards the given animate data, freeing both the XcursorCursors array of cursors as well as the XcursorAnimate structure.

       Cursor XcursorAnimateNext (
                      XcursorAnimate        *animate)

              Cyclically returns the next Cursor in the array, incrementing the sequence number to prepare for the next call.

              The caller is responsible for displaying the series of Cursor images.  Xcursor does not do that.

   Glyph Cursor APIs
       The X11 XCreateFontCursor and XCreateGlyphCursor functions use this part of the API to extend the X core cursors feature to use themes.

       void XcursorImageHash (
                      XImage                *image,
                      unsigned char          hash[XCURSOR_BITMAP_HASH_SIZE])

              Compute a hash of the image, to display when the environment variable XCURSOR_DISCOVER is set.

       void XcursorImagesSetName (
                      XcursorImages         *images,
                      const char            *name)

              Associates the given name with the images.

       void XcursorNoticeCreateBitmap (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      Pixmap                 pid,
                      unsigned int           width,
                      unsigned int           height)

              Check if the display supports either ARGB or themes, and also if the image size fits within the maximum cursor size (64 pixels).  If so, create a bitmap of the specified size, and cache the
              result in Xcursor, identifying it with the Pixmap-id (pid) value.

       void XcursorNoticePutBitmap (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      Drawable               draw,
                      XImage                *image)

              Update the image contents in the bitmap specified by the draw value (a Pixmap-id).  The bitmap must have been created by XcursorNoticeCreateBitmap.

       Cursor XcursorTryShapeBitmapCursor (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      Pixmap                 source,
                      Pixmap                 mask,
                      XColor                *foreground,
                      XColor                *background,
                      unsigned int           x,
                      unsigned int           y)

              If  the display supports either ARGB or themes, try to load a cursor into Xcursor's cache using the source parameter as a Pixmap-id.  The source may no longer be in the cache.  Xcursor uses
              the hash value to identify the desired image.

       Cursor XcursorTryShapeCursor (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      Font                   source_font,
                      Font                   mask_font,
                      unsigned int           source_char,
                      unsigned int           mask_char,
                      XColor _Xconst        *foreground,
                      XColor _Xconst        *background)

              If the display supports either ARGB or themes, try to load a cursor into Xcursor's cache using the source_char parameter as a shape.  Using

              •   the default size from XcursorGetDefaultSize,

              •   the default theme from XcursorGetTheme, and

              •   the source_char parameter as a shape,

              Xcursor calls XcursorShapeLoadImages to load the cursor images.  If successful, Xcursor uses XcursorImagesLoadCursor to load the cursor information.

   Display Information APIs
       XcursorBool XcursorSupportsARGB (
                      Display               *dpy)

              Returns true if the display supports ARGB cursors.  Otherwise, cursors will be mapped to a core X cursor.

       XcursorBool XcursorSupportsAnim (
                      Display               *dpy)

              Returns true if the display supports animated cursors.  Otherwise, cursors will be mapped to a core X cursor.

       XcursorBool XcursorSetDefaultSize (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      int                    size)

              Sets the default size for cursors on the specified display.  When loading cursors, those whose nominal size is closest to this size will be preferred.

       int XcursorGetDefaultSize (
                      Display               *dpy)

              Gets the default cursor size.

       XcursorBool XcursorSetResizable (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      XcursorBool            resizable)

              Sets the current resizable-cursors state.

       XcursorBool XcursorGetResizable (
                      Display               *dpy)

              Gets the current resizable-cursors state.

       XcursorBool XcursorSetTheme (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      const char            *theme)

              Sets the current theme name.

       char *XcursorGetTheme (
                      Display               *dpy)

              Gets the current theme name.

       XcursorBool XcursorGetThemeCore (
                      Display               *dpy)

       XcursorBool XcursorSetThemeCore (
                      Display               *dpy,
                      XcursorBool            theme_core)

              Get or set property which tells Xcursor whether to enable themes for core cursors.

ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables can be used to override resource settings, which in turn override compiled-in default values.

       Some of the environment variables recognized by Xcursor are booleans, specified as follows:

          true for “t”, “1”, “y” or “on”

          false for “f”, “0”, “n” or “off”

       Xcursor ignores other values for these booleans.

       HOME           Xcursor interprets “~” in the search list as the home directory, using this variable rather than the password database.

       XCURSOR_ANIM   If the display supports the Render CreateCursor request, and the Render feature is enabled, disable animated cursors if the environment variable is false.

                      If the environment variable is not given, Xcursor uses the resource Xcursor.anim.

       XCURSOR_CORE   If the display supports the Render CreateCursor request disable the Render feature if the environment variable is false.

                      If the environment variable is not given, Xcursor uses the resource Xcursor.core.

       XCURSOR_DISCOVER
                      If the variable is set, Xcursor turns on a logging feature.  It displays the hash value and the image so that users can see which cursor name is associated with each image.

                      There is no corresponding resource setting.

       XCURSOR_DITHER This variable sets the desired dither.

                      If the environment variable is not given, Xcursor uses the resource Xcursor.dither.

                      If neither environment variable or resource is found, Xcursor uses “threshold”

                      These are the recognized values:

                         diffuse

                         median

                         ordered

                         threshold

       XCURSOR_PATH   This variable sets the list of paths in which to search for cursors, rather than the compiled-in default list.

                      Directories in this path are separated by colons (:).

       XCURSOR_RESIZED
                      Enables automatic resizing of cursors to improve their displayed size if the environment variable is true.

                      If the environment variable is not given, Xcursor tries the Xcursor.resized resource.

       XCURSOR_SIZE   This variable sets the desired cursor size, in pixels.

                      If the environment variable is not given, Xcursor tries the Xcursor.size resource.

                      If no size is given, whether by environment variable or resource setting, Xcursor next tries the Xft.dpi resource setting to guess the size of a 16-point cursor.

                      Finally, if Xft.dpi is not set, Xcursor uses the display height, dividing by 48 (assuming that the height is 768).

       XCURSOR_THEME  This variable selects the desired theme.

                      If the environment variable is not given, Xcursor tries the Xcursor.theme resource.

                      If neither environment variable or resource is found, Xcursor uses the default theme.

       XCURSOR_THEME_CORE
                      Enables themes for core cursors if the environment variable is true.

                      If the environment variable is not given, Xcursor tries the Xcursor.theme_core resource.

                      An application can enable or disable themes using XcursorSetThemeCore.

CAVEATS
       Xcursor will probably change radically in the future; weak attempts will be made to retain some level of source-file compatibility.
