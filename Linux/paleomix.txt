NAME
       trim_pipeline - trim pipeline of PALEOMIX suite

SYNOPSIS
       trim_pipeline [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  PALEOMIX  pipelines are a set of pipelines and tools designed to aid the rapid processing of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data: The BAM pipeline processes de-multiplexed reads from one or
       more samples, through sequence processing and alignment, to generate BAM alignment files useful in downstream analyses; the Phylogenetic pipeline carries out genotyping and phylogenetic  inference
       on BAM alignment files, either produced using the BAM pipeline or generated elsewhere; and the Zonkey pipeline carries out a suite of analyses on low coverage equine alignments, in order to detect
       the presence of F1-hybrids in archaeological assemblages. In addition, PALEOMIX aids in metagenomic analysis of the extracts.

       The  pipelines  have been designed with ancient DNA (aDNA) in mind, and includes several features especially useful for the analyses of ancient samples, but can all be for the processing of modern
       samples, in order to ensure consistent data processing.

       trim_pipeline is the trim pipeline of paleomix(1).
