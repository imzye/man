NAME
       tefd - Tool for Data and Event Flow Diagrams

SYNOPSIS
       tefd [options] [document]

DESCRIPTION
       tefd  is  an X11/Motif based graphical editor for drawing data and control flow diagrams.  Documents can be loaded from and stored to a file. It can print documents to a PostScript printer or save
       as PostScript to a file.

       tefd is part of The Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling (TCM).

ARGUMENTS
       You can call tefd with a single document name as argument.  If this argument is an existing file then tefd tries to load a document from it. If it does not exist, a new document  is  created  with
       the argument as document name. tefd files should have suffix '*.efd'.

       Without a document argument, tefd creates a new empty data and control flow diagram with the name 'untitled.efd'.

       In addition to the standard X11 toolkit options (see X11(7)) tefd accepts the options listed below:

       -drawing widthxheight
              Create a drawing area of width pixels wide and height pixels high.

       -help  Write all available options to standard output and quit.

       -maxdrawing widthxheight
              The drawing area can not be larger than width pixels wide and height pixels high.

       -priv_cmap
              Start the editor with a private colormap.

       -projdir directory
              Set the project directory (current working directory) to directory.

       -toEPS [file.eps]
              Generate EPS (to file.eps or stdout when no file name was given) and quit.

       -toFig [file.fig] [-latex]
              Generate Fig format (to file.fig or stdout when no file name was given and quit. When the -latex option is given, LaTeX fonts are generated, otherwise normal PostScript fonts are generated.
              The Fig format can be read by xfig(1) and fig2dev(1).

       -toPNG file.png
              Generate PNG format to file.png and quit.

       -toPS [file.ps]
              Generate PostScript (to file.ps or stdout when no file name was given) and quit.

       -version
              Write the TCM version to standard output and quit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The TCM_HOME environment variable should be the directory where the TCM files are installed.

       PATH   Should include $TCM_HOME/bin

       MANPATH
              Should include $TCM_HOME/man

       PRINTER
              Name of the default printer that is used by tefd.

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH when the distribution contains shared
              object libraries in $TCM_HOME/lib.  Should include $TCM_HOME/lib

FILES
       The following relative files are relative to $TCM_HOME.

       bin/tefd
              the data and control flow diagram editor.

       bin/psf
              a program to filter PostScript output.

       lib/banner.ps
              PostScript banner page that can be used when the printer does not print a banner page.

       lib/help/*
              The help directory contains a collection of text files for the on-line help.

       lib/TCM
              X Resources (the same as the ones that are built-in).  You can customize the fonts and colors by setting resources in your X defaults database.  Each string of the form ``TCM.resource:defi‐
              nition'' sets a resource.

       /tmp/tcmXXXXXX
              Pseudo random temporary file, for PostScript output.

       lib/tcm.conf
              TCM editor configuration file. This file contains values for some of the editor defaults like the page size, the default fonts etc. This file is read by each editor upon startup.

       $HOME/.tcmrc
              Each user of TCM can override some of the options of tcm.conf by its own configuration file, installed in $HOME/.tcmrc.
