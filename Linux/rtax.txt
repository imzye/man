NAME
       rtax - Rapid and accurate taxonomic classification of short paired-end sequence reads from the 16S ribosomal RNA gene

SYNOPSIS
       rtax [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
OPTIONS
       -r refd      reference database in FASTA format

       -t taxonomy  taxonomy file with sequence IDs matching the reference database

       -a queryA    FASTA file containing query sequences (single-ended or read 1)

       -b queryB    FASTA file containing query sequences (read b, with matching IDs)

       -x           Reverse-complement query A sequences (required if they are provided in the reverse sense)

       -y           Reverse-complement query B sequences (required if they are provided in the reverse sense)

       -i regex     regular expression used to select part of the fasta header to use as the sequence id.  Default: "(\S+)"

       -l file      text file containing sequence IDs to process, one per line

       -d delimiter delimiter separating the two reads when provided in a single file

       -m tempdir   temporary directory.  Will be removed on successful completion, but likely not if there is an error

       -f           for sequences where only one read is available, fall back to single-ended classification.  Default: drop these sequences

       -g           for sequences where one read is overly generic, do not fall back to single-ended classification.  Default: classify these sequences based on only the more specific read

       -o classifications.out
                    output path
