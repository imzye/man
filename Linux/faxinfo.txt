FAXINFO(8)                                                                                  System Manager's Manual                                                                                  FAXINFO(8)

NAME
       faxinfo - print information about a received facsimile

SYNOPSIS
       Basic usage:

       /usr/sbin/faxinfo [ -b ] [ -n ] [ -D ] file.tif [ file2.tif [...] ]

       Formatting shortcuts:

       /usr/sbin/faxinfo [ -C delim | -c delim | -r ] file.tif [ file2.tif ] ]

       Raw formatting:

       /usr/sbin/faxinfo [ -S fmt ] [ -s fmt ] [ -e fmt ] [ -E fmt ] file.tif [ file2.tif ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       faxinfo prints descriptive information on the standard output about a received facsimile file.  For example:

              /var/spool/hylafax/recvq/fax00017.tif:
                  Sender: +14159657824
                   Pages: 3
                 Quality: Normal
                    Page: North American Letter
                Received: 1996:01:19 13:51:02
              TimeToRecv: 0:39
              SignalRate: 14400 bit/s
              DataFormat: 2-D MR
              ErrCorrect: No
                 CallID1: 2152345678
                 CallID2: 1234

       This information is typically included in the notification mail generated by the faxrcvd(8) script when a facsimile is received by HylaFAX.

       -n     suppresses the printing of the filename.

       -b     strips any leading directory of the filename before printing

       -D     prints the actual print strings being used for debug purposes

       Formatting shortcuts:

       -C delim
              Sets the format to a quoted CSV, shortcut to
              -S '"%s"' -s ',"' -e '"' -E '\n'

       -c delim
              Sets the format to a CSV, shortcut to:
              -S '%s' -s ',' -e '' -E '\n'

       -r     Sets the format to raw values, shortcut to:
              -S '' -s '' -e '0 -E ''

       Raw formating:

       -S fmt used to start each fax, it is passed one parameter, the fax file name

       -s fmt used to start each field, it is passed one parameter, the field name

       -e fmt used to end each field, it is passed one parameter, the field name

       -E fmt used to end each fax, it is passed one parameter, the fax file name

NOTES
       The  information  that faxinfo prints is obtained from the tags stored in the TIFF image that is written by the HylaFAX software.  If faxinfo is presented with an invalid TIFF image it may print unin‐
       teresting information.  Similarly if a TIFF image that was not written by HylaFAX is supplied as an argument then only partial information may be printed—this is because HylaFAX stores certain  infor‐
       mation in private tags that other TIFF writers may not emit.

       Use  of  the raw fmt options to allow you to directly control the print format strings used when formating the output.  These format strings are passed directly to printf, with basic \<char> sequences
       being interpreted, including \n, \r, and \t, and can be used to make the faxinfo output conform to specific requirements, like peculiar CVS, tables, HTML, etc.

       The order of the options is important.  They are parsed from first to last, so any later options will override settings of previous ones.

ERRORS
       faxinfo return 0 on success and 1 if the file passed as argument is not valid.
