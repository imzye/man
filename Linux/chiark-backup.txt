NAME
       backup-loaded - tell the chiark-backup system what to do with a new tape

SYNOPSIS
       backup-loaded [TAPEID]

DESCRIPTION
       backup-loaded: this tells the scripts that a currently unlabelled tape should be treated as tape X: eg:
       backup-loaded b3
       will  cause  it  to  treat  it  as tape `b3'.  NB: this won't override the TAPEID label written on the tape; it's just for use with previously unused tapes.  This applies only to the next time the
       backup scripts are invoked.  You can say just
       backup-loaded
       to go back to the default behaviour, which is to fail if the tape has no TAPEID.

OPTIONS
       TAPEID Treat the tape as label TAPEID

FILES
       /etc/chiark-backup/settings.pl
              Configuration file for the whole of chiark-backup
