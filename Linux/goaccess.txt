NAME
       goaccess - fast web log analyzer and interactive viewer.

SYNOPSIS
       goaccess [filename] [options...] [-c][-M][-H][-q][-d][...]

DESCRIPTION
       goaccess GoAccess is an open source real-time web log analyzer and interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems or through your browser.

       It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.

       GoAccess parses the specified web log file and outputs the data to the X terminal. Features include:

       General Statistics:
              This panel gives a summary of several metrics, such as the number of valid and invalid requests, time taken to analyze the dataset, unique visitors, requested files, static files (CSS, ICO,
              JPG, etc) HTTP referrers, 404s, size of the parsed log file and bandwidth consumption.

       Unique visitors
              This  panel  shows  metrics  such  as  hits, unique visitors and cumulative bandwidth per date. HTTP requests containing the same IP, the same date, and the same user agent are considered a
              unique visitor. By default, it includes web crawlers/spiders.

              Optionally, date specificity can be set to the hour level using --date-spec=hr which will display dates such as 05/Jun/2016:16, or to the minute level producing 05/Jun/2016:16:59.  This  is
              great if you want to track your daily traffic at the hour or minute level.

       Requested files
              This panel displays the most requested (non-static) files on your web server.  It shows hits, unique visitors, and percentage, along with the cumulative bandwidth, protocol, and the request
              method used.

       Requested static files
              Lists  the  most frequently static files such as: JPG, CSS, SWF, JS, GIF, and PNG file types, along with the same metrics as the last panel. Additional static files can be added to the con‐
              figuration file.

       404 or Not Found
              Displays the same metrics as the previous request panels, however, its data contains all pages that were not found on the server, or commonly known as 404 status code.

       Hosts  This panel has detailed information on the hosts themselves. This is great for spotting aggressive crawlers and identifying who's eating your bandwidth.

              Expanding the panel can display more information such as host's reverse DNS lookup result, country of origin and city. If the -a argument is enabled, a list of user agents can be  displayed
              by selecting the desired IP address, and then pressing ENTER.

       Operating Systems
              This panel will report which operating system the host used when it hit the server. It attempts to provide the most specific version of each operating system.

       Browsers
              This panel will report which browser the host used when it hit the server. It attempts to provide the most specific version of each browser.

       Visit Times
              This panel will display an hourly report. This option displays 24 data points, one for each hour of the day.

              Optionally,  hour  specificity  can  be  set  to the tenth of an hour level using --hour-spec=min which will display hours as 16:4 This is great if you want to spot peaks of traffic on your
              server.

       Virtual Hosts
              This panel will display all the different virtual hosts parsed from the access log. This panel is displayed if %v is used within the log-format string.

       Referrers URLs
              If the host in question accessed the site via another resource, or was linked/diverted to you from another host, the URL they were referred from will be provided in this panel.  See  `--ig‐
              nore-panel` in your configuration file to enable it.  disabled by default.

       Referring Sites
              This panel will display only the host part but not the whole URL. The URL where the request came from.

       Keyphrases
              It  reports  keyphrases  used on Google search, Google cache, and Google translate that have lead to your web server. At present, it only supports Google search queries via HTTP. See `--ig‐
              nore-panel` in your configuration file to enable it.  disabled by default.

       Geo Location
              Determines where an IP address is geographically located. Statistics are broken down by continent and country. It needs to be compiled with GeoLocation support.

       HTTP Status Codes
              The values of the numeric status code to HTTP requests.

       ASN    This panel displays ASN (Autonomous System Numbers) data for GeoIP2 and legacy databases. Great for detecting malicious traffic and blocking accordingly.

       Remote User (HTTP authentication)
              This is the userid of the person requesting the document as determined by HTTP authentication. If the document is not password protected, this part will be "-" just like the  previous  one.
              This panel is not enabled unless %e is given within the log-format variable.

       Cache Status
              If  you  are using caching on your server, you may be at the point where you want to know if your request is being cached and served from the cache. This panel shows the cache status of the
              object the server served. This panel is not enabled unless %C is given within the log-format variable. The status can be either
               `MISS`, `BYPASS`, `EXPIRED`, `STALE`, `UPDATING`, `REVALIDATED` or `HIT`

       MIME Types
              This panel specifies Media Types (formerly known as MIME types) and Media Subtypes which will be assigned and listed underneath. This panel is not enabled unless %M is given within the log-
              format variable. See https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml for more details.

       Encryption Settings
              This panel shows the SSL/TLS protocol used along the Cipher Suites. This panel is not enabled unless %K is given within the log-format variable.

       NOTE: Optionally and if configured, all panels can display the average time taken to serve the request.

STORAGE
       There are three storage options that can be used with GoAccess. Choosing one will depend on your environment and needs.

       Default Hash Tables
              In-memory storage provides better performance at the cost of limiting the dataset size to the amount of available physical memory. GoAccess uses in-memory hash tables. It has very good mem‐
              ory usage and pretty good performance. This storage has support for on-disk persistence.

CONFIGURATION
       Multiple options can be used to configure GoAccess. For a complete up-to-date list of configure options, run ./configure --help

       --enable-debug
              Compile with debugging symbols and turn off compiler optimizations.

       --enable-utf8
              Compile with wide character support. Ncursesw is required.

       --enable-geoip=<legacy|mmdb>
              Compile with GeoLocation support. MaxMind's GeoIP is required.  legacy will utilize the original GeoIP databases.  mmdb will utilize the enhanced GeoIP2 databases.

       --with-getline
              Dynamically expands line buffer in order to parse full line requests instead of using a fixed size buffer of 4096.

       --with-openssl
              Compile GoAccess with OpenSSL support for its WebSocket server.

OPTIONS
       The following options can be supplied to the command or specified in the configuration file. If specified in the configuration file, long options need to be used without prepending -- and  without
       using the equal sign =.

   LOG/DATE/TIME FORMAT
       --time-format=<timeformat>
              The  time-format variable followed by a space, specifies the log format time containing either a name of a predefined format (see options below) or any combination of regular characters and
              special format specifiers.

              They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`.  %T or %H:%M:%S.

              Note that if a timestamp is given in microseconds, %f must be used as time-format.  If the timestamp is given in milliseconds %* must be used as time-format.

       --date-format=<dateformat>
              The date-format variable followed by a space, specifies the log format time containing either a name of a predefined format (see options below) or any combination of regular characters  and
              special format specifiers.

              They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`.  %Y-%m-%d.

              Note that if a timestamp is given in microseconds, %f must be used as date-format.  If the timestamp is given in milliseconds %* must be used as date-format.

       --datetime-format=<date_time_format>
              The  date  and  time  format  combines  the  two variables into a single option. This gives the ability to get the timezone from a request and convert it to another timezone for output. See
              --tz=<timezone>

              They all begin with a percentage (%) sign. See `man strftime`. e.g., %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z.

              Note that if --datetime-format is used, %x must be passed in the log-format variable to represent the date and time field.

       --log-format=<logformat>
              The log-format variable followed by a space or \t for tab-delimited, specifies the log format string.

              Note that if there are spaces within the format, the string needs to be enclosed in single/double quotes. Inner quotes need to be escaped.

              In addition to specifying the raw log/date/time formats, for simplicity, any of the following predefined log format names can be supplied to the log/date/time-format variables. GoAccess can
              also handle one predefined name in one variable and another predefined name in another variable.

                COMBINED     - Combined Log Format,
                VCOMBINED    - Combined Log Format with Virtual Host,
                COMMON       - Common Log Format,
                VCOMMON      - Common Log Format with Virtual Host,
                W3C          - W3C Extended Log File Format,
                SQUID        - Native Squid Log Format,
                CLOUDFRONT   - Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution,
                CLOUDSTORAGE - Google Cloud Storage,
                AWSELB       - Amazon Elastic Load Balancing,
                AWSS3        - Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
                AWSALB       - Amazon Application Load Balancer
                CADDY        - Caddy's JSON Structured format (local/info format)
                TRAEFIKCLF   - Traefik's CLF flavor

              Note: Generally, you need quotes around values that include white spaces, commas, pipes, quotes, and/or brackets. Inner quotes must be escaped.

              Note: Piping data into GoAccess won't prompt a log/date/time configuration dialog, you will need to previously define it in your configuration file or in the command line.

              Note: The default GoAccess format for CADDY is the 'local/info' format. Nevertheless, if needed, you have the option to utilize a custom GoAccess log format to match your particular config‐
              uration.

   USER INTERFACE OPTIONS

              See configuration file for a sample color scheme.

       --color-scheme=<1|2|3>
              Choose among color schemes.  1 for the default grey scheme.  2 for the green scheme.  3 for the Monokai scheme (shown only if terminal supports 256 colors).

       --crawlers-only
              Parse and display only crawlers (bots).

       --html-custom-css=<path/custom.css>
              Specifies a custom CSS file path to load in the HTML report.

       --html-custom-js=<path/custom.js>
              Specifies a custom JS file path to load in the HTML report.

       --html-report-title=<title>
              Set HTML report page title and header.

       --html-refresh=<secs>
              Refresh the HTML report every X seconds. The value has to be between 1 and 60 seconds. The default is set to refresh the HTML report every 1 second.

       --html-prefs=<JSON>
              Set HTML report default preferences. Supply a valid JSON object containing the HTML preferences. It allows the ability to customize each panel plot. See example below.

              Note: The JSON object passed needs to be a one line JSON string. For instance,

              --html-prefs='{"theme":"bright","perPage":5,"layout":"horizontal","showTables":true,"visitors":{"plot":{"chartType":"bar"}}}'

       --json-pretty-print
              Format JSON output using tabs and newlines.

              Note: This is not recommended when outputting a real-time HTML report since the WebSocket payload will much much larger.

       --max-items=<number>
              The maximum number of items to display per panel. The maximum can be a number between 1 and n.

              Note: Only the CSV and JSON output allow a maximum number greater than the default value of 366 (or 50 in the real-time HTML output) items per panel.

       --no-color
              Turn off colored output. This is the default output on terminals that do not support colors.

       --no-column-names
              Don't write column names in the terminal output. By default, it displays column names for each available metric in every panel.

       --no-csv-summary
              Disable summary metrics on the CSV output.

       --no-progress
              Disable progress metrics [total requests/requests per second].

       --no-tab-scroll
              Disable scrolling through panels when TAB is pressed or when a panel is selected using a numeric key.

       --no-html-last-updated
              Do not show the last updated field displayed in the HTML generated report.

       --no-parsing-spinner
              Do now show the progress metrics and parsing spinner.

       --tz=<timezone>
              Outputs the report date/time data in the given timezone. Note that it uses the canonical timezone name. e.g., Europe/Berlin or America/Chicago or Africa/Cairo If an invalid timezone name is
              given, the output will be in GMT. See --datetime-format in order to properly specify a timezone in the date/time format.

   SERVER OPTIONS
       Note This is just a WebSocket server to provide the raw real-time data.  It is not a WebServer itself. To access your reports html file, you will still need your own HTTP server, place the  gener‐
       ated report in it's document root dir and open the html file in your browser. The browser will then open another WebSocket-connection to the ws-server you may setup here, to keep the dashboard up-
       to-date.

       --addr Specify IP address to bind the server to. Otherwise it binds to 0.0.0.0.

              Usually there is no need to specify the address, unless you intentionally would like to bind the server to a different address within your server.

       --daemonize
              Run GoAccess as daemon (only if --real-time-html enabled).

              Note: It's important to make use of absolute paths across GoAccess' configuration.

       --user-name=<username>
              Run GoAccess as the specified user.

              Note:  It's  important to ensure the user or the users' group can access the input and output files as well as any other files needed.  Other groups the user belongs to will be ignored.  As
              such it's advised to run GoAccess behind a SSL proxy as it's unlikely this user can access the SSL certificates.

       --origin=<url>
              Ensure clients send the specified origin header upon the WebSocket handshake.

       --pid-file=<path/goaccess.pid>
              Write the daemon PID to a file when used along the --daemonize option.

       --port=<port>
              Specify the port to use. By default GoAccess' WebSocket server listens on port 7890.

       --real-time-html
              Enable real-time HTML output.

              GoAccess uses its own WebSocket server to push the data from the server to the client. See http://gwsocket.io for more details how the WebSocket server works.

       --ws-url=<[scheme://]url[:port]>
              URL to which the WebSocket server responds. This is the URL supplied to the WebSocket constructor on the client side.

              Optionally, it is possible to specify the WebSocket URI scheme, such as ws:// or wss:// for unencrypted and encrypted connections. e.g., wss://goaccess.io

              If GoAccess is running behind a proxy, you could set the client side to connect to a different port by specifying the host followed by a colon and the port.  e.g., goaccess.io:9999

              By default, it will attempt to connect to the generated report's hostname. If GoAccess is running on a remote server, the host of the remote server should be specified here. Also, make sure
              it is a valid host and NOT an http address.

       --ping-interval=<secs>
              Enable WebSocket ping with specified interval in seconds. This helps prevent idle connections getting disconnected.

       --fifo-in=<path/file>
              Creates a named pipe (FIFO) that reads from on the given path/file.

       --fifo-out=<path/file>
              Creates a named pipe (FIFO) that writes to the given path/file.

       --ssl-cert=<cert.crt>
              Path to TLS/SSL certificate. In order to enable TLS/SSL support, GoAccess requires that --ssl-cert and --ssl-key are used.

              Only if configured using --with-openssl

       --ssl-key=<priv.key>
              Path to TLS/SSL private key. In order to enable TLS/SSL support, GoAccess requires that --ssl-cert and --ssl-key are used.

              Only if configured using --with-openssl

   FILE OPTIONS
       -      The log file to parse is read from stdin.

       -f --log-file=<logfile>
              Specify the path to the input log file. If set in the config file, it will take priority over -f from the command line.

       -S --log-size=<bytes>
              Specify the log size in bytes. This is useful when piping in logs for processing in which the log size can be explicitly set.

       -l --debug-file=<debugfile>
              Send all debug messages to the specified file.

       -p --config-file=<configfile>
              Specify a custom configuration file to use. If set, it will take priority over the global configuration file (if any).

       --external-assets
              Output HTML assets to external JS/CSS files. Great if you are setting up Content Security Policy (CSP). This will create two separate files, goaccess.js and goaccess.css , in the  same  di‐
              rectory as your report.html file.

       --invalid-requests=<filename>
              Log invalid requests to the specified file.

       --unknowns-log=<filename>
              Log unknown browsers and OSs to the specified file.

       --no-global-config
              Do not load the global configuration file. This directory should normally be /usr/local/etc, unless specified with --sysconfdir=/dir.  See --dcf option for finding the default configuration
              file.

   PARSE OPTIONS
       -a --agent-list
              Enable a list of user-agents by host. For faster parsing, do not enable this flag.

       -d --with-output-resolver
              Enable IP resolver on HTML|JSON output.

       -e --exclude-ip=<IP|IP-range>
              Exclude  an IPv4 or IPv6 from being counted. Applicable solely during access log data processing, it does not exclude persisted data.  Ranges can be included as well using a dash in between
              the IPs (start-end).

              Examples:
                exclude-ip 127.0.0.1
                exclude-ip 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.100
                exclude-ip ::1

       -j --jobs=<1-6>
              This specifies the number of parallel processing threads to be used during the execution of the program. It determines the degree of concurrency when analyzing log data, allowing for paral‐
              lel processing of multiple tasks simultaneously. It defaults to 1 thread. It's common to set the number of jobs based on the available hardware resources, such as the number of CPU cores.

       -H --http-protocol=<yes|no>
              Set/unset HTTP request protocol. This will create a request key containing the request protocol + the actual request.

       -M --http-method=<yes|no>
              Set/unset HTTP request method. This will create a request key containing the request method + the actual request.

       -o --output=<path/file.[json|csv|html]>
              Write output to stdout given one of the following files and the corresponding extension for the output format:

                /path/file.csv - Comma-separated values (CSV)
                /path/file.json - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
                /path/file.html - HTML

       -q --no-query-string
              Ignore request's query string. i.e., www.google.com/page.htm?query => www.google.com/page.htm.

              Note: Removing the query string can greatly decrease memory consumption, especially on timestamped requests.

       -r --no-term-resolver
              Disable IP resolver on terminal output.

       --444-as-404
              Treat non-standard status code 444 as 404.

       --4xx-to-unique-count
              Add 4xx client errors to the unique visitors count.

       --anonymize-ip
              Anonymize the client IP address. The IP anonymization option sets the last octet of IPv4 user IP addresses and the last 80  bits  of  IPv6  addresses  to  zeros.   e.g.,  192.168.20.100  =>
              192.168.20.0 e.g., 2a03:2880:2110:df07:face:b00c::1 => 2a03:2880:2110:df07::

              Note: This deactivates -a.

       --chunk-size=<256-32768>
              This determines the number of lines that form a chunk. This parameter influences the size of the data processed concurrently by each thread, allowing for parallelization of the file reading
              and  processing tasks. The value of chunk-size affects the efficiency of the parallel processing and can be adjusted based on factors such as system resources and the characteristics of the
              input data.

              Low Values: If chunk-size is set too low, it might result in inefficient processing. For instance, if each chunk contains a very small number of lines, the overhead of managing and  coordi‐
              nating parallel processing might outweigh the benefits.

              Large  Values:  Conversely,  if chunk-size is set too high, it could lead to resource exhaustion. Each chunk represents a portion of data that a thread processes in parallel. Setting chunk-
              size to an excessively large value might cause memory issues, particularly if there are many parallel threads running simultaneously.

       --anonymize-level
              Specifies the anonymization levels: 1 => default, 2 => strong, 3 => pedantic.

       --all-static-files
              Include static files that contain a query string. e.g., /fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff?v=4.0.3

       --browsers-file=<path>
              By default GoAccess parses an "essential/basic" curated list of browsers & crawlers. If you need to add additional browsers, use this  option.   Include  an  additional  delimited  list  of
              browsers/crawlers/feeds etc.  See config/browsers.list for an example or https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allinurl/goaccess/master/config/browsers.list

       --date-spec=<date|hr|min>
              Set the date specificity to either date (default), hr to display hours or min to display minutes appended to the date.

              This  is used in the visitors panel. It's useful for tracking visitors at the hour level. For instance, an hour specificity would yield to display traffic as 18/Dec/2010:19 or minute speci‐
              ficity 18/Dec/2010:19:59.

       --double-decode
              Decode double-encoded values. This includes, user-agent, request, and referrer.

       --enable-panel=<PANEL>
              Enable parsing and displaying the given panel.

              Available panels:
                VISITORS

                TLS_TYPE

       --fname-as-vhost=<regex>
              Use log filename(s) as virtual host(s). POSIX regex is passed to extract the virtual host from the filename. e.g., --fname-as-vhost='[a-z]*.[a-z]*' can be used to extract awesome.com.log =>
              awesome.com.

       --hide-referrer=<NEEDLE>
              Hide a referrer but still count it. Wild cards are allowed in the needle. i.e., *.bing.com.

       --hour-spec=<hr|min>
              Set the time specificity to either hour (default) or min to display the tenth of an hour appended to the hour.

              This is used in the time distribution panel. It's useful for tracking peaks of traffic on your server at specific times.

       --ignore-crawlers
              Ignore crawlers from being counted.

       --unknowns-as-crawlers
              Classify unknown OS and browsers as crawlers.

       --ignore-panel=<PANEL>
              Ignore parsing and displaying the given panel.

              Available panels:
                VISITORS
                REQUESTS

                TLS_TYPE

       --ignore-referrer=<referrer>
              Ignore referrers from being counted. Wildcards allowed. e.g., *.domain.com ww?.domain.*

       --ignore-statics=<req|panel>
              Ignore static file requests.

              req
                Only ignore request from valid requests

              panels
                Ignore request from panels.

                Note that it will count them towards the total number of requests

       --ignore-status=<CODE>
              Ignore parsing and displaying one or multiple status code(s). For multiple status codes, use this option multiple times.

       --keep-last=<num_days>
              Keep the last specified number of days in storage. This will recycle the storage tables. e.g., keep & show only the last 7 days.

       --no-ip-validation
              Disable client IP validation. Useful if IP addresses have been obfuscated before being logged.  The log still needs to contain a  placeholder  for  %h  usually  it's  a  resolved  IP.  e.g.
              ord37s19-in-f14.1e100.net.

       --no-strict-status
              Disable HTTP status code validation. Some servers would record this value only if a connection was established to the target and the target sent a response.  Otherwise, it could be recorded
              as -.

       --num-tests=<number>
              Number  of lines from the access log to test against the provided log/date/time format. By default, the parser is set to test 10 lines. If set to 0, the parser won't test any lines and will
              parse the whole access log. If a line matches the given log/date/time format before it reaches <number>, the parser will consider the  log  to  be  valid,  otherwise  GoAccess  will  return
              EXIT_FAILURE and display the relevant error messages.

       --process-and-exit
              Parse log and exit without outputting data. Useful if we are looking to only add new data to the on-disk database without outputting to a file or a terminal.

       --real-os
              Display real OS names. e.g, Windows XP, Snow Leopard.

       --sort-panel=<PANEL,FIELD,ORDER>
              Sort panel on initial load. Sort options are separated by comma. Options are in the form: PANEL,METRIC,ORDER

              Available metrics:

                DESC

       --static-file=<extension>
              Add static file extension. e.g.: .mp3 Extensions are case sensitive.

   GEOLOCATION OPTIONS
       -g --std-geoip
              Standard GeoIP database for less memory usage.

       --geoip-database=<geofile>
              Specify path to GeoIP database file. i.e., GeoLiteCity.dat.

              If using GeoIP2, you will need to download the GeoLite2 City or Country database from MaxMind.com and use the option --geoip-database to specify the database. You can also get updated data‐
              base files for GeoIP legacy, you can find these as GeoLite Legacy Databases from MaxMind.com. IPv4 and IPv6 files are supported as well. For updated DB URLs, please see the default GoAccess
              configuration file.

              Note: --geoip-city-data is an alias of --geoip-database.

   OTHER OPTIONS
       -h --help
              The help.

       -s --storage
              Display current storage method. i.e., B+ Tree, Hash.

       -V --version
              Display version information and exit.

       --dcf  Display the path of the default config file when `-p` is not used.

   PERSISTENCE STORAGE OPTIONS
       --persist
              Persist parsed data into disk. If database files exist, files will be overwritten. This should be set to the first dataset. See examples below.

       --restore
              Load previously stored data from disk. If reading persisted data only, the database files need to exist. See --persist and examples below.

       --db-path=<dir>
              Path where the on-disk database files are stored. The default value is the /tmp directory.

CUSTOM LOG/DATE FORMAT
       GoAccess can parse virtually any web log format.

       Predefined options include, Common Log Format (CLF), Combined Log Format (XLF/ELF), including virtual host, Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution), Google Cloud Storage and W3C format (IIS).

       GoAccess allows any custom format string as well.

       There are two ways to configure the log format.  The easiest is to run GoAccess with -c to prompt a configuration window. Otherwise, it can be configured under ~/.goaccessrc or the %sysconfdir%.

       time-format
              The time-format variable followed by a space, specifies the log format time containing any combination of regular characters and special format specifiers.  They all begin with a percentage
              (%) sign. See `man strftime`.  %T or %H:%M:%S.

              Note: If a timestamp is given in microseconds, %f must be used as time-format or %* if the timestamp is given in milliseconds.

       date-format
              The  date-format variable followed by a space, specifies the log format date containing any combination of regular characters and special format specifiers. They all begin with a percentage
              (%) sign. See `man strftime`. e.g., %Y-%m-%d.

              Note: If a timestamp is given in microseconds, %f must be used as date-format or %* if the timestamp is given in milliseconds.

       log-format
              The log-format variable followed by a space or \t , specifies the log format string.

       %x     A date and time field matching the time-format and date-format variables. This is used when given a timestamp or the date & time are concatenated as a single  string  (e.g.,  1501647332  or
              20170801235000) instead of the date and time being in two separated variables.

       %t     time field matching the time-format variable.

       %d     date field matching the date-format variable.

       %v     The canonical Server Name of the server serving the request (Virtual Host).

       %e     This is the userid of the person requesting the document as determined by HTTP authentication.

       %C     The cache status of the object the server served.

       %h     host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6)

       %r     The  request line from the client. This requires specific delimiters around the request (as single quotes, double quotes, or anything else) to be parsable. If not, we have to use a combina‐
              tion of special format specifiers as %m %U %H.

       %q     The query string.

       %m     The request method.

       %U     The URL path requested.

              Note: If the query string is in %U, there is no need to use %q.  However, if the URL path, does not include any query string, you may use %q and the query string will be appended to the re‐
              quest.

       %H     The request protocol.

       %s     The status code that the server sends back to the client.

       %b     The size of the object returned to the client.

       %R     The "Referrer" HTTP request header.

       %u     The user-agent HTTP request header.

       %K     The TLS encryption settings chosen for the connection. (In Apache LogFormat: %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x)

       %k     The TLS encryption settings chosen for the connection. (In Apache LogFormat: %{SSL_CIPHER}x)

       %M     The MIME-type of the requested resource. (In Apache LogFormat: %{Content-Type}o)

       %D     The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds as a decimal number.

       %T     The time taken to serve the request, in seconds with milliseconds resolution.

       %L     The time taken to serve the request, in milliseconds as a decimal number.

       %n     The time taken to serve the request, in nanoseconds.

       %^     Ignore this field.

       %~     Move forward through the log string until a non-space (!isspace) char is found.

       ~h     The host (the client IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6) in a X-Forwarded-For (XFF) field.

              It uses a special specifier which consists of a tilde before the host specifier, followed by the character(s) that delimit the XFF field, which are enclosed by curly braces. i.e., "~h{, }

              For example, "~h{, }" is used in order to parse "11.25.11.53, 17.68.33.17" field which is delimited by a comma and a space (enclosed by double quotes).

              ┌──────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┐
              │ XFF field                            │ specifier │

              └──────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┘

       Note: In order to get the average, cumulative and maximum time served in GoAccess, you will need to start logging response times in your web server. In Nginx you can add $request_time to your  log
       format, or %D in Apache.

       Important: If multiple time served specifiers are used at the same time, the first option specified in the format string will take priority over the other specifiers.

       GoAccess requires the following fields:

              %h a valid IPv4/6

              %d a valid date

              %r the request

EXAMPLES
       Note: Piping data into GoAccess won't prompt a log/date/time configuration dialog, you will need to previously define it in your configuration file or in the command line.

   DIFFERENT OUTPUTS
       To output to a terminal and generate an interactive report:

              # goaccess access.log

       To generate an HTML report:

              # goaccess access.log -a -o report.html

       To generate a JSON report:

              # goaccess access.log -a -d -o report.json

       To generate a CSV file:

              # goaccess access.log --no-csv-summary -o report.csv

       GoAccess also allows great flexibility for real-time filtering and parsing. For instance, to quickly diagnose issues by monitoring logs since goaccess was started:

              # tail -f access.log | goaccess -

       And even better, to filter while maintaining opened a pipe to preserve real-time analysis, we can make use of tail -f and a matching pattern tool such as grep, awk, sed, etc:

              # tail -f access.log | grep -i --line-buffered 'firefox' | goaccess --log-format=COMBINED -

       or to parse from the beginning of the file while maintaining the pipe opened and applying a filter

              # tail -f -n +0 access.log | grep -i --line-buffered 'firefox' | goaccess --log-format=COMBINED -o report.html --real-time-html -

       or to convert the log date timezone to a different timezone, e.g., Europe/Berlin

              # goaccess access.log --log-format='%h %^[%x] "%r" %s %b "%R" "%u"' --datetime-format='%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z' --tz=Europe/Berlin --date-spec=min

   MULTIPLE LOG FILES
       There are several ways to parse multiple logs with GoAccess. The simplest is to pass multiple log files to the command line:

              # goaccess access.log access.log.1

       It's even possible to parse files from a pipe while reading regular files:

              # cat access.log.2 | goaccess access.log access.log.1 -

       Note that the single dash is appended to the command line to let GoAccess know that it should read from the pipe.

       Now  if  we want to add more flexibility to GoAccess, we can do a series of pipes. For instance, if we would like to process all compressed log files access.log.*.gz in addition to the current log
       file, we can do:

              # zcat access.log.*.gz | goaccess access.log -

       Note: On Mac OS X, use gunzip -c instead of zcat.

   REAL TIME HTML OUTPUT
       GoAccess has the ability to output real-time data in the HTML report. You can even email the HTML file since it is composed of a single file with no external file dependencies, how neat is that!

       The process of generating a real-time HTML report is very similar to the process of creating a static report. Only --real-time-html is needed to make it real-time.

              # goaccess access.log -o /usr/share/nginx/html/site/report.html --real-time-html

       By default, GoAccess will use the host name of the generated report.  Optionally, you can specify the URL to which the client's browser will connect to. See https://goaccess.io/faq for a more  de‐
       tailed example.

              # goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --ws-url=goaccess.io

       By default, GoAccess listens on port 7890, to use a different port other than 7890, you can specify it as (make sure the port is opened):

              # goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --port=9870

       And to bind the WebSocket server to a different address other than 0.0.0.0, you can specify it as:

              # goaccess access.log -o report.html --real-time-html --addr=127.0.0.1

       Note: To output real time data over a TLS/SSL connection, you need to use --ssl-cert=<cert.crt> and --ssl-key=<priv.key>.

   WORKING WITH DATES
       Another useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log

       The following will get all HTTP requests starting on 05/Dec/2010 until the end of the file.

              # sed -n '/05Dec2010/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a -

       or using relative dates such as yesterdays or tomorrows day:

              # sed -n '/'$(date '+%d%b%Y' -d '1 week ago')'/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a -

       If we want to parse only a certain time-frame from DATE a to DATE b, we can do:

              # sed -n '/5Nov2010/,/5Dec2010/ p' access.log | goaccess -a -

       If we want to preserve only certain amount of data and recycle storage, we can keep only a certain number of days. For instance to keep & show the last 5 days:

              # goaccess access.log --keep-last=5

   VIRTUAL HOSTS
       Assuming your log contains the virtual host (server blocks) field. For instance:

              vhost.com:80 10.131.40.139 - - [02/Mar/2016:08:14:04 -0600] "GET /shop/bag-p-20 HTTP/1.1" 200 6715 "-" "Apache (internal dummy connection)"

       And you would like to append the virtual host to the request in order to see which virtual host the top urls belong to

              awk '$8=$1$8' access.log | goaccess -a -

       To exclude a list of virtual hosts you can do the following:

              # grep -v "`cat exclude_vhost_list_file`" vhost_access.log | goaccess -

   FILES & STATUS CODES
       To parse specific pages, e.g., page views, html, htm, php, etc. within a request:

              # awk '$7~/.html|.htm|.php/' access.log | goaccess -

       Note,  $7 is the request field for the common and combined log format, (without Virtual Host), if your log includes Virtual Host, then you probably want to use $8 instead. It's best to check which
       field you are shooting for, e.g.:

              # tail -10 access.log | awk '{print $8}'

       Or to parse a specific status code, e.g., 500 (Internal Server Error):

              # awk '$9~/500/' access.log | goaccess -

   SERVER
       Also, it is worth pointing out that if we want to run GoAccess at lower priority, we can run it as:

              # nice -n 19 goaccess -f access.log -a

       and if you don't want to install it on your server, you can still run it from your local machine:

              # ssh -n root@server 'tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log' | goaccess -

       Note: SSH requires -n so GoAccess can read from stdin. Also, make sure to use SSH keys for authentication as it won't work if a passphrase is required.

   INCREMENTAL LOG PROCESSING
       GoAccess has the ability to process logs incrementally through its internal storage and dump its data to disk. It works in the following way:

       1  A dataset must be persisted first with --persist, then the same dataset can be loaded with

       2  --restore.  If new data is passed (piped or through a log file), it will append it to the original dataset.

       NOTES

       GoAccess keeps track of inodes of all the files processed (assuming files will stay on the same partition), in addition, it extracts a snippet of data from the log along with the last line  parsed
       of each file and the timestamp of the last line parsed. e.g., inode:29627417|line:20012|ts:20171231235059

       First  it  compares  if  the  snippet matches the log being parsed, if it does, it assumes the log hasn't changed dramatically, e.g., hasn't been truncated. If the inode does not match the current
       file, it parses all lines. If the current file matches the inode, it then reads the remaining lines and updates the count of lines parsed and the timestamp. As an extra precaution, it won't  parse
       log lines with a timestamp ≤ than the one stored.

       Piped data works based off the timestamp of the last line read. For instance, it will parse and discard all incoming entries until it finds a timestamp >= than the one stored.

       For instance:

              // last month access log
              # goaccess access.log.1 --persist

       then, load it with

              // append this month access log, and preserve new data
              # goaccess access.log --restore --persist

       To read persisted data only (without parsing new data)

              # goaccess --restore

NOTES
       Each  active  panel  has  a  total  of 366 items or 50 in the real-time HTML report.  The number of items is customizable using max-items Note that HTML, CSV and JSON output allow a maximum number
       greater than the default value of 366 items per panel.

       A hit is a request (line in the access log), e.g., 10 requests = 10 hits. HTTP requests with the same IP, date, and user agent are considered a unique visit.

       If you want to enable dual-stack support, please use --addr=:: instead of the default --addr=0.0.0.0.

       The generated report will attempt to reconnect to the WebSocket server after 1 second with exponential backoff. It will attempt to connect 20 times.
