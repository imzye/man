NAME
       pdb2mdb - Program Database to Mono Debugging Symbol converter.

SYNOPSIS
       pdb2mdb pdb_file

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is used to convert debugging symbols generated by Microsoft's
       compilers into debugging symbols that can be consumed  by  Mono's  run‐
       time.

       Program  Database  files are files that end with the extension .pdb and
       are associated with a library or executable  (a  .dll  or  .exe  file).
       This format was until recently not documented so Mono used its own file
       format for storing debugging information, the Mono debugging format.

       Just like PDB files Mono Debugging information is stored in files  that
       reside side-by-side with a program executable or a library.

       You  can  use  the  pdb2mdb  tool to transform these PDB files into MDB
       files that Mono can then consume to debug programs or provide line-num‐
       ber information for stack traces or exceptions.

LICENSE
       The  pdb2mdb  tool is  released under the terms of the Microsoft Public
       License (MS-PL).  JB Evain wrote the tool.   The  PDB  reading  support
       came from Microsoft Common Compiler Infrastructure.
