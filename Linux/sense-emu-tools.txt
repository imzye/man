NAME
       sense_csv - Sense HAT CSV conversion tool

       Converts a Sense HAT recording to CSV format, for the purposes of debugging or analysis.

SYNOPSIS
          sense_csv [-h] [--version] [-q] [-v] [-l FILE] [-P]
                    [--timestamp-format TIMESTAMP_FORMAT] [--header] input output

DESCRIPTION
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --version
              show this program's version number and exit

       -q, --quiet
              produce less console output

       -v, --verbose
              produce more console output

       -l FILE, --log-file FILE
              log messages to the specified file

       -P, --pdb
              run under PDB (debug mode)

       --timestamp-format FMT
              the format to use when outputting the record timestamp (default: ISO8601 format, which is "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f"; see strftime(3) for information on valid format parameters)

       --header
              if specified, output column headers at the start of the output

EXAMPLES
       To convert a recording to CSV, simply run sense_csv with the recorded file as the first filename, and the output CSV file as the second:

          $ sense_csv experiment.hat experiment.csv

       By default, only the data is output, with the columns defined as follows:

       1.  Timestamp - the moment in time at which the readings were taken (note that as the Pi lacks a real-time clock, this is likely to be inaccurate unless the clock has been set with NTP).

       2.  Pressure - the reading from the pressure sensor in hectopascals (hPa).

       3.  Temperature - the temperature reading from the pressure sensor in degrees celsius (°C).

       4.  Humidity - the reading from the humidity sensor in % humidity.

       5.  Temperature - the temperature reading from the humidity sensor in degrees celsius (°C).

       6.  Accelerometer X-axis - the acceleration reading along the X-axis of the HAT in g.

       7.  Accelerometer Y-axis.

       8.  Accelerometer Z-axis.

       9.  Gyroscope X-axis - the angular rate of change around the X-axis of the HAT in degrees per second.

       10. Gyroscope Y-axis.

       11. Gyroscope Z-axis.

       12. Compass X-axis - the magnetometer reading along the X-axis in micro-teslas.

       13. Compass Y-axis.

       14. Compass Z-axis.

       15. Orientation X-axis - the computed orientation of the HAT as radians rotation (-π to +π) about the X-axis.

       16. Orientation Y-axis.

       17. Orientation Z-axis.

       If you wish to include column headers as the first row of data, simply specify the --header option:

          $ sense_csv --header experiment.hat experiment.csv

       If - is specified for either filename, sense_csv will read from stdin, or write to stdout. This can be used in conjunction with other standard command line utilities for all sorts of effects.
       For example, to produce a CSV file containing only the timestamps, humidity, and accelerometer readings:

          $ sense_csv --header experiment.hat - | cut -d, -f1,4,6-8 > experiment.csv
