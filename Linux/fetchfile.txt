NAME
       fetchfile - fetch file(s) via O-SAFT protocol

SYNOPSIS
       fetchfile [ -46lakdPriqQvVI ] [ -f user ] [ -s [user@]server ] [ -C[wr]=conffile ] filename

       fetchfile [ -lakdPriqQvVI ] [ -f user ] [ -s [user@]server ] [ -C[wr]=conffile ] -n filenumber

DESCRIPTION
       fetchfile fetches files from a SAFT server to the local user spool.

       In  the  SAFT  server  spool there must lay your sendfile public key to identify yourself. This key can be generated by the fetchfile -I command and has to be transfered to the SAFT server at the very
       first time.  This prevents other people to steal your files.

       You may list or fetch your files from the server. But remember, they are stored first in your local sendfile spool. You have to call receive to really receive them to your current directory.

OPTIONS
       -4, -6  Explicitly force  IPv4 or IPv6 connections.  By default, the program will try to resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol automatically. If resolving  a  host  name  returns
               both IPv4  and  IPv6  addresses, fetchfile will try to use the adresses in the order they are returned by the resolver.

       -l      Only list the files on the server.

       -a      Fetch all files.

       -k      Keep files on server after fetching.

       -d      Delete files without receiving.

       -n      Specify the file number instead of the file name.

       -r      Call receive automaticly afterwards.

       -f user Restrict file selection to this specifc user.

       -V      Show version information and exit.

       -v      Be verbose and show SAFT protocol messages.

       -P      Send files to stdout directly.

       -i      Ignore testing whether file has been already fetched.

       -q      Quiet mode 1: print no transfer messages.

       -Q      Quiet mode 2: print no transfer, information or warning messages.

       -I      Initialize fetchfile and the pgp key pair.

       -s [user@]host
               Specify an alternate saft server and/or alternate user.

       -Cr=conffile
               Read configuration file "config" or "restrictions" from server.

       -Cw=conffile
               Write configuration file "config" or "restrictions" to server.
