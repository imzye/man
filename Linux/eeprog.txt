NAME
       eeprog - reads and writes 24Cxx EEPROMs connected to I2C serial bus

SYNOPSIS
       eeprog [-fqxdh] [-16|-8] [-r addr[:count]|-w addr] <device> <i2c-addr>

DESCRIPTION
       eeprog uses the SMBus protocol used by most of the recent chipsets.

NOTE
       Don't forget to load your i2c chipset and the i2c-dev drivers.

       The following environment variables could be set instead of the command line arguments:

           EEPROG_DEV              device
           EEPROG_I2C_ADDR         i2c-addr

PARAMETERS
       Address modes

       -8     Use 8bit address mode for 24c0x...24C16 [default]

       -16    Use 16bit address mode for 24c32...24C256

       Actions

       -r addr[:count]
              Read count (1 if omitted) bytes from addr and print them to the standard output

       -w addr
              Write input (stdin) at address addr of the EEPROM

       -h     Print this help

       Options

       -x     Set hex output mode

       -d     Dummy mode, display what *would* have been done

       -f     Disable warnings and don't ask confirmation

       -q     Quiet mode

       Bus

       device Device file representing the I2C bus (eg. /dev/i2c-0)

       i2c-addr
              I2C bus address of the EEPROM (eg. 0x3A)

EXAMPLES
       Read 64 bytes from the EEPROM at address 0x54 on bus 0 starting at address 123 (decimal)

            eeprog /dev/i2c-0 0x54 -r 123:64

       Print the hex codes of the first 32 bytes read from bus 1 at address 0x22

            eeprog /dev/i2c-1 0x51 -x -r 0x22:0x20

       Write the current timestamp at address 0x200 of the EEPROM on bus 0 at address 0x33

            date | eeprog /dev/i2c-0 0x33 -w 0x200
