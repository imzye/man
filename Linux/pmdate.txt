PMDATE(1)                   General Commands Manual                  PMDATE(1)

NAME
       pmdate - display an offset date

SYNOPSIS
       pmdate [offset ...]  format

DESCRIPTION
       pmdate displays the current date and/or time, with an optional offset.

       An  offset  is specified with a leading sign (``+'' or ``-''), followed
       by an integer value, followed by one of the following ``scale''  speci‐
       fiers;

       S      seconds
       M      minutes
       H      hours
       d      days
       m      months
       y      years

       The  output  format  follows  the  same  rules as for date(1) and strf‐
       time(3).

       For example, the following will display the date a  week  ago  as  DDM‐
       MYYYY;
               pmdate -7d %d%m%Y

PCP ENVIRONMENT
       Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the
       file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installation,  the  file
       /etc/pcp.conf  contains  the  local  values  for  these variables.  The
       $PCP_CONF variable may be used to specify an alternative  configuration
       file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
