NAME
       owtap - Packet sniffer for the owserver protocol

SYNOPSIS
       owtap -p owtap-tcp-port -s owserver-tcp-port

DESCRIPTION
   1-Wire
       1-wire is a wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector scheme where the data line can also provide
       power.

       Each  device  is  uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage, contact, current), switches,
       timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also 1-wire devices that have encryption included.

       The 1-wire scheme uses a single bus master and multiple slaves on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be individually discovered  and  addressed  using  their
       unique ID.

       Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB adapters.

   OWFS design
       OWFS  is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual filesystem, with the unique ID being the direc‐
       tory, and the individual properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.

       Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or  control  ap‐
       plications.  There  are  some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundamental
       goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness rather than speed.

   owserver
       owserver (1) is the backend component of the OWFS 1-wire bus control system.  owserver (1) arbitrates access to the bus from multiple client processes. The physical bus is usually connected  to  a
       serial or USB port, and other processes connect to owserver (1) over network sockets (tcp port).

       Frontend clients include a filesystem representation: owfs (1) , and a webserver: owhttpd (1).  Direct language bindings are also available, e.g: owperl (3).

       There are also many light-weight clients that can only talk to owserver (1) and not to the 1-Wire bus directly. They include shell and multiple language modules (perl, Visual Basic, python,...)

   owserver protocol
       All the owserver (1) clients use the owserver protocol for communication. The owserver protocol is a well documented tcp/ip client/server protocol. Assigned the "well known port" default of 4304.

   owtap
       owtap  (1)  is  interposed between owserver (1) and clients, to display and help resolve communication problems. Network communication is forwarded in both directions, but a visual display is also
       created, with statistics and "drill-down" of individual packets.

SPECIFIC OPTIONS
   -p
       TCP port or IPaddress:port for owtap
       Other OWFS programs will access owtap via this address. (e.g. owdir -s IP:port /)

   -s
       TCP port or IPaddress:port for owserver
       The tcp port (IP:port) for the "upstream" owserver.

EXAMPLE
       If owserver (1) is started:
       owserver -p 4304 -d /dev/ttyS0
       owserver on tcp port 4304 and connects to a physical 1-wire bus on a serial port.

       You can directly query owserver (1) with
       owdir -s 4304 /

       To see the protocol in action:
       owtap -s 4304 -p 3000
       owdir -p 3000 /

       In this case owtap (1) is connecting to owserver (1) on the original port (4304) and offering a new port (3000) for clients.

PLATFOMS
       owtap (1) is a pure Tcl/TK program and will run wherever Tcl/TK is available (Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Unix)
