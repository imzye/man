NAME
       jpegparse - JPEG parse program

SYNOPSIS
       If only an input file is supplied, will dump rather than copy.

       If a decompressed output file is supplied, will write in big endian if precision greater than 8, and will appended component number before file extension iff more than one component.

       two or three parameters, the input file, the copied compressed output file, and the decompressed output file

DESCRIPTION
       A command line tool to parse a JPEG bitstream

       Includes the ability to selectively redact blocks and leave other blocks alone, to permit "lossless" redaction.

       Includes the ability to decompress lossless JPEG.

       Development of this class was supported by funding from MDDX Research and Informatics.
