NAME
       pystache3 - Render a mustache template with the given context.

SYNOPSIS
       pystache3 [options] sub-command [sub-cmd-options] [infile]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the pystache3 commands.

       Pystache3  is  a  Python3  implementation  of Mustache. Mustache is a framework-agnostic, logic-free templating system inspired by ctemplate and et. Like ctemplate, Mustache "emphasizes separating
       logic from presentation: it is impossible to embed application logic in this template language."

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the Info files.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

              A filename or template string.

       context
