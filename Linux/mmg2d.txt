DESCRIPTION
     The mmg2d application is dedicated to bidimensional triangular mesh remeshing.

     By default it improve the mesh quality with respect to its initial size.
     Providing a metric file, it adapts the mesh to the prescribed sizes at nodes.  -ls option allows to explicitly mesh an implicit domain.
     Without metric file, the -optim option allow to improve the mesh quality with respect to the initial mesh size.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
     1.   Generic options:
          -h                      Print help.
          -v ⟨n⟩                  Tune level of verbosity.
                                  Takes values between -1 and 10.
          -m ⟨n⟩                  Set maximal memory size to n MBytes.
          -d                      Turn on debug mode.
          -default                Write a local parameter file (with extension .mmg2d) with setted values.
          -val                    Print the default parameters values.

     2.   File specifications:
          -in ⟨mesh_file⟩         Input triangulation.
          -out ⟨output_file⟩      Output triangulation.
          -sol ⟨solution_file⟩    Load metric, level-set or displacement file.
          -met ⟨metric_file⟩      Load metric file in level-set mode.

     3.   Mode specifications (default is mesh adaptation):
          -lag ⟨n⟩                Lagrangian mesh displacement according to mode 0 ( n=0 ), 1 ( n=1 ) or 2 ( n=2 ). This option is only available with the USE_ELAS compilation flag. The LinearElasticity li‐
                                  brary must be founded to activate this flag.
          -ls x                   Create mesh of isovalue x (0.0 if x is not provided).

     4.   Parameters:
          -A                      Enable anisotropy (without metric file).
          -ar ⟨x⟩ | -nr           Threshold for angle detection or sharp features detection disabling.

          -rmc x                  Remove componants whose volumic fraction is less than x (1.e-5 if x is not provided) of the whole mesh volume (level-set mode).
          -opnbdy                 Preserve input edges at the interface of two domains of the same reference.
          -noinsert               No point insertion/deletion.
          -nomove                 No point relocation

          -3dMedit ⟨n⟩            Write and/or read Medit mesh file in 3D.  If val=1 write the 2D mesh in 3D. If val=2 read an write 2D mesh in 3D.

RETURN VALUES
     mmg2d returns:
     •   the 0 value if successful;
     •   the 1 value if the process fail but can save a conform mesh;
     •   the 2 value if the process fail and can't save a comform mesh.
