NAME
       xtv - Grabs the screen of a remote X display

SYNOPSIS
       xtv [options]

DESCRIPTION
       xtv grabs the screen of a remote X display to which you have access. It can then continual refresh that screen grab, making a "TV" out of that display.

OPTIONS
       -h     Prints out the usage

       -s refresh_timeout
              How often to update the screen grab.

       -d display
              The display to grab the screen from.

BUGS
       You can't grab the screen from a display of differing bit-depth. Due to the nature of X and what not, this would be particularly difficult to fix.
