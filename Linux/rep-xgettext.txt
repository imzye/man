NAME
       rep-xgettext - extract i18n strings from lisp scripts.

SYNOPSIS
       rep-xgettext [ --include DEFINER ] [ --c  ] [ --pot  ]

DESCRIPTION
       rep-xgettext The usual method of constructing message catalogue templates (.pot files) is to run xgettext on the C source files of the program (that have been annotated for i18n).  librep provides the
       rep-xgettext program to perform the same task for files of Lisp code.

OPTIONS

              include DEFINER. This is not documented by upstream.

       --c    This makes it output pseudo C code containing the string constants found.

       --pot  This makes it output in standart .pot file.

SEE ALSO
