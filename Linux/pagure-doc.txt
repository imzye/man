NAME
       pagure - Pagure Documentation

       Pagure is a light-weight git-centered forge based on pygit2.

       Features:

       • Open-sources: Web-interface for the git repositories

       • Flexibility: Ability to create any project you want

       • One place: Keep your documentation and tickets in pagure

       • Collaboration: Fork a project and make a pull-request

       • Integration: Create pull-request from a fork hosted somewhere else than in pagure

       • Open data: Sources, doc, ticket and pull-requests meta-data are available in the web interface but also in git repos which can thus be cloned and changed locally.

       • Freedom: Pagure is fully Free and Open-Source Software!

       Resources:

       • Home page

       • Git repository

       • Github mirror

OVERVIEW
       Pagure is split over multiple components, each having their purpose and all but two (the core web application and its workers) being optional.

       These components are:

   Contents
       • Overview

         • Pagure core application

         • Pagure workers

         • Gitolite

         • Pagure doc server

         • Pagure milter

         • Pagure EventSource Server

         • Pagure web-hook Server

         • Pagure load JSON service

         • Pagure log com service

       Before going into the overall picture, one should realize that most of the components listed above are optional.

       Here is a diagram representing pagure without all the optional components:

       And here is a diagram of all the components together: .SS Pagure core application

       The  core  application  is  the  flask application interacting with gitolite to provide a web UI to the git repositories as well as tickets and pull-requests.  This is the main application for the
       forge.

   Pagure workers
       Interacting with git repos can be a long process, it varies depending on the size of the repository itself but also based on hardware performances or simply the load on the system.  To make pagure
       capable of handling more load, since pagure 3.0 the interactions with the git repositories from the web UI is performed by dedicated workers, allowing async processing of the different tasks.

       The communication between the core application and its worker is based on celery and defaults to using redis but any of the queueing system supported by celery could be used instead.

   Gitolite
       Currently pagure uses gitolite to grant or deny ssh access to the git repositories, in other words to grant or deny read and/or write access to the git repositories.

       Pagure supports cloning over both ssh and http, but writing can only be done via ssh, through gitolite.

   Pagure doc server
       While integrated into the main application at first, it has been split out for security concern, displaying information directly provided by the user without a clear/safe way of filtering for  un‐
       safe  script  or  hacks is a security hole.  For this reason we also strongly encourage anyone wanting to deploy their own instance of pagure with the doc server, to run this application on a com‐
       pletely different domain name (not just a sub-domain) in order to reduce the cross-site forgery risks.

       Pagure can be run just fine without the doc server, all you need to do is to not define the variable DOC_APP_URL in the configuration file.

   Pagure milter
       The milter is a script, receiving an email as input and performing an action with it.

       In the case of pagure, the milter is used to allow replying on a comment of a ticket or a pull-request by directly replying to the notification sent.  No need to go to the page anymore to reply to
       a comment someone made.

       The milter integrates with a MTA such as postfix or sendmail that you will have running and have access to in order to change its configuration.

   Pagure EventSource Server
       Eventsource or Server Sent Events are messages sent from a server to a browser.

       For pagure this technology is used to allow live-refreshing of a page when someone is viewing it. For example, while you are reading a ticket if someone comments on it, the comment will  automati‐
       cally show up on the page without the need for you to reload the entire page.

       The  flow  is: the main pagure server does an action, sends a message over redis, the eventsource server picks it up and send it to the browsers waiting for it, then javascript code is executed to
       refresh the page based on the information received.

   Pagure web-hook Server
       Sends notifications to third party services using POST http requests.

       This is the second notifications system in pagure with fedmsg.  These notifications are running on their own service to prevent blocking the main web application in case the third part service  is
       timing-out or just being slow.

       The flow is: the main pagure server does an action, sends a message over redis, the web-hook server picks it up, build the query and performs the POST request to the specified URLs.

   Pagure load JSON service
       The  load  JSON  service  is  an async service updating the database based on information pushed to the ticket or pull-request git repositories.  This allows updating the database with information
       pushed to the git repositories without keeping the connection open with the client.

   Pagure log com service
       The log com (for log commit) service is an async service updating the log table of the database on every pushed made to any repository allowing to build the data for  the  calendar  heatmap  graph
       displayed on every user's page.

USAGE
       Using  pagure should come fairly easily, especially to people already used to forges such as GitHub or GitLab. There are however some tips and tricks which can be useful to know and that this sec‐
       tion of the doc covers.

       One of the major difference with GitHub and GitLab is that for each project on pagure, four git repositories are made available:

       • A git repository containing the source code, displayed in the main section of the pagure project.

       • A git repository for the documentation

       • A git repository for the issues and their metadata

       • A git repository for the metadata for pull-requests

       Issues and pull-requests repositories contain the meta-data (comments, notifications, assignee...) from the issues and pull-request. They are are not public and only available to admins  and  com‐
       mitters of the project, since they may contain private information.

       You  can use these repositories for offline access to your tickets or pull-requests (the pag-off project for example relies on a local copy of the issue git repository). They are designed to allow
       you to have full access to all the data about your project.  One of the original idea was also to allow syncing a project between multiple pagure instances by syncing these  git  repositories  be‐
       tween the instances.

       You  can  find the URLs to access or clone these git repositories on the overview page of the project. On the top right of the page, in the drop-down menu entitled Clone. Beware that if documenta‐
       tion, the issue tracker or the pull-requests are disabled on the project, the corresponding URL will not be shown.

   First Steps on pagure
       When coming to pagure for the first time there are a few things one should do or check to ensure all works as desired.

   Log in to pagure or create your account
       Pagure has its own user account system.

       For instances of pagure such as the one at pagure.io where the authentication is delegated to a third party (in the case of pagure.io, the Fedora Account System) via OpenID, the local user account
       is created upon login.

       This means, you cannot be added to a group or a project before you log in for the first time as the system will simply not know you.

       If you run your own pagure instance which uses the local authentication system, then you will find on the login page an option to create a new account.

   Upload your SSH key
       Pagure uses gitolite to manage who has read/write access to which git repository via ssh.

       An ssh key is composed of two parts:

       • a private key, which you must keep to yourself and never share with anyone.

       • a public key, which is public and therefore can be shared with anyone.

       If you have never generated a ssh key, you can do so by running:

          ssh-keygen

       or alternatively on GNOME using the application seahorse.

       This will create two files in ~/.ssh/ (~ is the symbol for your home folder).

       These two files will be named (for example) id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.  The first one is the private key that must never be shared. The second is the public key that can be uploaded on pagure to  give
       you ssh access.

       To upload your public key onto pagure:

       1. Log in to pagure and click on the user icon on the top right corner, there, select My settings.

       2. In the authentication section of your user settings copy the content of your id_rsa.pub file in the Public SSH key text box and save your ssh key settings.  .sp NOTE:
          Pagure  supports  multiple ssh keys per user. To add more than one ssh key to your user account just add your new ssh key in your authentication settings (one key per row), this way you will be
          able to push commits to your repository from a different computer.

   Configure the default email address
       If the pagure instance you use is using local user authentication, you can choose whichever email address you prefer to use during account creation.  But in the case  (like  pagure.io)  where  the
       pagure instance relies on an external authentication service, the email address provided by this service may be different from the one you prefer.

       The settings page of your account (see above for how to access the page) allows you to add multiple email addresses and set one as default.

       Your default email address is the address that will be used to send you notifications and also as the email address in the git commit if you merge a pull-request with a merge commit.

       For online editing, when doing the commit, you will be presented with the list of valid email addresses associated with your account and you will be able to choose which one you wish to use.

       NOTE:
          All email addresses will need to be confirmed to be activated, this is done via a link sent by email to the address. If you do not receive this link, don't forget to check your spam folder!

   Forks
       A  fork in Pagure is a copy of a repository. When contributing to a project on Pagure, the first step is to fork it. This gives you a place to make changes to the project and, if you so wish, con‐
       tribute back to the original project.  If you're not already familiar with Git's distributed workflow, the Pro Git book has an excellent introduction.

       You can see a list of projects you've forked on your home page.

   Create a Fork on Pagure
       To fork a project, simply navigate to the project on Pagure and click the fork button. You will then be redirected to your new fork.

   Configure your Local Git Repository
       Now that you have forked the project on Pagure, you're ready to configure a local copy of the repository so you can get to work. First, clone the repository. The URL for the repository is  on  the
       right-hand side of the project overview page. For example:

          $ git clone ssh://git@pagure.io/forks/jcline/pagure.git
          $ cd pagure

       After cloning your fork locally, it's a good idea to add the upstream repository as a git remote. For example:

          $ git remote add -f upstream ssh://git@pagure.io/pagure.git

       This lets you pull in changes that the upstream repository makes after you forked. Consult Git's documentation for more details.

   Pushing Changes
       After you Configure your Local Git Repository you're ready to make your changes and contribute them upstream. First, start a new branch:

          $ git checkout -b my-feature-or-bugfix

       It's a good idea to give the branch a descriptive name so you can find it later.  Next, make your changes. Once you're satisfied, add the changes to Git's staging area and commit the changes:

          $ git add -A  # add all changes
          $ git commit -s # prepare changes for upload

       Your text editor of choice will open and you can write your commit message.  If you have not done so already Upload your SSH key now.  Afterwards, you are ready to push your changes to your remote
       fork:

          $ git push -u origin my-feature-or-bugfix # upload changes

       In case you cloned the repo via HTTP, for example using a command like git clone https://..., the push will fail. Pagure.io does not support pushing over HTTP. An easy workaround is to use:

          $ git push -u origin my-feature-or-bugfix ssh://git@pagure.io/forks/jcline/pagure.git

       You are now ready to Open a Pull Request.

   Understanding Read Only Mode of projects
       If  a  project  is in Read Only Mode, the users of the project may not be able to modify the git repository of the project. Let's say you forked a project, then the forked project goes into a read
       only mode. You won't be able to modify the git repository of the forked project in that mode.  After the read only mode is gone, you can begin to use the git repository again. Let's say you decide
       to add another user to your fork, this time the project will go in read only mode again but, you still will be able to use the git repository while the new user will have to  wait  for  read  only
       mode  to  get  over. This is also true when you remove a user from your project. The removed user can still access the project's git repository, given that he had at least commit access, until the
       read only mode is over.

       In Pagure, we use gitolite for Access Control Lists when using SSH.  Modifying gitolite may be a time taking task (depending on number of projects hosted on the pagure instance) that's why  Pagure
       does it outside of HTTP Request-Response Cycle.

       Whenever you fork a project or add/remove a new user/group to project, gitolite needs to be refreshed in order to put those changes in effect for ssh based git usage.

   Actions that put the project in read only mode
       All the actions that needs gitolite to be compiled, will bring the project in read only mode.

       • Creating/Forking a project. (only the fork will be in read only mode)

       • Adding/Removing a user/group from a project.

   HTTP PUSH
       When using git push over http against a pagure instance, there are two situations to distinguish.

   Git push over http with API token
       This  is  going  to  be the most supported approach. Any user can generate API tokens with the commit ACL which reads in the UI as: Commit to a git repository via http(s).  These API tokens can be
       specific to a project if generated in the settings page of the project, or generic to all projects if generated in the user's settings page.  In either case, they will no work if the user does not
       have at commit access to the project.

       Once the API token has been generate, the user needs to enter it with git prompts for a password (instead of their actual password).

       For example:

          $ git push
          username: pingou
          password: ABC123...

   Git push over http with Username & Password
       This is only supported on pagure instance that are using the local authentication system (ie: where pagure manages the registration of the user accounts, email confirmation, etc).

       For these pagure instances and for these only, when being prompted by git for an username and password the user can choose to enter either their username and actual password or their username  and
       an API token.

   Storing the password/token
       If  you  interact with git regularly, typing you password or API token will quickly become tiring.  Thanksfully, git has a built-in mechanism named git credential store which can take care of this
       for you.

       You can use two modes for the store, either cache or store.  - cache will cache your credential in memory for 15 minutes (by default) - store will actually store your credentials in plain text  on
       disk

       You can set this using either:

          $ git config credential.helper store
          $ git config credential.helper cache

       The timeout of the cache can be configured using:

          $ git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

       Where the timeout value is a number of seconds (so here the cache is extended to one hour).

       Finally, if you wish to use this configuration on multiple project, you can add the --global argument to these commands which will make the configuration work for all your git repo instead of just
       the one in which you run the command.

   Pull Requests
       Pagure  uses  the  concept  of  pull requests to contribute changes from your fork of a project back to the upstream project. To contribute a change to a project you first open a pull request with
       original project. The project maintainer then merges the pull request if they are satisfied with the changes you have proposed.

   Open a Pull Request
       Before you can open a pull request, you need to complete the First Steps on pagure and Create a Fork on Pagure of the project you would like to contribute to. Once you have a  fork  and  you  have
       pushed a git branch containing one or more commits, you are ready to contribute to the project.

   Pagure to Pagure pull request
       You can create a pull request from a pagure project, using one of the following options

   From the project overview
       1. Go the the overview tab of your fork.

       2. Locate your feature branch (Right hand side), and press the button New PR button.

       3. Fill the Create a pull request form (Title and Description) and create your pull request.

       Notes: The New PR button appears only if there are commits not available in the main branch.  .SS From the commits history

       1. Go to the commit tab of your fork and select your feature branch.

       2. Press the create pull request button (above the latest commits).

       3. Fill the Create a pull request form (Title and Description) and create your pull request.
       .SS From the pull requests list

       1. Go to the main project's (not your fork) pull requests list and press the File Pull Request button.

       2. Select the feature branch containing your changes from the dropdown menu.

       3. Fill the Create a pull request form (Title and Description) and create your pull request.
       .SS Remote Git to Pagure pull request

       You can create a pull request from another git hosting platform (e.g. GitHub, GitLab).  This is a remote pull request.

   From the pull requests list
       1. Go to the main project's (not your fork) pull requests list and press the File Pull Request button.

       2. Select the Remote pull-request option from the dropdown menu.

       3. Fill the New remote pull-request form (Title, Git repo address and Git branch) and create your remote pull request.

       Congratulations! It is now up to the project maintainer to accept your changes by merging them.

   Updating Your Pull Request
       It  is  likely that project maintainers will request changes to your proposed code by commenting on your pull request. Don't be discouraged! This is an opportunity to improve your contribution and
       for both reviewer and reviewee to become better programmers.

       Adding to your pull request is as simple as pushing new commits to the branch you used to create the pull request. These will automatically be displayed in the commit list for the pull request.

   Rebasing
       You may encounter a situation where you want to include changes from the master branch that were made after you created your pull request. You can do this by rebasing your pull request branch  and
       pushing it to your remote fork.

   Working with Pull Requests
       It's  quite  common to work with a pull request locally, either to build on top of it or to test it. You can do this easily using git fetch to download the pull request followed by git checkout to
       work with it as you would any local branch.  The syntax for git fetch is:

          git fetch $REMOTE pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:$BRANCHNAME

       For example, if you have PR#1 which "adds support for foo" you might run:

          git fetch origin pull/1/head:add-foo-support

       Then you can work with the add-foo-support normally:

          git checkout add-foo-support

       NOTE:
          You may use / characters in your branch name if you want to group your pull requests by the submitter name, bug number, etc.  For example, you could name your local branch user/add-foo-support.

       If you want to allow working with all of your pull requests locally, you can do so by editing your git configuration as follows.  Locate your remote in the .git/config file, for example:

          [remote "origin"]
              url = ssh://git@pagure.io/pagure.git
              fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

       Now add this line:

          fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*

       to that section as the first fetch line, like this:

          [remote "origin"]
              url = ssh://git@pagure.io/pagure.git
              fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
              fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

       Obviously, the remote URL should be matching the URL of your project (pagure project in this example).

       Now you can fetch the all the pull requests:

          $ git fetch origin
          From ssh://pagure.io/pagure
          * [new ref]        refs/pull/2541/head -> origin/pr/2541
          * [new ref]        refs/pull/2540/head -> origin/pr/2540
          * [new ref]        refs/pull/2538/head -> origin/pr/2538

       To checkout a particular pull request:

          $ git checkout pr/25413
          Branch pr/2541 set up to track remote branch pr/2541 from origin.
          Switched to a new branch 'pr/2541'

       You will now be able to use this branch to work from or on this pull requests.

       If you are only interested in one particular pull request and do not want to fetch all the project PRs, you can add to your ~/.bashrc the following function:

          function pullpr {
              remote="${2:-origin}"
              git fetch $remote pull/$1/head:pr_$1
              git checkout pr_$1
          }

       Then after sourcing your ~/.bashrc or restarting your shell, you can use the pullpr function to checkout a pull request from within the clone of the git repository.  For example checkout pull  re‐
       quest number 58 from current git clone (here the infra-docs project)

          $ source ~/.bashrc
          $ pullpr 58
          remote: Counting objects: 393, done.
          remote: Compressing objects: 100% (238/238), done.
          remote: Total 365 (delta 231), reused 255 (delta 127)
          Receiving objects: 100% (365/365), 71.36 KiB | 63.00 KiB/s, done.
          Resolving deltas: 100% (231/231), completed with 20 local objects.
          From ssh://pagure.io/infra-docs
          * [new ref]         refs/pull/58/head -> pr_58
          Switched to branch 'pr_58'

   Using Markdown in Pagure
       Pagure  uses  Markdown syntax highlighting as the base for formatting comments in issues, pull requests, and in Markdown files in repositories. For basic formatting, Pagure follows common Markdown
       formatting, but it also has some unique syntax for more advanced formatting. This help page helps demonstrate how to use Markdown in Pagure.

       Pagure relies on the Markdown python module to do the conversion.  It has enabled a few extensions:

       • Definition Lists

       • Fenced Code Blocks

       • Tables

       • Admonition

       • CodeHilite

       • Sane lists

       README files can also rely on:

       • Abbreviations

       • Footnotes

       • Table of Contents

       While comments use:

       • New Line to Break

       WARNING:
          Pagure does not support linking to remote images, if you want to link to an image on a ticket, you will have to upload it to pagure.

   Styling
       You can mark up text with bold, italics, or strikethrough.

       •

         Style: Bold

                • Syntax: ** ** or __ __

                • Example: **This is bold text**

                • Output: This is bold text

       •

         Style: Italics

                • Syntax: * * or _ _

                • Example: _This is italicized text_

                • Output: This is italicized text

       •

         Style: Strikethrough

                • Syntax: ~~ ~~

                • Example: ~~This text is no longer relevant~~

                • Output: This text is no longer relevant

       •

         Style: Bold and italics

                • Syntax: ** ** and _ _

                • Example: ** This text is the _most important thing ever_ **

                • Output: ** This text is the most important thing ever **

   Quoting

   Lists
   Unordered lists
       You can make unordered lists spanning multiple lines with either - or *.

          * Superman
          * Batman
              * Protector of Gotham City!
          * Superwoman

         Harley Quinn

                • Something on this list is unlike the others...

   Ordered lists
       You can make ordered lists by preceding each line with a number.

   Tagging users
       You can tag other users on Pagure to send them a notification about an issue or pull request. To tag a user, use the @ symbol followed by their username.  Typing the @ symbol  in  a  comment  will
       bring  up  a  list  of users that match the username. The list searches as you type. Once you see the name of the person you are looking for, you can click their name to automatically complete the
       tag.

       @jflory7, could you please review this pull request and leave feedback?

       @jflory7, could you please review this pull request and leave feedback?

   Tagging issues or pull requests
       In a comment, you can automatically link a pull request or issue by its number.  To link it, use the # character followed by its number. Like with tagging users, Pagure  will  provide  suggestions
       for issues or pull requests as you type the number. You can select the issue in the drop-down to automatically tag the issue or pull request.

       If  you  need to tag an issue or pull request that is outside of the current project, you are also able to do this. For cross-projects links, you can tag them by typing <project name>#id or <user‐
       name>/<project name>#id.

   Emoji
       Pagure natively supports emoji characters. To use emoji, you can use two colons wrapped around the emoji keyword (:emoji:). Typing a colon by itself will bring up a list of suggested emoji with  a
       small preview. If you see the one you are looking for, you can click it to automatically complete the emoji.

   Project settings
       Each project have a number of options that can be tweaked in the settings page of the project which is accessible to the person having full commits to the project.

       This page presents the different settings and there effect.

   Always merge
       This Boolean enables or disables always making a merge commit when merging a pull-request.

       When merging a pull-request in pagure there are three states:

       • fast-forward: when the commits in the pull-request can be fast-forwarded pagure signals it and just fast-forward the commit, keeping the history linear.

       • merge: when the commits in the pull-request cannot be merged without a merge commit, pagure signals it and performs this merge commit.

       • conflicts: when the commits in the pull-request cannot be merged at all automatically due to one or more conflicts. Then pagure signals it and prevent merging.

       If the Always merge option is on, then the fast-forward option above is disabled in favor of the merge option.

   Boards
       The  boards  feature  provides  simple  kanban  board  functionality by showing issues in columns that represent state.  The settings page lists existing boards and allows adminisrators to add new
       boards.

   Comment editing
       This Boolean enables or disables editing comments.

       After commenting on a ticket or a pull-request, the admins of the project and the author of the comment may be allowed to edit the comment.  This allows them to adjust the wording or the style  as
       they wish.

       NOTE:
          notification about a comment is only sent once with the original text, changes performed later will not trigger a new notification.

       Some project may not want to allow editing comments after they were posted and this setting allows turning it on or off.

   Enforce signed-off commits in pull-request
       This Boolean enables or disables checking for a 'Signed-off-by' line (case insensitive) in the commit messages of the pull-requests.

       If this line is missing, pagure will display a message near the Merge button, allowing project admin to request the PR to be updated.

       NOTE:
          This setting does not prevent commits without this 'signed-off-by' line to be pushed directly, it only work at the pull-request level.

   Issue tracker
       This  Boolean simply enables or disables the issue tracker for the project.  So if you are tracking your ticket on a different system, you can simply disable reporting issue on pagure by un-check‐
       ing this option.

   Minimum score to merge pull-request
       This option can be used for project wishing to enforce having a minimum number of people reviewing a pull-request before it can be merged.

       If this option is enabled, anyone can vote in favor or against a pull-request and the sum of the votes in favor minus the sum of the votes against give the pull-request  a  score  that  should  be
       equal or greater than the value entered in this option for the pull-request to be allowed to be merged.

       NOTE:
          Only the main comments (i.e.: not in-line) are taken into account to calculate the score of the pull-request.

       To vote in favor of a pull-request, use either: * +1 * :thumbsup:

       To vote against a pull-request, use either: * -1 * :thumbsdown:

       NOTE:
          Pull-Request not reaching the minimum score are not automatically merged

       NOTE:
          Anyone can vote on the pull-request, not only the contributors.

       NOTE:
          Only one vote per person is taken into account to compute the final score.

   Only assignee can merge pull-request
       This option can be used for project wishing to institute a strong review workflow where pull-request are first assigned then merged.

       If this option is enabled, only the person assigned to the pull-request can merge it.

   Project documentation
       Pagure offers the option to have a git repository specific for the documentation of the project.

       This repository is then accessible under the Docs tab in the menu of the project.

       If you prefer to store your documentation elsewhere or maybe even within the sources of the project, you can disable the Docs tab by un-checking this option.

   Pull requests
       Pagure  offers  the option to fork a project, make changes to it and then ask the developer to merge these changes into the project. This is similar to the pull-request mechanism on GitHub or Git‐
       Lab.

       However, some projects may prefer receiving patches by email on their list or via another hosting platform or simply do not wish to use the pull-request mechanism at all. Un-checking  this  option
       will therefore prevent anyone from opening a pull-request against this project.

       NOTE:
          disabling pull-requests does not disable forking the projects.

   Web-hooks
       Pagure  offers the option of sending notification about event happening on a project via [web-hooks|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook]. This option is off by default and can be turned on for a
       pagure instance in its configuration file.

       The URL of the web-hooks can be entered in this field.

       NOTE:
          See the notifications documentation to learn more about web-hooks in pagure and how to use them.

   Tags
       Pagure allows you to define "tags" that can be added to Issues.  Tags are unique to each project, and they can only be defined in the project settings page.  The Tag color can also  be  customized
       for a more robust visual representation of the tag.

   Deploy keys
       Deploy keys are SSH keys that have access to pull/push only to a single project.  Upon creation, admins can determine whether this particular key has read/write access or read-only.

   Project Level Access Control
       Till  release  2.12,  pagure had a very simple user model. If we added a new user or a new group to a project, the user/group would be an admin of the project.  The user/group  could do everything
       from changing the status of an issue to adding or removing any user on the project. With project ACL feature, we allow a more fine grained control over what a new user/group has  access  to,  what
       things it can add or what actions it can take.

       With Project ACL feature, We can now have three levels of access:

       • Ticket:  A  user or a group with this level of access can only edit metadata of an issue. This includes changing the status of an issue, adding/removing tags from them, adding/removing assignees
         and every other option which can be accessed when you click "Edit Metadata" button in an issue page. However, this user can not "create" a new tag or "delete" an existing tag because, that would
         involve access to settings page of the project which this user won't have. It also won't be able to "delete" the issue because, it falls outside of "Edit Metadata".

       • Commit: A user or a group with this level of access can do everything what a user/group with ticket access can do + it can do everything on the project which doesn't include access  to  settings
         page.  It can "Edit Metadata" of an issue just like a user with ticket access would do, can merge a pull request, can push to the main repository directly, delete an issue, cancel a pull request
         etc.

       • Admin: The user/group with this access has access to everything on the project.  All the "users" of the project that have been added till now are having this access.  They can  change  the  set‐
         tings of the project, add/remove users/groups on the project.

   Add/Update Access
       • Every time you add a new user or a new group to the project, you will be asked to provide the level of access you want to give to that user or group. It's a required field in the form.

       • To add a user or a group to a project, go to settings page of the project. There are buttons with text: Add User and Add Group. It will take you to a different page where you will have to select
         the user or group (depending on whether you clicked Add User or Add Group) and the access you want the user/group to have.

       • If  you want to update a user or a group's access, go to settings page of the project.  There is a section which lists users associated with the project with the buttons to edit their access and
         a different button to remove them from the project. If you click the edit button, you will be taken to a different page where you can change the access and then click on Update button.

   Points to be noted
       • The creator of a project in pagure holds a more unique position than a normal user with admin access. The creator can not be removed by an admin. His access level can not be changed. But, an ad‐
         min's access can be updated by a fellow admin or the creator himself.

       • All the members of a group will have same access over the project except for the case mentioned in the next point.

       • In cases when, a user is added to a project with an access level of "A" and a group is also added to the same project with access level "B" and that user is also present in the group  then,  the
         user  will enjoy the access of higher of "A" and "B". Meaning, if the user earlier had access of ticket and the group had access of commit, the user will enjoy the access of a committer. And, if
         the user earlier had access of commit and the group had access of ticket, the user will still be a committer.

   Using the roadmap feature
       Pagure allows building the roadmap of the project using the tickets and their milestones.

       The principal is as follow:

       • For each milestones defined in the settings of the project, the roadmap will group tickets with the corresponding milestone.

       • If your project has an unplanned milestone, this milestone will be shown at the bottom of the roadmap page. This allowing you to put something on the roadmap without assigning a  real  milestone
         to it.

   Example
       For a project named test on pagure.io.

       • First, go to the settings page of the project, create the milestones you like, for example: v1.0 and v2.0.

       • For  the tickets you want to be on these milestones, go through each of them and set their milestone to either v1.0 or v2.0, or none of them if the ticket is not on the roadmap.  You can set the
         milestone on the metadata panel on the right side of the issue page.

       • And this is how it will look like
       .SS Flags

       Pagure offers the possibility to flag pull-requests and commits. A flag is a way for a third-party tool to provide feedback on a pull-request or a commit.

       This feedback can be as simple as the outcome of running the tests, or some lint tool, or test coverage evolution.

   Add a flag
       Flags can be set via the API, see the /api/ URL in your pagure instance or at pagure.io/api/ and look for the endpoints with the titles: Flag a commit or Flag a pull-request.

       • uid: the API endpoints to add flag have an optional UID argument. It is a unique identifier (of maximum 32 characters) that is unique the commit or pull-request that is being/has  been  flagged.
         If it is not specified by the user/tool adding the flag, it will be automatically generated and in either case, will be returned in the JSON data returned by the API endpoints. Note that this is
         the only time you would be able to retrieve this identifier if you do not specify it yourself.

       • status: this field indicates the status of the task in the system running it. Pagure supports the following statuses:

         • success: the task ended successfully.

         • canceled: the task was canceled.

         • failure: the task ended but failed.

         • error: the task did not end at all.

         • pending: the results of this task are pending.  (for failure vs error think of the test system ran the tests but they failed vs the test system did not get to run the tests)

       • percent:  this  is  an  optional  field which can be used to provide some more details about the outcome of the task. For example this could be used for test coverage, or the number of test that
         failed/passed.

       • username: the name of the system running the tests. While not being restricted in length, a shorter name will render better in the interface.

       • comment: a free text form not restricted in length (however, here as well if the comment is too long it may render off in the interface).

       • url: the URL the flag is linked to and where the user should be able to retrieve more information about the task and its outcome.

   Example of two flags on a commit:
       .SS Example of two flags on a pull-request: .SS Magic Words

       Magic words are words and constructs you can use in your commit message to make pagure act on tickets or pull-requests.

   Enabling magic words
       These magic words are enabled if the pagure git hook is enable. To do so, go to your project's settings page, open the Hooks tab and activate there the Pagure hook.

   Using magic words
       To reference an issue/PR you need to use one of recognized keywords followed by a reference to the issue or PR, separated by whitespace and and optional colon.  Such references can be either:

       • The issue/PR number preceded by the # symbol

       • The full URL of the issue or PR

       If using the full URL, it is possible to reference issues in other projects.

       The recognized keywords are:

       • fix/fixed/fixes

       • relate/related/relates

       • merge/merges/merged

       • close/closes/closed

       • resolve/resolves/resolved

       Examples:

       • Fixes #21

       • related: https://pagure.io/myproject/issue/32

       • this commit merges #74

       • Merged: https://pagure.io/myproject/pull-request/74

       Capitalization does not matter; neither does the colon (:) between keyword and number.

   Using the doc repository of your project
       In this section of the documentation, we are interested in the doc repository.

       The doc repository is a simple Git repo. It can be displayed as a subfolder of a project or as a dedicated Git repo.  Either way its content can be displayed in 2 ways:

       • inline under the Docs tab in Pagure:

         • https://pagure.io/docs/<project>/ or

         • https://pagure.io/docs/<namespace>/<project>/

       • standalone:

         • https://docs.pagure.org/<project>/ or

         • https://docs.pagure.org/<namespace>.<project>/

       By default the Docs tab in the project's menu is disabled, you will have to visit the project's settings page and turn it on in the Project options section.

       The URL to clone the doc repo is:

       • https://pagure.io/docs/<namespace>/<project>.git

       To view the doc source files in the browser:

       • if the doc repo is kept in the project's sources, use the project's website

       • if the doc repo is a dedicated repo, use https://pagure.io/<namespace>/<name>

       Different file types can be used for your documentation in this repo:

       • simple text files

         Pagure will display them as plain text. If one of these is named index it will be presented as the front page.

       • RST or markdown files

         Pagure will convert them to HTML on the fly and display them as such.  The RST files must end with .rst and the markdown ones must end with .mk, .md or simply .markdown.

       • HTML files

         Pagure will simply show them as such.

       Updating documentation hosted in a dedicated repo is like using other repos.

   Example
       Pagure's documentation is kept in pagure's sources, in the doc folder there.  You can see it at: https://pagure.io/pagure/blob/master/f/doc. This doc can be built with Sphinx to make it  HTML  and
       prettier.

       The built documentation is available at: https://docs.pagure.org/pagure/.

       This is how it is built/updated:

       • Clone pagure's sources:

            git clone https://pagure.io/pagure.git

       • Move into its doc folder:

            cd pagure/doc

       • Build the doc:

            make html

       • Clone pagure's doc repository:

            git clone ssh://git@pagure.io/docs/pagure.git

       • Copy the result of sphinx's build to the doc repo:

            cp -r _build/html/* pagure/

       • Go into the doc repo and update it:

            cd pagure
            git add .
            git commit -am "Update documentation"
            git push

       • Clean the sources:

            cd ..
            rm -rf pagure  # remove the doc repo
            rm -rf _build  # remove the output from the sphinx's build

       To make things simpler, the following script (name update_doc.sh) can be used:

          #!/bin/bash

          make html

          git clone "ssh://git@pagure.io/docs/$1.git"
          cp -r _build/html/* $1/
          (
              cd $1
              git add .
              git commit -av
              git push
          )

          rm -rfI _build
          rm -rfI $1

       It can be used by running update_doc.sh <project> from within the folder containing the doc.

       So for pagure it would be something like:

          cd pagure/doc
          update_doc.sh pagure

   Using web-hooks
       Web-hooks are a notification system that could be compared to a callback.  Basically, pagure will make a HTTP POST request to one or more third party server/application with information about what
       is or just happened.

   Activating web-hooks notifications
       To  set-up  a  web-hook, simply go to the settings page of your project and enter the URL to the server/endpoint that will receive the notifications.  If you wish to enter multiple URLs, enter one
       per line.  To stop all notifications, clear out that field.

       Pagure will send a notification to this/these URL(s) for every action made on this project: new issue, new pull-request, new comments, new commits...

       NOTE:
          The notifications sent via web-hooks have the same payload as the notifications sent via fedmsg.  Therefore, the list of pagure topics as well as example messages can be  found  in  the  fedmsg
          documentation about pagure

   Authenticating the notifications
       There  is,  in  the  settings page, a web-hook key which is used by the server (here pagure) to sign the message sent and which you can use to ensure the notifications received are coming from the
       right source.

       Each POST request made contains some specific headers:

          X-Pagure
          X-Pagure-Project
          X-Pagure-Signature
          X-Pagure-Signature-256
          X-Pagure-Topic

       X-Pagure contains URL of the pagure instance sending this notification.

       X-Pagure-Project contains the name of the project on that pagure instance.

       X-Pagure-Signature contains the signature of the message allowing to check that the message comes from pagure.

       X-Pagure-Signature-256 contains the SHA-256 signature of the message allowing to check that the message comes from pagure.

       NOTE:
          These headers are present to allow you to verify that the webhook was actually sent by the correct Pagure instance. These are not included in the signed data.

       X-Pagure-Topic is a global header giving a clue about the type of action that just occurred. For example issue.edit.

       WARNING:
          The headers X-Pagure, X-Pagure-Project and X-Pagure-Topic are present for convenience only, they are not signed and therefore should not be trusted. Rely on the payload after checking the  sig‐
          nature to make any decision.

       Pagure relies on hmac to sign the content of its messages. If you want to validate the message, in python, you can do something like the following:

          import hmac
          import hashlib

          payload =  # content you received in the POST request
          headers =  # headers of the POST request
          project_web_hook_key =  # private web-hook key of the project

          hashhex = hmac.new(
              str(project_web_hook_key), payload, hashlib.sha1).hexdigest()

          if hashhex != headers.get('X-Pagure-Signature'):
              raise Exception('Message received with an invalid signature')

   Templates for ticket input
       Pagure  offers  the  possibility to add templates for ticket's input. These templates do not enforce anything, users will have the possibility to simply ignore it, or even to not follow it, but it
       also helps structuring the ticket opened against a project and highlighting the information that are often requested/needed.

       The templates are provided in the git repository containing the meta-data for the tickets.  They must be placed under a templates folder in this git repository, end with .md and as  the  extension
       suggests can be formatted as markdown.

       If you create a template templates/default.md, it will be shown by default when someone ask to create a new ticket.

   Example
       For a project named test on pagure.io.

       • First, clone the ticket git repo [1] and move into it

          git clone ssh://git@pagure.io/tickets/test.git
          cd test

       • Create the templates folder

          mkdir templates

       • Create a default template

          vim templates/default.md

       And place in this file the following content:

          ##### Issue

          ##### Steps to reproduce
          1.
          2.
          3.

          ##### Actual results

          ##### Expected results

       • Commit and push the changes to the git repo

          git add templates
          git commit -m "Add a default template for tickets"
          git push

       • And this is how it will look like

       [1]  The URLs to the different git repositories can be found on the main page of the project, on the right-side menu, under the section Source GIT URLs. Click on more to see them if you are logged
            in and have access to the repository (the ticket and request git repositories require a commit access or higher).

   Customize the PR page
       Pagure  offers  the possibility to customize the page that creates pull-request to add your specific information, such as: please follow the XYZ coding style, run the tests or whatever you wish to
       inform contributors when they open a new pull-request.

       The customization is done via a file in the git repository containing the meta-data for the pull-requests. This file must be placed under a templates folder, be named contributing.md  and  can  be
       formatted as you wish using markdown.

   Example
       For a project named test on pagure.io.

       • First, clone the pull-request git repo [1] and move into it

          git clone ssh://git@pagure.io/requests/test.git
          cd test

       • Create the templates folder

          mkdir templates

       • Create the customized PR info

          vim templates/contributing.md

       And place in this file the following content:

          Contributing to test
          ====================

          When creating a pull-request against test, there are couple of items to do
          that will speed up the review process:

          * Ensure the unit-tests are all passing (cf the ``runtests.py`` script at the
            top level of the sources)
          * Check if your changes are [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
            compliant for this you can install ``python-pep8`` and run the ``pep8`` CLI
            tool

       • Commit and push the changes to the git repo

          git add templates
          git commit -m "Customize the PR page"
          git push

       • And this is how it will look like

       [1]  All the URLs to the different git repositories can be found on the main page of the project, on the right-side menu, under the section Source GIT URLs, click on more to see them.

   Theming Guide
       Pagure  is  built  on Flask, and uses Jinja2 for templates. Pagure also includes the ability to apply different themes that control the look and feel of your pagure instance, or add or remove ele‐
       ments from the interface.

   Setting a theme
       The theme is set in the Pagure configuration file. The theme name is defined by the name of the directory in the /themes/ folder that contains the theme. For example to enable the  theme  that  is
       used on Pagure.io, add the following line to your Pagure configuration:

          THEME = "pagureio"

   Theme contents
       A theme requires two directories (templates and static) in the directory that contains the theme. The only other required file is theme.html which is placed in the templates directory

   templates/
       The  templates directory is where pagure will look for the theme.html template. Additionally, if you wish to override any template in Pagure, place it in the theme templates/ directory, and pagure
       will use that template rather than the standard one.

       WARNING:
          Take care when overriding templates, as any changes to Pagure upstream will need to be backported to your theme template override.

   static/
       The static directory contains all the static elements for the theme, including additional a favicon, images, Javascript, and CSS files. To reference a file in the theme static  directory  use  the
       jinja2 tag {{ url_for('theme.static', filename='filename')}}. For example:

          <link href="{{ url_for('theme.static', filename='theme.css') }}"
                rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

   templates/theme.html
       The  theme.html  file defines a subset of items in the Pagure interface that are commonly changed when creating a new theme. Theming is a new feature in Pagure, so this set is currently small, but
       please file issues or PRs against pagure with ideas of new items to include.

       The current items configurable in theme.html are:

   masthead_class variable
       A string of additional CSS class(es) to be added to the navbar element.  This navbar element is the topbar in Pagure. For example:

          {% set masthead_class = "navbar-dark bg-dark" %}

   masthead_navbar_items() macro
       A Jinja macro that allows themes to inject custom items in the Pagure navigation bar. Example:

          {% macro masthead_navbar_items() %}
              <li class="nav-item ml-3">
                  <a class="nav-link font-weight-bold" href="...">
                      Foobar
                  </a>
              </li>
          {% endmacro %}

   site_title variable
       A string containing the text to append at the end of the html title on every page on the site. Usage:

          {% set site_title = "Pagure" %}

   projectstring(Bool:plural) macro
       A macro that returns a string used to refer to Projects in Pagure The plural parameter informs if the string to be returned is the plural form.  This macro is optional.  Usage:

          {% macro projectstring(plural=False) -%}
              {% if plural %}
                  Repositories
              {% else %}
                  Repository
              {% endif %}
          {% endmacro -%}

   projecticon variable
       A string containing the name of the fontawesome icon to use for Projects. This variable is optional. Usage:

          {% set projecticon = "Package" %}

   head_imports() macro
       A Jinja macro that defines the additional items in the html head to be imported. The base templates do not include the bootstrap CSS, so this needs to be included in this macro in your theme.  Ad‐
       ditionally, include your favicon here, and a link to any additional CSS files your theme uses. Example:

          {% macro head_imports() %}
              <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon"
                    href="{{ url_for('theme.static', filename='favicon.ico')}}"/>
              <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('theme.static', filename='bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css')}}" />
              <link href="{{ url_for('theme.static', filename='theme.css') }}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
          {% endmacro %}

   js_imports() macro
       A Jinja macro that defines the additional javascript files to be imported. The base templates do not include the bootstrap JS, so this needs to be included in this macro in your theme. Example:

          {% macro js_imports() %}
              <script src="{{ url_for('theme.static', filename='bootstrap/bootstrap.bundle.min.js')}}"></script>
          {% endmacro %}

   browseheader_message(select) macro
       An  optional Jinja macro that defines the welcome message that is shown above the tabs on the Browse Pages (Projects, Users, and Groups). The select parameter is a string with the name of the page
       being shown Example:

          {% macro browseheader_message(select) %}
              {% if select == 'projects' %}
              <div class="row justify-content-around">
              <div class="col-md-8">
                  <div class="jumbotron bg-transparent m-0 py-4 text-center">
                      <h1 class="display-5">Welcome to my Pagure</h1>
                      <p class="lead">Pagure is an Open Source software code hosting system.</p>
                  </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              {% endif %}
          {% endmacro %}

   footer() macro
       A Jinja macro that defines the footer of the Pagure site. Example:

          {% macro footer() %}
              <div class="footer py-3 bg-light border-top text-center">
                  <div class="container">
                      <p class="text-muted credit">
                  Powered by
                  <a href="https://pagure.io/pagure">Pagure</a>
                  {{ g.version }}
                      </p>
                      <p><a href="{{ url_for('ui_ns.ssh_hostkey') }}">SSH Hostkey/Fingerprint</a> | <a href="https://docs.pagure.org/pagure/usage/index.html">Documentation</a></p>
                  </div>
              </div>
          {% endmacro %}

   about_page() macro
       A Jinja macro that defines the content of the About page (available at /about). You may want to replace the links to contact links for your own instance. Example:

          {% macro about_page() %}
              <div class="container mt-5">
                  <h1>About</h1>
                  <p>This is an instance of Pagure, a git forge.</p>

   Upgrade a database
       For changes to the database schema, we rely on Alembic.  This allows us to do upgrade and downgrade of schema migration, kind of like one would do commits in a system like git.

       To upgrade the database to the latest version simply run:

          alembic upgrade head

       NOTE:
          if pagure's configuration file isn't in /etc/pagure/pagure.cfg you will have to specify it to alembic using the command:

              PAGURE_CONFIG=/path/to/pagure.cfg alembic upgrade head

          This allow applies for the command specified below.

       This may fail for different reasons:

       • The change was already made in the database

       This can be because the version of the database schema saved is incorrect.  It can be debugged using the following commands:

          • Find the current revision:

                alembic current

          • See the entire history:

                alembic history

       Once the revision at which your database should be is found (in the history) you can declare that your database is at this given revision using:

          alembic stamp <revision id>

       Eventually, if you do not know where your database is or should be, you can do an iterative process stamping the database for every revision, one by one trying every time to alembic upgrade  until
       it works.

       • The database used does not support some of the changes

       SQLite is handy for development but does not support all the features of a real database server. Upgrading a SQLite database might therefore not work, depending on the changes done.

       In some cases, if you are using a SQLite database, you will have to destroy it and create a new one.

   Pagure CI
       Pagure CI is a service integrating the results of Continuous Integration (CI) services, such as jenkins or travis-ci, into pull-requests opened against your project on pagure.

       NOTE:
          By default pagure-ci is off, an admin of your pagure instance will need to configure it to support one or more CI services. Check the configuration section on how to do that.

       Contents:

   Jenkins with Pagure-ci
       Jenkins is a Continuous Integration service that can be configured to be integrated with pagure.

       This document describe the steps needed to make it work.

   How does it work?
       The principal is:

       • pagure will trigger a build on jenkins when a pull-request is created, updated or when someone explicitly asks pagure to do so or when a new commit is pushed (if pagure-ci is configured to trig‐
         ger on commit).

       • pagure will send a few information to jenkins when triggering a build: REPO, BRANCH, BRANCH_TO, cause.

       • jenkins will do its work and, using webhook, report to pagure that it has finished its task

       • pagure will query jenkins to know the outcome of the task and flag the PR accordingly

       REPO corresponds to the url of the repository the pull-request originates from (so most often it will be a fork of the main repository).

       BRANCH corresponds to the branch the pull-request originates from (the branch of the fork).

       BRANCH_TO corresponds to the targeted branch in the main repository (the branch of the main project in which the PR is to be merged).

       cause is the reason the build was triggered (ie: the pull-request id or the commit hash).

   How to enable Pagure CI
       • Visit the settings page of your project

       • Scroll down to the Hooks section and click on Pagure CI

       • Select the type of CI service you want

       • Enter the URL of the CI service. For example http://jenkins.fedoraproject.org

       • Enter the name of the job the CI service will trigger. For example pagure-ci

       • Tick the checkbox activating the hook. Either trigger on every commits, trigger only on pull-requests or both every commits and pull-requests.

       These  steps will activate the hook, after reloading the page or the tab, you will be given access to two important values: the token used to trigger the build on jenkins and the URL used by jenk‐
       ins to report the status of the build.  Keep these two available when configuring jenkins for your project.

   Configure Jenkins
       These steps can only be made by the admins of your jenkins instance, but they only need to be made once.

       • Download the following plugins:

         • Git Plugin

         • Notification Plugin

   Configure your project on Jenkins
       • Go to the Configure page of your project

       • Under Job Notification  click Add Endpoint

       • Fields in Endpoint will be :

          FORMAT: JSON
          PROTOCOL: HTTP
          EVENT: All Events
          URL: <The URL provided in the Pagure CI hook on pagure>
          TIMEOUT: 3000
          LOG: 1

       • Tick the checkbox This build is parameterized

       • Add two String Parameters named REPO and BRANCH

       • Source Code Management select Git  and give the URL of the pagure project

       • Under Build Trigger click on Trigger build remotely and specify the token given by pagure.

       • Under Build -> Add build step -> Execute Shell

       • In the box given  enter the shell steps you want for testing your project.

       Example Script

          # Script specific for Pull-Request build
          if [ -n "$REPO" -a -n "$BRANCH" ]; then
          git remote rm proposed || true
          git remote add proposed "$REPO"
          git fetch proposed
          git checkout origin/master
          git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
          git config --global user.name "Your Name"
          git merge --no-ff "proposed/$BRANCH" -m "Merge PR"
          fi

          # Part of the script specific to how you run the tests on your project

       • To use the URL to POST results you need to add CI token to Jenkins instance.  This token could be found in Pagure project Settings -> Hooks -> Pagure CI.  In Jenkins add it in Manage Jenkins  ->
         Manage Credentials -> Stores scoped to Jenkins -> Jenkins -> Global credentials (unrestricted) -> Add Credentials as kind Secret text (ID will be used in script).

       Example function used in Jenkins pipeline script

          # 'pagure-auth' is the ID of the credentials

          def notifyPagurePR(repo, msg, status, phase, credentials = 'pagure-auth'){
              def json = JsonOutput.toJson([name: 'pagure', url: env.JOB_NAME, build: [full_url: currentBuild.absoluteUrl, status: status, number: currentBuild.number, phase: phase]])
              println json

              withCredentials([string(credentialsId: credentials, variable: "PAGURE_PUSH_SECRET")]) {
                  /* We need to notify pagure that jenkins finished but then pagure will
                    wait for jenkins to be done, so if we wait for pagure's answer we're
                    basically stuck in a loop where both jenkins and pagure are waiting
                    for each other */
                  sh "timeout 1 curl -X POST -d \'$json\' https://pagure.io/api/0/ci/jenkins/$repo/\${PAGURE_PUSH_SECRET}/build-finished -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" | true"
              }
          }

       • To  be  able  to trigger builds from Pagure CI you need to change the Global Security. Go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security and find Authorization section.  In Matrix-based security
         add Read permission to Anonymous Users for Overall/Job/View.

   Tips and tricks
       • How to re-trigger a run of pagure-ci on a pull-request?

       To manually trigger a run of pagure-ci on a given pull-request, simply add a comment saying: pretty please pagure-ci rebuild.

       NOTE:
          To always have this handy, you can save it in the Quick Replies!

       NOTE:
          This trigger can also be configured per pagure instance via the configuration file.

   Quick replies
       Quick replies are reusable pieces of text that you can use to start a comment on an issue or pull request. They are meant to remove the hassle of typing a similar response again and again.

       Examples where this can be handy:

       • asking for a rebase of a pull request

       • asking a person to add a Signed-off-by line to their commit

       All these requests might be accompanied by a description on why it's requested.  With quick replies you can prepare the descriptions and the just use them with a click of a button.

   Using quick replies
       Any user that can comment will be able to use the quick reply. They are offered in a drop down menu next to the Preview button above comment form.  [image]

       The button is only visible if the project has some quick replies defined.

       Additionally, the button will become insensitive when you type something into the comment box or switch to preview. This should avoid writing over your carefully crafted comment  by  accident.  If
       you remove the text from the field, the button will work again.

   Creating and modifying quick replies
       Project admins can create them in the settings section. There are no length limits on the reply, but only the first 50 characters will be displayed in the menu for users to choose from. This limi‐
       tation should encourage you to put the most important message at the beginning.

       The order in which you define the replies will be preserved on the chooser menu. This can be used to put the most frequently used ones on the top of the list.

   Using Boards
       Pagure  provides basic kanban board functionality.  This allows the state of issues to be represented visually.  The feature requires a specific, admin-defined tag to appear on a board.  A reposi‐
       tory may contain multiple boards, each with a different tag.

   Creating a Board
       1. From the Settings tab, select Boards

       2. Click the Add a new board button

       3. Enter a descriptive name in the Board name text box

       4. Select the tag to use in the Tag drop down

       5. Ensure the Active checkbox is checked

       6. Click the Update button to create the board

       After the board is created, add the status columns.

       1. While still on the Boards settings, click the wrench icon button

       2. If you want to use the default statuses (Backlog, Triaged, In Progress, In Review, Done, Blocked), click the Populate with defaults button.

       3.

          If you wish to add non-default statuses, click the Add new status button

                 1. Enter a name for the status in the Status name text box

                 2. If you want this status to be the default for issues added to the board, select the Default radio button.

                 3. If you want this status to close the issue, check the Close check box

                 4. Select the Color for the status on the board. This is for visual distinctness; you do not have to change it.

                 5. Repeat until all of the desired statuses are added

       4. Click and drag the arrows to reorder the statuses, if desired.

       5. Click the Update button when finished.

   Using Boards
       To add an issue to a board, add the board's label to the issue.  Alternatively, you can add an existing issue to the board by clicking the plus sign on the desired status column and adding the is‐
       sue number.

       To change the status of an issue. go to the Boards tab and drag the card on the board into the desired status column.  The status appears on the issue under the Boards information, but  it  cannot
       be changed from the issue.

       If you drag an issue to a column that has the Close boolean set, Pagure will automatically close the issue.

       NOTE:
          If you close an issue directly, Pagure will remove the board's label.

   Inaccessible pull-requests
   The symptoms
       When trying to open a pull-request, if you run into this error:

          The branch into which this pull-request was to be merged: XXX seems to
          no longer be present in this repo

       (Where XXX is a branch name).

       (Here XXX is m2).

       This  means that the pull-request was opened against a branch on your repo and that this branch no longer exists.  Pagure is therefore unable to compute the diff between the sources and the target
       of the pull-request.

       The pull-request is thus inaccessible but remains in the list of open pull-requests.

   The solution
       The easiest solution to solve this problem is to re-create the target branch in your repo.

       This can be done using git simply by doing:

          git checkout -b <branch_name>
          git push origin <branch_name>

       It will create the branch named <branch_name> in pagure, allowing the diff to be computed for that pull-request and thus allowing it to be displayed. It is then up to you to see if  this  pull-re‐
       quest is still relevant and should be merged or closed.

   Tips and tricks
       This page contains some tips and tricks on how to use pagure. These do not fit in their own page but are worth mentioning.

   Place image onto your overview page
       You can only use images that come from the Pagure host itself.

   Example
          ![See Copr workflow](/copr/copr/raw/master/f/doc/img/copr-workflow.png)

       Text in the square brackets will be used as an alt description.

   Pre-fill issue using the URL
       When creating issues for a project pagure supports pre-filling the title and description input text using URL parameters.

   Example:
       https://pagure.io/pagure/new_issue/?title=<Issue>&content=<Issue Content>

       The above URL will autofill the text boxes for Title and Description field with Title set to <Issue> and Description set to <Issue Content>.

   Pre-fill issue template using the URL
       When creating issues for a project pagure supports pre-filling the title and description input text using URL parameters.

   Example:
       https://pagure.io/pagure/new_issue/?template=<TemplateName>

       The above URL will autofill the ticket with the specified template. The TemplateName should be the name of the template file on disk (in the templates directory of the ticket git repository).

   Filter for issues not having a certain tag
       Very  much in the same way pagure allows you to filter for issues having a certain tag, pagure allows one to filter for issues not having a certain tag.  To do this, simply prepend a ! in front of
       the tag.

   Example:
       https://pagure.io/pagure/issues?tags=!easyfix

   Local user creation without email verification
       If you set EMAIL_SEND to `False` from the configuration file, you will get the emails printed to the console instead of being sent. The admin of the instance can then access the  URL  to  manually
       validate the account from there. This is generally used for development where we don't need to send any emails.

   Filter an user's projects by their access
       When watching a user's page, the list of all the project that user is involved in is presented regardless of whether the user has ticket, commit, admin access or is the main admin of the project.

       You can specify an acl= argument to the URL to filter the list of projects by access.

       NOTE:
          This also works for your home page when you are logged in.

   Examples:
       https://pagure.io/user/pingou?acl=main admin https://pagure.io/user/pingou?acl=admin https://pagure.io/user/pingou?acl=commit

   Filter issues by (custom) fields
       Via the project's settings page, admins can set custom keys to be used in issues. You can search them using the URL via the arguments ckeys and cvalue or simpler, using the search field at the top
       of the issue page.

       This also works for the following regular fields: tags, milestones, author, assignee, status, priority (but tags and milestones despite their name only support a single value).

   Examples:
       https://pagure.io/SSSD/sssd/issues?status=Open&search_pattern=review%3ATrue https://pagure.io/pagure/issues?status=Open&search_pattern=tags%3Aeasyfix

   Search the comments of issues
       One  can  search all the comments made on an issue tracker using content:<keyword> in the search field. This is going to search all the comments (including the descriptions) of all the tickets and
       thus can be quite slow on large project. This is why this feature isn't being pushed much forward.

   Examples:
       https://pagure.io/pagure/issues?status=Open&search_pattern=content%3Aeasyfix

   Pagure API
       The API documentation can be found at https://pagure.io/api/0/ or in /api/0/ of you local pagure instance.

INSTALLING PAGURE
       There are two ways to install pagure:

       • via the RPM package (recommended if you are using a RPM-based GNU/Linux distribution)

       • via the setup.py

   Installing pagure via RPM
       Here as well there are two ways of obtaining the RPM:

       • From the main repositories

       Pagure is packaged for Fedora since Fedora 21 and is available for RHEL and its derivative via the EPEL repository <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>.  So installing it is as easy as:

          dnf install pagure pagure-milters pagure-ev pagure-webhook

       or

          yum install pagure pagure-milters pagure-ev pagure-webhook

       The pagure package contains the core of the application and the doc server.  (See the Overview page for a global overview of the structure of the project).

       The pagure-milters package contains, as the name says, the milter (a mail filter to hook into a MTA).

       The pagure-ev package contains the eventsource server.

       The pagure-webhook package contains the web-hook server.

       NOTE:
          The last three packages are optional, pagure would work fine without them but the live-update, the webhook and the comment by email services will not work.

       • From the sources

       If you wish to run a newer version of pagure than what is in the repositories you can easily rebuild it as RPM.

       Simply follow these steps: # Clone the sources:

          git clone https://pagure.io/pagure.git

       # Go to the folder:

          cd pagure

       # Build a tarball of the latest version of pagure:

          python setup.py sdist

       # Build the RPM:

          rpmbuild -ta dist/pagure*.tar.gz

       This will build pagure from the version present in your clone.

       Once, the RPM is installed the services pagure_milter and pagure_ev are ready to be used but the database and the web-application parts still need to be configured.

   Installing pagure via setup.py
       Pagure includes in its sources a setup.py automating the installation of the web applications of pagure (ie: the core + the doc server).

       To install pagure via this mechanism simply follow these steps: # Clone the sources:

          git clone https://pagure.io/pagure.git

       # Go to the folder:

          cd pagure

       # Install the latest version of pagure:

          python setup.py build
          sudo python setup.py install

       NOTE:
          To install the eventsource server or the milter, refer to their respective documentations.

       # Install the additional files as follow:
                                                                    ┌────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐

   Set-up pagure
       Once pagure's files are installed, you still need to set up some things.

       • Create the folder release

       This folder is used by project maintainers to upload the tarball of the releases of their project.

       This folder must be accessible by the user under which the application is running (in our case: git).

          mkdir -p /var/www/releases
          chown git:git /var/www/releases

       • Create the folders where the repos, forks and checkouts will be stored

       Pagure stores the sources of a project in a git repo, offers a place to store the project's documentation in another repo, stores a JSON dump of all issues and of all pull-requests in another  two
       repos, and keeps a local checkout of remote projects when asked to do remote pull-requests.  All these repositories are stored in different folders that must be created manually.

       For example you can place them under /srv/git/repositories/ which would make /srv/git the home of your gitolite user.

       You would then create the folders with:

          mkdir /srv/git/repositories/{docs,forks,tickets,requests,remotes}

       • Configure apache

       If installed by RPM, you will find an example apache configuration file at: /etc/httpd/conf.d/pagure.conf.

       If not installed by RPM, the example file is present in the sources at: files/pagure-apache-httpd.conf.

       Adjust it for your needs.

       • Configure the WSGI file

       If you installed by RPM, you will find example WSGI files at: /usr/share/pagure/pagure.wsgi for the core server and /usr/share/pagure/doc_pagure.wsgi for the doc server.

       If you did not install by RPM, these files are present in the sources at: files/pagure.wsgi and files/doc_pagure.wsgi.

       Adjust them for your needs

       • Give apache permission to read the repositories owned by the git user.

       For  the sake of this document, we assume that the web application runs under the git user, the same user as your gitolite user, but apache itself runs under the httpd (or apache2) user. So by de‐
       fault, apache will not be allowed to read git repositories created and managed by gitolite.

       To give apache this permission (required to make git clone via http work), we use file access control lists (aka FACL):

          setfacl -m user:apache:rx --default
          setfacl -Rdm user:apache:rx /srv/git
          setfacl -Rm user:apache:rx /srv/git

       Where /srv/git is the home of your gitolite user (which will thus need to be adjusted for your configuration).

       • Set up the configuration file of pagure

       This is an important step which concerns the file /etc/pagure/pagure.cfg.  If you have installed pagure by RPM, this file is already there, otherwise you can find an example one in the sources at:
       files/pagure.cfg.sample that you will have to copy to the right location.

       Confer the Configuration section of this documentation for a full explanation of all the options of pagure.

       • Create the database

       You first need to create the database itself. For this, since pagure can work with: PostgreSQL, MySQL or MariaDB, we would like to invite you to consult the documentation of your  database  system
       for this operation.

       Once you have specified in the configuration file the to url used to connect to the database, and create the database itself, you can now create the tables, the database scheme.

       For  changes  to existing tables, we rely on Alembic.  It uses revisions to perform the upgrades, but to know which upgrades are needed and which are already done, the current revision needs to be
       saved in the database. This will allow alembic to know and apply the new revision when running it.

       In the alembic.ini file, one of the configuration key is most important: script_location which is the path to the versions folder containing all the alembic  migration  files.  The  sqlalchemy.url
       configuration key if missing will be replaced by the url filled in the configuration file of pagure.

       To create the database tables, you need to run the script /usr/share/pagure/pagure_createdb.py and specify the configuration to use for pagure and for alembic.

       For example:

          python /usr/share/pagure/pagure_createdb.py -c /etc/pagure/pagure.cfg -i /etc/pagure/alembic.ini

       This will tell /usr/share/pagure/pagure_createdb.py to use the database information specified in the file /etc/pagure/pagure.cfg and to stamp the database at the last alembic revision.

       WARNING:
          Pagure's  default  configuration is using sqlite. This is fine for development purpose but not for production use as sqlite does not support all the operations needed when updating the database
          schema. Do use PostgreSQL, MySQL or MariaDB in production.

       For changes to existing tables, we rely on Alembic.  It uses revisions to perform the upgrades, but to know which upgrades are needed and which are already done, the current revision needs  to  be
       saved in the database. This will allow alembic to know apply the new revision when running it.

       In  the  alembic.ini  file,  one of the configuration key is most important: script_location which is the path to the versions folder containing all the alembic migration files. The sqlalchemy.url
       configuration key if missing will be replaced by the url filled in the configuration file of pagure.

       WARNING:
          Calling pagure_createdb.py is asked regularly in the UPGRADING.rst documentation, especially to handle database schema changes upon upgrades, but the --initial argument should only be used  the
          first time as it will otherwise break upgrading the database schema via alembic.

       NOTE:
          When install from source the script is called createdb.py and not pagure_createdb.py.

       If you installed by RPM, then enable and start the worker services

          systemctl enable --now pagure_worker.service pagure_gitolite_worker.service

   Set up virus scanning
       Pagure can automatically scan uploaded attachments for viruses using Clam.  To set this up, first install clamav-data-empty, clamav-server, clamav-server-systemd and clamav-update.

       Then edit /etc/freshclam.conf, removing the Example line and run freshclam once to get an up to date database.

       Copy  /usr/share/doc/clamav-server/clamd.conf to /etc/clamd.conf and edit that too, again making sure to remove the Example line. Make sure to set LocalSocket to a file in a directory that exists,
       and set User to an existing system user.

       Then start the clamd service and set VIRUS_SCAN_ATTACHMENTS = True in the Pagure configuration.

INSTALLING PAGURE'S MILTER
       A milter is a script that is ran by a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) upon receiving an email via either a network or an unix socket.

       If you want more information feel free to check out the corresponding page on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milter.

   Configure your system
       • Install the required dependencies

          python-pymilter

       NOTE:
          We ship a systemd unit file for pagure_milter but we welcome patches for scripts for other init systems.

       NOTE:
          It also requires a MTA, we used postfix.

       • Create an alias reply

       This can be done in /etc/aliases, for example:

          reply:      /dev/null

       • Activate the ability of your MTA, to split users based on the character +.  This way all the emails sent to reply+...@example.com will be forwarded to your alias for reply.

       In postfix this is done via:

          recipient_delimiter = +

       • Hook the milter in the MTA

       In postfix this is done via:

          non_smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/pagure/paguresock
          smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/pagure/paguresock

       • Install the files of the milter as follow:
                                                             ┌────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┐

       The first file is the script of the milter itself.

       The second file is a file specific for systemd and ensuring the temporary folders needed by the milter are re-created if needed at each boot.

       The third file is the systemd service file.

       • Activate the service and ensure it's started upon boot:

          systemctl enable pagure_milter
          systemctl start pagure_milter

INSTALLING PAGURE'S EVENTSOURCE SERVER
       Eventsource or Server Sent Events are messages sent from a server to a web browser. It allows one to refresh a page "live", ie, without the need to reload it entirely.

   Configure your system
       The eventsource server is easy to set-up.

       • Install the required dependencies

          python-redis
          python-trololio

       NOTE:
          We ship a systemd unit file for pagure_milter but we welcome patches for scripts for other init systems.

       • Install the files of the SSE server as follow:
                                                             ┌───────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

       The first file is the script of the SSE server itself.

       The second file is the systemd service file.

       • Finally, activate the service and ensure it's started upon boot:

          systemctl enable redis
          systemctl start redis
          systemctl enable pagure_ev
          systemctl start pagure_ev

INSTALLING PAGURE'S WEB-HOOKS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
       Web-hooks are a notification system upon which a system makes a http POST request with some data upon doing an action. This allows notifying a system that an action has occurred.

       If you want more information feel free to check out the corresponding page on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook.

   Configure your system
       • Install the required dependencies

          python-redis

CRON JOBS
       Some actions in pagure are meant to the run via a cron job.

   API key expiration reminder
       One of the cron job sending reminder about API keys that are about to expire.  It will send an email 10 days, then 5 days and finally the day before the key expires to the person who has created.

       The cron job can be found in the sources in:

          files/api_key_expire_mail.py

       In the RPM it is installed in:

          /usr/share/pagure/api_key_expire_mail.py

       This cron job is meant to be run daily using a syntax similar to:

          10 0 * * * root python /usr/share/pagure/api_key_expire_mail.py

       which will make the script run at 00:10 every day.

CONFIGURATION
       Pagure offers a wide varieties of options that must or can be used to adjust its behavior.

       All of these options can be edited or added to your configuration file.  If you have installed pagure, this configuration file is likely located in /etc/pagure/pagure.cfg. Otherwise, it  will  de‐
       pend on your setup/deployment.

   Must options
       Here are the options you must set up in order to get pagure running.

   SECRET_KEY
       This configuration key is used by flask to create the session. It should be kept secret and set as a long and random string.

   SALT_EMAIL
       This  configuration  key  is used to ensure that when sending notifications to different users, each one of them has a different, unique and unfakeable Reply-To header. This header is then used by
       the milter to find out if the response received is a real one or a fake/invalid one.

   DB_URL
       This configuration key indicates to the framework how and where to connect to the database server. Pagure uses SQLAchemy to connect to a wide range of database server including MySQL,  PostgreSQL,
       and SQLite.

       Examples values:

          DB_URL = 'mysql://user:pass@host/db_name'
          DB_URL = 'postgresql://user:pass@host/db_name'
          DB_URL = 'sqlite:////var/tmp/pagure_dev.sqlite'

       Defaults to sqlite:////var/tmp/pagure_dev.sqlite

   APP_URL
       This configuration key indicates the URL at which this pagure instance will be made available.

       Defaults to: http://localhost.localdomain/

   EMAIL_ERROR
       Pagure sends email when it catches an unexpected error (which saves you from having to monitor the logs regularly; but if you like, the error is still present in the logs).  This configuration key
       allows you to specify to which email address to send these error reports.

   GIT_URL_SSH
       This configuration key provides the information to the user on how to clone the git repos hosted on pagure via SSH.

       The URL should end with a slash /.

       Defaults to: 'ssh://git@llocalhost.localdomain/'

       NOTE:
          If  you  are  using  a  custom  setup for your deployment where every user has an account on the machine you may want to tweak this URL to include the username. If that is the case, you can use
          {username} in the URL and it will be expanded to the username of the user viewing the page when rendered.  For example: 'ssh://{username}@pagure.org/'

   GIT_URL_GIT
       This configuration key provides the information to the user on how to clone the git repos hosted on pagure anonymously. This access can be granted via the git:// or http(s):// protocols.

       The URL should end with a slash /.

       Defaults to: 'git://localhost.localdomain/'

   BROKER_URL
       This configuration key is used to point celery to the broker to use. This is the broker that is used to communicate between the web application and its workers.

       Defaults to: "redis://%s:%d/%d" % (pagure_config["REDIS_HOST"], pagure_config["REDIS_PORT"], pagure_config["REDIS_DB"])

       NOTE:
          See the Redis options for the REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT and
          ``
          REDIS_DB``configuration keys

   Repo Directories
       Each project in pagure has 2 to 4 git repositories, depending on configuration of the Pagure instance (see below):

       • the main repo for the code

       • the doc repo showed in the doc server (optional)

       • the ticket repo storing the metadata of the tickets (optional)

       • the request repo storing the metadata of the pull-requests

       There are then another 3 folders: one for specifying the locations of the forks, one for the remote git repo used for the remotes pull-requests (ie: those coming from a project not hosted on  this
       instance of pagure), and one for user-uploaded tarballs.

   GIT_FOLDER
       This configuration key points to the folder where the git repos are stored.  For every project, two to four repos are created:

       • a repo with source code of the project

       • a repo with documentation of the project (if ENABLE_DOCS is True)

       • a repo with metadata of tickets opened against the project (if ENABLE_TICKETS is True)

       • a repo with metadata of pull requests opened against the project

       Note that gitolite config value GL_REPO_BASE (if using gitolite 3) or $REPO_BASE (if using gitolite 2) must have exactly the same value as GIT_FOLDER.

   REMOTE_GIT_FOLDER
       This configuration key points to the folder where the remote git repos (ie: not hosted on pagure) that someone used to open a pull-request against a project hosted on pagure are stored.

   UPLOAD_FOLDER_PATH
       This configuration key points to the folder where user-uploaded tarballs are stored and served from.

   ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER
       This configuration key points to the folder where attachments can be cached for easier access by the web-server (allowing to not interact with the git repo having it to serve it).

   UPLOAD_FOLDER_URL
       Full  URL  to  where the uploads are available. It is highly recommended for security reasons that this URL lives on a different domain than the main application (an entirely different domain, not
       just a sub-domain).

       Defaults to: /releases/, unsafe for production!

       WARNING:
          both UPLOAD_FOLDER_PATH and UPLOAD_FOLDER_URL must be specified for the upload release feature to work

   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE
       When this is set to True, the session cookie will only be returned to the server via ssl (https). If you connect to the server via plain http, the cookie will not be sent. This  prevents  sniffing
       of the cookie contents.  This may be set to False when testing your application but should always be set to True in production.

       Defaults to: False for development, must be True in production with https.

   SESSION_TYPE
       Enables the flask-session extension if set to a value other than None. The flask-session package needs to be installed and proper configuration needs to be included in the Pagure config file.

       This  is  useful  when the Pagure server needs to be scaled up to multiple instances, which requires the flask session keys to be shared between those.  Flask-session allows you to use Redis, Mem‐
       cached, relational database or MongoDB for storing shared session keys.

   FROM_EMAIL
       This configuration key specifies the email address used by this pagure instance when sending emails (notifications).

       Defaults to: pagure@localhost.localdomain

   DOMAIN_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS
       This configuration key specifies the domain used by this pagure instance when sending emails (notifications). More precisely, it is used when building the msg-id header of the emails sent.

       Defaults to: localhost.localdomain

   VIRUS_SCAN_ATTACHMENTS
       This configuration key configures whether attachments are scanned for viruses on upload. For more information, see the install.rst guide.

       Defaults to: False

   GIT_AUTH_BACKEND
       This configuration key allows specifying which git auth backend to use.

       Git auth backends can either be static (like gitolite), where a file is generated when something changed and then used on login, or dynamic, where the actual ACLs are checked in a git hook  before
       being applied.

       By default pagure provides the following backends:

       • test_auth: simple debugging backend printing and returning the string Called GitAuthTestHelper.generate_acls()

       • gitolite2: allows deploying pagure on the top of gitolite 2

       • gitolite3: allows deploying pagure on the top of gitolite 3

       • pagure: Pagure git auth implementation (using keyhelper.py and aclchecker.py) that is used via sshd AuthorizedKeysCommand

       • pagure_authorized_keys: Pagure git auth implementation that writes to authorized_keys file

       Defaults to: gitolite3

       NOTE:
          The option GITOLITE_BACKEND is the legacy name, and for backwards compatibility reasons will override this setting

       NOTE:
          These options can be expended, cf Customize the gitolite configuration.

   Configure Pagure Auth
       Pagure offers a simple, but extensible internal authentication mechanism for Git repositories. It relies on SSH for authentication. In other words, SSH lets you in and Pagure checks if you are al‐
       lowed to do what you are trying to do once you are inside.

       This authentication mechanism uses keyhelper.py and aclchecker.py to check the Pagure database for user registered SSH keys to do the authentication.

       The  integrated  authentication  mechanism has two modes of operation: one where it is configured as the AuthorizedKeysCommand for the SSH user (preferred) and one where it is configured to manage
       the authorized_keys file for the SSH user.

       In the preferred mode, when you attempt to do an action with a remote Git repo over SSH (e.g. git clone ssh://git@localhost.localdomain/repository.git), the SSH server will ask Pagure to  validate
       the SSH user key. This has the advantage of performance (no racey and slow file I/O) but has the disadvantage of requiring changes to the system's sshd_config file to use it.

       To use this variant, set the following in pagure.cfg:

          GIT_AUTH_BACKEND = "pagure"

          HTTP_REPO_ACCESS_GITOLITE = None

          SSH_KEYS_USERNAME_EXPECT = "git"

          SSH_COMMAND_NON_REPOSPANNER = ([
              "/usr/bin/%(cmd)s",
              "/srv/git/repositories/%(reponame)s",
          ], {"GL_USER": "%(username)s"})

       Setting the following in /etc/ssh/sshd_config is also required:

          Match User git
              AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/libexec/pagure/keyhelper.py "%u" "%h" "%t" "%f"
              AuthorizedKeysCommandUser git

       If  you  do  not have the ability to modify the sshd configuration to set up the pagure backend, then you need to use the pagure_authorized_keys alternative backend. This backend will write to the
       git user's  authorized_keys file instead. This is slower than the preferred mode and also has the disadvantage of making it impossible to scale to multiple Pagure frontend instances on  top  of  a
       shared  Git  storage without causing races and triggering inconsistencies. It also adds to the I/O contention on a heavily used system, but for most smaller setups with few users, the trade-off is
       not noticeable.

       To use this variant, enable the pagure_authorized_keys_worker service and set the following to pagure.cfg:

          SSH_FOLDER = "/srv/git/.ssh"

          GIT_AUTH_BACKEND = "pagure_authorized_keys"

          HTTP_REPO_ACCESS_GITOLITE = None

          SSH_COMMAND_NON_REPOSPANNER = ([
              "/usr/bin/%(cmd)s",
              "/srv/git/repositories/%(reponame)s",
          ], {"GL_USER": "%(username)s"})

   Configure Gitolite
       Pagure can use gitolite as an authorization layer.  Gitolite relies on SSH for the authentication. In other words, SSH lets you in and gitolite checks if you are allowed to do what you are  trying
       to do once you are inside.

       Pagure  supports both gitolite 2 and gitolite 3 and the code generating the gitolite configuration can be customized for easier integration with other systems (cf Customize the gitolite configura‐
       tion).

       Using Gitolite also requires setting the following in pagure.cfg:

          HTTP_REPO_ACCESS_GITOLITE = "/usr/share/gitolite3/gitolite-shell"

          SSH_COMMAND_NON_REPOSPANNER = (
              [
                  "/usr/share/gitolite3/gitolite-shell",
                  "%(username)s",
                  "%(cmd)s",
                  "%(reponame)s",
              ],
              {},
          )

       This ensures that the Gitolite environment is used for interacting with Git repositories. Further customizations are listed below.

   gitolite 2 and 3
   GITOLITE_HOME
       This configuration key points to the home directory of the user under which gitolite is ran.

   GITOLITE_KEYDIR
       This configuration key points to the folder where gitolite stores and accesses the public SSH keys of all the user have access to the server.

       Since pagure is the user interface, it is pagure that writes down the files in this directory, effectively setting up the users to be able to use gitolite.

   GITOLITE_CONFIG
       This configuration key points to the gitolite.conf file where pagure writes the gitolite repository access configuration.

   GITOLITE_CELERY_QUEUE
       This configuration is useful for large pagure deployment where recompiling the gitolite config file can take a long time. By default the compilation of gitolite's configuration file is done by the
       pagure_worker, which spawns by default 4 concurrent workers. If it takes a while to recompile the gitolite configuration file, these workers may be stepping on each others' toes.  In  this  situa‐
       tion,  this  configuration  key  allows  you  to  direct  the  messages asking for the gitolite configuration file to be compiled to a different queue which can then be handled by a different ser‐
       vice/worker.

       Pagure provides a pagure_gitolite_worker.service systemd service file pre-configured to handles these messages if this configuration key is set to gitolite_queue.

   gitolite 2 only
   GL_RC
       This configuration key points to the file gitolite.rc used by gitolite to record who has access to what (ie: who has access to which repo/branch).

   GL_BINDIR
       This configuration key indicates the folder in which the gitolite tools can be found. It can be as simple as /usr/bin/ if the tools have been installed using a package manager  or  something  like
       /opt/bin/ for a more custom install.

   gitolite 3 only
   GITOLITE_HAS_COMPILE_1
       By setting this configuration key to True, you can turn on using the gitolite compile-1 binary. This speeds up gitolite task when it recompiles configuration after new project is created. In order
       to use this, you need to have the compile-1 gitolite command.

       There are two ways to have it,

       1. You distribution already has the file installed for you and you can then just use it.

       2. You need to download and install it yourself. We are describing what needs to be done for this here below.

       Installing the compile-1 command:

       • You  also  have  to make sure that your distribution of gitolite contains patch which makes gitolite respect ALLOW_ORPHAN_GL_CONF configuration variable, if this patch isn't already present, you
         will have to make the change yourself.

       • In your gitolite.rc set ALLOW_ORPHAN_GL_CONF to 1 (you may have to add it yourself).

       • Still in your gitolite.rc file, uncomment LOCAL_CODE file and set it to a full path of a directory that you choose (for example /usr/local/share/gitolite3).

       • Create a subdirectory commands under the path you picked for LOCAL_CODE (in our example, you will need to do: mkdir -p /usr/local/share/gitolite3/commands)

       • Finally, install the compile-1 command in this commands subdirectory If your installation doesn't ship this file, you can download it.  (Ensure the file is executable,  otherwise  gitolite  will
         not find it)

       Defaults to: False

   EventSource options
   EVENTSOURCE_SOURCE
       This configuration key indicates the URL at which the EventSource server is available. If not defined, pagure will behave as if there are no EventSource server running.

   EVENTSOURCE_PORT
       This configuration key indicates the port at which the EventSource server is running.

       NOTE:
          The EventSource server requires a redis server (see Redis options below)

   Web-hooks notifications
   WEBHOOK
       This configuration key allows turning on or off web-hooks notifications for this pagure instance.

       Defaults to: False.

       NOTE:
          The Web-hooks server requires a redis server (see Redis options below)

   Redis options
   REDIS_HOST
       This configuration key indicates the host at which the redis server is running.

       Defaults to: 0.0.0.0.

   REDIS_PORT
       This configuration key indicates the port at which the redis server can be contacted.

       Defaults to: 6379.

   REDIS_DB
       This configuration key indicates the name of the redis database to use for communicating with the EventSource server.

       Defaults to: 0.

   Authentication options
   ADMIN_GROUP
       List  of  groups,  either  local  or  remote (if the openid server used supports the group extension), that are the site admins. These admins can regenerate the gitolite configuration, the ssh key
       files, and the hook-token for every project as well as manage users and groups.

   PAGURE_ADMIN_USERS
       List of local users that are the site admins. These admins have the same rights as the users in the admin groups listed above as well as admin rights to all projects  hosted  on  this  pagure  in‐
       stance.

   Celery Queue options
       In order to help prioritize between tasks having a direct impact on the user experience and tasks needed to be run on the background but not directly impacting the users, we have split the generic
       tasks triggered by the web application into three possible queues: Fast, Medium, Slow.  If none of these options are set, a single queue will be used for all tasks.

   FAST_CELERY_QUEUE
       This configuration key can be used to specify a dedicated queue for tasks that are triggered by the web frontend and need to be processed quickly for the best user experience.

       This will be used for tasks such as creating a new project, forking or merging a pull-request.

       Defaults to: None.

   MEDIUM_CELERY_QUEUE
       This configuration key can be used to specify a dedicated queue for tasks that are triggered by the web frontend and need to be processed but aren't critical for the best user experience.

       This will be used for tasks such as updating a file in a git repository.

       Defaults to: None.

   SLOW_CELERY_QUEUE
       This configuration key can be used to specify a dedicated queue for tasks that are triggered by the web frontend, are slow and do not impact the user experience in the user interface.

       This will be used for tasks such as updating the ticket git repo based on the content posted in the user interface.

       Defaults to: None.

   Stomp Options
       Pagure integration with Stomp allows you to emit messages to any stomp-compliant message bus.

   STOMP_NOTIFICATIONS
       This configuration key can be used to turn on or off notifications via stomp protocol. All other stomp-related settings don't need to be present if this is set to False.

       Defaults to: False.

   STOMP_BROKERS
       List of 2-tuples with broker domain names and ports. For example [('primary.msg.bus.com', 6543), ('backup.msg.bus.com`, 6543)].

   STOMP_HIERARCHY
       Base  name of the hierarchy to emit messages to. For example /queue/some.hierarchy.. Note that this must end with a dot. Pagure will append queue names such as project.new to this value, resulting
       in queue names being e.g.  /queue/some.hierarchy.project.new.

   STOMP_SSL
       Whether or not to use SSL when connecting to message brokers.

       Defaults to: False.

   STOMP_KEY_FILE
       Absolute path to key file for SSL connection. Only required if STOMP_SSL is set to True.

   STOMP_CERT_FILE
       Absolute path to certificate file for SSL connection. Only required if STOMP_SSL is set to True.

   STOMP_CREDS_PASSWORD
       Password for decoding STOMP_CERT_FILE and STOMP_KEY_FILE. Only required if STOMP_SSL is set to True and credentials files are password-encoded.

   ALWAYS_STOMP_ON_COMMITS
       This configuration key can be used to enforce stomp notifications on commits made on all projects in a pagure instance.

       Defaults to: False.

   API token ACLs
   ACLS
       This configuration key lists all the ACLs that can be associated with an API token with a short description of what the ACL allows one to do.  This key it not really meant to be changed unless you
       really know what you are doing.

   USER_ACLS
       This configuration key can be used to list which of the ACLs listed in ACLS can be associated with an API token of a project in the (web) user interface.

       Use this configuration key in combination with ADMIN_API_ACLS to disable certain ACLs for users while allowing admins to generate keys with them.

       Defaults to: [key for key in ACLS.keys() if key != 'generate_acls_project']
              (ie: all the ACLs in ACLS except for generate_acls_project)

   ADMIN_API_ACLS
       This configuration key can be used to list which of the ACLs listed in ACLS can be generated by the pagure-admin CLI tool by admins.

       Defaults to: ['issue_comment', 'issue_create', 'issue_change_status', 'pull_request_flag', 'pull_request_comment', 'pull_request_merge', 'generate_acls_project', 'commit_flag', 'create_branch']

   CROSS_PROJECT_ACLS
       This configuration key can be used to list which of the ACLs listed in ACLS can be associated with a project-less API token in the (web) user interface.  These project-less API tokens can be  gen‐
       erated in the user's settings page and allows action in multiple projects instead of being restricted to a specific one.

       Defaults to: ['create_project', 'fork_project', 'modify_project']

   Optional options
   Theming
   THEME
       This configuration key allows you to specify the theme to be used. The string specified is the name of the theme directory in pagure/themes/

       For more information about theming see the Theming Guide

       Default options:

       • chameleon  The OpenSUSE theme for pagure

       • default  The default theme for pagure

       • pagureio  The theme used at https://pagure.io

       • srcfpo  The theme used at https://src.fedoraproject.org

       Defaults to: default

   Git repository templates
   PROJECT_TEMPLATE_PATH
       This  configuration  key allows you to specify the path to a git repository to use as a template when creating new repository for new projects.  This template will not be used for forks nor any of
       the git repository but the one used for the sources (ie: it will not be used for the tickets, requests or docs repositories).

   FORK_TEMPLATE_PATH
       This configuration key allows you to specify the path to a git repository to use as a template when creating new repository for new forks.  This template will not be used for any of the git repos‐
       itory but the one used for the sources of forks (ie: it will not be used for the tickets, requests or docs repositories).

   SSH_KEYS
       It is a good practice to publish the fingerprint and public SSH key of a server you provide access to.  Pagure offers the possibility to expose this information based on the values set in the con‐
       figuration file, in the SSH_KEYS configuration key.

       See the SSH hostkeys/Fingerprints page on pagure.io.

       Where <foo> and <bar> must be replaced by your values.

   CSP_HEADERS
       Content Security Policy (CSP) is a computer security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks resulting from execution of  malicious
       content in the trusted web page context

       Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy

       Defaults to:

          CSP_HEADERS = (
              "default-src 'self' https:; "
              "script-src 'self' 'nonce-{nonce}'; "
              "style-src 'self' 'nonce-{nonce}'"
          )

       Where {nonce} is dynamically set by pagure.

   LOGGING_GIT_HOOKS
       This configuration key allows having a different logging configuration for the web application and the git hooks.

       If un-specified (default), the logging configuration used by the git hooks will be the same as the one for the web application (i.e.: defined in LOGGING here below).

       Defaults to: None.

   LOGGING
       This configuration key allows you to set up the logging of the application.  It relies on the standard python logging module.

       The default value is:

          LOGGING = {
               "version": 1,
               "disable_existing_loggers": False,
               "formatters": {
                   "standard": {
                       "format": "%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s"
                   },
                   "email_format": {"format": MSG_FORMAT},
               },
               "filters": {"myfilter": {"()": ContextInjector}},

                       "stream": "ext://sys.stdout",
                   },
                   "auth_handler": {
                       "formatter": "standard",

                       "filters": ["myfilter"],
                   },
               },
               # The root logger configuration; this is a catch-all configuration
               # that applies to all log messages not handled by a different logger
               "root": {"level": "INFO", "handlers": ["console"]},
               "loggers": {
                   "pagure": {

                       "level": "DEBUG",
                       "propagate": False,
                   },

                       "handlers": ["console"],
                       "level": "WARN",
                       "propagate": False,
                   },
                   "binaryornot": {
                       "handlers": ["console"],
                       "level": "WARN",
                       "propagate": True,
                   },
                   "MARKDOWN": {
                       "handlers": ["console"],

                       "propagate": True,
                   },
                   "PIL": {"handlers": ["console"], "level": "WARN", "propagate": True},
                   "chardet": {
                       "handlers": ["console"],
                       "level": "WARN",
                       "propagate": True,
                   },
                   "pagure.lib.encoding_utils": {
                       "handlers": ["console"],
                       "level": "WARN",
                       "propagate": False,
                   },
               },
           }

       NOTE:
          as  you  can  see there is an email handler defined. It's not used anywhere by default but you can use it to get report of errors by email and thus monitor your pagure instance.  To do this the
          easiest is to set, on the root logger:

              'handlers': ['console', 'email'],

       NOTE:
          The pagure_auth logger is a special one logging all activities regarding read/write access to git repositories. It will be a pretty important log for auditing if needed.  You can separate  this
          log into its own file if you like by using the following handler:

              "auth_handler": {
                  "formatter": "standard",
                  "class": "logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler",
                  "filename": "/var/log/pagure/pagure_auth.log",
                  "backupCount": 10,
                  "when": "midnight",
                  "utc": True,
              },

          This  snippet  will automatically make the logs rotate at midnight each day, keep the logs for 10 days and use UTC as timezone for the logs. Depending on how your pagure instance is set-up, you
          may have to tweak the filesystem permissions on the folder and file so the rotation works properly.

   ITEM_PER_PAGE
       This configuration key allows you to configure the length of a page by setting the number of items on the page. Items can be commits, users, groups, or projects for example.

       Defaults to: 50.

   PR_TARGET_MATCHING_BRANCH
       If set to True, the default target branch for all pull requests in UI is the branch that is longest substring of the branch that the pull request is created from. For example, a mybranch branch in
       original repo will be the default target of a pull request from branch mybranch-feature-1 in a fork when opening a new pull request. If this is set to False, the default branch of the repo will be
       the default target of all pull requests.

       Defaults to: False.

   SSH_ACCESS_GROUPS
       Some instances of pagure are deployed in such a way that only the members of certain groups are allowed to commit via ssh. This configuration key allows to specify which groups have commit  access
       and  thus  let  pagure hide the ssh URL from the drop-down "Clone" menu for all the person who are not in one of these groups.  If this configuration key is not defined or left empty, it is assume
       that there is no such group restriction and everyone can commit via ssh (default behavior).

       Defaults to: []

   SMTP configuration
   SMTP_SERVER
       This configuration key specifies the SMTP server to use when sending emails.

       Defaults to: localhost.

       See also the SMTP_STARTTLS section.

   SMTP_PORT
       This configuration key specifies the SMTP server port.

       SMTP by default uses TCP port 25. The protocol for mail submission is the same, but uses port 587.  SMTP connections secured by SSL, known as SMTPS, default to port 465 (nonstandard, but sometimes
       used for legacy reasons).

       Defaults to: 25

   SMTP_SSL
       This configuration key specifies whether the SMTP connections should be secured over SSL.

       Defaults to: False

   SMTP_STARTTLS
       This configuration key specifies instructs pagure to starts connecting to the SMTP server via a starttls command.

       When enabling STARTTLS in conjunction with a local smtp server, you should replace localhost with a host name that is included in the server's certificate. If the server only relays messages orig‐
       inating from localhost, then you should also ensure that the above host name resolves to the same tcp address as localhost, for instance by adding an appropriate record to /etc/hosts.

       Defaults to: False

   SMTP_KEYFILE
       This configuration key specifies a key file to be used in the starttls command when connecting to the smtp server.

       Defaults to: None

   SMTP_CERTFILE
       This configuration key specifies a certificate file to be used in the starttls command when connecting to the smtp server.

       Defaults to: None

   SMTP_USERNAME
       This configuration key allows usage of SMTP with auth.

       Note: Specify SMTP_USERNAME and SMTP_PASSWORD for using SMTP auth

       Defaults to: None

   SMTP_PASSWORD
       This configuration key allows usage of SMTP with auth.

       Note: Specify SMTP_USERNAME and SMTP_PASSWORD for using SMTP auth

       Defaults to: None

   SHORT_LENGTH
       This configuration key specifies the length of the commit ids or file hex displayed in the user interface.

       Defaults to: 6.

   BLACKLISTED_PROJECTS
       This configuration key specifies a list of project names that are forbidden.  This list is used for example to avoid conflicts at the URL level between the static files located under /static/  and
       a project that would be named static and thus be located at /static.

       Defaults to:

          [
              'static', 'pv', 'releases', 'new', 'api', 'settings',
              'logout', 'login', 'users', 'groups', 'about'
          ]

   CHECK_SESSION_IP
       This  configuration key specifies whether to check the user's IP address when retrieving its session. This makes things more secure but under certain setups it might not work (for example if there
       are proxies in front of the application).

       Defaults to: True.

   PAGURE_AUTH
       This configuration key specifies which authentication method to use.  Valid options are fas, openid, oidc, or local.

       • fas uses the Fedora Account System FAS <https://accounts.fedoraproject.org> to provide user authentication and enforces that users sign the FPCA.

       • openid uses OpenID authentication.  Any provider may be used by changing the FAS_OPENID_ENDPOINT configuration key.  By default FAS (without FPCA) will be used.

       • oidc enables OpenID Connect using any provider.  This provider requires the configuration options starting with OIDC_ (see below) to be provided.

       • local causes pagure to use the local pagure database for user management.  User registration can be disabled with the ALLOW_USER_REGISTRATION configuration key.

       Defaults to: local.

   OIDC Settings
       NOTE:
          Pagure uses flask-oidc to support OIDC authentication. This extension has a number of configuration keys that may be useful depending on your set-up

   OIDC_CLIENT_SECRETS
       Provide a path to client secrets file on local filesystem. This file can be obtained from your OpenID Connect identity provider. Note that some providers don't fill in userinfo_uri. If that is the
       case, you need to add it to the secrets file manually.

   OIDC_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_SECURE
       When this is set to True, the cookie with OpenID Connect Token will only be returned to the server via ssl (https). If you connect to the server via plain http, the cookie will not be  sent.  This
       prevents sniffing of the cookie contents.  This may be set to False when testing your application but should always be set to True in production.

       Defaults to: True for production with https, can be set to False for convenient development.

   OIDC_SCOPES
       List of OpenID Connect scopes http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims to request from identity provider.

   OIDC_PAGURE_EMAIL
       Name of key of user's email in userinfo JSON returned by identity provider.

   OIDC_PAGURE_FULLNAME
       Name of key of user's full name in userinfo JSON returned by identity provider.

   OIDC_PAGURE_USERNAME
       Name of key of user's preferred username in userinfo JSON returned by identity provider.

   OIDC_PAGURE_SSH_KEY
       Name of key of user's ssh key in userinfo JSON returned by identity provider.

   OIDC_PAGURE_GROUPS
       Name of key of user's groups in userinfo JSON returned by identity provider.

   OIDC_PAGURE_USERNAME_FALLBACK
       This specifies fallback for getting username assuming OIDC_PAGURE_USERNAME is empty - can be email (to use the part before @) or sub (IdP-specific user id, can be a nickname, email or a numeric ID
       depending on identity provider).

   IP_ALLOWED_INTERNAL
       This  configuration  key  specifies  which IP addresses are allowed to access the internal API endpoint. These endpoints are accessed by the milters for example and allow performing actions in the
       name of someone else which is sensitive, thus the origin of the request using these endpoints is validated.

       Defaults to: ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '::1'].

   MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH
       This configuration key specifies the maximum file size allowed when uploading content to pagure (for example, screenshots to a ticket).

       Defaults to: 4 * 1024 * 1024 which corresponds to 4 megabytes.

   ENABLE_TICKETS
       This configuration key activates or deactivates the ticketing system for all the projects hosted on this pagure instance.

       Defaults to: True

   ENABLE_TICKETS_NAMESPACE
       This configuration key can be used to restrict the namespace in which the ticketing system is enabled.  So if your pagure instance has ENABLE_TICKETS as True and sets  ENABLE_TICKETS_NAMESPACE  to
       ['tests', 'infra'] only the projects opened in these two namespaces will have the ticketing system enabled. All the other namespaces will not.

       Defaults to: []

   ENABLE_DOCS
       This configuration key activates or deactivates creation of git repos for documentation for all the projects hosted on this pagure instance.

       Defaults to: True

   ENABLE_NEW_PROJECTS
       This configuration key permits or forbids creation of new projects via the user interface and the API of this pagure instance.

       Defaults to: True

   ENABLE_UI_NEW_PROJECTS
       This  configuration  key  permits  or forbids creation of new projects via the user interface (only) of this pagure instance. It allows forbidding to create new project in the user interface while
       letting a set of trusted person to create projects via the API granted they have the API token with the corresponding ACL.

       Defaults to: True

   RESTRICT_CREATE_BY_OIDC_GROUP
       This configuration key, when defined, only allows users that are a member of the group defined the ability to create new projects and groups.

       Defaults to: None

   RESTRICT_CREATE_BY_OIDC_GROUP_COUNT
       This configuration key, when defined, only allows users that are a member of the group defined by RESTRICT_CREATE_BY_OIDC_GROUP and a member of at least the number of groups defined  by  this  key
       the ability to create new projects.

       Defaults to: 0

   ENABLE_DEL_PROJECTS
       This configuration key permits or forbids deletion of projects via the user interface of this pagure instance.

       Defaults to: True

   ENABLE_DEL_FORKS
       This configuration key permits or forbids deletion of forks via the user interface of this pagure instance.

       Defaults to: ENABLE_DEL_PROJECTS

   GIT_HOOK_DB_RO
       This  configuration  key  specifies  if  the git hook have a read-only (RO) access to the database or not.  Some pagure deployment provide an actual shell account on the host and thus the git hook
       called upon git push are executed under that account. If the user manages to by-pass git and is able to access the configuration file, they could have access to "private" information. So in  those
       deployments the git hooks have a specific configuration file with a database access that is read-only, making pagure behave differently in those situations.

       Defaults to: False

   EMAIL_SEND
       This configuration key enables or disables all email notifications for this pagure instance. This can be useful to turn off when developing on pagure, or for test or pre-production instances.

       Defaults to: False.

       NOTE:
          This does not disable emails to the email address set in EMAIL_ERROR.

   FEDMSG_NOTIFICATIONS
       This configuration key can be used to turn on or off notifications via fedmsg.

       Defaults to: False.

   FEDORA_MESSAGING_NOTIFICATIONS
       This configuration key can be used to turn on or off sending notifications via fedora-messaging.

       Defaults to: False.

   ALWAYS_FEDMSG_ON_COMMITS
       This configuration key can be used to enforce fedmsg notifications on commits made on all projects in a pagure instance.

       Defaults to: True.

   ALLOW_DELETE_BRANCH
       This  configuration keys enables or disables allowing users to delete git branches from the user interface. In sensible pagure instance you may want to turn this off and with a customized gitolite
       configuration you can prevent users from deleting branches in their git repositories.

       Defaults to: True.

   ALLOW_ADMIN_IGNORE_EXISTING_REPOS
       This enables a checkbox "Ignore existing repos" for admins when creating a new project. When this is checkbox is checked, existing repositories will not cause project creation to fail.  This could
       be used to assume responsibility of existing repositories.

       Defaults to: False.

   USERS_IGNORE_EXISTING_REPOS
       List of users who can al create a project while ignoring existing repositories.

       Defaults to: [].

   LOCAL_SSH_KEY
       This configuration key can be used to let pagure administrate the user's ssh keys or have a third party tool do it for you.  In most cases, it will be fine to let pagure handle it.

       Defaults to True.

   DEPLOY_KEY
       This configuration key can be used to disable the deploy keys feature of an entire pagure instance. This feature enable to add extra public ssh keys that a third party  could  use  to  push  to  a
       project.

       Defaults to True.

   OLD_VIEW_COMMIT_ENABLED
       In version 1.3, pagure changed its URL scheme to view the commit of a project in order to add support for pseudo-namespaced projects.

       For pagure instances older than 1.3, who care about backward compatibility, we added an endpoint view_commit_old that brings URL backward compatibility for URLs using the complete git hash (the 40
       characters).  For URLs using a shorter hash, the URLs will remain broken.

       This configuration key enables or disables this backward compatibility which is useful for pagure instances running since before 1.3 but is not for newer instances.

       Defaults to: False.

   DISABLE_REMOTE_PR
       In some pagure deployments remote pull requests need to be disabled due to legal / policy reasons.

       Defaults to: False.

   PAGURE_CI_SERVICES
       Pagure can be configure to integrate results of a Continuous Integration (CI) service to pull-requests open against a project.

       To enable this integration, follow the documentation on how to install pagure-ci and set this configuration key to ['jenkins'] (Jenkins being the only CI service supported at the moment).

       Defaults to: None.

       WARNING:
          Requires Redis to be configured and running.

   INSTANCE_NAME
       This allows giving a name to this running instance of pagure. The name is then used in the welcome screen shown upon first login.

       Defaults to: Pagure

   ADMIN_EMAIL
       This configuration key allows you to change the default administrator email which is displayed on the "about" page. It can also be used elsewhere.

       Defaults to: root@localhost.localdomain

   USER_NAMESPACE
       This configuration key can be used to enforce that project are namespaced under the user's username, behaving in this way in a similar fashion as github.com or gitlab.com.

       Defaults to: False

   DOC_APP_URL
       This configuration key allows you to specify where the documentation server is running (preferably in a different domain name entirely).  If not set, the documentation page will show an error mes‐
       sage saying that this pagure instance does not have a documentation server.

       Defaults to: None

   PRIVATE_PROJECTS
       This configuration key allows you to host private repositories. These repositories are visible only to the creator of the repository and to the users who are given access to the repository. No in‐
       formation is leaked about the private repository which means redis doesn't have the access to the repository and even fedmsg doesn't get any notifications.

       Defaults to: True

   EXCLUDE_GROUP_INDEX
       This configuration key can be used to hide project an user has access to via one of the groups listed in this key.

       The use-case is the following: the Fedora project is deploying pagure has a front-end for the git repos of the packages in the distribution, that means about 17,000 git repositories in pagure. The
       project has a group of people that have access to all of these repositories, so when viewing the user's page of one member of that group, instead of seeing all the project that this user works on,
       you  can  see all the projects hosted in that pagure instance. Using this configuration key, pagure will hide all the projects that this user has access to via the specified groups and thus return
       only the groups of forks of that users.

       Defaults to: []

   TRIGGER_CI
       A run of pagure-ci can be manually triggered if some key sentences are added as comment to a pull-request, either manually or via the "Rerun CI" dropdown.  This allows one to re-run  a  test  that
       failed due to some network outage or other unexpected issues unrelated to the test suite.

       This  configuration  key can be used to define all the sentences that can be used to trigger this pagure-ci run. The format is following: {"<sentence>": {"name": "<name of the CI>", "description":
       "<short description>"}}

       Sentences which have None as value won't show up in the "Rerun CI" dropdown. Additionally, it's possible to add a requires_project_hook_attr key to the dict with data about a sentence.  For  exam‐
       ple, having "requires_project_hook_attr": ("ci_hook", "active_pr", True) would make the "Rerun CI" dropdown have a button for this specific CI only if the project has ci_hook activated and its ac‐
       tive_pr value is True.

       In versions before 5.2, this was a list containing just the sentences.

       Defaults to: {"pretty please pagure-ci rebuild": {"name": "Default CI", "description": "Rerun default CI"}}

       NOTE:
          The sentences defined in this configuration key should be lower case only!

   FLAG_STATUSES_LABELS
       By  default,  Pagure has success, failure, error, pending and canceled statuses of PR and commit flags. This setting allows you to define a custom mapping of statuses to their respective Bootstrap
       labels.

   FLAG_SUCCESS
       Holds name of PR/commit flag that is considered a success.

       Defaults to: success

   FLAG_FAILURE
       Holds name of PR/commit flag that is considered a failure.

       Defaults to: failure

   FLAG_PENDING
       Holds name of PR/commit flag that is considered a pending state.

       Defaults to: pending

   EXTERNAL_COMMITTER
       The external committer feature is a way to allow members of groups defined outside pagure (and provided to pagure upon login by the authentication system) to be consider committers on pagure.

       This feature can give access to all the projects on the instance, all but some or just some.

       Defaults to: {}

       To give access to all the projects to a group named fedora-altarch use a such a structure:

          EXTERNAL_COMMITTER = {
              'fedora-altarch': {}
          }

       To give access to all the projects but one (named rpms/test) to a group named provenpackager use a such a structure:

          EXTERNAL_COMMITTER = {
              'fedora-altarch': {},
              'provenpackager': {
                  'exclude': ['rpms/test']
              }
          }

       To give access to just some projects (named rpms/test and modules/test) to a group named testers use a such a structure:

          EXTERNAL_COMMITTER = {
              'fedora-altarch': {},
              'provenpackager': {
                  'exclude': ['rpms/test']
              },
              'testers': {
                  'restrict': ['rpms/test', 'modules/test']
              }
          }

   REQUIRED_GROUPS
       The required groups allows one to specify in which group an user must be to be added to a project with commit or admin access.

       Defaults to: {}

       Example configuration:

          REQUIRED_GROUPS = {
              'rpms/kernel': ['packager', 'kernel-team'],
              'modules/*': ['module-packager', 'packager'],
              'rpms/*': ['packager'],
              '*': ['contributor'],
          }

       With this configuration (evaluated in the provided order):

       • only users that are in the groups packager and kernel-team will be allowed to be added the rpms/kernel project (where rpms is the namespace and kernel the project name).

       • only users that are in the groups module-packager and packager will be allowed to be added to projects in the modules namespace.

       • only users that are in the group packager will be allowed to be added to projects in the rpms namespace.

       • only users in the contributor group will be allowed to be added to any project on this pagure instance.

   GITOLITE_PRE_CONFIG
       This configuration key allows you to include some content at the top of the gitolite configuration file (such as some specific group definition), thus allowing to customize the gitolite configura‐
       tion file with elements and information that are outside of pagure's control.

       This can be used in combination with GITOLITE_POST_CONFIG to further customize gitolite's configuration file. It can also be used with EXTERNAL_COMMITTER to give commit access to git  repos  based
       on external information.

       Defaults to: None

   GITOLITE_POST_CONFIG
       This configuration key allows you to include some content at the end of the gitolite configuration file (such as some project definition or access), thus allowing to customize the gitolite config‐
       uration file with elements and information that are outside of pagure's control.

       This can be used in combination with GITOLITE_PRE_CONFIG to further customize gitolite's configuration file. It can also be used with EXTERNAL_COMMITTER to give commit access to git repos based on
       external information.

       Defaults to: None

   GIT_GARBAGE_COLLECT
       This  configuration  key  allows  for explicit running of git gc --auto after every operation that adds new objects to any git repository - that is after pushing and merging. The reason for having
       this functionality in Pagure is that gc is not guaranteed to be run by git after every object-adding operation.

       The garbage collection run by Pagure will respect git settings, so you can tweak gc.auto and gc.autoPackLimit to your liking and that will have immediate effect on the task that runs  the  garbage
       collection. These values can be configured system-wide in /etc/gitconfig.  See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc#git-gc---auto for more details.

       This  is especially useful if repositories are stored on NFS (or similar network storage), where file metadata access is expensive - having unpacked objects in repositories requires a lot of meta‐
       data reads.

       Note that the garbage collection is only run on repos that are not on repoSpanner.

       Defaults to: False

   CELERY_CONFIG
       This configuration key allows you to tweak the configuration of celery for your needs.  See the documentation about celery configuration for more information.

       Defaults to: {}

   CASE_SENSITIVE
       This configuration key can be used to make this pagure instance case sensitive instead of its default: case-insensitive.

       Defaults to: False

   PROJECT_NAME_REGEX
       This configuration key can be used to customize the regular expression used to validate new project name.

       Defaults to: ^[a-zA-z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9-_]*$

   APPLICATION_ROOT
       This configuration key is used in the path of the cookie used by pagure.

       Defaults to: '/'

   ALLOWED_PREFIX
       This configuration key can be used to specify a list of allowed namespaces that will not require creating a group for users to create projects in.

       Defaults to: []

   ADMIN_SESSION_LIFETIME
       This configuration key allows specifying the lifetime of the session during which the user won't have to log in again for admin actions.  In other words, the maximum time between which an user can
       access a project's settings page without a re-login.

       Defaults to: timedelta(minutes=20)

       where timedelta comes from the python datetime module

   BLACKLISTED_GROUPS
       This configuration key can be used to blacklist some group names.

       Defaults to: ['forks', 'group']

   ENABLE_GROUP_MNGT
       This configuration key can be used to turn on or off managing (ie: creating a group, adding or removing users in that group) groups in this pagure instance.  If turned off, groups and  group  mem‐
       bers are to be managed outside of pagure and synced upon login.

       Defaults to: True

   ENABLE_USER_MNGT
       This configuration key can be used to turn on or off managing users (adding or removing them from a project) in this pagure instance.  If turned off, users are managed outside of pagure.

       Defaults to: True

   ALLOW_USER_REGISTRATION
       This  configuration  key can be used to turn on or off user registration (that is, the ability for users to create an account) in this pagure instance.  If turned off, user accounts cannot be cre‐
       ated through the UI or API.  Currently, this key only applies to pagure instances configured with the local authentication backend and has no effect with the other authentication backends.

       Defaults to: True

   SESSION_COOKIE_NAME
       This configuration key can be used to specify the name of the session cookie used by pagure.

       Defaults to: 'pagure'

   SHOW_PROJECTS_INDEX
       This configuration key can be used to specify what is shown in the index page of logged in users.

       Defaults to: ['repos', 'myrepos', 'myforks']

   EMAIL_ON_WATCHCOMMITS
       By default pagure sends an email to every one watch commits on a project when a commit is made.  However some pagure instances may be using a different notification mechanism on commits  and  thus
       may not want this feature to double the notifications received.  This configuration key can be used to turn on or off email being sent to people watching commits on a project upon commits.

       Defaults to: True

   ALLOW_HTTP_PULL_PUSH
       This  configuration  key  controls  whether  any HTTP access to repositories is provided via the support for that that's embedded in Pagure.  This provides HTTP pull access via <pagureurl>/<repon‐
       ame>.git if nothing else serves this URL.

       Defaults to: True

   ALLOW_HTTP_PUSH
       This configuration key controls whether pushing is possible via the HTTP interface.  This is disabled by default, as it requires setting up an authentication mechanism on the webserver  that  sets
       REMOTE_USER.

       Defaults to: False

   HTTP_REPO_ACCESS_GITOLITE
       This  configuration  key configures the path to the gitolite-shell binary.  If this is set to None, Git http-backend is used directly.  Only set this to None if you intend to provide HTTP push ac‐
       cess via Pagure, and are using a dynamic ACL backend.

       Defaults to: /usr/share/gitolite3/gitolite-shell

   MIRROR_SSHKEYS_FOLDER
       This configuration key specificies where pagure should store the ssh keys generated for the mirroring feature. This folder should be properly backed up and kept secure.

       Defaults to: /var/lib/pagure/sshkeys/

   LOG_ALL_COMMITS
       This configuration key will make pagure log all commits pushed to all branches of all repositories instead of logging only the once that are pushed to the default branch.

       Defaults to: False

   DISABLE_MIRROR_IN
       This configuration key allows a pagure instance to not support mirroring in projects (from third party git server).

       Defaults to: False

   SYNTAX_ALIAS_OVERRIDES
       This configuration key can be used to force highlight.js to use a certain logic on certain files based on their extensions.

       It should be a dictionary containing the file extensions as keys and the highlighting language/category to use as values.

       Defaults to: {".spec": "specfile", ".patch": "diff"}

   ALLOW_API_UPDATE_GIT_TAGS
       This configuration key determines whether users are allowed to update existing git tags via the API.  When set to False, this essentially makes the API ignore whether the force argument is set  or
       not.

       Defaults to: True

   PAGURE_PLUGINS_CONFIG
       This  option  can  be  used  to specify the configuration file used for loading plugins. It is not set by default, instead if must be declared explicitly.  Also see the documentation on plugins at
       Plugins.

   GIT_DEFAULT_BRANCH
       This configuration key specifies the default branch configured upon project creation. The default branch can be specified by the user upon project creation but if the user  does  not  specify  any
       branch, this branch name will be used.

       Defaults to: None (which results in the default branch being master).

   PR_WARN_CHARACTERS
       List of characters that triggers a warning to the users when met in a commit of a pull-request (each commit being made checked).

       Defaults to:

          set([
              chr(0x202a), chr(0x202b), chr(0x202c), chr(0x202d), chr(0x202e),
              chr(0x2066), chr(0x2067), chr(0x2068), chr(0x2069)
          ])

   RepoSpanner Options
       Pagure can be integrated with repoSpanner allowing to deploy pagure in a load-balanced environment since the git repositories are then synced across multiple servers simultaneously.

       Support for this integration has been included in Pagure version 5.0 and higher.

       Here below are the different options one can/should use to integrate pagure with repoSpanner.

   REPOBRIDGE_BINARY
       This should contain the path to the repoBridge binary, which is used for pushing and pulling to/from repoSpanner.

       Defaults to: /usr/libexec/repobridge.

   REPOSPANNER_NEW_REPO
       This configuration key instructs pagure to create new git repositories on repoSpanner or not.  Its value should be the region in which the new git repositories should be created on.

       Defaults to: None.

   REPOSPANNER_NEW_REPO_ADMIN_OVERRIDE
       This configuration key can be used to let pagure admin override the default region used when creating new git repositories on repoSpanner.  Its value should be a boolean.

       Defaults to: False

   REPOSPANNER_NEW_FORK
       This  configuration  key  instructs  pagure  on where/how to create new git repositories for the forks with repoSpanner.  If None, git repositories for forks are created outside of repoSpanner en‐
       tirely.  If True, git repositories for forks are created in the same region as the parent project.  Otherwise, a region can be directly specified where git repositories for forks will be created.

       Defaults to: True

   REPOSPANNER_ADMIN_MIGRATION
       This configuration key can be used to let admin manually migrate individual project into repoSpanner once it is set up.

       Defaults to: False

   REPOSPANNER_REGIONS
       This configuration key can be used to specify the different region where repoSpanner is deployed and thus with which this pagure instance can be integrated.

       An example entry could look like:

          REPOSPANNER_REGIONS = {
              'default': {'url': 'https://nodea.regiona.repospanner.local:8444',
                          'repo_prefix': 'pagure/',
                          'hook': None,
                          'ca': '/etc/pki/repospanner/pki/ca.crt',
                          'admin_cert': {'cert': '/etc/pki/repospanner/pki/admin.crt',
                                         'key': '/etc/pki/repospanner/pki/admin.key'},
                          'push_cert': {'cert': '/etc/pki/repospanner/pki/pagure.crt',
                                        'key': '/etc/pki/repospanner/pki/pagure.key'}}
          }

       If this configuration key is not defined, pagure will consider that it is not set to be integrated with repoSpanner.

       Defaults to: {}

   SSH_KEYS_USERNAME_LOOKUP
       This configuration key is used by the keyhelper script to indicate that the git username should be used and looked up. Use this if the username that is sent to ssh is specific for a unique  Pagure
       user (i.e. not using a single "git@" user for all git operations).

   SSH_KEYS_USERNAME_FORBIDDEN
       A list of usernames that are exempted from being verified via the keyhelper.

   SSH_KEYS_USERNAME_EXPECT
       This configuration key should contain the username that is used for git if a single SSH user is used for all git ssh traffic (i.e. "git").

   SSH_KEYS_OPTIONS
       This configuration key provides the options added to keys as they are returned to sshd, in the same format as AuthorizedKeysFile (see "AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT" in sshd(8)).

   SSH_ADMIN_TOKEN
       If not set to None, aclchecker and keyhelper will use this api admin token to get authorized to internal endpoints that they use. The token must have the internal_access ACL.

       This  is  useful when the IP address of sshd service is not predictable (e.g. because of running in a distributed cloud environment) and so it's not possible to use the IP_ALLOWED_INTERNAL address
       list.

       Defaults to: None

   SSH_COMMAND_REPOSPANNER
       The command to run if a repository is on repospanner when aclchecker is in use.

   SSH_COMMAND_NON_REPOSPANNER
       The command to run if a repository is not on repospanner when aclchecker is in use.

   MQTT Options
       If approprietly configured pagure supports sending messages to an MQTT message queue.

       Here below are the different configuration options to make it so.

   MQTT_NOTIFICATIONS
       Global configuration key to turn on or off the code to send notifications to an MQTT message queue.

       Defaults to: False

   MQTT_HOST
       Host name of the MQTT server to send the MQTT notifications to.

       Defaults to: None

   MQTT_PORT
       Port of the MQTT server to use to send the MQTT notifications to.

       Defaults to: None

   MQTT_USERNAME
       Username to authenticate to the MQTT server as.

       Defaults to: None

   MQTT_PASSWORD
       Password to authenticate to the MQTT server with.

       Defaults to: None

   MQTT_CA_CERTS
       When using SSL-based authentication to the MQTT server, use this configuration key to point to the CA cert to use.

       Defaults to: None

   MQTT_CERTFILE
       When using SSL-based authentication to the MQTT server, use this configuration key to point to the cert file to use.

       Defaults to: None

   MQTT_KEYFILE
       When using SSL-based authentication to the MQTT server, use this configuration key to point to the key file to use.

       Defaults to: None

   MQTT_CERT_REQS
       When using SSL-based authentication to the MQTT server, use this configuration key to specify if the CERT is required.

       Defaults to: ssl.CERT_REQUIRED (from python's ssl library)

   MQTT_TLS_VERSION
       When using SSL-based authentication to the MQTT server, use this configuration key to specify the TLS protocols to support/use.

       Defaults to: ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2 (from python's ssl library)

   MQTT_CIPHERS
       When using SSL-based authentication to the MQTT server, use this configuration key to specify the ciphers.

       Defaults to: None

   MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX
       This configuration key can be used to specify a prefix to the mqtt messages sent.  This prefix will be added to the topic used by pagure thus allowing the mqtt admins to specify a parent topic for
       all pagure-related messages.

       Defaults to: None

   ALWAYS_MQTT_ON_COMMITS
       This configuration key can be used to enforce mqtt notifications on commits made on all projects in a pagure instance.

       Defaults to: False.

   NOGITHOOKS
       This configuration key should not be touched. It is used in the test suite as a way to prevent all the git hooks from running (which includes checking if the user is allowed to push).  Using  this
       mechanism we are able to check some behavior in the test suite that in a deployed pagure instance are happening in a different process.

       Do not change this option in production

       Defaults to: None.

   Deprecated configuration keys
   FORK_FOLDER
       This  configuration key used to be use to specify the folder where the forks are placed. Since the release 2.0 of pagure, it has been deprecated, forks are now automatically placed in a sub-folder
       of the folder containing the mains git repositories (ie GIT_FOLDER).

       See the UPGRADING.rst file for more information about this change and how to handle it.

   UPLOAD_FOLDER
       This configuration key used to be use to specify where the uploaded releases are available. It has been replaced by UPLOAD_FOLDER_PATH in the release 2.10 of pagure.

   GITOLITE_VERSION
       This configuration key specifies which version of gitolite you are using, it can be either 2 or 3.

       Defaults to: 3.

       This has been replaced by GITOLITE_BACKEND in the release 3.0 of pagure.

   DOCS_FOLDER, REQUESTS_FOLDER, TICKETS_FOLDER
       These configuration values were removed. It has been found out that due to how Pagure writes repo names in the gitolite configuration file, these must have  fixed  paths  relative  to  GIT_FOLDER.
       Specifically,  they  must  occupy  subdirectories  docs, requests and tickets under GIT_FOLDER.  They are now computed automatically based on value of GIT_FOLDER.  Usage of docs and tickets can be
       triggered by setting ENABLE_DOCS and ENABLE_TICKETS to True (this is the default).

   FILE_SIZE_HIGHLIGHT
       This configuration key can be used to specify the maximum number of characters a file or diff should have to have syntax highlighting. Everything above this limit will not have syntax highlighting
       as this is a memory intensive procedure that easily leads to out of memory error on large files or diff.

       Defaults to: 5000

   BOOTSTRAP_URLS_CSS
       This configuration key can be used to specify the URL where are hosted the bootstrap CSS file since the files hosted on apps.fedoraproject.org used in pagure.io are not restricted in  browser  ac‐
       cess.

       Defaults to: 'https://apps.fedoraproject.org/global/fedora-bootstrap-1.1.1/fedora-bootstrap.css'

       This has been deprecated by the new way of theming pagure, see the theming documentation

   BOOTSTRAP_URLS_JS
       This  configuration  key  can be used to specify the URL where are hosted the bootstrap JS file since the files hosted on apps.fedoraproject.org used in pagure.io are not restricted in browser ac‐
       cess.

       Defaults to: 'https://apps.fedoraproject.org/global/fedora-bootstrap-1.1.1/fedora-bootstrap.js'

       This has been deprecated by the new way of theming pagure, see the theming documentation

   HTML_TITLE
       This configuration key allows you to customize the HTML title of all the pages, from ... - pagure (default) to ... - <your value>.

       Defaults to: Pagure

       This has been deprecated by the new way of theming pagure, see the theming documentation

   GITOLITE_BACKEND
       This configuration key allowed specifying the gitolite backend.  This has now been replaced by GIT_AUTH_BACKEND, please see that option for information on valid values.

   PAGURE_PLUGIN
       This configuration key specifies the path to the plugins configuration file. It is set as an environment variable. It has been replaced by PAGURE_PLUGINS_CONFIG. The new variable does  not  modify
       the behavior of the old variable, however unlike PAGURE_PLUGIN it can be set in the main Pagure configuration.

PLUGINS
       Pagure provides a mechanism for loading 3rd party plugins in the form of Flask Blueprints. The plugins are loaded from a separate configuration file that is specified using the PAGURE_PLUGINS_CON‐
       FIG option. There are at least two reasons for keeping plugins initialization outside the main pagure configuration file:

       1. avoid circular dependencies errors. For example if the pagure configuration imports a plugin, which in turn imports the pagure configuration, the plugin could try to read a configuration option
          that has not been imported yet and thus raise an error

       2. the pagure configuration is also loaded by other processes such as Celery workers. The Celery tasks might only be interested in reading the configuration settings without having to load any ex‐
          ternal plugin

   Loading the configuration
       The  configuration  file can be loaded by setting the variable PAGURE_PLUGINS_CONFIG inside the pagure main configuration file, for example inside /etc/pagure/pagure.cfg. Alternatively, it is also
       possible to set the environment variable PAGURE_PLUGINS_CONFIG before starting the pagure server. If both variables are set, the environment variable takes precedence over the configuration file.

   The configuration file
       After Pagure has imported the configuration file defined in PAGURE_PLUGINS_CONFIG it will look for Flask Blueprints in a variable called PLUGINS defined in the same file, for example PLUGINS  =  [
       plugin1.blueprint, plugin2.blueprint, ... ]. Pagure will then proceed to register any Blueprint into the main Flask app, in the same order as they are listed in PLUGINS.

       An example configuration can be seen in files/plugins.cfg.sample inside the Pagure repository.

CUSTOMIZE THE GITOLITE CONFIGURATION
       Pagure provides a mechanism to allow customizing the creation and compilation of the configuration file of gitolite.

       To customize the gitolite configuration file, we invite you to look at the sources of the module pagure.lib.git_auth.

       As you can see it defines the following class:

          class GitAuthHelper(object):

              __metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta

              @staticmethod
              @abc.abstractmethod
              def generate_acls():
                  pass

              @classmethod
              @abc.abstractmethod
              def remove_acls(self, session, project):
                  pass

       This will be the class you will have to inherit from in order to inject your own code.  You will then declare an entry point in your setup.py following this template:

          entry_points="""
          [pagure.git_auth.helpers]
          my_git_auth = my_pagure.my_module:MyGitAuthTestHelper
          """

       Then you can adjust pagure's configuration file to say:

          GITOLITE_BACKEND = 'my_git_auth'

DEVELOPMENT
   Get the sources
       Anonymous:

          git clone https://pagure.io/pagure.git

       Contributors:

          git clone ssh://git@pagure.io/pagure.git

   Dependencies
       Install the build dependencies of pagure:

          sudo dnf install git python-virtualenv libgit2-devel \
                           libjpeg-devel gcc libffi-devel redhat-rpm-config

       The python dependencies of pagure are listed in the file requirements.txt at the top level of the sources.

          virtualenv pagure_env
          source ./pagure_env/bin/activate
          pip install pygit2==<version of libgit2 found>.* # e.g. 0.23.*
          pip install -r requirements.txt

       NOTE:
          working in a virtualenv is tricky due to the dependency on pygit2 and thus on libgit2 but the pygit2 documentation has a solution for this.

   How to run pagure
       There are several options when it comes to a development environment. Vagrant will provide you with a virtual machine which you can develop on, you can use a container to run pagure or you can in‐
       stall it directly on your host machine.  The README has detailed instructions for the different options.

   Run pagure for development
       Adjust the configuration file (secret key, database URL, admin group...)  See Configuration for more detailed information about the configuration.

       Create the database scheme:

          ./createdb.py

       Create the folder that will receive the different git repositories:

          mkdir {repos,docs,forks,tickets,requests,remotes}

       Run the server:

          ./runserver.py

       If you want to change some configuration key you can create a file, place the configuration change in it and use it with

          ./runserver.py -c <config_file>

       For example, create the file config with in it:

          from datetime import timedelta
          # Makes the admin session longer
          ADMIN_SESSION_LIFETIME = timedelta(minutes=20000000)

          # Use a postgresql database instead of sqlite
          DB_URL = 'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/pagure'
          # Change the OpenID endpoint
          FAS_OPENID_ENDPOINT = 'https://id.stg.fedoraproject.org'

          APP_URL = '*'
          EVENTSOURCE_SOURCE = 'http://localhost:8080'
          EVENTSOURCE_PORT = '8080'
          DOC_APP_URL = '*'

          # Avoid sending email when developing
          EMAIL_SEND = False

       and run the server with:

          ./runserver.py -c config

       To get some profiling information you can also run it as:

          ./runserver.py --profile

       You should be able to access the server at http://localhost:5000

       Every time you save a file, the project will be automatically restarted so you can see your change immediately.

   Create a pull-request for testing
       When working on pagure, it is pretty often that one wanted to work on a feature or a bug related to pull-requests needs to create one.

       Making a pull-request for development purposes isn't hard, if you remember that since you're running a local instance, the git repos created in your pagure instance are also local.

       So here are in a few steps that one could perform to create a pull-request in a local pagure instance.

       • Create a project on your pagure instance, let's say it will be called test

       • Create a folder clones somewhere in your system (you probably do not want it in the repos folder created above, next to it is fine though):

            mkdir clones

       • Clone the repo of the test project into this clones folder and move into it:

            cd clones
            git clone ~/path/to/pagure/repos/test.git
            cd test

       • Add and commit some files:

            echo "*~" > .gitignore
            git add .gitignore
            git commit -m "Add a .gitignore file"
            echo "BSD" > LICENSE
            git add LICENSE
            git commit -m "Add a LICENSE file"

       • Push these changes:

            git push -u origin master

       • Create a new branch and add a commit in it:

            git branch new_branch
            git checkout new_branch
            touch test
            git add test
            git commit -m "Add file: test"

       • Push this new branch:

            git push -u origin new_branch

       Then  go back to your pagure instance running in your web-browser, check the test project. You should see two branches: master and new_branch.  From there you should be able to open a new pull-re‐
       quest, either from the front page or via the File Pull Request button in the Pull Requests page.

   Coding standards
       We are trying to make the code PEP8-compliant.  There is a flake8 tool that can automatically check your source.

       We run the source code through black as part of the tests, so you may have to do some adjustments or run it yourself (which is simple: black /path/to/pagure).

       NOTE:
          flake8 and black are available in Fedora:

              dnf install python3-flake8 python3-black

          or

              yum install python3-flake8 python3-black

   Send patch
       The easiest way to work on pagure is to make your own branch in git, make your changes to this branch, commit whenever you want, rebase on master, whenever you need and when you are done, send the
       patch either by email, via the trac or a pull-request (using git or github).

       The workflow would therefore be something like:

          git branch <my_shiny_feature>
          git checkout <my_shiny_feature>
          <work>
          git commit file1 file2
          <more work>
          git commit file3 file4
          git checkout master
          git pull
          git checkout <my_shiny_feature>
          git rebase master
          git format-patch -2

       This will create two patch files that you can send by email to submit in a ticket on pagure, by email or after forking the project on pagure by submitting a pull-request (in which  case  the  last
       step above git format-patch -2 is not needed.

       NOTE:
          Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough de‐
          scription.   The  text  up  to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git.  For example, git-format-patch turns a commit into
          email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.  Pagure uses lines that contain only 'Fixes #number' as references to issues. If for  example  a  commit
          message of a pagure patch has a line 'Fixes #3547' and a pullrequest (PR) gets created in pagure, this PR will be linked to from https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/3547

   Unit-tests
       Pagure has a number of unit-tests.

       We  aim  at having a full (100%) coverage of the whole code (including the Flask application) and of course a smart coverage as in we want to check that the functions work the way we want but also
       that they fail when we expect it and the way we expect it.

       Tests checking that function are failing when/how we want are as important as tests checking they work the way they are intended to.

       So here are a few steps that one could perform to run unit-tests in a local pagure instance.

       • Install the dependencies:

            pip install -r requirements-testing.txt

       • Run it:

            tox ./test/

       If you want to run a single interpreter, cou can use:

          tox -e py38 ./test/

       Each unit-tests files (located under tests/) can be called by alone, allowing easier debugging of the tests. For example:

          pytest-3 tests/test_pagure_lib.py

       NOTE:
          In order to have coverage information you might have to install python-coverage

              dnf install python3-pytest-cov

       To run the unit-tests, there is also a container available with all the dependencies needed.  Use the following command to run the tests

          $ ./dev/run-tests-container.py

       This command will build a fedora based container and execute the test suite.  You can also limit the tests to unit-test files or single tests similar to the options described above. You  need  set
       the environment variables REPO and BRANCH if the tests are not yet available in the upstream pagure master branch.

CONTRIBUTING
       If you're submitting patches to pagure, please observe the following:

       • Check that your python code is PEP8-compliant.  There is a flake8 tool that automatically checks the sources as part of the tests.

       • We run the source code through black as part of the tests, so you may have to do some adjustments or run it yourself (which is simple: black /path/to/pagure).

       • Check  that your code doesn't break the test suite.  The test suite can be run using tox at the top of the sources, you mayuse tox -e py38 ./test/ to run a single version of python. You can also
         run a single file by calling pytest directly: pytest-3 tests/test_style.py.  See Development for more information about the test suite.

       • If you are adding new code, please write tests for them in tests/, tox . will run the tests and show you the coverage of the code by the unit-tests.

       • If your change warrants a modification to the docs in doc/ or any docstrings in pagure/ please make that modification.

       NOTE:
          You have a doubt, you don't know how to do something, you have an idea but don't know how to implement it, you just have something bugging you?

          Come to see us on Matrix: #pagure:fedora.im or directly on the project.
