NAME
       jscal-restore - restores joystick calibration

SYNOPSIS
       jscal-restore <device-name>

DESCRIPTION
       jscal-restore restores the calibration and mapping information for the given joystick device, previously stored by the jscal-store command.

       An  appropriate rule can be set up with udev so that any stored calibration settings are restored when the relevant device is connected. Some distributions (at least Debian, Ubuntu and Slackware) pro‐
       vide joystick packages which install such rules automatically.

FILES
       /var/lib/joystick/joystick.state
              File used to store the calibration settings.
