NAME
       vrrpd - Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol Deamon

SYNOPSIS
       vrrpd -i ifname -v vrid [-f piddir] [-s] [-a auth] [-p prio] [-m ifname] [-c delta] [-nhD] ipaddr

DESCRIPTION
       vrrpd is an implementation of VRRPv2 as specified in rfc2338. It run in userspace for linux.  In short, VRRP is a protocol which elects a master server on a LAN and the master answers to a 'virtual ip
       address'. If it fails, a backup server takes over the ip address.

       A longer answer in the rfc2338 abstract : "This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).  VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for  a  virtual
       router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IP address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master, and forwards packets sent to these IP addresses.  The
       election process provides dynamic fail over in the forwarding responsibility should the Master become unavailable.  This allows any of the virtual router IP addresses on the LAN to be used as the  de‐
       fault first hop router by end-hosts.  The advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on ev‐
       ery end-host."  Copyright (C) The Internet Society (1998).  All Rights Reserved.

       Monitored interface functionality is useful on high availability router or firewall platforms, where single interface failure can cause asymmetrical routing issues.

       Ideally, what is required is a method for a vrrpd process to detect a failure of the 'other' network interface, and lower it's own VRRP priority below that of the 'backup' vrrpd process.  This  allows
       failover to occur normally.

   OPTIONS
       -h     display this short inlined help

       -n     Don't handle the virtual mac address

       -D     Go into background mode, daemonize

       -i ifname
              the  interface  name  to  run on.  More than one interface can be monitored by the one vrrpd process, a list like "eth1 eth2 eth3 eth4 eth5" is acceptable. Losing link-beat on any of these will
              cause the priority of that vrrpd process to be decreased by the specified value, or a default of 100.  Note that as MII calls are used, this implementation is limited to Fast and Gigabit Ether‐
              net chipsets only - 10Mbps Ethernet cards will not work.

       -v vrid
              the id of the virtual server [1-255]

       -s     iqxSwitch the preemption mode (Enabled by default)

       -a auth
              set the authentification type auth=(none|pw/hexkey|ah/hexkey) hexkey=0x[0-9a-fA-F]+ Password is a symbolic security, anybody with a sniffer can break it.  AH is a bit stronger.

       -p prio
              Set the priority of this host in the virtual server (dfl: 100)

       -f piddir
              specify the directory where the pid file is stored (dfl: /var/run)

       -d delay
              Set the advertisement interval (in sec) (dfl: 1) -m ifname Interface(s) to monitor for failure. Use " " for multiple interfaces

       -c delta
              Set the delta to decrease priority by (dfl: 50)

       ipaddr the ip address(es) of the virtual server

EXAMPLES
       vrrpd -i eth0 -v 50 10.0.0.1

       run vrrp on the interface eth0 with the virtual id 50 and 10.0.0.1 as virtual ip address
