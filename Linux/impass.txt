NAME
       impass - Simple and secure password management and retrieval system

SYNOPSIS
       impass <command> [<args>...]

DESCRIPTION
       The password database is stored as a single json object, OpenPGP encrypted and signed, and written to local disk (see IMPASS_DB). The file is created upon addition of the first entry. Database en‐
       tries are keyed by 'context'. During retrieval of passwords the database is decrypted and read into memory. Contexts are searched by sub-string match.

       Contexts  can  be  any  string. If a context string is not specified on the command line it can be provided at a prompt, which features tab completion for contexts already in the database. One may
       also specify a context of '-' to read the context from stdin, or ':' to force a prompt.

       Passwords are auto-generated by default with 18 bytes of entropy. The number of octets can be specified with the IMPASS_PASSWORD environment variable or via the 'pwspec' optional argument to rele‐
       vant commands. The length of the actually generated password will sometimes be longer than the specified bytes due to base64 encoding. If pwspec is ':' the user will be prompted for the password.

COMMANDS
       add [-h] [context] [pwspec]
              Add new entry. If the context already exists in the database an error will be thrown.

       replace [-h] [context] [pwspec]
              Replace password for entry. If the context does not already exist in the database an error will be thrown.

       update [-h] [old_context] [new_context]
              Update context for existing entry, keeping password the same.  Special context value of '-' can only be provided to the old context.

       dump [-h] [string]
              Dump password database to stdout as json. If a string is provide only entries whose context contains the string will be dumped. Otherwise all entries are returned.  Passwords  will  not  be
              displayed unless IMPASS_DUMP_PASSWORDS is set.

       get [-h] [context]
              Print password matching context to stdout.

       gui [-h] [string]
              Launch  minimal  GUI. Good for X11 or Wayland-based window manager integration. Upon invocation the user will be prompted to decrypt the database, after which a graphical search prompt will
              be presented. If an additional string is provided, it will be added as the initial search string. All matching results for the query will be presented to the user.  When  a  result  is  se‐
              lected,  the password will be retrieved according to the method specified by IMPASS_XPASTE. If no match is found, the user has the opportunity to generate and store a new password, which is
              then delivered via IMPASS_XPASTE. Note: contexts that have leading or trailing whitespace are not accessible through the GUI.

       remove [-h] [context]
              Remove entry. If the context does not already exist in the database an error will be thrown.

       help [-h]
              Full usage or command help (also '-h' after command).

       version [-h]
              Print version.

SIGNATURES
       During decryption, OpenPGP signatures on the db file are checked for validity. If any of them are found to not be valid, a warning message will be written to stderr.

ENVIRONMENT
       IMPASS_DB
              Path to impass database file. Default: ~/.impass/db

       IMPASS_KEYFILE
              File containing OpenPGP key ID of database encryption recipient. Default: ~/.impass/keyid

       IMPASS_KEYID
              OpenPGP key ID of database encryption recipient. This overrides IMPASS_KEYFILE if set.

       IMPASS_PASSWORD
              See Passwords above.

       IMPASS_DUMP_PASSWORDS
              Include passwords in dump when set.

       IMPASS_XPASTE
              Method for password retrieval from GUI. Options are: 'xdo', which attempts to type the password into the window that had focus on launch, 'xclip' which inserts the password in the  X  clip‐
              board, and 'sway', which types the password into the focused wayland container. Default: xdo or sway, detected automatically.
