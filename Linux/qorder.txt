SYNOPSIS
       qorder job_identifier job_identifier

DESCRIPTION
       To  order  two  jobs is to exchange the jobs positions in the queue or queues in which the jobs resides.  The two jobs must be located at the same server.  No attribute of the job, such as priority is
       changed.  The impact of interchanging the order with the queue(s) is dependent on local job scheduled policy, contact your systems administrator.

       A job in the running state cannot be reordered.

OPERANDS

           sequence_number[.server_name][@server]
       The server specification for the two jobs must agree as to the current location of the two job IDs.

STANDARD ERROR
       The qorder command will write diagnostic messages to standard error for each error occurrence.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the qorder command, the exit status will be a value of zero.

       If the qorder command fails to process any operand, the command exits with a value greater than zero.
