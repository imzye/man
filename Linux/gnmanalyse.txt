DESCRIPTION
       The  gnmanalyse program provides analysing capabilities of geographical
       networks in GDAL. The results of calculations are return in an OGRLayer
       format or as a console text output if such layer is undefined. All cal‐
       culations are made considering the blocking state of features.

       dijkstra <start_gfid> <end_gfid>
              Calculates the best path between two points using Dijkstra algo‐
              rithm from start_gfid point to end_gfid point.

       kpaths <start_gfid> <end_gfid>
              Calculates K shortest paths between two points using Yen's algo‐
              rithm (which internally uses Dijkstra algorithm for single  path
              calculating) from start_gfid point to end_gfid point.

       resource
              Calculates the "resource distribution". The connected components
              search is performed using breadth-first search and starting from
              that features which are marked by rules as 'EMITTERS'.

       -d <ds_name>
              The  name and path of the dataset to save the layer with result‐
              ing paths. Not need to be existed dataset.

       -f <ds_format>
              Define this to set the format of newly created dataset.

       -l <layer_name>
              The name of the resulting layer. If the layer exist already - it
              will be rewritten.

       <gnm_name>
              The network to work with (path and name).

       -dsco NAME=VALUE
              Dataset creation option (format specific)

       -lco NAME=VALUE
              Layer creation option (format specific)

       -alo NAME=VALUE
              Algorithm option (format specific)
