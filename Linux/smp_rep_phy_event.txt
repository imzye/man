NAME
       smp_rep_phy_event - invoke REPORT PHY EVENT SMP function

SYNOPSIS
       smp_rep_phy_event [--desc] [--enumerate] [--help] [--hex] [--interface=PARAMS] [--long] [--phy=ID] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] [--zero] SMP_DEVICE[,N]

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a  SAS  Serial  Management  Protocol  (SMP)  REPORT PHY EVENT function request to an SMP target. The SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the
       SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. The mpt interface uses SMP_DEVICE to identify a HBA (an SMP initiator) and needs the additional ,N to differentiate between  HBAs  if  there  are  multiple
       present.

       Reports zero or more phy event descriptors. Each descriptor contains a phy event source, a phy event (i.e. a count) and a peak value detector theshold.  At least one phy event should be maintained for
       each phy.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -d, --desc
              precede each phy event descriptor with a line announcing its descriptor index number. Index numbers start at 1.

       -e, --enumerate
              enumerate all of the known Phy Event Source names, one per line preceded by its value in hex. Ignores SMP_DEVICE if it is given; most other options are also ignored. Exits after displaying  the
              names.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output the response (less the CRC field) in hexadecimal.

       -I, --interface=PARAMS
              interface specific parameters. In this case "interface" refers to the path through the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils man page for more information.

       -l, --long
              prefix each phy event source string with its numeric identifier in hex.  For example: "[0x1]: Invalid word count: 23"

       -p, --phy=ID
              phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and 254. Default is 0.

       -r, --raw
              send the response (less the CRC field) to stdout in binary. All error messages are sent to stderr.

       -s, --sa=SAS_ADDR
              specifies  the  SAS  address  of the SMP target device. Typically this is an expander. This option may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the target's SAS address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in
              decimal but most SAS addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in hexadecimal either prefix it with '0x' or put a trailing 'h' on it.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the verbosity of the output. Can be used multiple times

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

NOTES
       Similar information is maintained for SAS SSP target phys (e.g. on a SAS disk). It can be obtained from the Protocol Specific Port log page with the sg_logs utility.

       Similar information may be obtained for SAS initiator phys (e.g. on a SAS HBA). As an example in Linux 2.6.28 error information can be found in this directory /sys/class/sas_phy/phy-4:0 (for the phy 0
       in SCSI/SAS host 4).

       Similar information may be obtained for SATA device phys (e.g. on a SATA disk). If there is a SAT layer between OS and the SATA device then the sg_sat_phy_event utility can fetch the information.

CONFORMING TO
       The SMP REPORT PHY EVENT function was introduced in SAS-2 .
