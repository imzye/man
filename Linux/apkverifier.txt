NAME
       apkverifier - verify the signature on an Android APK

SYNOPSIS
       Command line tool for verifying Android APK files:

       apkverifier input.apk

       input.apk is an existing file with an APK Signature

DESCRIPTION
       Simple  command  line  tool that verifies the signatures on Android APK binaries.  It can verify APK Signature scheme v1, v2 and v3 and passes Google apksig's testing suite.  It should support all
       algorithms and downgrade attack protection.

       Because Android can handle even broken x509 cerficates and ZIP files, apkverifier is using the ZipReader from apkparser package and vendors crypto/x509 in  internal/x509andr  and  github.com/full‐
       sailor/pkcs7 (https://github.com/fullsailor/pkcs7) in the fullsailor/pkcs7 folder.  The last two have some changes to handle some not-entirely-according-to-spec certificates.
