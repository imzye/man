NAME
       Pod::Plainer - Perl extension for converting Pod to old-style Pod.

SYNOPSIS
         use Pod::Plainer;

         my $parser = Pod::Plainer -> new ();
         $parser -> parse_from_filehandle(\*STDIN);

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::Plainer uses Pod::Parser which takes Pod with the (new) 'C<< .. >>' constructs and returns the old(er) style with just 'C<>'; '<' and '>' are replaced by 'E<lt>' and 'E<gt>'.

       This can be used to pre-process Pod before using tools which do not recognise the new style Pods.

   METHODS
       escape_ltgt
           Replace '<' and '>' by 'E<lt>' and 'E<gt>'.

       simple_delimiters
           Replace delimiters by '<' and '>'.

       textblock
           Redefine "textblock" from Pod::Parser to use "escape_ltgt" and "simple_delimiters".

   EXPORT
       None by default.
