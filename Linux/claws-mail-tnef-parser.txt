NAME
       claws-mail-tnef-parser - decode TNEF attachments

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-tnef-parser package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-tnef-parser is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       Allows decoding of attachments with "application/ms-tnef" MIME type within Claws Mail. These attachments are also known as "winmail.dat" files.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...” dialog, click on the “Load plugin...” button and select the plugin file, named tnef_parse.so, and press the
       “Open” button.
