GDCMSCU(1)                    DICOM Manipulation.                   GDCMSCU(1)

NAME
       gdcmscu - Tool to execute a DICOM Query/Retrieve operation

SYNOPSIS
           gdcmscu [OPTION]...[OPERATION]...HOSTNAME...[PORT]...

       Execute a DICOM Q/R operation to HOSTNAME, using port PORT (104 when
       not specified)

DESCRIPTION
       The gdcmscu command line program is the tool to execute DICOM
       Query/Retrieve operation. It supports:

       •   C-ECHO (SCU)

       •   C-FIND (SCU)

       •   C-STORE (SCU)

       •   C-MOVE (SCU/SCP) C-MOVE operation are executed using two different
           ports (one for the SCU and one for the SCP).

C-ECHO USAGE
       gdcmscu is a great tool to test if a DICOM server is up. For example to
       send a C-ECHO to server dicom.example.com using port 104, use:

           $ gdcmscu dicom.example.com

       or if you prefer being explicit:

           $ gdcmscu --echo dicom.example.com 104

       Using basic security your DICOM server might require that you set the
       appropriate called AE-TITLE

           $ gdcmscu --echo dicom.example.com 11112 --call SERVSCP

       If you want to specifiy your own AE-TITLE (default is GDCMSCU), simply
       use:

           $ gdcmscu --echo dicom.example.com 11112 --call SERVSCP --aetitle MYSCU

       For example you could test on the DICOM server provided by DICOMObject
       team:

           $ gdcmscu www.dicomserver.co.uk 11112

C-STORE USAGE
       C-STORE is the operation that allow sending a DICOM file to a remote
       DICOM server. For instance to send a file called myfile.dcm

           $ gdcmscu --store dicom.example.com 104 myfile.dcm

       or if you prefer being explicit:

           $ gdcmscu --store dicom.example.com 104 -i myfile.dcm

       You can even send multiple files using the same association:

           $ gdcmscu --store dicom.example.com 104 myfile1.dcm myfile2.dcm myfile3.dcm ...

C-FIND USAGE
       gdcmscu also allow querying a DICOM server. This is the C-FIND
       operation, for example to find all DICOM Instance where PatientsName
       match a particular pattern, usage is simply:

           $ gdcmscu --find --patient dicom.example.com 11112 --patientroot --key 10,10,"A*"

       We also support a DCMTK compatible convention:

           $ gdcmscu --find --patient dicom.example.com 11112 --patientroot --key 10,10="A*"

       When an attribute is set without a value it will be part of the output
       result:

           $ gdcmscu --find --patient dicom.example.com 11112 --call MI2B2 --patientroot -k 10,10="A*" -k 10,20

C-MOVE USAGE
       C-MOVE is the operation to retrieve a DICOM instance from a remote
       DICOM server. Most of the time, it is a subsequent operation after a
       C-FIND query. To retrieve a DICOM instance where PatientID is ABCD1234,
       simply execute:

           $ gdcmscu --move --patient --aetitle ACME1 --call ACME_STORE dicom.example.com 5678 --patientroot -k 10,20="ABCD1234" --port-scp 1234

       WARNING For this operation to work you need information from the DICOM
       server you are communicating with. Only the DICOM server you are
       sending a C-MOVE query will be responsible for sending back incoming
       associations (the actual C-STORE SCP). Therefore you need to make sure
       that you mapping of (AE-TITLE,PortNumber) is properly set on the DICOM
       server side as well as the port for incoming association (–port-scp).

       gdcmscu does not currently support external C-STORE association
       (C-STORE request sent to an external SCP application).

PATIENTROOT NOTES
       The flag –patientroot is just simply a wrapper around the syntax –key
       8,52=PATIENT For instance one would write using DCMTK syntax:

           $ findscu --patient dicom.example.com 11112 --key 8,52=PATIENT --key 10,10="F*"

       This would become using GDCM syntax:

           $ gdcmscu --find --patient dicom.example.com 11112 --patientroot --key 10,10="F*"

DEBUGGING
       This is sometime difficult to investigate why a connection to a remote
       DICOM server cannot be done. Some recommendations follows:

       Always try to do a simple C-ECHO at first. If you cannot get the C-ECHO
       to work none of the other operations will work

       Before trying to a C-MOVE operation, make sure you can execute the
       C-FIND equivalent query first.

       When doing a C-MOVE operation you really need to communicate with the
       PACS admin as the C-MOVE operation is different from the other lower
       level operation such as HTTP/GET. When doing a C-MOVE, the server will
       communicate back using another channel (could be different port) using
       it's internal database to map an AE-TITLE back to the destination IP.

       Indeed the C-MOVE operation by design does not always use your incoming
       IP address to send back the resulting dataset. Instead it uses a
       mapping of AE-TITLE to IP address to send back any results. So pay
       particular attention to the spelling of your AE-TITLE and your incoming
       port (which may be different from the port to connect to the server).

PORT WARNING
       Watch out that port ranging [1-1024] are reserved for admin and not
       easily accessible unless granted special privileges. Therefore the
       default 104 DICOM port might not be accessible to all your users.

C-STORE WARNINGS
       When constructing a C-STORE operation, gdcmscu will always use the
       Media Storage SOP Class UID as found in the file to be sent. For
       encapsulated DICOM file (eg. RLE Lossless) the receiving SCP server
       might not support this compression and will legitimately refuse the
       C-STORE operation. In this case users have to manually convert to a
       non-compressed form this particular file:

           $ gdcmconv --raw compressed.dcm non_compressed.dcm

C-MOVE WARNINGS
       At the moment gdcmscu only supports non-compressed transfer syntax. It
       will always request DataSet using Implicit VR Little Endian Transfer
       Syntax during a C-MOVE operation (both incoming and outgoing
       associations). This make gdcmscu –move equivalent to DCMTK movescu
       syntax:

           $ movescu -xi +xi ...

C-FIND IMAGE LEVEL (COMPOSITE OBJECT INSTANCE)
       One should pay attention that gdcmscu –find and findscu are not
       completely equivalent. Using gdcmscu –find, all Unique Keys will be
       added automatically. One can therefore execute something like this:

           $ gdcmscu --find --patientroot --image --key 8,18=1.2.3.4.5.6 dicom.example.com 11112

       instead of the more explicit form

           $ gdcmscu --find --patientroot --image --key 8,18=1.2.3.4.5.6 dicom.example.com 11112 --key 10,20 --key 20,d --key 20,e

       This would also be equivalent to:

           $ findscu --patient --key 8,52=IMAGE --key 8,18=1.2.3.4.5.6 dicom.example.com 11112 --key 10,20 --key 20,d --key 20,e

STORING THE QUERY
       It is also possible to store the query:

           gdcmscu --find --patient --patientroot dicom.example.com 11112 --key 10,20="*" --key 10,10 --store-query query.dcm

       One can then check the DataSet values send for the query:

           $ gdcmdump query.dcm
           # Dicom-File-Format

           # Dicom-Meta-Information-Header
           # Used TransferSyntax:

           # Dicom-Data-Set
           # Used TransferSyntax: 1.2.840.10008.1.2
           (0008,0005) ?? (CS) [ISO_IR 192]                                  # 10,1-n Specific Character Set
           (0008,0052) ?? (CS) [PATIENT ]                                    # 8,1 Query/Retrieve Level
           (0010,0010) ?? (PN) (no value)                                    # 0,1 Patient's Name
           (0010,0020) ?? (LO) [* ]                                          # 2,1 Patient ID

       The Specific Character Set was set to “ISO_IR 192” as the locale
       encoding of the system was found automatically by gdcmscu to be UTF-8.

       This means that the following command line will properly setup the
       Query with the appropriate Charset to be executed correctly:

           $ gdcmscu --find --patient --patientroot dicom.example.com 11112 --key 10,10="*Jérôme*"

       The query is always executed on the server side (SCP), some
       implementations does not support string matching with different
       Character Set.
