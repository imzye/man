NAME
       BitchX - The Ultimate IRC Client

SYPNOSIS
       BitchX [-aAbBcdfFHilLnNpPqrvxZ]

DESCRIPTION
       BitchX  is a VERY heavily modified ircII client.  It includes many things such as built in CDCC (XDCC) offering, built in flood protection, etc.  It is easier to script things in BitchX because unlike
       plain, vanilla ircII, half the script does not have to be devoted to changing the appearance of ircII.  It also includes many other new features, such as port scanning, advanced TCL, a  CD  player,  a
       mail client, screening process, etc.
