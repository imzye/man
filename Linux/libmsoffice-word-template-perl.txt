NAME
       MsOffice::Word::Template::Engine::TT2::Provider -- subclass of Template::Provider for loading .docx templates

DESCRIPTION
       This subclass of Template::Provider is called whenever a "MsOffice::Word::Template" document requires a ".docx" subtemplate through the "INSERT", "INCLUDE" or "PROCESS" directives.

       The subtemplate is parsed as usual, but only the inner document body is returned to the caller, so that it can be inserted in a parent document.
