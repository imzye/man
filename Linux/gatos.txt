BUG REPORTS
       To submit a bug report, send an e-mail to:
       Insomnia (Stea Greene) <insomnia@core.binghamton.edu>

       with a subject line of:
       GATOS BUG: <brief description...>

       Then in the main body of the message:

       - Describe the bug in detail, including how to repeat the
              misbehavior,

       - Specify what version of GATOS and what version of
              IBTK you are using,

       - Then include a dump of "xatitv -v" (either as a MIME
              attachment or right in the message),

       - Include a patch of any changes you made to the code that may
              fix the problem. See PATCHES below,

       When a bug is fixed or if the bug report is not understood, you
       will get a reply, so make sure your message is properly reply-able.

PATCHES
       To create a patch, first make sure you have a full tree of both the
       original and the modified trees (herin called "gatos-orig" and
       "gatos-new" respectively).

       Make sure each tree is clean by using:

       ->     make distclean

       in EACH directory.  Then change to the directory immediately above
       these two directories and use the following command:

       ->     diff -ur gatos-orig gatos-new > gatos-new-patch

       Look at gatos-new-patch (with a text editor or viewer) and make sure
       nothing is changed that you didn't intend to be.  You can submit this
       patch to me either included in an e-mail, or as a MIME attachment, or
       you can compress it and send it as a MIME attachment, as follows:

       Compress it with:

       ->     gzip -9 gatos-new-patch

       Then send gatos-new-patch.gz to me as a MIME attachment.

       If there is a problem with the patch, or I have a question or the
       patch/description is not understood, you will get a reply, so make sure
       your message is properly reply-able.
