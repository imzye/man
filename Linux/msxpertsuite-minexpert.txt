NAME
       mineXpert            —             Open mass spectrometric data files of a wide variety of formats and mine data graphically

SYNOPSIS
       minexpert [options]  [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the mineXpert software shipped within the msXpertSuite software suite.

       This  program  can  be  used  to load mass spectrometry data files and show the spectral data in a plot widget for further analysis according to a variety of
       available integrations. While this program can operate integrally in a graphical mode, it is also widely scriptable using JavaScript as a scripting language.
       A typical data mining session would involve the following steps/actions:

          •  Open a mass spectrometry file and immediately compute a TIC chromatogram, show that chromatogram in a dedicated window. If the data are from an ion mo‐
             bility mass spectrometry experiment, compute a mz = f(dt) color map. The TIC chromatogram and the color map are then the starting points for the mining
             of the data.

          •  Perform  a  wide  variety of integrations to a mass spectrum or a drift spectrum. Each new spectrum is displayed in its dedicated window (the TIC chro‐
             matogram window, the Color map window, the Mass spectrum window and the Drift spectrum window).  Each new plot (be it a TIC chromatogram, a mass  spec‐
             trum  or  a  drift  spectrum) is potentially the start of another integration such that the analysis can drill at each step further in the depth of the
             data.

          •  Perform isotopic cluster calculations and shape the obtained mass peak centroids into fully shaped mass peaks (Gaussian or Lorentizan mathematical mod‐
             els).

          •  Each  plot has specific functions associated to it: export as a (x,y) file, automatic recording of the relevant data of signalled peaks into a file us‐
             ing a specific easy-to-understand grammar, slicing of the data file into smaller data files.

          •  One feature of importance is the fact that a large part of the functionalities of the program are scriptable (JavaScript) and a powerful scripting con‐
             sole is available to elaborate scripts before storing them in script files to be automatically executed.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
                 Displays detailed usage information and exits.

       -c | --config
                 Display program configuration at build time and the Qt version used to build it.

       -V | --Version
                 Print the version of the software program along the with version of the Qt libraries used to build it.

       -l | --license
                 Print the license of this software.

       -s | --streamed
                 When opening one or more files in the gui, do that in streamed mode, otherwise in full.

       -j | --scriptFile <filename>
                 Start the program and immediately run the JavaScript script.

       filename ...
                 One or more names of files to be opened.
