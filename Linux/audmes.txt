NAME
       AUDMES - AUDio MEasurement System

DESCRIPTION
       Audmes is a Multi-platfrom system for audio measurement through a sound card in the PC.

       Incorporates Generator, Oscilloscope, Fast Fourier Transform and Sweep frequency characteristic.

       Features:

          - generator
          - spectrum analyzer
          - oscilloscope
          - frequency response - just frequency stepping

TROUBLESHOOTING
       If a popup appears about sound card issues, make sure you have stereo input and output available.

       You may need to plug in a cable. Mono channels on sound cards are not yet supported, sorry.

       If you see messages like

       `WARNING **: invalid source position for vertical gradient`

       then your Gnome Theme has a bug. It is annoying but harmless.

       On Debian the issue disappears when using e.g. `materia-gtk-theme`.
