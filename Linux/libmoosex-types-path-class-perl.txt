NAME
       MooseX::Types::Path::Class - A Path::Class type library for Moose

VERSION
       version 0.09

SYNOPSIS
         package MyClass;
         use Moose;
         use MooseX::Types::Path::Class;
         with 'MooseX::Getopt';  # optional

         has 'dir' => (
             is       => 'ro',
             isa      => 'Path::Class::Dir',
             required => 1,
             coerce   => 1,
         );

         has 'file' => (
             is       => 'ro',
             isa      => 'Path::Class::File',
             required => 1,
             coerce   => 1,
         );

         # these attributes are coerced to the
         # appropriate Path::Class objects
         MyClass->new( dir => '/some/directory/', file => '/some/file' );

DESCRIPTION
       MooseX::Types::Path::Class creates common Moose types, coercions and option specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class objects as Moose attributes.

       Coercions (see Moose::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from both "Str" and "ArrayRef" to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File objects.  If you have MooseX::Getopt installed, the "Getopt"
       option type ("=s") will be added for both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File.

EXPORTS
       None of these are exported by default.  They are provided via MooseX::Types.

       Dir, File
           These exports can be used instead of the full class names.  Example:

             package MyClass;
             use Moose;
             use MooseX::Types::Path::Class qw(Dir File);

             has 'dir' => (
                 is       => 'ro',
                 isa      => Dir,
                 required => 1,
                 coerce   => 1,
             );

             has 'file' => (
                 is       => 'ro',
                 isa      => File,
                 required => 1,
                 coerce   => 1,
             );

           Note that there are no quotes around "Dir" or "File".

       is_Dir($value), is_File($value)
           Returns true or false based on whether $value is a valid "Dir" or "File".

       to_Dir($value), to_File($value)
           Attempts to coerce $value to a "Dir" or "File".  Returns the coerced value or false if the coercion failed.
