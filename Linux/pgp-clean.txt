NAME
       pgp-clean -- remove all non-self signatures from key

SYNOPSIS
       pgp-clean [-s] keyid [keyid ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pgp-clean takes a list of keyids on the command line and outputs an ascii-armored keyring on stdout for each key with all signatures except self-signatures stripped.  Its use is to reduce the size of
       keys sent out after signing (e.g. with caff).

           Do not remove subkeys. (Pruned by default.)

       keyid
           Use this key.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME
           The default home directory.

       GNUPGBIN
           The gpg binary.  Default: "gpg".

       GNUPGHOME
           The default working directory for gpg.  Default: "$HOME/.gnupg".

FILES
       $HOME/.gnupg/pubring.gpg  -  default GnuPG keyring
