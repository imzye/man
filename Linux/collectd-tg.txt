COLLECTD-TG(1)                     collectd                     COLLECTD-TG(1)

NAME
       collectd-tg - Traffic generator for collectd.

SYNOPSIS
       collectd-tg -n num_vl -H num_hosts -p num_plugins -i interval -d dest
       -D dport

DESCRIPTION
       collectd-tg generates bogus collectd network traffic. While host,
       plugin and values are generated randomly, the generated traffic tries
       to mimic "real" traffic as closely as possible.

ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS
       The following options are understood by collectd-tg. The order of the
       arguments generally doesn't matter, as long as no argument is passed
       more than once.

       -n num_vl
           Sets the number of unique value lists (VL) to generate. Defaults to
           10000.

       -H num_hosts
           Sets the number of unique hosts to simulate. Defaults to 1000.

       -p num_plugins
           Sets the number of unique plugins to simulate. Defaults to 20.

       -i interval
           Sets the interval in which each value list is dispatched. Defaults
           to 10.0 seconds.

       -d dest
           Sets the destination to which to send the generated network
           traffic. Defaults to the IPv6 multicast address, "ff18::efc0:4a42".

       -D dport
           Sets the destination port or service to which to send the generated
           network traffic. Defaults to collectd's default port, 25826.

       -h  Print usage summary.
