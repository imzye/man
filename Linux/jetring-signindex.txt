NAME
       jetring-signindex - gpg sign an index file

SYNOPSIS
       jetring-signindex dir

DESCRIPTION
       This command uses gpg to sign the dir/index file.

       This  is  a  low-level command, that is run by higher-level commands in jetring. Any jetring command that modifies a jetring directory and needs to add a changeset to its index file, will run jetring-
       signindex at the end, if the index file was previously signed, or if JETRING_SIGN is set.

       So nornally, you don't need to call this command by hand, though it can be useful when first creating a changeset directory, to force the index file to get signed.
