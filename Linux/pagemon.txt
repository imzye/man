NAME
       pagemon - a tool to monitor memory pages.

SYNOPSIS
       pagemon [options]

DESCRIPTION
       pagemon is a program that allows one to interactively monitor the memory pages of a process.

OPTIONS
       pagemon options are as follow:

       -a     enable automatic zoom mode, this will change the zoom level to show the entire page map in the window, up to a maximum zoom level of 999.

       -d delay
              delay in microseconds between data refreshes, the default is 10,000 microseconds (1/100th of a second).

       -h     show help.

       -p     specify the process id (PID) or name of the process to monitor. If a name is given, then pagemon will monitor the first process that matches the name.

       -r     read pages into memory. This will force all pages in the process to be read into physical memory.

       -t ticks
              specify ticks between dirty page checks. The default is 60 ticks; the larger the value the longer time between dirty page checks.

       -v     enable VM information view. This is equivalent to pressing the 'v' or 'V' key when running pagemon.

       -z zoom
              specify the default zoom level on page view, the default is 1 (that is 1-to-1 view of pages).  Higher values increase the zoom level so more pages are represented in the map view.
