NAME
       Set::Object::Weak - Sets without the referant reference increment

SYNOPSIS
        use Set::Object::Weak qw(weak_set);

        my $set = Set::Object::Weak->new( 0, "", {}, [], $object );
        # or
        my $set = weak_set( 0, "", {}, [], $object );

        print $set->size;  # 2 - the scalars aren't objects

DESCRIPTION
       Sets, but weak.  See "weaken" in Set::Object.

       Note that the "set" in "Set::Object::Weak" returns weak sets.  This is intentional, so that you can make all the sets in scope weak just by changing "use Set::Object" to "use Set::Object::Weak".

CONSTRUCTORS
       new This class method is exactly the same as "Set::Object->new", except that it returns a weak set.

       weak_set( ... )
           This optionally exported function is a shortcut for saying "Set::Object::Weak->new(...)".

       set( ... )
           This method is exported so that if you see:

            use Set::Object qw(set);

           You can turn it into using weak sets lexically with:

            use Set::Object::Weak qw(set);

           Set::Object 1.19 had a bug in this method that meant that it would not add the passed members into it.
