NAME
       svm-scale - scale data to a restricted range as preprocessing for SVM training

SYNOPSIS
       svm-scale [ -l lower ] [ -u upper ] [ -y y_upper ] [ -s save_filename ] [ -r restore_filename ] datafilename

DESCRIPTION
       svm-scale reads the given datafilename (a training or testing data file as specified in svm_train(1) or svm_predict(1) ) and scales all dimensions to the given ranges.

OPTIONS
       -l lower
              lower is the lowest (minimal) value allowed in each dimension.  It defaults to -1.

       -u upper
              upper is the highest (maximal) value allowed in each dimension.  It defaults to 1.

       -y y_lower
              y_lower is a boolean value (0 or 1) indicating whether or not y-values (targets) should be scaled.  It defaults to 0.

       -s save_filename
              save_filename indicates the filename to save the scaled data to.

       -r restore_filename
              restore_filename indicates the filename reserved to hold the original (unscaled) data in case there is a need to restore.

FILES
       datafilename must be a training or testing dataset.

ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables.

DIAGNOSTICS
       None documented; see Vapnik et al.

BUGS
       Please report bugs to the Debian BTS.
