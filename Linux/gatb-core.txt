NAME
       leon - reference free compression for NGS reads

OPTIONS
   leon options
       -file  (1 arg) :    input file (e.g. FASTA/FASTQ for compress or .leon file for decompress)

       -c     (0 arg) :    compression

       -d     (0 arg) :    decompression

       -nb-cores
              (1 arg) :    number of cores (default is the available number of cores)  [default '0']

       -lossless
              (0 arg) :    switch to lossless compression for qualities (default is lossy. lossy has much higher compression rate, and the loss is in fact a gain. lossy is better!)

   compression options
       -kmer-size
              (1 arg) :    size of a kmer  [default '31']

       -abundance
              (1 arg) :    abundance threshold for solid kmers (default inferred)  [default '']

       -init-iterator
              (0 arg) :    init iterator for ibank mode

       -seq-only
              (0 arg) :    store dna seq only, header and quals are discarded, will decompress to fasta (same as -noheader -noqual)

       -noheader
              (0 arg) :    discard header

       -noqual
              (0 arg) :    discard quality scores
