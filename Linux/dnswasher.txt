DNSWASHER(1)             PowerDNS Authoritative Server            DNSWASHER(1)

NAME
       dnswasher - A PowerDNS nameserver debugging tool

SYNOPSIS
       dnswasher INFILE [INFILE] OUTFILE

DESCRIPTION
       dnswasher  takes one or more INFILEs in PCAP format and writes out OUT‐
       FILE also in PCAP format, while obfuscating end-user IP addresses.

       This is useful to share data with third  parties  while  attempting  to
       protect the privacy of your users.

       The INFILEs must be of identical PCAP type.

       Please  check  the  output  of  dnswasher  to  make sure no customer IP
       addresses remain. Also realize that sufficient data could  allow  indi‐
       viduals to be re-identified based on the domain names they care about.

       --decrypt,-d              Undo  IPCipher  encryption  of  IP  addresses
