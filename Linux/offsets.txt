NAME
       offsets - Manipulate auxiliary files created by ingests

SYNOPSIS
       offsets <aux file> <27 MHz timestamp>

DESCRIPTION
       OffseTS  is  a  companion  application for multicat, to manipulate auxiliary files.  Given an offset in time from the beginning of the file, it returns the offset of the position in number of packets.
       OffseTS is currently deprecated in favour of using the -k and -d switches of multicat.
