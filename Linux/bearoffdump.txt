BEAROFFDUMP(6)                   Games Manual                   BEAROFFDUMP(6)

NAME
       bearoffdump - dump a position from the GNU Backgammon bearoff database

SYNOPSIS
       bearoffdump file id

DESCRIPTION
       bearoffdump takes the path to a GNU Backgammon bearoff database and a
       position number and dumps the bearoff information for that position.
       It can be called on either the one-sided bearoff database, normally
       /usr/share/gnubg/gnubg_os0.bd; or the two-sided bearoff database, nor‐
       mally /usr/share/gnubg/gnubg_ts0.bd.  The output from the former in‐
       cludes the probabilities of bearing off all checkers in varying numbers
       of moves.  The latter only gives the probability of winning and dou‐
       bling cube equity.

       The id is difficult to derive if you don't know GNU Backgammon inter‐
       nals.  Each possible combinatorial position of checkers and points is
       assigned a position number, id divided by that number is the player po‐
       sition, and id modulo that number is the opponent position.  The number
       of points and checkers is set when building the bearoff database and
       are shown by bearoffdump when run with any id.
