NAME
       crafty.rc, .craftyrc  - run control for crafty(6)

DESCRIPTION
       A  Crafty  run control file should contain a sequence of valid Crafty commands, terminated by the command "exit" to restore standard input to the keyboard.  This manual page gives a skeletal exam‐
       ple.  Even the few commands used are not fully explained, and should be looked up in "crafty.doc".  As for where the run control file should be, see crafty(6).

EXAMPLE
       # $HOME/.craftyrc (comments like this are fine).

       ! echo "Reading $HOME/.craftyrc ..."
       # Crafty's shell escape "!" lets us at system commands.
       # Echoed information will be in "log.001".

       # PROCESSOR USAGE:

       mt=0
       # The "mt" command indicates how many processors to use.
       # With zero, multiprocessor support is disabled.
       # If Crafty has been compiled without SMP support,
       # a harmless error message results.

       # MEMORY USAGE:

       hash=24M
       # Memory allowed for transposition hash table.

       hashp=3M
       # Memory for pawn structure hash table.
       # These commands are well explained in "crafty.doc".
       # Hopefully, someone will step in and rewrite this
       # example to properly use the more intricate "adaptive".

       # ENDGAME TABLEBASES:

       egtb !
       # Enable tablebases.
       # The "!" has Crafty pat us on the head if we happen to
       # play a good move in the late endgame.

       cache=1M
       # Define memory usage for caching tablebase probe info.

       # OUTPUT TUNING:

       show book
       # Make Crafty verbose in the opening.

       # FINALLY, RESTORE CRAFTY'S INPUT TO THE KEYBOARD:

       exit

       # End of $HOME/.craftyrc
