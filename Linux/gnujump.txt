NAME
       GNUjump - a xjump clone

SYNOPSIS
       sdljump [ REPLAY ] [ OPTIONS ]
       sdljump [ --help ]

DESCRIPTION
       GNUjump GNUjump is part of the GNU project.

       GNUjump is a clone of the simple yet addictive game Xjump, adding new features like multiplaying, unlimited FPS, smooth floor falling, themable graphics etc...

       The goal in this game is to jump to the next floor so you don't fall down. As you go upper in the Falling Tower the floors will fall faster. Try to survive longer than anyone.

       To make the multiplayer games last longer, you can choose to have more than one live, but the final result will be divided by the number of lives consumed.

HIGHSCORES
       The mode tab in the Highscores might seem strange at first, but it is quite simple: it represents the Game Mode options set in that match. Each letter represents an option:

       1st Letter: The FPS limiter
              s: GNUjump default - An arbitrary FPS limit.
              x: Xjump - 40 fps, the xjump default

       2nd Letter: The player rotation
              s: GNUjump default - full rotation.
              x: Xjump rotation mode
              n: No rotation

       3rd Letter: The falling floors scroll mode.
              s: GNUjump default - Soft
              x: Xjump - Hard
