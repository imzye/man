NAME
       nauty-showg - (stand-alone subset of listg)

SYNOPSIS
       showg [-p#:#l#o#Ftq] [-a|-A|-c|-d|-e] [infile [outfile]]

DESCRIPTION
              Write graphs in human-readable format.

              infile is the input file in graph6, sparse6 or digraph6 format

              This program does not support incremental sparse6 files; use listg.

              outfile is the output file Defaults are standard input and standard output.

       -p#, -p#:#, -p#-# : only display one graph or a sequence of

       graphs.
              The first graph is number 1.  A second number

              which is empty or zero means infinity.

       -a     : write the adjacency matrix

       -A     : same as -a with a space between entries

       -d     : write output to satisfy dreadnaut

       -c     : write compact dreadnaut form with minimal line-breaks

       -e     : write a list of edges, preceded by the order and the

              number of edges

       -o# : specify number of first vertex (default is 0)

       -t     : write upper triangle only (affects -a, -A, -d and default)

       -F     : write a form-feed after each graph except the last

       -l# : specify screen width limit (default 78, 0 means no limit)

              This is not currently implemented with -a or -A.

       -q     : suppress auxiliary output

       -a, -A, -c, -d and -e are incompatible.
