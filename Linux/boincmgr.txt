NAME
       boincmgr - The graphical BOINC manager for the client.

SYNOPSIS
       boincmgr [--verbose] [-a] [-e client_dir] [-d data_dir] [-n hostname] [-g port] [-p passwd] [-b BOINC_ARGS] [-i] [-c] [-m]
       boincmgr [-h | --help]

DESCRIPTION
       The  BOINC manager (boincmgr) is a graphical controlling and monitoring utility for the BOINC client (boinc(1)). It communicates with a running client using port 31416 over TCP/IP. It can only connect
       to one client at a time.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show all options.

       --verbose
              Generate verbose log messages.

       -a, --autostart
              Tells the BOINC Manager that it was started by the operating system automatically. Use this if the Manager is started at login time.

       -e client_dir, --clientdir=client_dir
              Directory containing the locale directory containing the Manager localisation files.

       -d data_dir, --datadir=data_dir
              Directory containing the configuration files .

       -n hostname, --namehost=hostname
              Hostname or IP address of client to which the manager should connect to.

       -g port, --gui_rpc_port=port
              RPC port number used to communicate with the client. Has to be the same value as on the client (see boinc(1)).

       -p passwd, --password=passwd
              Use passwd as password for RPC authentication. If the current working directory contains a file gui_rpc_auth.cfg, boincmgr will read the password from this file.

       -b BOINC_ARGS, --boincargs=BOINC_ARGS
              Startup the BOINC client with these optional arguments if necessary.

       -i, --insecure
