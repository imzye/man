NAME
       GPSsmooth - send NMEA-formatted GPS data to a FlightGear instance

SYNOPSIS
       GPSsmooth  --help  | --file file_name [--hertz hertz] [--host hostname]
       [--broadcast] [--fdm-port port] [--ctrls-port port]

DESCRIPTION
       GPSsmooth is a utility that reads a text file containing  GPS  data  in
       NMEA  format,  parses  it and sends it to a FlightGear instance for re‐
       playing.

OPTIONS
       --help Display usage information and exit.

       --file file_name
              Read GPS data from file_name. This option is mandatory if --help
              is not specified.

       --hertz hertz
              Specify  the frequency to use for sending data to the FlightGear
              instance.  By default, events are sent at a frequency of 60 Hz.

       --host hostname
              Send the data to the FlightGear instance running on hostname.

              If --host is not specified, the default is to send the  data  to
              localhost.

       --broadcast
              Send flight data model and control data as broadcast packets.

       --fdm-port port
              Set  the  port  flight data model data should be sent to. By de‐
              fault, data is sent to port 5505.

       --ctrls-port port
              Set the port control data should be sent to. By default, data is
              sent to port 5506.

EXIT STATUS
       GPSsmooth  exits  with  0 on success, with -1 if the syntax of the com‐
       mand-line arguments is wrong or an error occurs.
