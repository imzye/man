NAME
       pamtopam - copy PAM image

SYNOPSIS
       pamtopam

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamtopam simply copies a PAM image from Standard Input to Standard Out‐
       put.  This may seem an unnecessary duplication  of  cat,  but  remember
       that a PAM program can read a PBM, PGM, or PPM image as if it were PAM.
       So pamtopam can read either a PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM image and produce a
       PAM image as output.

       Even  that is of limited usefulness because of the fact that almost any
       program to which you would feed the resulting PAM image could also just
       take the original image directly.  However, sometimes you really want a
       true PAM image.

       You can do a more general job of translating PAM/PNM to PAM  with  pam‐
       channel.
