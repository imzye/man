NAME
       track2cdda - records audio compact disc from tracks

SYNOPSIS
       track2cdda [OPTIONS] <track 1> [track 2] ...

DESCRIPTION
       track2cdda takes a list of audio tracks and writes their contents to an audio compact disc.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              show a list of options and exit

       -c, --cdrom=CDROM
              the cdrom device to write the CD to

       -s, --speed=SPEED
              the speed in which to write the CD at

       --cue=FILENAME
              A cuesheet or cdrdao(1) TOC file to use when writing. If given, the created CD will have the same track layout and metadata as the cuesheet. This makes the burned CD identical to the original.

       -j, --joint=PROCESSES
              The  maximum  number  of  tracks  to  convert to temporary files at one time. If one has multiple CPUs or CPU cores, allowing track2cdda(1) to use all of them simultaneously can reduce the time
              needed to decode tracks prior to CD burning.

       -V, --verbose=VERBOSITY
              The level of output to display. Choose between 'normal', 'quiet' and 'debug'.

       Write all of the WAVEs in the current directory to /dev/cdrom:

              track2cdda -c /dev/cdrom *.wav
