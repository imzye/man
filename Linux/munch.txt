NAME
       munch - munching squares

SYNOPSIS
       munch  [-display  host:display.screen]  [-foreground  color]  [-background  color]  [-window] [-root] [-mono] [-install] [-visual visual] [-delay usecs] [-xor] [-noxor] [-clear number] [-simul number]
       [-classic | -mismunch | -random] [-fps]

DESCRIPTION
       The munch program performs the munching squares hack.  It picks square size, position, and gravity randomly.  It also displays a creatively broken misimplementation of the classic algorithm.

       The munching squares hack consists of drawing Y = X XOR T for a range of X and T over and over until all the possible combinations of X and T have come up.  It was  reportedly  discovered  by  Jackson
       Wright in 1962 and took 5 instructions of PDP-6 code.

OPTIONS
       munch accepts the following options:

       -window Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

       -root   Draw on the root window.

       -mono   If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.

       -install
               Install a private colormap for the window.

       -visual visual
               Specify which visual to use.  Legal values are the name of a visual class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.

       -delay usecs
               The delay between steps of the animation, in microseconds.  Default: 2500.

       -xor    Use the XOR drawing function.  This is the default.

       -no-xor Don't use the XOR drawing function.

       -clear number
               Number of squares to misdraw before clearing the display.  Default: 65.

       -simul number
               Number of squares to misdraw simultaneously.  Default: 5.

       -classic
               Draw classic munching squares only.

       -mismunch
               Draw "mismunch" only.

       -random Do one or the other.

       -fps    Display the current frame rate and CPU load.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
               to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

HISTORY
       HAKMEM: MIT AI Memo 239, Feb. 29, 1972.  Beeler, M., Gosper, R.W., and Schroeppel, R.

       "Unless otherwise stated, all computer programs are in PDP-6/10 assembly language."

   ITEM 146: MUNCHING SQUARES
       Another simple display program. It is thought that this was discovered by Jackson Wright on the RLE PDP-1 circa 1962.

            DATAI 2
            ADDB 1,2
            ROTC 2,-22
            XOR 1,2
            JRST .-4

       2=X,  3=Y. Try things like 1001002 in data switches. This also does interesting things with operations other than XOR, and rotations other than -22. (Try IOR; AND; TSC; FADR; FDV(!); ROT -14, -9, -20,
       ...)

   ITEM 147 (Schroeppel):
       Munching squares is just views of the graph Y = X XOR T for consecutive values of T = time.

   ITEM 148 (Cohen, Beeler):
       A modification to munching squares which reveals them in frozen states through opening and closing curtains: insert FADR 2,1 before the XOR. Try data switches =

            4000,,4    1000,,2002    2000,,4    0,,1002

       (Notation: <left half>,,<right half>)
       Also try the FADR after the XOR, switches = 1001,,1.
