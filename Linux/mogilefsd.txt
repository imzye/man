NAME
       mogilefsd -- MogileFS tracker daemon

USAGE
       This is the main MogileFS daemon, mogilefsd, also called the "tracker".  All interaction with a MogileFS installation begins by a client talking to a tracker (you should run several in parallel for
       redundancy).

       See MogileFS::Client for a client library.

ARCHITECTURE
   Processes
       The mogilefsd daemon is an event-loop in the parent process, handling with epoll/kqueue/etc (see Danga::Socket) tons of client connections, while managing a bunch of worker processes underneath.

       The worker processes under mogilefsd include:

       Client query processing -- implements the MogileFS client/server protocol
           See MogileFS::Worker::Query.

       Monitoring -- monitors hosts and devices
           See MogileFS::Worker::Monitor.

       Replicate -- replicates files
           See MogileFS::Worker::Replicate.

       Deleter -- deletes files from storage nodes (protocol deletes from namespace are immediate)
           See MogileFS::Worker::Delete.

       Reaper -- re-enqueues files for replication when disks are marked dead
           See MogileFS::Worker::Reaper.

       Fsck -- background filesystem consistency checker
           See MogileFS::Worker::Fsck.

   Data Storage
       See MogileFS::Store.
