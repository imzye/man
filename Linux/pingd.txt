NAME
       pingd - node up/down monitoring daemon

SYNOPSIS
       pingd [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The pingd daemon regularly sends out ICMP pings to determine if nodes are still up or down.

       The pingd daemon can be configured using the pingd configuration file.  Nodes which should be pinged may also be configured via loadable modules.

       See the pingd.conf(5) manpage for additional information.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Output help

       -v, --version
              Output version

CLUSTERLIST MODULES
       The  pingd  daemon  nodes to ping can also be configured with a clusterlist module.  The clusterlist module can obtain a list of all cluster nodes.  There are several possible clusterlist formats that
       can be parsed.  By default, the following clusterlist modules are searched for by pingd in the following order:

       genders - Uses a genders database and the genders library to determine all nodes in the cluster.  See http://genders.sourceforge.net.

       hostsfile - Uses a file that lists the hostname of every node in the cluster on a separate line.  The default hostsfile is /etc/hostsfile.

       If none of the above are found, nodes must be configured via the pingd configuration file.

FILES
