NAME
       Tree::Binary2 - An implementation of a binary tree

SYNOPSIS
         my $tree = Tree::Binary2->new( 'root' );

         my $left = Tree::Binary2->new( 'left' );
         $tree->left( $left );

         my $right = Tree::Binary2->new( 'left' );
         $tree->right( $right );

         my $right_child = $tree->right;

         $tree->right( undef ); # Unset the right child.

         my @nodes = $tree->traverse( $tree->POST_ORDER );

         my $traversal = $tree->traverse( $tree->IN_ORDER );
         while ( my $node = $traversal->() ) {
             # Do something with $node here
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This is an implementation of a binary tree. This class inherits from Tree, which is an N-ary tree implemenation. Because of this, this class actually provides an implementation of a complete
       binary tree vs. a sparse binary tree.  The empty nodes are instances of Tree::Null, which is described in Tree.  This should have no effect on your usage of this class.

METHODS
       In addition to the methods provided by Tree, the following items are provided or overriden.

       •   left([$child]) / right([$child])

           These access the left and right children, respectively. They are mutators, which means that their behavior changes depending on if you pass in a value.

           If you do not pass in any parameters, then it will act as a getter for the specific child, return the child (if set) or undef (if not).

           If you pass in a child, it will act as a setter for the specific child, setting the child to the passed-in value and returning the $tree. (Thus, this method chains.)

           If you wish to unset the child, do "$tree>left( undef );"

       •   children()

           This will return the children of the tree.

           NOTE:  There  will  be  two  children,  always.  Tree::Binary2  implements  a  complete  binary tree, filling in missing children with Tree::Null objects.  (Please see Tree::Fast for more
           information on Tree::Null.)

       •   traverse( [$order] )

           When called in list context ("my @traversal = $tree->traverse()"), this will return a list of the nodes in the given traversal order. When called  in  scalar  context  ("my  $traversal  =
           $tree->traverse()"), this will return a closure that will, over successive calls, iterate over the nodes in the given traversal order. When finished it will return false.

           The default traversal order is pre-order.

           In addition to the traversal orders provided by Tree, Tree::Binary2 provides in-order traversals.

           •   In-order

               This will return the result of an in-order traversal on the left node (if any), then the node, then the result of an in-order traversal on the right node (if any).

       NOTE:  You  have  access  to  all  the  methods  provided  by  Tree, but it is not recommended that you use many of them, unless you know what you're doing. This list includes add_child() and
       remove_child().

TODO
       •   Make in-order closure traversal work iteratively

       •   Make post-order closure traversal work iteratively
