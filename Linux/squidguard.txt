NAME
       sgclean - Removing redundant entries in blacklists

SYNOPSIS
       sgclean configfile

DESCRIPTION
       sgclean removes redundant entries in domain files and urls files.

       sgclean always need explicit the `configfile' i.e.  `/etc/squidguard/squidGuard.conf'.

       Although sgclean makes a backup of the old files, it's always a good idea to make your own backup before running the program.
