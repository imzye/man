NAME
       falconeer.fal - Falcon Language table compiler

SYNOPSIS
       fallc.fal [-m merge_file] [...options...] ftt_list...

DESCRIPTION
       The  Falcon language table compiler is used to compile .ftt files (Fal‐
       con translation tables) into a binary .ftr file  (Falcon  translation).
       The  ftr file is a collection of translations relative to a single mod‐
       ule (source file, .fam pre-compiled Falcon file or  binary  shared  ob‐
       ject/dynamic  load  library), that can be shipped side by side with the
       module and providing a translation to one of the compiled-in  languages
       on request.

       Ftt  files  are  generated by falcon command line compiler using the -y
       option.

       The program operates on the list of ftt files provided on  the  command
       li

OPTIONS
       -c     Do  NOT  check  for  inline variables consistency. If not given,
              fallc will check for all the variables indicated  with  $varname
              or  $(varname[:...])  to  be both in the original strings and in
              the translation, and  will warn if this doesn't happens.

       -h     Prints an help screen with command synopsis.

       -m <source_table.ftt>
              Merges a new source table  with  previously  performed  transla‐
              tions.   If  the  source program that must be translated changes
              after that some work has been performed on the  translation  ta‐
              ble,  it  is  necessary  to  integrate the changes into the work
              files.  In this mode, a new template source table  generated  by
              falcon can be integrated in already existing translations, which
              will be modified directly on place. It is possible to provide  a
              different  output  file for the merged result using the -o <out‐
              putfile> option, but in this case it will be possible  to  merge
              only one file at a time.

       -o <outputfile>
              By  default,  fallc sends the binary translation table to a file
              named after the original module with the .ftr  extension  added.
              This  option  allows  to specify a different destination for the
              compiled translation table. The option can be used  in  conjunc‐
              tion  with the -m option to send the result of a merged table to
              a different file.

       -v     Prints program version and exits.

NOTES
       On some systems, fallc.fal script can be "proxied" with a fallc  pseudo
       command (shell script, batch file and so on).
