NAME
       Text::FormatTable - Format text tables

SYNOPSIS
        my $table = Text::FormatTable->new('r|l');
        $table->head('a', 'b');
        $table->rule('=');
        $table->row('c', 'd');
        print $table->render(20);

DESCRIPTION
       Text::FormatTable renders simple tables as text. You pass to the constructor (new) a table format specification similar to LaTeX (e.g. "r|l|5l|R|20L") and you call methods to fill the table data
       and insert rules. After the data is filled, you call the render method and the table gets formatted as text.

       Methods:

       new($format)
           Create a Text::FormatTable object, the format of each column is specified as a character of the $format string. The following formats are defined:

           l   Left-justified top aligned word-wrapped text.

           L   Left-justified bottom aligned word-wrapped text.

           r   Right-justified top aligned word-wrapped text.

           R   Right-justified bottom aligned word-wrapped text.

           10R, 20r, 15L, 12l,
               Number is fixed width of the column.  Justified and aligned word-wrapped text (see above).

           ' ' A space.

           |   Column separator.

       head($col1, $col2, ...)
           Add a header row using $col1, $col2, etc. as cell contents. Note that, at the moment, header rows are treated like normal rows.

       row($col1, $col2, ...)
           Add a row with $col1, $col2, etc. as cell contents.

       rule([$char])
           Add an horizontal rule. If $char is specified it will be used as character to draw the rule, otherwise '-' will be used.

       render([$screen_width])
           Return the rendered table formatted with $screen_width or 79 if it is not specified.
