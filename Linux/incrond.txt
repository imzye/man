NAME
       incrond - inotify cron (incron) daemon

SYNOPSIS
       incrond [ -f file ] [ -n | -k ]

DESCRIPTION
       The inotify cron daemon (incrond) is a daemon which monitors filesystem
       events and executes commands defined in system and  user  tables.  It's
       use is generally similar to cron(8).

       incrond can be started from /etc/rc, /etc/rc.local and so on. It daemo‐
       nizes itself (returns immediately) and doesn't need to be started  with
       & and through nohup(1). It can be run on foreground too.

       incrond  uses  two categories of tables incrontab(5). System tables are
       usually located in /etc/incron.d and are maintained outside  of  incron
       (e.g.  by various applications). These tables work on root rights level
       and thus any file may be watched and commands are  executed  with  root
       privileges.

       User  tables are located in /var/spool/incron by default and have names
       based on user accounts. These tables use  users'  access  rights,  thus
       only files which the user may access are watched. Commands are executed
       with users' privileges.

       If a table  (incrontab)  is  changed  incrond  reacts  immediately  and
       reloads the table. Currently running child processes (commands) are not
       affected.

       There are two files determining whether  an  user  is  allowed  to  use
       incron.  These  files have very simple syntax - one user name per line.
       If /etc/incron.allow exists the user must be noted there to be  allowed
       to  use  incron. Otherwise if /etc/incron.deny exists the user must not
       be noted there to use incron. If none of these files exists there is no
       other  restriction  whether  anybody  may use incron. Location of these
       files can be changed in the configuration.

       The daemon itself is currently not protected against looping. If a com‐
       mand  executed  due  to  an  event causes the same event it leads to an
       infinite loop unless a flag mask containing loopable=true is specified.
       Please  beware  of  this  and do not allow permission for use incron to
       unreliable users.

       -n (or --foreground) option causes running on foreground. This is  use‐
       ful especially for testing, debugging and optimization.

       -k (or --kill) option terminates a running instance of incrond.

       -f  <FILE>  (or  --config=<FILE>) option specifies another location for
       the configuration file (/etc/incron.conf is used by default).

       Environment variables: For system tables, the default (the same as  for
       incrond  itself)  environment variable set is used. The same applies to
       root's table. For  non-root  user  tables,  the  whole  environment  is
       cleared and then only these variables are set: LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME,
       SHELL, HOME and PATH. The variables (except PATH) take values from  the
       user   database  (e.g.  /etc/passwd).  The  PATH  variable  is  set  to
       /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin.

BUGS
       incrond is currently not resistent against looping.
