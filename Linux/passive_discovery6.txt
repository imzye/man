NAME
       passive_discovery6

SYNOPSIS
       passive_discovery6 [-Ds] [-m maxhop] [-R prefix] interface [script]

OPTIONS
        -D          do also dump destination addresses (does not work with -m)
        -s          do only print the addresses, no other output
        -m maxhop   the maximum number of hops a target which is dumped may be away.
                    0 means local only, the maximum amount to make sense is usually 5
        -R prefix   exchange the defined prefix with the link local prefix

       Passivly sniffs the network and dump all client's IPv6 addresses detected.
       Note that in a switched environment you get better results when additionally
       starting parasite6, however this will impact the network.
       If a script name is specified after the interface, it is called with the
       detected ipv6 address as first and the interface as second option.
