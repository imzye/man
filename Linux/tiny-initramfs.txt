NAME
       update-tirfs - generate a tiny-initramfs image

SYNOPSIS
       update-tirfs [-k kernel-version]

DESCRIPTION
       The  update-tirfs  script generates initramfs images that contains the tiny-initramfs init binary and place them in the standard Debian location so that the boot loader may find them. It will call
       mktirfs(8) to create the actual image. When called, all initramfs images in /boot for matching kernel versions will be replaced.

       Please read /usr/share/doc/tiny-initramfs-core/README.md for an overview of the use cases tiny-initramfs was designed for and the features it supports.

OPTIONS
       -k, --kernel-version=kernel-version
              Which kernel version to generate the initramfs image for. By default, the special value all is assumed, which indicates that the initramfs image should be regenerated for all installed ker‐
              nel versions.

CONFIGURATION
       If present, the configuration file /etc/tiny-initramfs/tiny-initramfs.conf can modify the behavior of mktirfs(8) in how the initramfs image is constructed. Please refer to the documentation of the
       mktirfs utility for details.

EXAMPLE
       Update all initramfs images:

               update-tirfs

       Update the initramfs image for a specific kernel version:

               update-tirfs -k 4.2.0

DEBIAN MAINTAINER SCRIPTS
       Please do not call this utility from Debian maintainer scripts. Use the update-initramfs trigger instead, as that will not depend on the initramfs implementation.

FILES
       /etc/tiny-initramfs/tiny-initramfs.conf
              If present, values in there will be used as defaults for the command line arguments of mktirfs.

       /usr/share/doc/tiny-initramfs-core/tiny-initramfs.conf.example
