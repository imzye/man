NAME
       drracket - the Racket programming environment

SYNOPSIS
       drracket [ Xoption ...  ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       DrRacket is the Racket programming environment.

       The drracket program treats non-switch command-line arguments as files to open.

X OPTIONS
       When  running  in X11, DrRacket accepts the following standard Xoptions: -display disp, -geometry geom, -bg color, -background color, -fg color, -foreground color, -fn font, -font font, -iconic, -name
       name, -rv, -reverse, +rv, -selectionTimeout time, -synchronous, -title name, -xnllanguage lang, -xrm file.

       In addition, the option -singleInstance is treated like an X option (it must appear before all other options), and it runs DrRacket in single-instance mode.  In single-instance mode, when an  existing
       instance is running with the same host and executable name, all non-option arguments are treated as file names and sent to the existing instance.
