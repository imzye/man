NAME
       icebreaker - An addictive action-puzzle game for X.

SYNOPSIS
       icebreaker

DESCRIPTION
       So, uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for world domina‐
       tion.

       In  order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg into small chunks by melting lines without hitting any of the birds. Once 80% or more of the 'berg is gone, you advance to the next
       level.

       Use the left mouse button to start lines, and the right (and/or middle) button to toggle between horizontal and vertical. Beyond that, it's probably easier for you go figure out the game by  play‐
       ing than by reading. So go.

       Go!

OPTIONS
       -n, --nosound
              do not attempt to initialize sound system. Causes the in-game Sound option to be marked N/A, and the config file setting to be ignored.

       -f, --fullscreen
              start in fullscreen mode if possible. Ignores config file setting.

       -w, --windowed
              start  in windowed mode. Resets config file so that this is the default. You probably won't ever need to use this, but it's there in case fullscreen somehow is broken and you're too lazy to
              edit the config file manually.

       -tthemename, --theme=themename
              select theme themename -- overrides config file. For more information on themes, see README.themes or the IceBreaker web site.

       -l, --listthemes
              show available themes.

       -v, --version
              display version and copyright information

       -h, --help
              display simple command-line option help screen
