NAME
       bytes-circle - Show byte statistics as an ASCII circle graph

SYNOPSIS
       bytes-circle [-o {0|1|2|3}] [-bBglLZnruvh] [-[fsStT] #] [-z {0-255}] files...

DESCRIPTION
       bytes-circle is a program that shows statistics about bytes contained in a file, as an ASCII circle graph of deviations from mean in standard deviation (sigma) fraction increments.

       By default, byte 0 is at the center of the circle and next bytes until 256 are situated counterclockwise around the center.

       bytes-circle expects a colour terminal, though other options are available.

       The ASCII art produced uses this char array to represent increment values of 1/4*sigma from the statistic's mean:
          . , - ~ + * o O # @

       This  ranges  from  zero (.) on the left, to 9/4*sigma (@) on the right.  If value is zero or over the mean the char is printed green.  If it is below the mean, it's printed red. A (blue) '=' char
       represents a byte value that doesn't appear in the file.

OPTIONS
       files  One or more files. If no file is indicated, standard input is used.

       -o {0|1|2|3}
              0=default | 1=no color | 2=numbers | 3=uncoloured numbers

       -b     No color (Black & white). In this case, ASCII art is adjusted so the zero sigma is at the middle of the chars array (char '*'). Increments are 1/2*sigma.

       -B     ('Break') stop processing files on first error encountered.

       -g     ('Global') show summary values for file, when using `-[sS]`.

       -l     List number of bytes counted, from 0 to 255.

       -L     List number of bytes counted, excluding zero valued.

       -Z     List number of bytes counted, but only zero valued.

       -n     Use Numbers. In this case, coloured numbers are used to represent values from 0 to 9/4*sigma.

       -r     Restrict statistics to the byte values that appear in the file, not to the 256 default. This only makes a difference if there are byte values that do not appear in the file.

       -u     Use Uncoloured numbers (equivalent to `-b -n`). In this case, numbers are used to represent positive deviations from 0 to 9/4*sigma, and letters are used to  represent  negative  deviations
              from 'a' (-0) to 'i' (-9/4)*sigma.

       -v     Show program version and list chars used in coloured circle.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -f #   ('From') analyze file from # byte on (1 implicit). SI suffixes supported.

       -s #   Slice file in slices of size # bytes. SI suffixes supported.

       -S #   Slice file in # slices. SI suffixes supported.

       -t #   ('To') analyze file until # byte. SI suffixes supported.

       -T #   ('To') analyze this # bytes from `-f`. SI suffixes supported.

       -z {0-255}
              Show a second circle centered on indicated byte bucket. A zero value is equivalent to 127 for ease of use. This way a second view of the statistics is available for data disaggregation.

       Note about SI suffixes: use one of kmgtpe (powers of 10), KMGTPE (powers of 2), and prefixes '0x' (hexadecimal number) and '0' (octal number).
