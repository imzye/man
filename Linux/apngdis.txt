NAME
       apngdis - deconstruct APNG file into a sequence of PNG frames

SYNOPSIS
       apngdis filename.png [name]

DESCRIPTION
       Extract invividual PNG files from animated PNG.

       After editing PNG frames in programs like Photoshop or GIMP, you can assemle files back into APNG using apngasm(1). Crrectly handles all blend/dispose combinations, in all color modes/depths.

       Some optimizations used in apngasm(1) might re-sort the palette, or change the color type from RGBA and RGB modes to RGB and indexed modes. Those optimizations are only performed when they are
       lossless, but if you want to avoid changing the palette or colortype, see options to turn them off.

       The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) file format is an extension to the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) specification. It allows for animated PNG files that work similarly to animated GIF
       files, while retaining backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files and adding support for 8-bit transparency and 24-bit images.

OPTIONS
       None.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       None.
