NAME
       dh_cruft - install cruft files into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_cruft [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_cruft is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing information files used by cruft(-ng) into package build directories.

FILES
       debian/package.cruft
           Installed  into usr/share/cruft/rules/package in the package build directory. This file is used to register runtime files as belonging to this package. For clarity, directories should end with
           a '/'.

       debian/package.purge
           Appended to usr/share/cruft/rules/package in the package build directory. This file is used to register runtime files as belonging to this package. For claririty, directories should end with a
           '/'.

           Also, a snippet is appended to postrm with the needed rm -rf commands to remove these files on purge phase.

           Some basic templating is implemented: the #VERSION# tag will be replaced by the basic upstream version.
