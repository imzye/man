NAME
       clasp - a conflict-driven nogood learning answer set solver

SYNOPSIS
       clasp [number] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the clasp command.

       clasp is an answer set solver for (extended) normal logic programs. It combines the high-level modeling capacities of answer set programming (ASP) with state-of-the-art techniques from the area of
       Boolean  constraint solving. The primary clasp algorithm relies on conflict-driven nogood learning, a technique that proved very successful for satisfiability checking (SAT). Unlike other learning
       ASP solvers, clasp does not rely on legacy software, such as a SAT solver or any other existing ASP solver. Rather, clasp has been genuinely developed for answer set solving based on conflict-dri‐
       ven nogood learning. clasp can be applied as an ASP solver (on LPARSE output format), as a SAT solver (on simplified DIMACS/CNF format), or as a PB solver (on OPB format).

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting  with  two  dashes  (`-').   A  summary  of  options  is  included  below.   For  a  complete  description,  see
