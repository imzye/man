NAME
       ipip - an IP over IP encapsulation daemon

SYNOPSIS
       ipip

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a  user-space daemon that supports encapsulation of IP over IP.  Modern Linux kernels provide this ability in the kernel, but consume an interface per encapsulated link.  This can be im‐
       practical for virtual networks built up of a large number of encapsulated links, such as is the case with the amateur radio net-44 network.  The ipip daemon is often a better  solution  for  these
       environments.

       There is very little documentation on the daemon at this time.  Look for the README file in /usr/share/doc/ipip, and the example config files also in that tree.

AUTHOR
       This package was originally written by Mike Westerhof for SunOS.  Bdale Garbee ported it to HP-UX and BSD/OS.  Ron Atkinson and John Paul Morrison then provided the tweaks for Linux.

       The package is currently once again being maintained by Bdale Garbee, both as "upstream maintainer" and as maintainer of the Debian GNU/Linux ipip package.

                                                                                                                                                                                                    IPIP(1)
