NAME
       ccrewrite  - Rewrite CLR assemblies for runtime code contract verifica‐
       tion.

SYNOPSIS
       ccrewrite --assembly=<assembly> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Rewrite CLR  assemblies  to  convert  calls  into  the  System.Diagnos‐
       tics.Contracts namespace to perform runtime contract verification. This
       includes contract inheritance for virtual methods.

       The assembly must  have  been  built  with  the  symbol  CONTRACTS_FULL
       defined,  otherwise  the  calls  to the contract methods will have been
       removed by the compiler.

       Currently  only  pre-conditions   are   supported,   using   the   Con‐
       tract.Requires()  method.  Contract  inheritance for virtual methods is
       supported. Only a limited range of operations and  types  can  be  used
       within  a pre-condition, an error message will be shown if ccrewrite is
       unable to process the specified assembly.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       --assembly <assembly-name>
              The assembly to rewrite. If no  --output  option  is  specified,
              then this file is overwritten with the rewritten version.

       --debug
              Use  debug information if available to improve the usefulness of
              contract failure messages.

       --help Show help for ccrewrite, listing configuration options.

       --level <level> (default=4)
              Set which contract types are present in rewritten assembly: 0  =
              No contracts; 1 = Release requires; 2 = Requires; 3 = Ensures; 4
              = Invariants; (Each level includes all previous levels)

       --output <file-name>
              Write the rewritten assembly to the specified file. If  this  is
              not present then the input assembly file is overwritten with the
              rewritten version.

       --rewrite (default=true)
              Rewrite the assembly. If false, then nothing is done.

       --throwOnFailure (default=false)
              Throw a ContractException on  unhandled  contract  failure.  The
              default behaviour is to Assert.
