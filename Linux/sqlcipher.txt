NAME
       sqlcipher - A command line interface for SQLCipher version 3

SYNOPSIS
       sqlcipher [options] [databasefile] [SQL]

SUMMARY
       sqlcipher  is  a  terminal-based  front-end  to  the SQLCipher library that can evaluate queries interactively and display the results in multiple formats.  sqlcipher can also be used within shell
       scripts and other applications to provide batch processing features.

DESCRIPTION
       To start a sqlcipher interactive session, invoke the sqlcipher command and optionally provide the name of a database file.  If the database file does not exist, it will be created.  If  the  data‐
       base file does exist, it will be opened.

       For example, to create a new database file named "mydata.db", create a table named "memos" and insert a couple of records into that table:

       $ sqlcipher mydata.db
       SQLCipher version 3.43.0 2023-08-11 17:45:23
       Enter ".help" for usage hints.
       sqlite> create table memos(text, priority INTEGER);
       sqlite> insert into memos values('deliver project description', 10);
       sqlite> insert into memos values('lunch with Christine', 100);
       sqlite> select * from memos;
       deliver project description|10
       lunch with Christine|100
       sqlite>

       If no database name is supplied, the ATTACH sql command can be used to attach to existing or create new database files.  ATTACH can also be used to attach to multiple databases within the same in‐
       teractive session.  This is useful for migrating data between databases, possibly changing the schema along the way.

       Optionally, a SQL statement or set of SQL statements can be supplied as a single argument.  Multiple statements should be separated by semi-colons.

       For example:

       $ sqlcipher -line mydata.db 'select * from memos where priority > 20;'
           text = lunch with Christine
       priority = 100

   SQLITE META-COMMANDS
       The  interactive  interpreter  offers a set of meta-commands that can be used to control the output format, examine the currently attached database files, or perform administrative operations upon
       the attached databases (such as rebuilding indices).   Meta-commands are always prefixed with a dot (.).

       A list of available meta-commands can be viewed at any time by issuing the '.help' command.  For example:

       sqlite> .help

       The available commands differ by version and build options, so they are not listed here. Please refer to your local copy for all available options.

INIT FILE
       sqlcipher reads an initialization file to set the configuration of the interactive environment.  Throughout initialization, any previously specified setting can be  overridden.   The  sequence  of
       initialization is as follows:

       o The default configuration is established as follows:

       mode            = LIST
       separator       = "|"
       main prompt     = "sqlite> "
       continue prompt = "   ...> "

       o If the file ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/sqlcipher/sqliterc or ~/.sqliterc exists, the first of those to be found is processed during startup.  It should generally only contain meta-commands.

       o If the -init option is present, the specified file is processed.

       o All other command line options are processed.
