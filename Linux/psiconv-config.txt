NAME
       psiconv-config - script to get information about the installed version of Psiconv

SYNOPSIS
       psiconv-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs] [--cflags] [LIBRARIES]

DESCRIPTION
       psiconv-config  is  a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use psiconv. It is also used internally to the .m4
       macros for GNU autoconf that are included with psiconv.

OPTIONS
       psiconv-config accepts the following options:

       LIBRARIES
               Psiconv has one library 'psiconv'.  If you specify one of them, only the appropriate things for that library will be printed.

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of psiconv on the standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a psiconv program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a psiconv program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that psiconv was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options. This option is also  used  for  the  exec
               prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified,  use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that psiconv was built with when computing the output for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified be‐
               fore any --libs or --cflags options.
