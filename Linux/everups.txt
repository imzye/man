EVERUPS(8)                        NUT Manual                        EVERUPS(8)

NAME
       everups - Driver for Ever UPS models

NOTE
       This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
       everups driver. For information about the core driver, see
       nutupsdrv(8).

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       This driver should recognize the NET *-DPC and AP *-PRO models.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
       This driver does not support any extra settings in the ups.conf(5).

BUGS
       This UPS can only switch off the load if it’s running on battery. This
       means you may be vulnerable to power races if your shutdown scripts
       don’t sleep and force a reboot.
