DESCRIPTION
     fido2-token manages a FIDO 2 authenticator.

     The options are as follows:

     -C device
             Changes the PIN of device.  The user will be prompted for the
             current and new PINs.

     -D -i id device
             Deletes the resident credential specified by id from device,
             where id is the credential's base64-encoded id.  The user will be
             prompted for the PIN.

     -D -b -k key_path device
             Deletes a “largeBlob” encrypted with key_path from device, where
             key_path must hold the blob's base64-encoded encryption key.  A
             PIN or equivalent user-verification gesture is required.

     -D -b -n rp_id [-i cred_id] device
             Deletes a “largeBlob” corresponding to rp_id from device.  If
             rp_id has multiple credentials enrolled on device, the credential
             ID must be specified using -i cred_id, where cred_id is a
             base64-encoded blob.  A PIN or equivalent user-verification ges‐
             ture is required.

     -D -e -i id device
             Deletes the biometric enrollment specified by id from device,
             where id is the enrollment's template base64-encoded id.  The
             user will be prompted for the PIN.

     -D -u device
             Disables the FIDO 2.1 “user verification always” feature on
             device.

     -G -b -k key_path blob_path device
             Gets a FIDO 2.1 “largeBlob” encrypted with key_path from device,
             where key_path must hold the blob's base64-encoded encryption
             key.  The blob is written to blob_path.  A PIN or equivalent
             user-verification gesture is required.

     -G -b -n rp_id [-i cred_id] blob_path device
             Gets a FIDO 2.1 “largeBlob” associated with rp_id from device.
             If rp_id has multiple credentials enrolled on device, the creden‐
             tial ID must be specified using -i cred_id, where cred_id is a
             base64-encoded blob.  The blob is written to blob_path.  A PIN or
             equivalent user-verification gesture is required.

     -I device
             Retrieves information on device.

     -I -c device
             Retrieves resident credential metadata from device.  The user
             will be prompted for the PIN.

     -I -k rp_id -i cred_id device
             Prints the credential id (base64-encoded) and public key (PEM en‐
             coded) of the resident credential specified by rp_id and cred_id,
             where rp_id is a UTF-8 relying party id, and cred_id is a
             base64-encoded credential id.  The user will be prompted for the
             PIN.

     -L      Produces a list of authenticators found by the operating system.

     -L -b device
             Produces a list of FIDO 2.1 “largeBlobs” on device.  A PIN or
             equivalent user-verification gesture is required.

     -L -e device
             Produces a list of biometric enrollments on device.  The user
             will be prompted for the PIN.

     -L -r device
             Produces a list of relying parties with resident credentials on
             device.  The user will be prompted for the PIN.

     -L -k rp_id device
             Produces a list of resident credentials corresponding to relying
             party rp_id on device.  The user will be prompted for the PIN.

     -R      Performs a reset on device.  fido2-token will NOT prompt for con‐
             firmation.

     -S      Sets the PIN of device.  The user will be prompted for the PIN.

     -S -a device
             Enables FIDO 2.1 Enterprise Attestation on device.

     -S -b -k key_path blob_path device
             Sets blob_path as a FIDO 2.1 “largeBlob” encrypted with key_path
             on device, where blob_path holds the blob's plaintext, and
             key_path the blob's base64-encoded encryption.  A PIN or equiva‐
             lent user-verification gesture is required.

     -S -b -n rp_id [-i cred_id] blob_path device
             Sets blob_path as a FIDO 2.1 “largeBlob” associated with rp_id on
             device.  If rp_id has multiple credentials enrolled on device,
             the credential ID must be specified using -i cred_id, where
             cred_id is a base64-encoded blob.  A PIN or equivalent user-veri‐
             fication gesture is required.

     -S -c -i cred_id -k user_id -n name -p display_name device
             Sets the name and display_name attributes of the resident creden‐
             tial identified by cred_id and user_id, where name and
             display_name are UTF-8 strings and cred_id and user_id are
             base64-encoded blobs.  A PIN or equivalent user-verification ges‐
             ture is required.

     -S -e device
             Performs a new biometric enrollment on device.  The user will be
             prompted for the PIN.

     -S -e -i template_id -n template_name device
             Sets the friendly name of the biometric enrollment specified by
             template_id to template_name on device, where template_id is
             base64-encoded and template_name is a UTF-8 string.  The user
             will be prompted for the PIN.

     -S -f device
             Forces a PIN change on device.  The user will be prompted for the
             PIN.

     -S -l pin_length device
             Sets the minimum PIN length of device to pin_length.  The user
             will be prompted for the PIN.

     -S -u device
             Enables the FIDO 2.1 “user verification always” feature on
             device.

     -V      Prints version information.

     -d      Causes fido2-token to emit debugging output on stderr.

     If a tty is available, fido2-token will use it to prompt for PINs.  Oth‐
     erwise, stdin is used.

     fido2-token exits 0 on success and 1 on error.

CAVEATS
     The actual user-flow to perform a reset is outside the scope of the FIDO2
     specification, and may therefore vary depending on the authenticator.
     Yubico authenticators do not allow resets after 5 seconds from power-up,
     and expect a reset to be confirmed by the user through touch within 30
     seconds.

     An authenticator's path may contain spaces.

     Resident credentials are called “discoverable credentials” in FIDO 2.1.

     Whether the FIDO 2.1 “user verification always” feature is activated or
     deactivated after an authenticator reset is vendor-specific.
