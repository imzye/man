NAME
       statnews - generate some useful statistics out of a newsgroup

SYNOPSIS
       statnews [OPTIONS] NEWSGROUP

DESCRIPTION
       The statnews command get some useful statistics out of a newsgroup.  It displays things like how many articles each author posted, how many characters was written, how many lines were quoted, how
       many articles belong to each thread, the number of messages/characters per day, the average message length, and so on.

OPTIONS
       --capitalize(*)
           Whether  to  capitalize  the  name  of  both  the  sender  and the receiver of each message (default is "--capitalize": yes).  This option is useful to collect "AUTHOR" together with "author",
           "Author", and "AuThor".

       --dotted(*)
           Whether to translate "." to "/" in NEWSGROUP (default is "--nodotted": does translate).  This option may be useful if  your  system  stores  each  newsgroup  in  a  dedicate  directory  (e.g.,
           news.useless.group) instead that by hierarchy (e.g., news/useless/group), or if your system has a news archive stored this way.

       --from=DATE
           Set the date statistics start from (DATE format is "dd/mm/yyyy", GMT).

       --help
           Display the help summary.

       --spooldir=SPOOLDIR
           Search NEWSGROUP in SPOOLDIR (default is /var/spool/news/articles/).

       --to=DATE
           Set the date statistics end by (DATE format is "dd/mm/yyyy", GMT).

       --width=WIDTH
           Set the terminal width to WIDTH columns (default is 80, with a minimum of 70).

       Options may be conveniently abbreviated and prefixed by "-" instead of "--"; the "=" may be omitted or substituted with one or more blanks.

       Options listed with (*) may be negated by adding the prefix "no" in front of them (e.g., "--dotted" => "--nodotted").

RETURN VALUE
       The statnews command returns 0 on success and a positive integer on errors.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable STATNEWS can hold a set of default options for statnews.

       These options are interpreted first by the program and can be overridden by explicit command line parameters.  For example:

       sh: "STATNEWS="--nocapital --width=132"; export STATNEWS"

       csh:
           "setenv STATNEWS "--nocapital --width=132""

FILES
       The default spool directory is /var/spool/news/articles/.

HISTORY
       This  program  was  originally aimed for use with FidoNet style echo areas under Debian GNU/Linux.  It can be successfully used with Usenet newsgroups as well.  More precisely, it can be used with
       every message base that stores one message per file in some directory in traditional mbox format.
