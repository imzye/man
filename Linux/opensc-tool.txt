NAME
       opensc-tool - generic smart card utility

SYNOPSIS
       opensc-tool [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The opensc-tool utility can be used from the command line to perform miscellaneous smart card operations such as getting the card ATR or sending arbitrary APDU commands to a card.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Print the OpenSC package release version.

       --atr, -a
           Print the Answer To Reset (ATR) of the card. Output is in hex byte format

       --card-driver driver, -c driver
           Use the given card driver. The default is to auto-detect the correct card driver. The literal value ?  lists all available card drivers.

       --list-algorithms,
           Lists algorithms supported by card

       --info, -i
           Print information about OpenSC, such as version and enabled components.

       --list-drivers, -D
           List all installed card drivers.

       --list-files, -f
           Recursively list all files stored on card.

       --list-readers, -l
           List all configured readers.

       --name, -n
           Print the name of the inserted card (driver).

       --get-conf-entry conf, -G conf
           Get configuration key, format: section:name:key

       --set-conf-entry conf, -S conf
           Set configuration key, format: section:name:key:value

       --reader arg, -r arg
           Number of the reader to use. By default, the first reader with a present card is used. If arg is an ATR, the reader with a matching card will be chosen.

       --reset [type],
           Resets the card in reader. The default reset type is cold, but warm reset is also possible.

       --send-apdu apdu, -s apdu
           Sends an arbitrary APDU to the card in the format AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF....

       --serial
           Print the card serial number (normally the ICCSN). Output is in hex byte format

       --verbose, -v
           Causes opensc-tool to be more verbose. Specify this flag several times to enable debug output in the opensc library.

       --wait, -w
           Wait for a card to be inserted.
