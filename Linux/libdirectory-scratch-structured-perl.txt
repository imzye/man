NAME
        Directory::Scratch::Structured - creates temporary files and directories from a structured description

SYNOPSIS
         my %tree_structure =
                       (
                       dir_1 =>
                               {
                               subdir_1 =>{},
                               file_1 =>[],
                               file_a => [],
                               },
                       dir_2 =>
                               {
                               subdir_2 =>
                                       {
                                       file_22 =>[],
                                       file_2a =>[],
                                       },
                               file_2 =>[],
                               file_a =>['12345'],
                               file_b =>[],
                               },

                       file_0 => [] ,
                       ) ;

         use Directory::Scratch::Structured qw(create_structured_tree) ;
         my $temporary_directory = create_structured_tree(%tree_structure) ;

         or

         use Directory::Scratch ;
         use Directory::Scratch::Structured  qw(piggyback_directory_scratch) ;

         my $temporary_directory = Directory::Scratch->new;
         $temporary_directory->create_structured_tree(%tree_structure) ;

DESCRIPTION
       This module adds a create_structured_tree subroutine to the Directory::Scratch.

DOCUMENTATION
       I needed a subroutine to create a bunch of temporary directories and files while running tests. I used the excellent Directory::Scratch to implement  such a functionality. I proposed the
       subroutine to the Directory::Scratch author but he preferred to implement a subroutine using an unstructured input data based on the fact that Directory::Scratch didn't use structured data. This
       is, IMHO, flawed design, though it may require slightly less typing.

       I proposed a hybrid solution to reduce the amount of subroutines and integrate the subroutine using structured input into Directory::Scratch but we didn't reach an agreement on the API. Instead I
       decided that I would piggyback on Directory::Scratch.

       You can access create_structured_tree through a subroutine or a method through a Directory::Scratch object.

       Whichever interface you choose, the argument to the create_structured_tree consists of tuples (hash entries). The key represents the name of the object to create in the directory.

       If the value is of type:

       ARRAY
         A file will be created, it's contents are  the contents of the array (See Directory::Scratch)

       HASH
         A directory will be created. the element of the hash will also be , recursively, created

       OTHER
         The subroutine will croak.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   create_structured_tree
         use Directory::Scratch::Structured qw(create_structured_tree) ;

         my $temporary_directory = create_structured_tree(%tree_structure) ;
         my $base = $temporary_directory->base() ;

       Returns a default Directory::Scratch object.

   directory_scratch_create_structured_tree
       Adds create_structured_tree to  Directory::Scratch when you Load Directory::Scratch::Structured with the piggyback_directory_scratch option.

         use Directory::Scratch ;
         use Directory::Scratch::Structured qw(piggyback_directory_scratch) ;

         my $temporary_directory = Directory::Scratch->new;
         $temporary_directory->create_structured_tree(%tree_structure) ;

   _create_structured_tree
       Used internally by both interfaces

   piggyback
       Used internally to piggyback Directory::Scratch.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       None so far.
