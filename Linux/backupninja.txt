       when   When to process each configuration file. The value used here will be applied for each configuration file. It is possible to override this "when" in each configuration file, see also section
              "Scheduling" in backup.d(5).

              For example:

                when = sundays at 02:00
                when = 30th at 22
                when = 30 at 22:00
                when = everyday at 01            <-- the default
                when = Tuesday at 05:00

              These values for 'when' are equivalent:

                when = tuesday at 05:30
                when = TUESDAYS at 05

              These values for 'when' are invalid:

                when = tuesday at 2am
                when = tuesday at 2
                when = tues at 02
