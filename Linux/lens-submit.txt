DESCRIPTION
       lines-submit is a simple tool that reads a Hugin .pto project, finds the first 'lens', gathers some lens and EXIF data, and submits it via HTTP to a central collecting server.

       Data submitted is anonymous, no serial numbers, user names, dates or file names are submitted.  Your ip-address can be logged by the server as the submission is via a normal HTTP GET request.

       IMPORTANT: Data submitted via this protocol may be collated, processed and redistributed under any or all of the following licenses:
