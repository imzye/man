DESCRIPTION
       The eyaml command is a command line interface for hiera-eyaml. It is used to create keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and act as a wrapper around a text editor.

EXAMPLES
   encrypting data
             $ eyaml encrypt --string 'foo bar'
       Encrypts  the  command  line  argument  to "--string", and outputs the encrypted data on two formats, line and block. This can be included in an .eyaml file. The "eyaml" command expects keys to be
       present in the "./keys/" directory by default.

   using the editor wrapper
             $ eyaml edit hieradata/common.eyaml
       Decrypts the file into a temporary file, and opens the file in a text editor. Values to be encrypted are wrapped in markup. When the file is saved, any changed values are encrypted.

AUTHORS
       eyaml was written by Geoff Meakin, Peter Dyson, Robert Fielding, Simon Hildrew and Tom Poulton.

       This man page was written by Stig Sandbeck Mathisen for the Debian distribution, but may be used by others.

BUGS
       The file referenced in "eyaml edit" must exist.

       An error in the markup may result in "eyaml edit" not being able to open the file.
