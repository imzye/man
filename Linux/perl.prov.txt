NAME
       perl.prov - list what Perl source files provide

SYNOPSIS
       perl.prov [-v|--verbose] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       This script calculates conventional name for each Perl source file specified on a command line, based on its location relative to standard Perl library paths; alternatively, a list of files is
       obtained from standard input, one file per line.  *.pm, *.pl, and *.ph files are processed (*.pm files also suffer version extraction).  The output of perl.prov is suitable for automatic dependency
       tracking (e.g.  for RPM packaging).

       For example, /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/DB_File.pm provides "perl(DB_File.pm) = 1.810" (as of perl-5.8.6).

       perl.prov is a counterpart of perl.req.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity.

       The RPM_PERL_LIB_PATH environment variable, if set, must contain the list of paths, separated by colons. These paths are considered as library paths used to determine relative names of provided perl
       files (in addition to paths from @INC variable).
