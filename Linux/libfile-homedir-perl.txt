File::HomeDir::Darwin::Carbon(3pm)                                                  User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                  File::HomeDir::Darwin::Carbon(3pm)

NAME
       File::HomeDir::Darwin - Find your home and other directories on Darwin (OS X)

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides Darwin-specific implementations for determining common user directories.  In normal usage this module will always be used via File::HomeDir.

       Note -- since this module requires Mac::Carbon and Mac::Carbon does not work with 64-bit perls, on such systems, File::HomeDir will try File::HomeDir::Darwin::Cocoa and then fall back to the (pure
       Perl) File::HomeDir::Darwin.

SYNOPSIS
         use File::HomeDir;

         # Find directories for the current user
         $home    = File::HomeDir->my_home;      # /Users/mylogin
         $desktop = File::HomeDir->my_desktop;   # /Users/mylogin/Desktop
         $docs    = File::HomeDir->my_documents; # /Users/mylogin/Documents
         $music   = File::HomeDir->my_music;     # /Users/mylogin/Music
         $pics    = File::HomeDir->my_pictures;  # /Users/mylogin/Pictures
         $videos  = File::HomeDir->my_videos;    # /Users/mylogin/Movies
         $data    = File::HomeDir->my_data;      # /Users/mylogin/Library/Application Support

TODO
       •   Test with Mac OS (versions 7, 8, 9)

       •   Some better way for users_* ?
