NAME
       ginn - Gesture to Keypress / Mouse Button injector

SYNOPSIS
       ginn [<specific configuration file>]

DESCRIPTION
       ginn is a program to test support gestures in legacy applications without the need to rewrite them.  This support is made by injecting keypresses or mouse buttons after matching rules from
       wishes.xml file.

       You can define the matching rules by expressing wishes. Each wish contains the name of the gesture, number of fingers, the matching rules.  The keypress to inject is defined by key tag, and
       the mouse button by button, you can add also up to 4 modifiers keys like Control_L.

   EXAMPLES
       Sample wishes file:

           <ginn>
           <global>
             <wish gesture="Drag" fingers="2">
               <action name="action5" when="update">
                 <trigger prop="delta y" min="20" max="80"/>
                 <key>Down</key>
               </action>
             </wish>
           </global>
           <applications>
             <application name="inkscape">
               <wish gesture="Pinch" fingers="2">
                 <action name="action1" when="update">
                   <trigger prop="radius delta" min="-200" max="-40"/>
                   <key>KP_Subtract</key>
                 </action>
               </wish>
             </application>
           </applications>
           </ginn>

       Gesture type can be: Drag, Pinch, Rotate or Tap The time of injection can be selected by using update to inject when the gesture is received or finish to inject when the gesture is finished.
       The choice should be written inside the when in the action line.
               <action name="action1" when="update">

       The Open Input Framework gesture stack provide gesture updates which can be very small to reach the desired interval specified in the trigger.  To provide more flexibility a gesture
       accumulation is performed by default to the successive property values' updates for a desired gesture until it reaches the min-max intervall or the gesture finish, then, the accumlation
       buffer is reinitialized.  If you want to disable this feature you can specify it explicitly:
               <trigger prop="delta x" min="-80" max="-40" accumulate="false"/>

       The attributes used in trigger can be obtained by running geistest, you can also refer to the list below.  You can use more than one trigger, but you need to use them in the same order as
       they appear in the list below.

           Sub-list of general attributes
            "device id"       = 13
            "timestamp"       = 180598198
            "root window id"  = 254
            "event window id" = 159825921
            "child window id" = 159825921
            "focus x"         = 0.000000
            "focus y"         = 0.000000
            "gesture name"    = "Drag"
            "touches"         = 1

           Sub-list of attributes used with Drag gesture
            "delta x"    = -8.933333
            "delta y"    = 22.000000
            "velocity x" = -0.638095
            "velocity y" = 1.571429
            "position x" = 634.533386
            "position y" = 482.777771

           Sub-list of attributes used with Rotate gesture
            "angle delta"      = -0.358113
            "angular velocity" = -0.029843
            "angle"            = -1.159999

           Sub-list of attributes used with Pinch gesture
            "radius delta"    = -44.935688
            "radial velocity" = -3.209692
            "radius"          = 180.466690

           Sub-list of attributes used with Tap gesture
            "tap time"   = 74.000000
            "position x" = 740.933350
            "position y" = 469.333344

           Last attribues in the general list
            "boundingbox x1" = 634.533386
            "boundingbox y1" = 482.777771
            "boundingbox x2" = 634.533386
            "boundingbox y2" = 482.777771
            "touch 0 id"     = 1079.000000
            "touch 0 x"      = 634.533386
            "touch 0 y"      = 482.777771

       The names of keys list can be obtained after removing the XK_ prefix from /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h file

        The mouse buttons are written with their corresponding number:
           1   Left Button
           2   Middle Button
           3   Right Button
           4   Wheel Up
           5   Wheel Down
           6   Horizontal Wheel Left
           7   Horizontal Wheel Right
           8   "Back" in browsers
