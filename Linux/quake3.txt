NAME
       quake3 - Quake III Arena client

SYNOPSIS
       quake3 [-h|--help] [-q|--quiet] [debugging options] [+set option value]...

DESCRIPTION
       quake3 is the client for Quake III Arena, a multiplayer network game.

OPTIONS
       The wrapper script used for Quake III Arena in Debian accepts these options:

       -h, --help
              Display a short help summary

       -q, --quiet
              Disable all console output

       --demo Run the demo version, even if the full game is installed

       --debugger=DEBUGGER
              Prepend a debugger or other prefix (such as strace) to the engine command line

       --print-backtrace
              Use gdb(1) to get a backtrace if the engine crashes (the gdb package must be installed)

       Additionally,  if  quake3 is run via a symbolic link whose name is quake3-team-arena, it will play the expansion pack, Quake III Team Arena. This requires that additional data files are installed.
       Similarly, a symbolic link named quake3-demo is equivalent to the --demo option.

       Any console command can also be prefixed with + and used as a command-line option (press Shift+Esc to access the in-game console), including:

       +set option value
              Set an option (see below for some options)

       +connect server[:port]
              Connect to a server
