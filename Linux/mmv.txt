NAME
       mmv - move/copy/link multiple files by wildcard patterns

SYNOPSIS
       mmv [-m|-x|-r|-c|-o|-a|-l|-s] [-h] [-d|-p] [-g|-t] [-v|-n] FROM TO

DESCRIPTION
       move/copy/link multiple files by wildcard patterns

       The FROM pattern is a shell glob pattern, in which `*' stands for any number of characters and `?' stands for a single character.

       Use #[l|u]N in the TO pattern to get the string matched by the Nth FROM pattern wildcard [lowercased|uppercased].

       Patterns should be quoted on the command line.

       Mmv  moves  (or  copies or links, as specified) each source file matching a from pattern to the target name specified by the to pattern.  This multiple action is performed safely, i.e. without any
       unexpected deletion of files due to collisions of target names with existing filenames or with other target names.  Furthermore, before doing anything, mmv attempts to detect any errors that would
       result from the entire set of actions specified and gives the user the choice of either proceeding by avoiding the offending parts or aborting.  mmv does support large files (LFS) but it does  not
       support sparse files (i.e. it explodes them).

       Older  versions  of mmv supported interactive editing of the rename etc. operations, but using a fragile system that could not cope with certain characters, such as spaces, in filenames. Users who
       require this functionality can use qmv(1) and friends (in the renameutils package).

                                                                                                 The Task Options

       Whether mmv moves, copies, or links is governed by the first set of options given above.  If none of these are specified, the task is given by the command name under which mmv was invoked:

               command name   default task

               mmv            --copydel
               mcp            --copy
               mln            --hardlink

       The task option choices are:

       --move:
              move source file to target name.  Both must be on the same device.  If the source file is a symbolic link, moves the link without checking if the link's target from  the  new  directory  is
              different than the old.

       --copydel:
              same  as  --move,  except  cross-device moves are done by copying, then deleting source.  When copying, sets the permission bits and file modification time of the target file to that of the
              source file.

       --rename:
              rename source file or directory to target name.  The target name must not include a path: the file remains in the same directory in all cases.

       --copy:
              copy source file to target name.  Sets the file modification time and permission bits of the target file to that of the source file, regardless of whether the target  file  already  exists.
              Chains and cycles (to be explained below) are not allowed.

       --overwrite:
              overwrite target name with source file.  If target file exists, it is overwritten, keeping its original owner and permission bits.  If it does not exist, it is created, with read-write per‐
              mission bits set according to umask(1), and the execute permission bits copied from the source file.  In either case, the file modification time is set to the current time.

       --hardlink:
              link target name to source file.  Both must be on the same device, and the source must not be a directory.  Chains and cycles are not allowed.

       --symlink:
              same  as --hardlink, but use symbolic links instead of hard links.  For the resulting link to aim back at the source, either the source name must begin with a '/', or the target must reside
              in either the current or the source directory.  If none of these conditions are met, the link is refused.  However, source and target can reside on different devices, and the source can  be
              a directory.

       Only one of these options may be given, and it applies to all matching files.

                                                                                                 The From Pattern

       The from pattern is a filename with embedded wildcards: '*', '?', '['...']', and ';'.  The first three have their usual sh(1) meanings of, respectively, matching any string of characters, matching
       any single character, and matching any one of a set of characters.

       Between  the  '['  and  ']',  a  range  from  character  'a'  through character 'z' is specified with "a-z".  The set of matching characters can be negated by inserting a '^' after the '['.  Thus,
       "[^b-e2-5_]" will match any character but 'b' through 'e', '2' through '5', and '_'.

       Note that paths are allowed in the patterns, and wildcards may be intermingled with slashes arbitrarily.  The ';' wildcard is useful for matching files at any depth  in  the  directory  tree.   It
       matches  the  same  as "*/" repeated any number of times, including zero, and can only occur either at the beginning of the pattern or following a '/'.  Thus ";*.c" will match all ".c" files in or
       below the current directory, while "/;*.c" will match them anywhere on the file system.

       In addition, if the from pattern (or the to pattern) begins with "~/", the '~' is replaced with the home directory name.  (Note that the "~user" feature of csh(1) is  not  implemented.)   However,
       the '~' is not treated as a wildcard, in the sense that it is not assigned a wildcard index (see below).

       The directories "." and ".." are only matched against completely explicit from patterns (i.e. not containing wildcards).

       Files beginning with '.' are only matched against from patterns that begin with an explicit '.'.  However, if -h is specified, they are matched normally.

       Warning: since the shell normally expands wildcards before passing the command-line arguments to mmv, it is usually necessary to enclose the command-line from and to patterns in quotes.

                                                                                                  The To Pattern

       The  to pattern is a filename with embedded wildcard indexes, where an index consists of the character '#' followed by a string of digits.  When a source file matches a from pattern, a target name
       for the file is constructed out of the to pattern by replacing the wildcard indexes by the actual characters that matched the referenced wildcards in the source name.  Thus, if the from pattern is
       "abc*.*" and the to pattern is "xyz#2.#1", then "abc.txt" is targeted to "xyztxt.".  (The first '*' matched "", and the second matched "txt".)   Similarly,  for  the  pattern  pair  ";*.[clp]"  ->
       "#1#3/#2", "foo1/foo2/prog.c" is targeted to "foo1/foo2/c/prog".  Note that there is no '/' following the "#1" in the to pattern, since the string matched by any ';' is always either empty or ends
       in a '/'.  In this case, it matches "foo1/foo2/".

       To convert the string matched by a wildcard to either lowercase or uppercase before embedding it in the target name, insert 'l' or 'u', respectively, between the '#' and the string of digits.

       The  to pattern, like the from pattern, can begin with a "~/" (see above).  This does not necessitate enclosing the to pattern in quotes on the command line since csh(1) expands the '~' in the ex‐
       act same manner as mmv (or, in the case of sh(1), does not expand it at all).

       For all task options other than -r, if the target name is a directory, the real target name is formed by appending a '/' followed by the last component of the source file name.  For example,  "mmv
       dir1/a dir2" will, if "dir2" is indeed a directory, actually move "dir1/a" to "dir2/a".  However, if "dir2/a" already exists and is itself a directory, this is considered an error.

       To  strip any character (e.g. '*', '?', or '#') of its special meaning to mmv, as when the actual replacement name must contain the character '#', precede the special character with a '\' (and en‐
       close the argument in quotes because of the shell).  This also works to terminate a wildcard index when it has to be followed by a digit in the filename, e.g. "a#1\1".

                                                                                                Chains and Cycles

       A chain is a sequence of specified actions where the target name of one action refers to the source file of another action.  For example,

       mmv
       a b
       b c

       specifies the chain "a" -> "b" -> "c".  A cycle is a chain where the last target name refers back to the first source file, e.g. "mmv a a".  Mmv detects chains and cycles regardless of  the  order
       in  which their constituent actions are actually given.  Where allowed, i.e. in moving and renaming files, chains and cycles are handled gracefully, by performing them in the proper order.  Cycles
       are broken by first renaming one of the files to a temporary name.

                                                                                             Collisions and Deletions

       When any two or more matching files would have to be moved, copied, or linked to the same target filename, mmv detects the condition as an error before performing any  actions.   Furthermore,  mmv
       checks if any of its actions will result in the destruction of existing files.  If the -d (delete) option is specified, all file deletions or overwrites are done silently.  Under -p (protect), all
       deletions  or overwrites (except those specified with "(*)" on the standard input, see below) are treated as errors.  And if neither option is specified, the user is queried about each deletion or
       overwrite separately.  (The terminal is used for interactive queries, not standard input.)

                                                                                                  Error Handling

       Whenever any error in the user's action specifications is detected, an error message is given on the standard output, and mmv proceeds to check the rest of the specified actions.  Once all  errors
       are  detected,  mmv  asks  the  user whether to continue by avoiding the erroneous actions or to abort altogether.  This and all other queries may be avoided by specifying either the -g (go) or -t
       (terminate) option.  The former will resolve all difficulties by avoiding the erroneous actions; the latter will abort mmv if any errors are detected.  Specifying either of them  defaults  mmv  to
       -p, unless -d is specified (see above).  Thus, -g and -t are most useful when running mmv in the background or in a shell script, when interactive queries are undesirable.

                                                                                                     Reports

       Once  the actions to be performed are determined, mmv performs them silently, unless either the -v (verbose) or -n (no-execute) option is specified.  The former causes mmv to report each performed
       action on the standard output as

       a -> b : done.

       Here, "a" and "b" would be replaced by the source and target names, respectively.  If the action deletes the old target, a "(*)" is inserted after the the target name.  Also, the  "->"  symbol  is
       modified  when  a cycle has to be broken: the '>' is changed to a '^' on the action prior to which the old target is renamed to a temporary, and the '-' is changed to a '=' on the action where the
       temporary is used.

       Under -n, none of the actions are performed, but messages like the above are printed on the standard output with the ": done." omitted.

       Although mmv attempts to predict all mishaps prior to performing any specified actions, accidents may happen.  For example, mmv does not check for adequate free space when copying.  Thus,  despite
       all  efforts, it is still possible for an action to fail after some others have already been done.  To make recovery as easy as possible, mmv reports which actions have already been done and which
       are still to be performed after such a failure occurs.  It then aborts, not attempting to do anything else.

EXAMPLES
       Rename all *.jpeg files in the current directory to *.jpg:

          mmv '*.jpeg' '#1.jpg'

       Replace the first occurrence of abc with xyz in all files in the current directory:

          mmv '*abc*' '#1xyz#2'

       Rename files ending in .html.en, .html.de, etc. to ending in .en.html, .de.html, etc. in the current directory:

          mmv '*.html.??' '#1.#2#3.html'

       Rename music files from <track no.> - <interpreter> - <song title>.ogg to <interpreter> - <track no.> - <song title>.ogg in the current directory:

          mmv '* - * - *.ogg' '#2 - #1 - #3.ogg'

EXIT STATUS
       Mmv exits with status 1 if it aborts before doing anything, with status 2 if it aborts due to failure after completing some of the actions, and with status 0 otherwise.

BUGS
       If the search pattern is not quoted, the shell expands the wildcards.  Mmv then (usually) gives some error message, but cannot determine that the lack of quotes is the cause.

       To avoid difficulties in semantics and error checking, mmv refuses to create directories.
