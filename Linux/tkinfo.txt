DESCRIPTION

OPTIONS
       --help Produces a short help message.

       -/+headers
              Turns on/off display of the raw info node headers in the first line of the window. Default is on.

       -/+buttons
              Turns on/off display of the button row. Default is on.

       -/+balloons
              Turns on/off balloonhelp for the buttons. Default is on.

       -/+scrollthrough
              Turns on/off jumping to the successor node when attempting to scroll at the bottom of a node. Default is on.

       -/+pagesep
              Turns on/off inserting of page separators when scrolling page-wise.  Default is on.

       -/+showdir
              Turns on/off showing the full pathname of the displayed info file. Default is off.

       -linklook type
              Specifies  how  to  display  cross references and menu entries.  type must be one of "color", "font", or "underline". Default is "color" on color displays and "underline" on black and white
              displays.

       -highlight type
              Specifies how to highlight links.  type must be one of "color", "inverse", or "underline". Default is "inverse".

       -searchlook type
              Specifies how to highlight matches after searches.  type must be one of "color", "inverse", or "underline". Default is "inverse".

       -geometry geom
              Geometry of the window.  geom must be of the form XxY+A+B or XxY or +A+B, where X and Y specify the size of the window in characters and A and B the location in pixels.

       -display display
              X display to use for the tkinfo window.

       -iconic
              Start the first window in iconic state.

       -dir dir
              Specifies directories to search for info files, in addition to those contained in the INFOPATH environment variable.  The directories specified with -dir will be searched first, in the  or‐
              der given.

       node   Specifies the info node to visit initially. Possible formats for node are:
                "(filename)nodename"  most general
                "(filename)"          equivalent to (filename)Top
                "filename"            equivalent to (filename).

       If filename is not absolute, the info directories (from INFOPATH and -dir) will be searched. If filename cannot be found, its lower case version will be tried.

       An alternative way to specify the node "(FILE)NODE" is with "-file FILE -node NODE".

       If no node is given, the default node "(dir)Top" is used.

ENVIRONMENT
       INFOPATH
              A colon (``:'') separated list of directories to search for info files. More directories can be given with -dir options, above. If not set, tkinfo will try various standard directories that
              should be ok for most systems.

       INFOSUFFIX
              A  colon separated list of file suffixes to try when searching for an info file. If not set, tkinfo will try the suffixes "", ".info", and "-info". In addition, tkinfo will always automati‐
              cally try the suffixes .Z, .z, and .gz and deal with the compressed file if necessary.

SEE ALSO
       The program documents itself in the info format: start it and type "h". Customization via X resources is also documented in that way.
