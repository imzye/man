NAME
       dh_xine - calculates xine-lib dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       dh_xine [debhelper options] [package name suffixes]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_xine is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the ${xine-x:Depends} and ${xine-console:Depends} substitutions and adding them to substvars files.

       Each xine-lib front end is required to have one of these two substvars listed in its Depends line in debian/control. Using package names directly will, sooner or later, break.

       By  listing  package  name  suffixes,  you can generate dependencies and recommendations (almost) at will.  If you don't specify any, then 'x' and 'console' are used, generating xine-x:Depends and
       xine-console:Depends.

EXAMPLES
       dh_xine is usually called indirectly in a rules file via the dh command.

               %:
                       dh --with xine $@

       It can also be called directly, prior to calling dh_gencontrol.

CONFORMS TO
       Debian policy, version 3.8.1

SEE ALSO
