NAME
       mlpost - wrapper around OCaml and Metapost for the Mlpost library

SYNOPSIS
       mlpost [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       mlpost is a program that compiles OCaml files to PostScript or PDF files using the Mlpost library.

OPTIONS
       -pdf   Generate .mps files (default)

       -mp    Generate .mp files

       -png   Generate .png files

       -ps    Generate .1 files

       -latex <main.tex>
              Scan the LaTeX prelude

       -eps   Generate encapsulated postscript files

       -xpdf  WYSIWYG mode using xpdf remote server (the name of the remote server is "mlpost")

       -v     Be a bit more verbose. Otherwise nothing is printed except in case of error.

       -ocamlbuild
              Use ocamlbuild to compile

       -native
              Compile to native code

       -ccopt <options>
              Pass <options> to the Ocaml compiler

       -execopt <options>
              Pass <options> to the compiled program

       -version
              Print Mlpost version and exit

       -no-magic
              Do not parse mlpost options, do not call Metapost.dump

       -depend
              output dependency lines in a format suitable for the make(1) utility

       -contrib <contrib-name>
              compile with the specified contrib

       -dumpable
              output one name of dumpable file by line. So it print all the figures which will be created by the .ml file.

       -get-include-compile {cmxa|cma|dir|file}
              output the libraries which are needed by the library Mlpost if you want not to use the mlpost tool :

                      - cmxa print the needed cmxa file (opt version)
                      - cma print the needed cma file (byte version)
                      - dir print the directories needed to be include
                      - file print the file name inside this directory without extension

       -compile-name <compile-name>
              Keep the compiled version of the .ml file and name it <compile-name>.

       -dont-execute
              Don't execute the mlfile. So mlpost generates no figures. With this option you can check that a file compile without wasting time to generate the fig‐
              ures. The options -dont-execute and -compile-name can be used in conjunction to create a program which generates some figures according to  some  com‐
              mand line options.

       -dont-clean
              Don't remove intermediates files. The metapost backend use some intermediates files which are removed without this option.

       -cairo Use the cairo backend instead of metapost

       -t1disasm
              Set the program used to decrypt PostScript Type 1 font, only with cairo (default built-in one). This option will disappear soon.

       -help, --help
              Display the list of options
