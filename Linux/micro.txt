NAME
       micro - A modern and intuitive terminal-based text editor

SYNOPSIS
       micro [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Micro  is  a  terminal-based  text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities of modern terminals. It comes as one single, batteries-in‐
       cluded, static binary with no dependencies.

       As the name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch, but micro also aims to be enjoyable to use full  time,  whether  you
       work in the terminal because you prefer it (like me), or because you need to (over ssh).

       Use Ctrl-q to quit, Ctrl-s to save, and Ctrl-g to open the in-editor help menu.

               Set `option` to `value` for this session For example: `micro -syntax off file.c`

CONFIGURATION
       Micro  uses  $MICRO_CONFIG_HOME  as the configuration directory.  If this environment variable is not set, it uses $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/micro instead.  If that environment variable is not set, it uses
       ~/.config/micro as the configuration directory.  In the documentation, we use ~/.config/micro to refer to the configuration directory (even if it may in fact be somewhere else if you have set  ei‐
       ther of the above environment variables).

NOTICE

       cro. Micro tells you what key combination to press to get help in the lower right.
