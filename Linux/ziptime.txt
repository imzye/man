NAME
       ziptime - zip timestamp tool

SYNOPSIS
       To normalize the timestamps in the Zip header:

       ziptime file.zip

       where file.zip is an existing Zip archive to rewrite.

DESCRIPTION
       This  tools  replaces the timestamps in the zip headers with a static time (Jan 1 2008).  The extra fields are not changed, so you'll need to use the -X option to zip so that it doesn't create the
       `universal time' extra.
