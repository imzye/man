NAME
       runtest - DejaGnu test driver

SYNOPSIS
       runtest [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       DejaGnu is a framework for testing programs using Expect.  runtest is the driver program for DejaGnu.  It controls what tests to run and how to run them.

OPTIONS
       --all, -a
              Output all test results. By default, only unexpected results are displayed.

       --build TRIPLET
              The configuration TRIPLET for the build system.

       --debug
              Turn on Expect internal debugging output. The output is logged to a file called dbg.log.

       --directory DIRECTORY
              Run only tests in the specified DIRECTORY.

       --global_init NAME
              The NAME to use for the global init file in libdir.  The default is site.exp if this option is not given.

       --help Prints a usage message and then exits.

       --host TRIPLET
              The configuration TRIPLET for the host system.

       --host_board NAME
              The host board definition to use.

       --ignore test1.exp test2.exp ...
              Do not run the specified tests.

       --local_init NAME
              The NAME to use for the testsuite local init file in both the current directory and objdir.  The default is site.exp if this option is not given.

       --log_dialog
              Emit Expect output to standard output.

       --mail ´name1 name2 ...´
              Electronic mail addresses to receive test results.

       --objdir PATH
              PATH is a directory containing compiled test code.

       --outdir DIRECTORY
              The name of a DIRECTORY for test log output.

       --reboot
              Reboot the target board when runtest initializes (if supported).

       --srcdir PATH
              PATH is a directory containing test directories.

       --strace N
              Turns on Expect internal tracing to N levels deep. The output is logged to a file called dbg.log.

       --target TRIPLET
              The configuration TRIPLET for the target.

       --target_board NAME
              A list of target board NAMEs to run tests on.

       --tool TOOLNAME
              Specify the tool to be tested.  TOOLNAME controls the test suite applied, and the associated initialization module.

       --tool_exec PATH
              Specify the PATH to the executable to test.

       --tool_opts OPTIONS
              Additional OPTIONS to pass to the tool.

       -v, --verbose
              Turns on more debugging output from test cases and DejaGnu utility code.  Use more than once to increase output further.

       -V, --version
              Prints out the versions of DejaGnu, Expect and Tcl.

       -x, --xml
              Generate XML output.  The output file is named after the tool with an .xml extension.

       -D[number]
              Activate the Tcl debugger.  number can be either 1 or 0. If it is 1, then the Expect shell will break when it starts to run. The interrupt key will cause DejaGnu to drop to the debugger prompt.
              If it is 0, DejaGnu starts as usual, but Control-C drops to the debugger prompt.

       Any file name on the command line is assumed to be a subset of the
       test names to run.  Usually these are the names of the test scripts (eg. foo.exp).

       Makefile-style variables are used to specify tool names and their flags; these and other configuration dependent values are saved in the file site.exp, created during configuration.

   Exit status:
       0      if all tests passed including expected failures and unsupported tests,

       1      if any test failed, passed unexpectedly, or was unresolved,

       2      if Expect encountered any error in the test scripts.
