NAME
       yices-smt - the Yices SMT solver for the SMT-LIB 1.2 language

SYNOPSIS
       yices-smt [ options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Runs the Yices SMT solver on an input problem written in SMT-LIB 1.2.  If no file is given, the problem is read from standard input.

       SMT-LIB 1.2 is the old version of the SMT-LIB language. It was replaced by SMT-LIB 2.0 in 2012.

OPTIONS
       --version, -V
              Display version and exit.

       --help, -h
              Display a short help summary.

       --model, -m
              Print a model (on stdout) if the problem is satisfiable (some variables may be eliminated).

       --full-model, -f
              Print a full model if the problem is satisfiable. This gives more details than option --model.

       --verbose, -v
              Print statistics and other data during the search.

       --stats, -s
              Print a statistics summary at the end of the search.

       --timeout=timeout,-t timeout
              Give a timeout in seconds. There is no timeout by default.
