NAME
       dh_octave_check - automatically run an Octave-Forge package test suite

SYNOPSIS
       dh_octave_check

DESCRIPTION
       dh_octave_check performs the automated tests present in both *.m and C++ files in the sub-directories of the current directory, which should be the top-level source directory of an Octave add-on
       package.  It also runs the script debian/check.m, if it exists.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Some aspects of the execution of dh_octave_check can be controlled through the environment variables listed below.  These variables can also be set in file "debian/checkvars", which is sourced by
       dh_octave_check.

       DH_OCTAVE_EXCLUDE_TEST
           A space-separated list with the the names of the files whose unit tests should not be run.

       DH_OCTAVE_TEST_OPT
           The optional second argument for Octave’s test function.  Allowed values are "quiet", "normal", and "verbose".

       DH_OCTAVE_TEST_ENV
           Prefix  for calling the Octave command.  It can be used for setting environment variables to Sensible values (for instance "LD_PRELOAD=") and specifying another program under which Octave must
           be run (like "xvfb-run").

       octave
           Name of the Octave binary to run (defaults to "octave-cli").

       octave_options
           Command line options for Octave (defaults to "--no-history --silent --no-init-file --no-window-system").

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7), dh(1), dh_octave_substvar(1), dh_octave_clean(1), dh_octave_version(1), dh_octave_changelogs(1), dh_octave_examples(1)

       This program is meant to be used together with debhelper for Debian packages derived from Octave-Forge packages.  It is recommended to enable it by adding the dh-sequence-octave virtual package to
       Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Arch or Build-Depends-Indep.  This is equivalent to adding dh-octave to the same field and adding --with=octave to the dh sequencer in debian/rules, except  that  only
       -arch/-indep/profiled builds are affected.  This is also slightly more simple in the most common case.
