NAME
       Crypt::GCrypt::MPI - Perl interface to multi-precision integers from the GNU Cryptographic library

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::GCrypt::MPI;

         my $mpi = Crypt::GCrypt::MPI->new();

ABSTRACT
       Crypt::GCrypt::MPI provides an object interface to multi-precision integers from the C libgcrypt library.

BASIC OPERATIONS
   new()
       Create a new multi-precision integer.

         my $mpi = Crypt::GCrypt::MPI::new(
           secure => 1,
           value => 20,
         );

       No parameters are required.  If only one parameter is given, it is treated as the "value" parameter.  Available parameters:

       value
           The initial value of the MPI.  This can be an integer, a string, or another Crypt::GCrypt::MPI.  (It would also be nice to be able to initialize it with a Math::Int).

       secure
           If this parameter evaluates to non-zero, initialize the MPI using secure memory, if possible.

       format
           If the value is a string, the format parameter suggests how to convert the string.  See CONVERSION FORMATS for the available formats.  Defaults to Crypt::GCrypt::MPI::FMT_STD.

   set()
       Copies the value of the other Crypt::GCrypt::MPI object.

         $mpi->set($othermpi);

   swap()
       Exchanges the value with the value of another Crypt::GCrpyt::MPI object:

         $mpi->swap($othermpi);

   is_secure()
       Returns true if the Crypt::GCrypt::MPI uses secure memory, where possible.

   cmp($other)
       Compares this object against another Crypt::GCrypt::MPI object, returning 0 if the two values are equal, positive if this value is greater, negative if $other is greater.

   mutually_prime($other)
       Compares this object against another Crypt::GCrypt::MPI object, returning true only if the two values share no factors in common other than 1.

   copy()
       Returns  a  new  Crypt::GCrypt::MPI  object, with the contents identical to this one.  This is different from using the assignment operator (=), which just makes two references to the same object.
       For example:

        $b = new Crypt::GCrypt::MPI(15);
        $a = $b;
        $b->add(1); # $a points to the same object,
                    # so both $a and $b contain 16.

        $a = $b->copy(); # $a and $b are both 16, but
                         # different objects; no risk of
                         # double-free.
        $b->add(1); # $a == 16, $b == 17

       If $b is a Crypt::GCrypt::MPI object, then "$a = $b->copy();" is identical to "$a = Crypt::GCrypt::MPI->new($b);"

CALCULATIONS
       All calculation operations modify the object they are called on, and return the same object, so you can chain them like this:

        $g->addm($a, $m)->mulm($b, $m)->gcd($x);

       If you don't want an operation to affect the initial object, use the copy() operator:

        $h = $g->copy()->addm($a, $m)->mulm($b, $m)->gcd($x);

   add($other)
       Adds the value of $other to this MPI.

   addm($other, $modulus)
       Adds the value of $other to this MPI, modulo the value of $modulus.

   sub($other)
       Subtracts the value of $other from this MPI.

   subm($other, $modulus)
       Subtracts the value of $other from this MPI, modulo the value of $modulus.

   mul($other)
       Multiply this MPI by the value of $other.

   mulm($other, $modulus)
       Multiply this MPI by the value of $other, modulo the value of $modulus.

   mul_2exp($e)
       Multiply this MPI by 2 raised to the power of $e (this is a leftward bitshift)

   div($other)
       Divide this MPI by the value of $other, leaving the integer quotient.  (This is integer division)

   mod($other)
       Divide this MPI by the value of $other, leaving the integer remainder.  (This is the modulus operation)

   powm($other, $modulus)
       Raise this MPI to the power of $other, modulo the value of $modulus.

   invm($modulus)
       Find the multiplicative inverse of this MPI, modulo $modulus.

   gcd($other)
       Find the greatest common divisor of this MPI and $other.

OUTPUT AND DEBUGGING
   dump()
       Send the MPI to the libgcrypt debugging stream.

   print($format)
       Return a string with the data of this MPI, in a given format.  See CONVERSION FORMATS for the available formats.

CONVERSION FORMATS
       The available printing and scanning formats are all in the Crypt::GCrypt::MPI namespace, and have the same meanings as in gcrypt.

   FMT_STD
       Two's complement representation.

   FMT_PGP
       Same as FMT_STD, but with two-byte length header, as used in OpenPGP.  (Only works for non-negative values)

   FMT_SSH
       Same as FMT_STD, but with four-byte length header, as used by OpenSSH.

   FMT_HEX
       Hexadecimal string in ASCII.

   FMT_USG
       Simple unsigned integer.

BUGS AND FEEDBACK
       Crypt::GCrypt::MPI does not currently auto-convert to and from Math::BigInt objects, even though it should.

       Other than that, here are no known bugs. You are very welcome to write mail to the maintainer (aar@cpan.org) with your contributions, comments, suggestions, bug reports or complaints.
