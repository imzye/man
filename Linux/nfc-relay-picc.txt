NAME
       nfc-relay-picc - Relay demonstration tool for ISO14443-4

SYNOPSIS
       nfc-relay-picc

DESCRIPTION
       nfc-relay-picc

       This  tool  requires  two NFC devices. One device (configured as target) will emulate an ISO/IEC 14443-4 type A tag, while the second device (configured as initiator) will act as a reader. The genuine
       tag can be placed on the second device (initiator) and the tag emulator (target) can be placed close to the original reader. All communication is now relayed and shown in the screen on real-time.

       tag <---> initiator (relay) <---> target (relay) <---> original reader

OPTIONS
       -h
           Help
           List options

       -q
           Quiet mode
           Suppress printing of relayed data (improves timing)

       -t
           Target mode only (to be used on reader side)
           Commands are sent to file descriptor 4
           Responses are read from file descriptor 3

       -i
           Initiator mode only (to be used on tag side)
           Commands are read from file descriptor 3
           Responses are sent to file descriptor 4

       -s
           Swap roles of found devices
           Usually the first found device is used as target (emulator) and the second
           as initiator (reader). Using this option these roles are inversed.

       -n N
           Adds a waiting time of N seconds (integer) in the loop

EXAMPLES
       Basic usage:

         nfc-relay-picc

       Remote relay over TCP/IP:

         socat
           TCP-LISTEN:port,reuseaddr
           "EXEC:nfc-relay-picc -i,fdin=3,fdout=4"
         socat
           TCP:remotehost:port
           "EXEC:nfc-relay-picc -t,fdin=3,fdout=4"

NOTES
       There are some differences with nfc-relay:

       This example only works with PN532 because it relies on its internal handling of ISO14443-4 specificities.

       Thanks to this internal handling & injection of WTX frames, this example works on readers very strict on timing.
