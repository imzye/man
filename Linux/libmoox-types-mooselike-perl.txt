MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base(3pm)                                                   User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                   MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base(3pm)

NAME
       MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base - A set of basic Moose-like types for Moo

SYNOPSIS
         package MyPackage;
         use Moo;
         use MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base qw(:all);

         has "beers_by_day_of_week" => (
             isa => HashRef
         );

         has "current_BAC" => (
             isa => Num
         );

         # Also supporting is_$type.  For example, is_Int() can be used as follows
         has 'legal_age' => (
             is => 'ro',
             isa => sub { die "$_[0] is not of legal age"
                          unless (is_Int($_[0]) && $_[0] > 17) },
         );

DESCRIPTION
       Moo attributes (like Moose) have an 'isa' property.  This module provides some basic types for this property.  One can import all types with ':all' tag or import a list of types like:

         use MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base qw/HashRef ArrayRef/;

       so one could then declare some attributes like:

         has 'contact' => (
           is => 'ro',
           isa => HashRef,
         );
         has 'guest_list' => (
           is => 'ro',
           isa => ArrayRef[HashRef],
         );

       These types provide a check that the contact attribute is a "hash" reference, and that the guest_list is an "array of hash" references.

   Value
       A non-reference type

   Ref

   Int
       An integer type

   ArrayRef
       An ArrayRef (ARRAY) type

   HashRef
       A HashRef (HASH) type

   CodeRef
       A CodeRef (CODE) type

   RegexpRef
       A regular expression reference type

   GlobRef
       A glob reference type

   FileHandle
       A type that is either a builtin perl filehandle or an IO::Handle object

   Object
       A type that is an object (think blessed)

PARAMETERIZED TYPES
   Parameterizing Types With a Single Type
       The following types can be parameterized with other types.

       ArrayRef

       For example, ArrayRef[HashRef]

       HashRef

       ScalarRef

       Maybe

       For example, Maybe[Int] would be an integer or undef

   Parameterizing Types With Multiple Types
       AnyOf

       Check if the attribute is any of the listed types (think union).  Takes a list of types as the argument, for example:

         isa => AnyOf[Int, ArrayRef[Int], HashRef[Int]]

       Note: AnyOf is passed an ArrayRef[CodeRef]

       AllOf

       Check if the attribute is all of the listed types (think intersection).  Takes a list of types as the argument. For example:

         isa => AllOf[
           InstanceOf['Human'],
           ConsumerOf['Air'],
           HasMethods['breath', 'dance']
         ],

   Parameterizing Types With (Multiple) Strings
       In addition, we have some parameterized types that take string arguments.

       InstanceOf

       Check if the attribute is an object instance of one or more classes.  Uses "blessed" and "isa" to do so.  Takes a list of class names as the argument. For example:

         isa => InstanceOf['MyClass','MyOtherClass']

       Note: InstanceOf is passed an ArrayRef[Str]

       ConsumerOf

       Check if the attribute is blessed and consumes one or more roles.  Uses "blessed" and "does" to do so.  Takes a list of role names as the arguments. For example:

         isa => ConsumerOf['My::Role', 'My::AnotherRole']

       HasMethods

       Check if the attribute is blessed and has one or more methods.  Uses "blessed" and "can" to do so.  Takes a list of method names as the arguments. For example:

         isa => HasMethods[qw/postulate contemplate liberate/]

       Enum

       Check if the attribute is one of the enumerated strings.  Takes a list of possible string values. For example:

         isa => Enum['rock', 'spock', 'paper', 'lizard', 'scissors']
