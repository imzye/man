NAME
       lttng-crash - Recover and view LTTng 2 trace buffers in the event of a crash

SYNOPSIS
       lttng-crash [--extract=PATH | --viewer=VIEWER] [-v | -vv | -vvv] SHMDIR

DESCRIPTION
       The Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation <https://lttng.org/> is an open source software package used for correlated tracing of the Linux kernel, user applications, and user libraries.

       LTTng consists of Linux kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing) and dynamically loaded libraries (for user application and library tracing).

       The lttng-crash command-line tool is used to recover and view LTTng trace buffers in the event of a system crash.

       lttng-crash reads files within the directory SHMDIR and does one of:

       Without the --extract option
           Launches a trace reader (see the --viewer option) to view the recovered traces.

       With the --extract option
           Extracts them as uncorrupted LTTng traces on the file system.

       SHMDIR is the directory specified as the argument of the --shm-path option of the lttng-create(1) command used to create the tracing session for which to recover the traces.

OPTIONS
       -x PATH, --extract=PATH
           Extract recovered traces to path PATH; do not execute the trace viewer.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity.

           Three levels of verbosity are available, which are triggered by appending additional v letters to the option (that is, -vv and -vvv).

       -e VIEWER, --viewer=VIEWER
           Use trace viewer VIEWER to view the trace buffers.  VIEWER is the absolute path to the viewer command to use, and it can contain command arguments as well. The trace directory paths are passed to
           the VIEWER command as its last arguments.

           Without this option, lttng crash uses babeltrace2(1) if it’s available. Otherwise, it tries to use babeltrace(1).

   Program information
       -h, --help
           Show help.

       -V, --version
           Show version.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           Success

       1
           Error

       3
           Fatal error
