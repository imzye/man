NAME
       pnginfo - display information on the PNG files named

SYNOPSIS
       pnginfo [-t] [-d] [-D] <filenames>

DESCRIPTION
       This command dumps information about the PNG files named on the command line. This command's output is based on the output of the tiffinfo command, which is part of the libtiff distribution. Each line
       output by the command represents a value that has been set within the PNG file.

       The -t command line option forces pnginfo to use libtiff tiffinfo style lables, instead of the more relevant png names. The -d command line option dumps the bitmap contained by the image  to  standard
       out, whilst the -D command merely checks that the image bitmap could be extracted from the file. If nothing is reported by -D, then there was no error.

       The format for the output bitmaps is hexadecimal, with each pixel presented as a triple -- for instance [red green blue]. This means that paletted images et cetera will have their bitmaps expanded be‐
       fore display.

RETURNS
       Nothing.
