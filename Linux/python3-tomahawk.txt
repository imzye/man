NAME
       tomahawk3 - enables to execute a command to many hosts

SYNOPSIS
       tomahawk3 [options] command

DESCRIPTION
       tomahawk3 is a program that enables to execute a command into many hosts.

          $ tomahawk3 -h host1,host2,host3 uptime

       ---> 'uptime' command will be executed in host1, host2, and host3 with following output.

          oinume@host1 % uptime
          22:41:27 up 10 days,  3:26,  1 users,  load average: 1.11, 1.13, 1.11

          oinume@host2 % uptime
          22:41:28 up 20 days,  4:26,  2 users,  load average: 2.11, 2.13, 2.11

          oinume@host3 % uptime
          22:41:29 up 30 days,  5:26,  3 users,  load average: 3.11, 3.13, 3.11

   ssh
       tomahawk3 executes a command via 'ssh'. You can specify options for ssh with -o/--ssh-options and can configure ssh behavior with $HOME/.ssh/config.

   hosts file
       -h option enables you to specify hosts, another option '-f', which is specifying hosts files.  hosts file is listing host names like this

          host1
          host2
          host3
          #host4

       Starting with "#" means commenting the host out.

   shell operators
       tomahawk3 executes commands via shell(/bin/sh), so you can use '|' (pipe), '&&', '||' operators and so on.

          $ tomahawk3 -h host1,host2 'ps auxww | grep python'

OPTIONS
       These  programs  follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ('--').  A summary of options is included below.  For a
       complete description, see the Info files.

   -H, --hosts
       Specifies host names for sending commands. You can specify multiple hosts with ','.

   -f, --hosts-files
       Specifies hosts files which listed host names for sending commands.  You can specify multiple hosts files with ','.

       Format of hosts file is below.

          web01
          web02
          #web03
          web04

       A line of starting with '#' disables a host.

   -l, --prompt-login-password
       Prompts a password for ssh authentication at first. If the password is all the same between target hosts, you'll input a password just once.

   --login-password-stdin
       Read a SSH password from stdin instead of prompting.

   -s, --prompt-sudo-password
       Prompts a password for sudo.

   -c, --continue-on-error
       Continues to send commands even if any errors.  The default behavior is fail-safe, means that tomahawk3 will stop if any errors.

   -p, --parallel
       Specifies a number of processes for parallel command execution. (default: 1) If your machine has multiple cpu cores, --parallel 2 .. N might be faster.

   -t, --timeout
       Specifies timeout seconds for a command.

   -u, --ssh-user
       Specifies ssh user. The default is a current logged in user.

   -o, --ssh-options
       Specifies ssh options.

   -F, --output-format
       Specifies command output format.  The default is '${user}@${host} % ${command}\n${output}\n'

   -V, --verify-output
       Verify command output of all hosts.  For additional information, see checking-files-on-remote-hosts

   -C, --conf
       Specifies configuration file path. For additional information, see omit-command-line-options

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       tomahawk's behavior is affected by the following environment variables.

   TOMAHAWK_ENV
       This variable specifies an environment of 'production', 'testing' or 'development'. If TOMAHAWK_ENV=production specified, tomahawk3 or tomahawk-rsync3 prompt
       as "command "%s" will be executed %s hosts. Are you sure? [yes/NO]: ". The environment variable exists for mis-execution of a command.
