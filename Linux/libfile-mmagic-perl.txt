NAME
       File::MMagic - Guess file type

SYNOPSIS
         use File::MMagic;
         use FileHandle;

         $mm = new File::MMagic; # use internal magic file
         # $mm = File::MMagic->new('/etc/magic'); # use external magic file
         # $mm = File::MMagic->new('/usr/share/etc/magic'); # if you use Debian
         $res = $mm->checktype_filename("/somewhere/unknown/file");

         $fh = new FileHandle "< /somewhere/unknown/file2";
         $res = $mm->checktype_filehandle($fh);

         $fh->read($data, 0x8564);
         $res = $mm->checktype_contents($data);

ABSTRACT
       This perl library uses perl5 objects to guess file type from filename and/or filehandle.

DESCRIPTION
       checktype_filename(), checktype_filehandle() and checktype_contents returns string contains file type with MIME mediatype format.

METHODS
       File::MMagic->new()
       File::MMagic->new( $filename )
           Initializes the module. If no filename is given, the magic numbers stored in File::MMagic are used.

       $mm->addSpecials
           If  a  filetype  cannot  be  determined  by  magic  numbers,  extra checks are done based on extra regular expressions which can be defined here. The first argument should be the filetype, the
           remaining arguments should be one or more regular expressions.

           By default, checks are done for message/news, message/rfc822, text/html, text/x-roff.

       $mm->removeSpecials
           Removes special regular expressions. Specify one or more filetypes. If no filetypes are specified, all special regexps are removed.

           Returns a hash containing the removed entries.

       $mm->addFileExts
           If a filetype cannot be determined by magic numbers, extra checks can be done based on the file extension (actually, a regexp). Two arguments should be geiven: the  filename  pattern  and  the
           corresponding filetype.

           By default, checks are done for application/x-compress, application/x-bzip2, application/x-gzip, text/html, text/plain

       $mm->removeFileExts
           Remove filename pattern checks. Specify one or more patterns. If no pattern is specified, all are removed.

           Returns a hash containing the removed entries.

       $mm->addMagicEntry
           Add a new magic entry in the object. The format is same as magic(5) file.

             Ex.
             # Add a entry
             $mm->addMagicEntry("0\tstring\tabc\ttext/abc");
             # Add a entry with a sub entry
             $mm->addMagicEntry("0\tstring\tdef\t");
             $mm->addMagicEntry(">10\tstring\tghi\ttext/ghi");

       $mm->readMagicHandle
       $mm->checktype_filename
       $mm->checktype_magic
       $mm->checktype_contents

       I read some of Ian F. Darwin's BSD C implementation, to try to determine how some of this was done since the specification is a little vague.  I don't believe  that  this  perl  version  could  be
       construed as an "altered version", but I did grab the tokens for identifying the hard-coded file types in names.h and copied some of the man page.
