NAME
       jsondiff-jdiff - Compare JSON and JSON-like structures

SYNOPSIS
       jsondiff-jdiff [-s SYNTAX] [-i N] base-file target-file
       jsondiff-jdiff [-s SYNTAX] [-i N] --patch base-file patch-file
       jsondiff-jdiff -h

DESCRIPTION
       Compares two JSON files and returns a JSON representation of the differences between them.

       Differences are represented according to the specified syntax and can be pretty-printed using a specified indentation.

       The --patch option can be used to instead apply the changes described by a JSON diff to a JSON file.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       base-file
              The first JSON file to compare. This is the source or base file.

       target-file
              The second JSON file to compare. This is the target or comparison file.

       patch-file
              The jsondiff patch file to apply. Only used with --patch.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show a help message and exit.

       -p, --patch
              Instead of producing a difference file, apply the differences from the second file to the first file.

       -s SYNTAX, --syntax SYNTAX
              Define the output syntax. The available options are "compact", "symmetric", and "explicit". The default is "compact".

       -i INDENT, --indent INDENT
              Set the number of spaces for indentation in the output JSON. By default, no indentation is applied to the output JSON.
