NAME
       pgcenter - is the PostgreSQL administration console with top-like monitoring.

SYNOPSIS
       pgcenter [OPTION]... [DBNAME [USERNAME]]

DESCRIPTION
       PostgreSQL  provides  various statistics which includes information about tables, indexes, functions and other database objects and their usage. Moreover, statistics has information about connections,
       current queries and database operations (INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE). But most of this statistics are provided as permanently incremented counters. The pgcenter provides convenient interface to this statis‐
       tics  and  allow  viewing  statistics changes in time interval, eg. per second. The pgcenter provides fast access for database management task, such as editing configuration files, reloading services,
       viewing log files and canceling or terminating database backends (by pid or using state mask). However if need execute some specific operations, pgcenter can start psql session for this purposes.

       The pgcenter uses screens and contexts.  Screen is a special area for displaying statistics. Number of screen limited by eight. Context is the type of displayed  statistics:  table  statistics,  index
       statistics, functions statistics, replication statistics, etc.

       All operations in pgcenter realized through hotkeys.

       When  pgcenter starts it using the connection parameters transmitted directly through the arguments, or use a connection file that describes the connections options. For each connection is allocated a
       separate screen. When the arguments and connections file used together, connect options from arguments always starts in the firts screen. If the arguments or connections file is not specified,  pgcen‐
       ter use default connection settings.

       The pgcenter main window divided into 3 window: SUMMARY, CMDLINE, DBRESULT and optional LOGTAIL window which hidden by default and appears only by user command.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       The command-line syntax for pgcenter consists of:

       -h, --host=HOSTNAME
              PostgreSQL server host or socket directory (default: "/tmp").

       -p, --port=PORT
              PostgreSQL server port (default: "5432").

       -d, --dbname=DBNAME
              PostgreSQL administrative database name (default: "pgbouncer").

       -f, --file=FILENAME
              Use connections information from file. By default, pgcenter when starting, trying read ~/.pgcenterrc connections file. This behaviour can be overriden with this option.

       -w, --no-password
              Never prompt for password.

       -W, --password
              Force password prompt (should happen automatically).

       -V, --version
              Print version, then exit.

       pg_stat_indexes context
              Show statistics from pg_stat_user_indexes and pg_statio_user_indexes (or pg_stat_all_indexes and pg_statio_all_indexes).  The pg_stat_user_indexes view will contain one row for  each  index  in
              the  current  database,  showing  statistics  about accesses to that specific index.  pg_statio_user_indexes view will contain one row for each index in the current database, showing statistics
              about I/O on that specific index.

              Note: Indexes can be used via either simple index scans or "bitmap" index scans. In a bitmap scan the output of several indexes can be combined via AND or OR rules, so it is difficult to  asso‐
              ciate  individual heap row fetches with specific indexes when a bitmap scan is used. Therefore, a bitmap scan increments the pg_stat_all_indexes.idx_tup_read count(s) for the index(es) it uses,
              and it increments the pg_stat_all_tables.idx_tup_fetch count for the table, but it does not affect pg_stat_all_indexes.idx_tup_fetch.  The idx_tup_read and idx_tup_fetch counts can be different
              even  without any use of bitmap scans, because idx_tup_read counts index entries retrieved from the index while idx_tup_fetch counts live rows fetched from the table. The latter will be less if
              any dead or not-yet-committed rows are fetched using the index, or if any heap fetches are avoided by means of an index-only scan.

              datname
                     Database name where vacuum worker is connected.

              state
                     Postgres backend state (see pg_stat_activity backends states).

              phase
                     Current processing phase of vacuum. See VACUUM phases - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/progress-reporting.html#VACUUM-PHASES.

              total
                     Total size of the table in Kbytes. This number is reported as of the beginning of the scan; size increased during vacuum will not be (and need not be) shown and this space  will  not  be
                     visited by this VACUUM.

              scanned
                     Size  of table in Kbytes that is scanned. Because the visibility map is used to optimize scans, some blocks will be skipped without inspection; skipped blocks are included in this total,
                     so that this number will eventually become equal to total when the vacuum is complete. This counter only advances when the phase is scanning heap.

              vacuumed
                     Size of table in Kbytes that is vacuumed. Unless the table has no indexes, this counter only advances when the phase is vacuuming heap. Blocks that contain no dead tuples are skipped, so
                     the counter may sometimes skip forward in large increments.

              wait_etype
                     The type of event for which the backend is waiting, if any; otherwise NULL.

              wait_event
                     Wait event name if backend is currently waiting, otherwise NULL.

              query
                     Text of a representative statement.

SUBSCREENS

              privileges.

       iostat subscreen
              Report input/output statistics for devices and partitions. The iostat subscreen is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by observing the time the devices are active  in  rela‐
              tion  to their average transfer rates. The first report generated by the iostat subscreen provides statistics concerning the time since the system was booted.  Each subsequent report covers the
              time since the previous report. Iostat subscreen similar to iostat utility from sysstat package and /proc/diskstats interface. For the proper iostat work /proc filesystem must  be  mounted  for
              iostat to work. Kernels older than 2.6.x are not supported.

                     The average time (in milliseconds) for write requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

              %util
                     Percentage  of  elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100% for de‐
                     vices serving requests serially.  But for devices serving requests in parallel, such as RAID arrays and modern SSDs, this number does not reflect their performance limits.

              waiting
                     Backends which are currently waiting on a lock. Long waiting transactions or statements are bad.
                     Used condition: WHERE waiting AND (
                                         (clock_timestamp() - xact_start) > '00:00:10.0'::interval

              A ten seconds interval used in condition determines query or transaction age and can be overriden with A hotkey.

              Note, waiting is not a backend state. If a backend is in the active state, it may or may not be waiting. If the state is active and waiting is true, it means that a query is being executed, but
              is being blocked by a lock somewhere in the system. Therefore, if waiting added to the mask, all waiting queries will be canceled ot terminated independently of his backends states.

          m  :Display current mask toggle
              Show current mask which will used for group cancel/terminate.

              Reset PostgreSQL stats counters for the current database to zero. The pg_stat_statements counters also reseted. Requires database superuser privileges.

          G  :Get query report toggle
              Show query report with various information about specified query. This function work only in pg_stat_statements_timing and pg_stat_statements_general screens. For specifying query use id values
              from queryid column.

          z  :Change refresh interval toggle
              You will be prompted to enter the delay time, in seconds, between display updates. Can not be less that 1 second.

          Z  :Change Color Mapping toggle
