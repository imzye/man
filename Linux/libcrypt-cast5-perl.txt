NAME
       Crypt::CAST5 - CAST5 block cipher

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::CBC;

           my $crypt = Crypt::CBC->new({
               key    => "secret key",
               cipher => "CAST5",
           });

           my $message = "All mimsy were the borogoves";
           my $ciphertext = $crypt->encrypt($message);
           print unpack("H*", $ciphertext), "\n";

           my $plaintext = $crypt->decrypt($ciphertext);
           print $plaintext, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an implementation of the CAST5 block cipher using compiled C code for increased speed. CAST5 is also known as CAST-128. It is a product of the CAST design procedure developed
       by C. Adams and S. Tavares.

       The CAST5 cipher is available royalty-free.

FUNCTIONS
   blocksize
       Returns the CAST5 block size, which is 8 bytes. This function exists so that Crypt::CAST5 can work with Crypt::CBC.

   keysize
       Returns the maximum CAST5 key size, 16 bytes.

   new
           $cast5 = Crypt::CAST5->new($key);

       Create a new encryption object. If the optional key parameter is given, it will be passed to the init() function.

   init
           $cast5->init($key);

       Set or change the encryption key to be used. The key must be from 40 bits (5 bytes) to 128 bits (16 bytes) in length. Note that if the key used is 80 bits or less, encryption and decryption will
       be somewhat faster.

       It is best for the key to be random binary data, not something printable like a password. A message digest function may be useful for converting a password to an encryption key; see Digest::SHA1
       or Digest::MD5.  Note that Crypt::CBC runs the given "key" through MD5 to get the actual encryption key.

   encrypt
           $ciphertext = $cast5->encrypt($plaintext);

       Encrypt a block of plaintext using the current encryption key, and return the corresponding ciphertext. The input must be 8 bytes long, and the output has the same length. Note that the encryption
       is in ECB mode, which means that it encrypts each block independently. That can leave you vulnerable to dictionary attacks, so it is generally best to use some form of chaining between blocks; see
       Crypt::CBC.

   decrypt
           $plaintext = $cast5->decrypt($ciphertext);

       Decrypt the ciphertext and return the corresponding plaintext.
