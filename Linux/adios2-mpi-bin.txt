NAME
       adios2_reorganize.mpi - ADIOS2 utility

SYNOPSIS
       adios_reorganize input output rmethod "params" wmethod "params" <decomposition>

DESCRIPTION
       input  Input stream path

       output Output file path

              rmethod ADIOS method to read with

              Supported read methods: BPFile, HDF5, SST, SSC, DataMan

       params Read method parameters (in quotes; comma-separated list)

              wmethod ADIOS method to write with params  Write method parameters (in quotes; comma-separated list) <decomposition>    list of numbers e.g. 32 8 4

              Decomposition  values  in  each  dimension of an array The product of these number must be less then the number of processes. Processes whose rank is higher than the product, will not write
              anything.

              Arrays with less dimensions than the number of values,

              will be decomposed with using the appropriate number of values.
