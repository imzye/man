NAME
       eus - EusLisp

SYNOPSIS
       eus [start-up-files]
       euscomp [-V] [-O] [-O0123] filename ...
       eusx
       eusgl
       eusmpi

DESCRIPTION
       EusLisp  is  an object-based implementation of CommonLisp with geometric modeling facilities.  Eus is the basic and lightest euslisp.  Euscomp is the EusLisp compiler, which is symbolically linked
       to eus.  Each of eusx, eusxview and eusview has the window interface with Xlib, xview toolkit, or sunview library respectively.

FILES
       Source programs should be stored under /usr/share/src/eus on a file-server.  For each installation on many machine architectures, machine:/usr/local/eus should be provided.  Source programs can be
       referenced through symbolic links from this directory.  The name of this installation directory is held in *eusdir* variable in EusLisp and referenced by load.
