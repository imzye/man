NAME
       flydraw - an inline drawing tool

SYNOPSIS
       flydraw

DESCRIPTION
       flydraw is an inline drawing tool, which uses libgd to output PNG, JPG, GIF files.  It parse its standard input for drawing commands.  Each command takes one line.

   DRAWING COMMANDS
       In the following lines, [color] may be either a color name, or 3 integers between 0 and 255, separated by commas, for the values of red,green,blue.

       animate fra,del,rep
              This  command  is  only available for WIMS OEF and doc, and MUST appear on the first line. Set up animation for fra frames, with del seconds between frames, and rep repetitions (rep=0 means
              infinite repetition).

       animstep n
              Set up an integer which can be called in any evaluation. Used for animation. Direct use of this command must be avoided under WIMS.

              Arc segment of an ellipse of width w and hight h centered at (x,y), from angle a1 to angle a2.

       arrow x1,y1,x2,y2,l,[color]
              Arrow (x1,y1)--->(x2,y2), where l is the length (in pixels) of arrowhead.
