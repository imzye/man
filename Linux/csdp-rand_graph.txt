NAME
       csdp-rand_graph - Generate a random graph

SYNOPSIS
       csdp-rand_graph OUTPUT_FILE N P [SEED]

DESCRIPTION
       The  csdp-rand_graph  program  generates a random graph, which is written to the indicated output file.  The parameter N is the desired number of vertices.  P is the probability of an edge between any
       given pair of vertices.  SEED is used to seed the random number generator; if not provided, the value 1 is used as the seed.

FILE FORMAT
       The generated graph is written to the output file in the following format:
              n
              m
              i1 j1
              …
              im jm
       where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges, and each i/j pair describes one edge.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is zero if the graph is generated successfully.  Otherwise, the exit status is one, and an error message indicating the problem is produced on standard out.
