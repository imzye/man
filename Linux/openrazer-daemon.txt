NAME
       razer.conf - configuration file for the OpenRazer Daemon

DESCRIPTION
       The  ~/.config/openrazer/razer.conf ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME is respected, if set) file configures some startup and runtime options of the openrazer-daemon(8). openrazer-daemon(8) is able to use configu‐
       ration files specified in non-standard locations by providing the --config argument.

       The configuration file is formatted like a .INI file and is parsed by Python's ConfigParser.

EXAMPLE
       An example file should be installed under /usr/share/openrazer/razer.conf.example.

SECTIONS
   GENERAL
       The first section in the configuration file is a [General] section. This section contains miscellaneous options.

       verbose_logging bool
           This flag specifies if the daemon is to output detailed logging information. This value acts the same as if -v or --verbose was passed at the command line.

   STARTUP
       The [Startup] section in the configuration file contains values to be used during startup, for example it can decide if syncing effects will be active when started.

       sync_effects_enabled bool
           This flag specifies if the effects syncing logic is active when the daemon is started, not having to wait for the user to activate them.

       devices_off_on_screensaver bool
           This flag specifies if the functionality to turn off razer devices when the screensaver is activated is active when the daemon starts.

       battery_notifier bool
           This flag specifies that notifications should be shown regularly with the remaining battery level.

       battery_notifier_freq int
           This flag specifies how often the notification with the remaining battery level should be shown.

       battery_notifier_percent int
           This flag specifies what battery percentage the device should reach before sending notifications.

       restore_persistence bool
           This flag specifies whether effects saved in persistence.conf should be applied when the daemon starts.

       persistence_dual_boot_quirk bool
           This flag specifies whether the persisted effect is applied twice to address a quirk with newer devices that were last changed by Razer Synapse on Windows. Only applicable with restore_persis‐
           tence = True.
