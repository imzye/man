NAME
       Class::Accessor::Named - Better profiling output for Class::Accessor

SYNOPSIS
           perl -MClass::Accessor::Named your_script.pl

DESCRIPTION
       Class::Accessor is a great way to automate the tedious task of generating accessors and mutators. One small drawback is that due to the details of the implemenetation, you only get one "__ANON__"
       entry in profiling output.  That entry contains all your accessors, which can be a real pain if you're attempting to figure out which of your accessors is being called six billion times.  This
       module is a development aid which uses Hook::LexWrap and Sub::Name to talk your accessors into identifying themselves. While it shouldn't add much additional runtime overhead (as it acts only
       Class::Accessor's generator functions), it has not been designed for production deployment,

DEPENDENCIES
       This module depends on Class::Accessor, UNIVERSAL::require, Hook::LexWrap and Sub::Name

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       This module uses Hook::Lexwrap to alter the behaviour of Class::Accessor and Class::Accessor::Fast. Due to the nature of Hook::LexWrap, this will skew your profiling a tiny bit. We could probably
       do a little more internals diving and eliminate the dependency and the deficiency. Patches welcome.
