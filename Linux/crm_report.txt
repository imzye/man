NAME
       crm_report - Part of the Pacemaker cluster resource manager

SYNOPSIS
       crm_report [options] [DEST]

DESCRIPTION
       crm_report - Create archive of everything needed when reporting cluster problems

   Required option:
       -f, --from TIME
              time prior to problems beginning (as "YYYY-M-D H:M:S" including the quotes)

OPTIONS
       -V     increase verbosity (may be specified multiple times)

       -h, --help
              display this message

       -v, --version
              display software version

       --features
              display software features

       -t, --to TIME
              time at which all problems were resolved (as "YYYY-M-D H:M:S" including the quotes; default "now")

       -T, --cts TEST
              CTS test or set of tests to extract

       --cts-log
              CTS master logfile

       -n, --nodes NODES
              node names for this cluster (only needed if cluster is not active on this host; accepts -n "a b" or -n a -n b)

       -M     do not search for cluster logs

       -l, --logfile FILE
              log file to collect (in addition to detected logs if -M is not specified; may be specified multiple times)

       -p PATT
              additional regular expression to match variables to be masked in output (default: "passw.*")

       -L PATT
              additional regular expression to match in log files for analysis (default: CRIT: ERROR:)

       -S, --single-node
              don't attempt to collect data from other nodes

       -c, --cluster TYPE
              force the cluster type instead of detecting (currently only corosync is supported)

       -C, --corosync
              force the cluster type to be corosync

       -u, --user USER
              username to use when collecting data from other nodes (default root)

       -D, --max-depth
              search depth to use when attempting to locate files

       -e, --rsh
              command to use to run commands on other nodes (default ssh -T)

       -d, --as-directory
              leave result as a directory tree instead of archiving

       --sos-mode
              use defaults suitable for being called by sosreport tool (behavior subject to change and not useful to end users)

       DEST, --dest DEST
              custom destination directory or file name

       crm_report works best when run from a cluster node on a running cluster, but can be run from a stopped cluster node or a Pacemaker Remote node.

       If neither --nodes nor --single-node is given, crm_report will guess the node list, but may have trouble detecting Pacemaker Remote nodes.  Unless --single-node is given, the node names (whether spec‐
       ified by --nodes or detected automatically) must be resolvable and reachable via the command specified by -e/--rsh using the user specified by -u/--user.
