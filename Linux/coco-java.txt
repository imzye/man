NAME
       cocoj - Coco/R Compiler Generator (Java Version)

HINT
       By  default  cocoj  expects the Parser.frame and Scanner.frame file to be in the same directory as the grammar (atg-file) to translate. As the frame files are architecture independent, the default
       frame files can be found in /usr/share/coco-java/.

SEE ALSO
       See package coco-doc for documentation.
