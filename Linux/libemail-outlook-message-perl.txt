NAME
       msgconvert - Convert Outlook .msg files to mbox format

SYNOPSIS
       msgconvert [options] <file.msg>...

       msgconvert --outfile <outfile> <file.msg>

         Options:
           --mbox <file>      deliver messages to mbox file <file>
           --outfile <oufile> write message to <outfile> or - for STDOUT
           --verbose          be verbose
           --help             help message

OPTIONS
       --mbox
                   Deliver to the given mbox file instead of creating individual .eml
                   files.

       --outfile
                   Writes the message into the outfile instead of individual .eml files. For
                   STDOUT "-" can be used as outfile. This option cannot be used together with
                   multiple <file.msg> instances.

       --verbose
                   Print information about skipped parts of the .msg file.

       --help
                   Print a brief help message.

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  will  convert  the messages contained in the Microsoft Outlook files <file.msg>...  to message/rfc822 files with extension .eml.  Alternatively, if the --mbox option is present, all
       messages will be put in the given mbox file.  This program will complain about unrecognized OLE parts in the input files on stderr.

BUGS
       The program will not check whether output files already exist. Also, if you feed it "foo.MSG" and "foo.msg", you'll end up with one "foo.eml", containing one of the messages.

       Not all data that's in the .MSG file is converted. There simply are some parts whose meaning escapes me. One of these must contain the date the message was sent, for example.  Formatting  of  text
       messages will also be lost. YMMV.
