FILES
       translate's preferred language and is stored in /etc/translate.conf. You can store your private configuration file in ~/.translate/translate.conf.  If there are no options in  the  commandline  it
       uses the default values de-en.

       It can also create a private dictionary in the ~/.translate/ directory, e.g. ~/.translate/de-en for the default language combination.
