NAME
       zdiff - decompress and compare two files line by line

SYNOPSIS
       zdiff [options] file1 [file2]

DESCRIPTION
       Zdiff  compares two files ('-' means standard input), and if they differ, shows the differences line by line. If any given file is compressed, its decompressed content is used. Zdiff is a front end to
       the diff program and has the limitation that messages from diff refer to temporary filenames instead of those specified.

       The formats supported are bzip2, gzip, lzip and xz.

       Zdiff compares file1 to file2. If file2 is omitted zdiff tries the following:

              1. If file1 is compressed, compares its decompressed contents with the corresponding uncompressed file (the name of file1 with the extension removed).

              2. If file1 is uncompressed, compares it with the decompressed contents of file1.[lz|bz2|gz|xz] (the first one that is found).

              3. If no suitable file is found, compares file1 with data read from standard input.

       Exit status is 0 if inputs are identical, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.
