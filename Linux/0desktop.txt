NAME
       0desktop — add programs to the desktop environment

SYNOPSIS
       0destkop [ URI ]

DESCRIPTION
       0desktop can be used to create launchers for 0install applications in desktop environments supporting the freedesktop.org menu specification (e.g.  GNOME and KDE).

       If the URI of a 0install application is given, this application is added.  On success, a launcher is added to the user's menu which, when invoked, runs the application using the command "0launch URI".

       Without a URI, a dialog box is displayed listing the user's current applications and allowing new ones to be added.

FILES
       ~/.local/share/applications
              Default directory in which the .desktop file for the new launcher is created.
