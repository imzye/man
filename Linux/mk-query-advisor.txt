NAME
       mk-query-advisor - Analyze queries and advise on possible problems.

SYNOPSIS
       Usage: mk-query-advisor [OPTION...] [FILE]

       mk-query-advisor analyzes queries and advises on possible problems.  Queries are given either by specifying slowlog files, --query, or --review.

          # Analyzer all queries in the given slowlog
          mk-query-advisor /path/to/slow-query.log

          # Get queries from tcpdump using mk-query-digest
          mk-query-digest --type tcpdump.txt --print --no-report | mk-query-advisor

          # Get queries from a general log
          mk-query-advisor --type genlog mysql.log

RISKS
       The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks, whether known or unknown, of using this tool.  The two main categories of risks are those created by the nature of the tool
       (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write tools) and those created by bugs.

       mk-query-advisor simply reads queries and examines them, and is thus very low risk.

       At the time of this release there is a bug that may cause an infinite (or very long) loop when parsing very large queries.

       The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue tracking system.  Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.  You can see a list of such issues at the following
       URL: <http://www.maatkit.org/bugs/mk-query-advisor>.

       See also "BUGS" for more information on filing bugs and getting help.

DESCRIPTION
       mk-query-advisor examines queries and applies rules to them, trying to find queries that look bad according to the rules.  It reports on queries that match the rules, so you can find bad practices or
       hidden problems in your SQL.  By default, it accepts a MySQL slow query log as input.

RULES
       These are the rules that mk-query-advisor will apply to the queries it examines.  Each rule has three bits of information: an ID, a severity and a description.

       The rule's ID is its identifier.  We use a seven-character ID, and the naming convention is three characters, a period, and a three-digit number.  The first three characters are sort of an
       abbreviation of the general class of the rule.  For example, ALI.001 is some rule related to how the query uses aliases.

       The rule's severity is an indication of how important it is that this rule matched a query.  We use NOTE, WARN, and CRIT to denote these levels.

       The rule's description is a textual, human-readable explanation of what it means when a query matches this rule.  Depending on the verbosity of the report you generate, you will see more of the text
       in the description.  By default, you'll see only the first sentence, which is sort of a terse synopsis of the rule's meaning.  At a higher verbosity, you'll see subsequent sentences.

       ALI.001
           severity: note

           Aliasing without the AS keyword.  Explicitly using the AS keyword in column or table aliases, such as "tbl AS alias," is more readable than implicit aliases such as "tbl alias".

       ALI.002
           severity: warn

           Aliasing the '*' wildcard.  Aliasing a column wildcard, such as "SELECT tbl.* col1, col2" probably indicates a bug in your SQL.  You probably meant for the query to retrieve col1, but instead it
           renames the last column in the *-wildcarded list.

       ALI.003
           severity: note

           Aliasing without renaming.  The table or column's alias is the same as its real name, and the alias just makes the query harder to read.

       ARG.001
           severity: warn

           Argument with leading wildcard.  An argument has a leading wildcard character, such as "%foo".  The predicate with this argument is not sargable and cannot use an index if one exists.

       ARG.002
           severity: note

           LIKE without a wildcard.  A LIKE pattern that does not include a wildcard is potentially a bug in the SQL.

       CLA.001
           severity: warn

           SELECT without WHERE.  The SELECT statement has no WHERE clause.

       CLA.002
           severity: note

           ORDER BY RAND().  ORDER BY RAND() is a very inefficient way to retrieve a random row from the results.

       CLA.003
           severity: note

           LIMIT with OFFSET.  Paginating a result set with LIMIT and OFFSET is O(n^2) complexity, and will cause performance problems as the data grows larger.

       CLA.004
           severity: note

           Ordinal in the GROUP BY clause.  Using a number in the GROUP BY clause, instead of an expression or column name, can cause problems if the query is changed.

       CLA.005
           severity: warn

           ORDER BY constant column.

       CLA.006
           severity: warn

           GROUP BY or ORDER BY different tables will force a temp table and filesort.

       CLA.007
           severity: warn

           ORDER BY different directions prevents index from being used. All tables in the ORDER BY clause must be either ASC or DESC, else MySQL cannot use an index.

       COL.001
           severity: note

           SELECT *.  Selecting all columns with the * wildcard will cause the query's meaning and behavior to change if the table's schema changes, and might cause the query to retrieve too much data.

       COL.002
           severity: note

           Blind INSERT.  The INSERT or REPLACE query doesn't specify the columns explicitly, so the query's behavior will change if the table's schema changes; use "INSERT INTO tbl(col1, col2) VALUES..."
           instead.

       LIT.001
           severity: warn

           Storing an IP address as characters.  The string literal looks like an IP address, but is not an argument to INET_ATON(), indicating that the data is stored as characters instead of as integers.
           It is more efficient to store IP addresses as integers.

       LIT.002
           severity: warn

           Unquoted date/time literal.  A query such as "WHERE col<2010-02-12" is valid SQL but is probably a bug; the literal should be quoted.

       KWR.001
           severity: note

           SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS is inefficient.  SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS can cause performance problems because it does not scale well; use alternative strategies to build functionality such as paginated result
           screens.

       JOI.001
           severity: crit

           Mixing comma and ANSI joins.  Mixing comma joins and ANSI joins is confusing to humans, and the behavior differs between some MySQL versions.

       JOI.002
           severity: crit

           A table is joined twice.  The same table appears at least twice in the FROM clause.

       JOI.003
           severity: warn

           Reference to outer table column in WHERE clause prevents OUTER JOIN, implicitly converts to INNER JOIN.

       JOI.004
           severity: warn

           Exclusion join uses wrong column in WHERE.  The exclusion join (LEFT OUTER JOIN with a WHERE clause that is satisfied only if there is no row in the right-hand table) seems to use the wrong column
           in the WHERE clause.  A query such as "... FROM l LEFT OUTER JOIN r ON l.l=r.r WHERE r.z IS NULL" probably ought to list r.r in the WHERE IS NULL clause.

       RES.001
           severity: warn

           Non-deterministic GROUP BY.  The SQL retrieves columns that are neither in an aggregate function nor the GROUP BY expression, so these values will be non-deterministic in the result.

       RES.002
           severity: warn

           LIMIT without ORDER BY.  LIMIT without ORDER BY causes non-deterministic results, depending on the query execution plan.

       STA.001
           severity: note

           != is non-standard.  Use the <> operator to test for inequality.

       SUB.001
           severity: crit

           IN() and NOT IN() subqueries are poorly optimized.  MySQL executes the subquery as a dependent subquery for each row in the outer query.  This is a frequent cause of serious performance problems.
           This might change version 6.0 of MySQL, but for versions 5.1 and older, the query should be rewritten as a JOIN or a LEFT OUTER JOIN, respectively.

OPTIONS
       "--query" and "--review" are mutually exclusive.

       This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage information for details.

       --ask-pass
           Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.

       --charset
           short form: -A; type: string

           Default character set.  If the value is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on STDOUT to utf8, passes the mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MySQL.  Any
           other value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MySQL.

       --config
           type: Array

           Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the first option on the command line.

       --[no]continue-on-error
           default: yes

           Continue working even if there is an error.

       --daemonize
           Fork to the background and detach from the shell.  POSIX operating systems only.

       --database
           short form: -D; type: string

           Connect to this database.  This is also used as the default database for "--[no]show-create-table" if a query does not use database-qualified tables.

       --defaults-file
           short form: -F; type: string

           Only read mysql options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

       --group-by
           type: string; default: rule_id

           Group items in the report by this attribute.  Possible attributes are:

              ATTRIBUTE GROUPS
              ========= ==========================================================
              rule_id   Items matching the same rule ID
              query_id  Queries with the same ID (the same fingerprint)
              none      No grouping, report each query and its advice individually

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --host
           short form: -h; type: string

           Connect to host.

       --ignore-rules
           type: hash

           Ignore these rule IDs.

           Specify a comma-separated list of rule IDs (e.g. LIT.001,RES.002,etc.)  to ignore. Currently, the rule IDs are case-sensitive and must be uppercase.

       --password
           short form: -p; type: string

           Password to use when connecting.

       --pid
           type: string

           Create the given PID file when daemonized.  The file contains the process ID of the daemonized instance.  The PID file is removed when the daemonized instance exits.  The program checks for the
           existence of the PID file when starting; if it exists and the process with the matching PID exists, the program exits.

       --port
           short form: -P; type: int

           Port number to use for connection.

       --print-all
           Print all queries, even those that do not match any rules.  With "--group-by" "none", non-matching queries are printed in the main report and profile.  For other "--group-by" values, non-matching
           queries are only printed in the profile.  Non-matching queries have zeros for "NOTE", "WARN" and "CRIT" in the profile.

       --query
           type: string

           Analyze this single query and ignore files and STDIN.  This option allows you to supply a single query on the command line.  Any files also specified on the command line are ignored.

       --report-format
           type: string; default: compact

           Type of report format: full or compact.  In full mode, every query's report contains the description of the rules it matched, even if this information was previously displayed.  In compact mode,
           the repeated information is suppressed, and only the rule ID is displayed.

       --review
           type: DSN

           Analyze queries from this mk-query-digest query review table.

       --sample
           type: int; default: 1

           How many samples of the query to show.

       --set-vars
           type: string; default: wait_timeout=10000

           Set these MySQL variables.  Immediately after connecting to MySQL, this string will be appended to SET and executed.

       --[no]show-create-table
           default: yes

           Get "SHOW CREATE TABLE" for each query's table.

           If host connection options are given (like "--host", "--port", etc.)  then the tool will also get "SHOW CREATE TABLE" for each query.  This information is needed for some rules like JOI.004.  If
           this option is disabled by specifying "--no-show-create-table" then some rules may not be checked.

       --socket
           short form: -S; type: string

           Socket file to use for connection.

       --type
           type: Array

           The type of input to parse (default slowlog).  The permitted types are slowlog and genlog.

       --user
           short form: -u; type: string

           User for login if not current user.

       --verbose
           short form: -v; cumulative: yes; default: 1

           Increase verbosity of output.  At the default level of verbosity, the program prints only the first sentence of each rule's description.  At higher levels, the program prints more of the
           description.  See also "--report-format".

       --version
           Show version and exit.

       --where
           type: string

           Apply this WHERE clause to the SELECT query on the "--review" table.

DSN OPTIONS
       These DSN options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like "option=value".  The options are case-sensitive, so P and p are not the same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after
       the "=" and if the value contains whitespace it must be quoted.  DSN options are comma-separated.  See the maatkit manpage for full details.
