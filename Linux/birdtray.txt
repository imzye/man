NAME
       birdtray - system tray notifications for Thunderbird

SYNOPSIS
       Birdtray is supposed to be ran with no arguments in a session startup script.  Most modern desktop environments provide their own way to do so.

OPTIONS
       Any end-user configuration is done by right-clicking Birdtray's icon.

       There's one debugging option:

       --dumpmork file.msf
              Display the contents of a Mork file (used by Thunderbird indices).

FILES
       ~/.thunderbird/*.default/ImapMail/
