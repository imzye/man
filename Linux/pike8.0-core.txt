NAME
       pike - pike compiler and interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       pike [ -driver-options ...  ] [ script [ script-arguments ...  ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Compiler and interpreter for the Pike programming language.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported by the loader:

       -a     Increase the debug level of the peep-hole optimizer with 1 (debug).

       -anum  Set the debug level of the peep-hole optimizer to num (debug).

       -Dsymbol
              Define the preprocessor symbol symbol to 1.

       -Dsymbol=value
              Define the preprocessor symbol symbol to value.

       -d     Increase the debug level with 1 (debug).

       -dnum  Set the debug level to num (debug).

       -dc    Increase the debug level of the Pike compiler (debug).

       -dg    Resets the debug malloc at every garbage collection (debug).

       -dL    Windows only: Enable Windows error dialogs when dll files cannot be loaded.

              It  is  common  that  Pike has modules which are linked to dll files that are not available in all installations. Therefore these error dialogs are disabled by default so that Pike does not
              hang on them when attempting to load certain modules.

              However, the error dialogs are the only way to see which dll's that could not be loaded, so this option may be necessary to find out why a certain module does not load.

       -dp    Turns off the peep hole optimization (debug).

       -ds    Debug signals (debug).

       -dt    Turn off tail recursion optimization (debug).

       -dT    Enable extra checks in the thread library, e.g. mutex sanity checks (debug).

       -l     Increase the debug level of the global optimizer with 1 (debug).

       -lnum  Set the debug level of the global optimizer to num (debug).

       -mmaster_program
              Use master_program instead of the ordinary master program.

       -p     Increase the level of profiling with 1 (debug).

       -pnum  Set the level of profiling to num (debug).

       -ps    Enable stack profiling (debug).

       -qnum  End execution after executing num Pike instructions.

       -rt    Turn on runtime checking of arguments to function calls, and soft casts.

       -rT    Turn on #pragma strict_types for all files.

       -snum  Set Pike stack size to num (minimum is 256).

       -ssnum Set the pike C-level thread stack size to num.

       -t     Increase the level of runtime trace with 1 (debug).

       -tnum  Set the level of runtime trace to num (debug).

       -tg    Log the gc runs to stderr.

       The following options are supported by the default master program:

       -h, --help,
              Print help message and exit.

       -eexpr,--execute=expr
              Execute expr and exit.

       -xtoolname
              Execute internal tool toolname from Tools.Standalone.  Omit toolname for a list of available tools.

       -E, --preprocess
              Just run the preprocessor.

       -Idir,--include-path=dir
              Append dir to the include path.

       -Mdir,--modue-path=dir
              Append dir to the module path.

       -Pdir,--program-path=dir
              Append dir to the program path.

       -v, --version
              Print version of Pike and exit.

       -Vmajor.minor,--compat=major.minor
              Set the compatibility version to Pike version major.minor.

       -w, --warnings
              Enable warnings.

       -W, --woff, --no-warnings
              Disable warnings.

       --assembler-debug
              Set the peephole optimizer debug level (debug).

       --autoreload
              Turn on the autoreload mode of the master.

       --compiler-trace
              Turn on tracing of the Pike compiler (debug).

       --debug
              Increase or set the debug level (debug).

       --debug-without=feature
              Hide feature from the resolver (debug).

       --dumpversion
              Print the Pike version number to stderr, e.g. "8.0.10\n"

       --features
              List some of the features that are enabled in this Pike binary and exit (debug).

       --info Show various information about this Pike installation and exit (debug).

       --optimizer-debug
              Set the global optimizer debug level (debug).

       --show-all-cpp-warnings, --picky-cpp
              Enable warnings for failing #if constant() expressions.

       --show-paths
              Show the paths pike will use and exit (debug).

       --trace
              Increase the trace level (debug).

       --trace=num
              Set the trace level to num (debug).

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       script A path to a script written in Pike to be compiled and then executed.  Everything on the commandline after the script is passed as arguments to the main() function in the script.

       If no script is specified, pike will start in interactive- (Hilfe) mode.

REGISTRY KEYS
       On Windows, Pike is affected by the following keys in the registry:

       HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Pike\8.0\PIKE_MASTER HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Pike\8.0\PIKE_MASTER
              Specifies the name of the master program (overridden by -m).  If these keys are not set (the default), then Pike finds the master by relative path from pike.exe.

ENVIRONMENT
       Pike is affected by the following environment variables:

       PIKE_MASTER
              Specifies the name of the master program (overridden by -m).

       Depending on operating system Pike may be affected by the following environment variables:

       LC_ALL Overrides the other LC_* variables.

       LC_COLLATE
              Specifies the character collation sequence.

       LC_CTYPE
              Specifies the character classification.

       LC_MESSAGES
              Specifies the language of the system messagedatabase.

       LC_NUMERIC
              Specifies the decimal and thousand delimiters.

       LC_TIME
              Specifies the date and time formats.

       The default master program is affected by the following environment variables:

       PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH
              List of directories separated with colon (:), to search for include-files.

       PIKE_PROGRAM_PATH
              List of directories separated with colon (:), to search for program-files.

       PIKE_MODULE_PATH
              List of directories separated with colon (:), to search for modules.

       LONG_PIKE_ERRORS
              If set disables truncation of paths in backtraces.

       SHORT_PIKE_ERRORS
              If set and LONG_PIKE_ERRORS is not set, truncates paths to just the filename in backtraces.

       PIKE_BACKTRACE_LEN
              The maximum number of elements in arrays to describe in backtraces.

       Note that the above environment variables have effect before the default master program attempts to load the Getopt(3P) module, which occurrs before the master program arguments are parsed.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0      Successfull completion.

       >0     An error occurred. See output on stderr (fd #2) for reason.
