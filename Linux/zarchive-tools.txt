NAME
       zarchive — create and read zstd-compressed file archives

       zarchive allows you to create and read file archives in the ZArchive format (.zar).

EXIT STATUS
       The zarchive utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       $ zarchive src
       Outputting to: src.zar
       Adding main.cpp
       Adding zarchivereader.cpp
       Adding zarchivewriter.cpp
       Adding sha_256.c
       Adding sha_256.h
