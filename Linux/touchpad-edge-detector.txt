NAME
       touchpad-edge-detector - print the axis ranges for a touchpad device

SYNOPSIS
       touchpad-edge-detector [--help] WxH /dev/input/eventX

DESCRIPTION
       The  touchpad-edge-detector  tool  reads  touchpad  events from the kernel and records the minimum and maximum coordinates based on user input. This is an interactive tool, the user must move a finger
       around the touchpad, attempting to trigger an event at all edges of the touchpad.

       To terminate the event collection and print a summary, press Ctrl+C. It is recommended that the tool is run several times to guarantee a reliable result.

OPTIONS
       WxH     The width and height of the touchpad in mm. For a touchpad 100mm wide and 75mm high, the argument is thus 100x75. This is a required argument.

       /dev/input/eventX
               The event node of the touchpad to read events from. A list of possible event nodes can be obtained with either one of the following commands: libinput record, evemu-record, or evtest. Alterna‐
               tively the event node for a device is listed in the Handlers= line /proc/bus/input/devices.  This is a required argument.

       --help  Print a short help description

NOTES
       On  completion, this tool prints a summary of the collected events and a suggested udev rule. Due to rounding errors it is rare to get an exact match for the touchpad's dimensions, but any discrepancy
       of more than 5mm should be corrected with the suggested udev rule.

       The  udev  rule  should  be  simplified  and  submitted  as  a  pull  request   to   the   system   repository   at   https://github.com/systemd/systemd.   For   further   guidance,   see   the   file
       /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-evdev.hwdb.
