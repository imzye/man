NAME
       lordsawar - A Warlords II clone

SYNOPSIS
       lordsawar [OPTION...] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       LordsAWar!  is  a   2d turn-based strategy game where up to 8 players strive for control of as many cities as possible.  Produce new armies in cities to conquer  nearby  cities.  Using the income from
       those cities, make more armies to take more cities.  Send a hero to a temple to get a quest, or maybe search a nearby ruin instead.  Play against the computer or against a friend.
