NAME
       tint - clone of the original tint

SYNOPSIS
       tint [-h] [-l level] [-n] [-d] [-b char]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tint clone. As with all games (and especially with tint), you have to play it, not read about it.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the NOTES file in /usr/share/doc/tint.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -l <level>
              Specify the starting level (1-9). The higher the level you're starting from, the faster you'll earn points.

       -n     Draw next shape. When the next shape is drawn, you might find the game to be easier, but it will be slower to earn points.

       -d     Draw dotted lines.

       -b <char>
              Use the specified character (instead of spaces) to draw blocks.
