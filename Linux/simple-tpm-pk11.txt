NAME
       simple-tpm-pk11 - Simple PKCS11 provider for TPM chips

DESCRIPTION
       simple-tpm-pk11 Is a PKCS11 provider for TPM chips. Its primary purpose is to protect SSH client keys so that they can’t be copied or stolen if the machine they’re on gets compromised.

OPTIONS
       Since PKCS11 modules are .so files loaded by other binaries, they don’t take command line options. Instead simple-tpm-pk11 options can be set up environment variables.

       SIMPLE_TPM_PK11_DEBUG
              If set, enables debug level logging.

       SIMPLE_TPM_PK11_CONFIG=/path/to/config
              Override default config location. Default is ~/.simple-tpm-pk11/config.

       SIMPLE_TPM_PK11_LOG_STDERR
              If set, copies all log output to STDERR.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Configuration options are of the key/value variety, with comments lines starting with "#".

       key key file
              Full path to key file, or relative to ~/.simple-tpm-pk11.  This the only required configuration option.

       debug  Enable debug level logging.

       srk_pin PIN
              Set SRK PIN. Default is the Well Known Secret (20 nulls).

       key_pin PIN
              Set key PIN.

       log log file
              Full path to log file, or relative to ~/.simple-tpm-pk11.

EXAMPLES
       # Load key from ~/.simple-tpm-pk11/my.key.
       key my.key

       # Load key from /keys/foo/my.key, and the empty string as SRK PIN.
       key /keys/foo/my.key
       srk_pin

TPM-TROUBLESHOOTING
       TODO.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Most errors will probably be related to interacting with the TPM chip.  Resetting the TPM chip and taking ownership should take care of most of them. See the TPM-TROUBLESHOOTING section.

BUGS
       The password is read from stdin without turning off echo. It should be read from the terminal without echo.
