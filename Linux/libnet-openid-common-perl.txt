NAME
       Net::OpenID::Extension - Base class for OpenID extensions

VERSION
       version 1.20

METHODS
   CLASS->namespace_uris
       Return a hashref mapping namespace URIs to the aliases you will use to refer to them in the other methods. For example:

           return {
               'http://example.com/some-extension' => 'someext',
           };

   CLASS->new_request(@parameters)
       When your extension is added to the Net::OpenID::ClaimedIdentity object in consumer-land, this method will be called to create a request object. Any additional arguments passed when adding the
       extension will be passed through verbatim in @parameters.

       The object you return here should at minimum provide the interface defined in Net::OpenID::ExtensionMessage.

       You can return "undef" here if you have nothing useful to return.

   CLASS->received_request(\%args)
       In server-land, when a caller asks for the request object for your extension this method will be called to create a request object.  %args maps the aliases you returned from the "namespace_uris"
       method to a hashref of the key-value pairs provided in that namespace.

       The object you return here should at minimum provide the interface defined in Net::OpenID::ExtensionMessage, and should behave identically to the corresponding object returned from "new_request".

       You can return "undef" here if you have nothing useful to return.

   CLASS->new_response(@parameters)
       When your extension is added to the response in server-land, this method will be called to create a response object. Any additional arguments passed when adding the extension will be passed
       through verbatim in @parameters.

       You can return "undef" here if you have nothing useful to return.

   CLASS->received_response(\%args)
       In consumer-land, when a caller asks for the request object for your extension in Net::OpenID::VerifiedIdentity this method will be called to create a response object.  %args maps the aliases you
       returned from the "namespace_uris" method to a hashref of the key-value pairs provided in that namespace.

       You can return "undef" here if you have nothing useful to return.
