NAME
       ssake - assembling millions of very short DNA sequences

SYNOPSIS
       Progressive assembly of millions of short DNA sequences by k-mer search through a prefix tree and 3' extension.

OPTIONS
       -f     Fasta file containing all the [paired (-p 1) / unpaired (-p 0)] reads (required) paired reads must now be separated by ":"

       -s     Fasta file containing sequences to use as seeds exclusively (specify only if different from read set, optional)

       -m     Minimum number of overlapping bases with the seed/contig during overhang consensus build up (default -m 16)

       -o     Minimum number of reads needed to call a base during an extension (default -o 3)

       -r     Minimum base ratio used to accept a overhang consensus base (default -r 0.7)

       -t     Trim up to -t base(s) on the contig end when all possibilities have been exhausted for an extension (default -t 0)>

       -p     Paired-end reads used? (-p 1=yes, -p 0=no, default -p 0)

       -v     Runs in verbose mode (-v 1=yes, -v 0=no, default -v 0, optional)

       -b     Base name for your output files (optional)

       ============ Options below only considered with -p 1 ============

       -d     Mean distance expected/observed between paired-end reads (default -d 200, optional)

       -e     Error (%) allowed on mean distance   e.g. -e 0.75  == distance +/- 75% (default -e 0.75, optional)

       -k     Minimum number of links (read pairs) to compute scaffold (default -k 2, optional)

       -a     Maximum link ratio between two best contig pairs *higher values lead to least accurate scaffolding* (default -a 0.70, optional)

       -z     Minimum contig size to track paired-end reads (default -z 50, optional)

       -g     Fasta file containing unpaired sequence reads (optional)
