NAME
       copylink - replace a link with a copy of the linked file

SYNOPSIS
       copylink [link ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Each of the links on the command line is replaced by a copy of the file that the link points too, so the copy can be edited without changing the original.

       The command is intended for modifying perl source files created by "./Configure -Dmksymlinks".
