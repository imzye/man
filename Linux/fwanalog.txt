NAME
       fwanalog - iptables log-file analyzer

SYNOPSIS
       fwanalog [-h | --help] [-c conffile][-r] [-t ] [-y] [-a IP-addr] [-p packet]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the fwanalog command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       fwanalog is a program that parses firewall log-files, and analyzes them with analog.  For a complete list of supported log-files formats see /usr/share/doc/fwanalog/README.Debian

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the documentation
       in /usr/share/doc/fwanalog

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -r     Rotate log cache (not necessary anymore).

       -t     Only update statistics for today (e.g. for hourly use). The sep_hosts and sep_packets commands in fwanalog.opts are ignored.

       -y     Like -t, but only for yesterday

       -a IP-addr
              Create a separate report for this host

       -p packet
              Create a separate report for this packet.

              Format: target/protocol/portnumber

              e.g. 192.168.0.1/tcp/21 or firewall/udp/137

FILES
       /etc/fwnalog/fwanalog.opts, user-changeable options
