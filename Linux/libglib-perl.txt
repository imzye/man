NAME
       Glib::Param::UInt64 -  Wrapper for uint64 parameters in GLib

HIERARCHY
         Glib::ParamSpec
         +----Glib::Param::UInt64

DESCRIPTION
       This page documents the extra accessors available for the unsigned 64 bit integer type paramspecs.  On 32 bit machines and even on some 64 bit machines, perl really only supports 32 bit integers,
       so all of these methods convert the values to and from Perl strings if necessary.

METHODS
   64 bit unsigned = $pspec->get_maximum
   64 bit unsigned = $pspec->get_minimum

       Glib, Glib::ParamSpec
