NAME
         exipick - selectively display messages from an Exim queue

SYNOPSIS
         exipick [<options>] [<criterion> [<criterion> ...]]
         exipick --help|--man

DESCRIPTION
       exipick is a tool to display messages in an Exim queue.  It is very similar to exiqgrep and is, in fact, a drop in replacement for exiqgrep.  exipick allows you to select messages to be displayed
       using any piece of data stored in an Exim spool file.  Matching messages can be displayed in a variety of formats.

QUICK START
       Delete every frozen message from queue:

           exipick -zi | xargs exim -Mrm

       Show only messages which have not yet been virus scanned:

           exipick '$received_protocol ne virus-scanned'

       Run the queue in a semi-random order:

           exipick -i --random | xargs exim -M

       Show the count and total size of all messages which either originated from localhost or have a received protocol of 'local':

           exipick --or --size --bpc \
                   '$sender_host_address eq 127.0.0.1' \
                   '$received_protocol eq local'

       Display all messages received on the MSA port, ordered first by the sender's email domain and then by the size of the emails:

           exipick --sort sender_address_domain,message_size \
                   '$received_port == 587'

       Display only messages whose every recipient is in the example.com domain, also listing the IP address of the sending host:

           exipick --show-vars sender_host_address \
                   '$each_recipients = example.com'

       Same as above, but show values for all defined variables starting with sender_ and the number of recipients:

           exipick --show-vars ^sender_,recipients_count \
                   '$each_recipients = example.com'

OPTIONS
       --and
           Display messages matching all criteria (default)

       -b  Display messages in brief format (exiqgrep)

       -bp | -l
           Display messages in standard mailq format (default).  (exiqgrep: "-l")

       -bpa
           Same as "-bp", show generated addresses also (exim)

       -bpc
           Show a count of matching messages (exim)

       -bpr
           Same as "-bp --unsorted" (exim)

       -bpra
           Same as "-bpa --unsorted" (exim)

       -bpru
           Same as "-bpu --unsorted" (exim)

       -bpu
           Same as "-bp", but only show undelivered messages (exim)

       -C | --config config
           Use config to determine the proper spool directory. (See "--spool" or "--input" for alternative ways to specify the directories to operate on.)

       -c  Show a count of matching messages (exiqgrep)

       --caseful
           Make operators involving "=" honor case

       --charset
           Override the default local character set for $header_ decoding

       -f regexp
           Same as "$sender_address =~ /<regexp>/" (exiqgrep).  Note that this preserves the default case sensitivity of exiqgrep's interface.

       --finput
           Same as "--input-dir Finput".  Finput is where exim copies frozen messages when compiled with SUPPORT_MOVE_FROZEN_MESSAGES.

       --flatq
           Use a single-line output format

       --freeze cache file
           Save queue information in an quickly retrievable format

       --help
           Display this output

       -i  Display only the message IDs (exiqgrep)

       --input-dir inputname
           Set the name of the directory under the spool directory.  By default this is input.  If this starts with /, the value of "--spool" is ignored.  See also "--finput".

       --not
           Negate all tests.

       -o seconds
           Same as "$message_age > <seconds>" (exiqgrep)

       --or
           Display messages matching any criteria

       --queue name
           Name of the queue (default: ''). See "named queues" in the spec.

       -r regexp
           Same as "$recipients =~ /<regexp>/" (exiqgrep).  Note that this preserves the default case sensitivity of exiqgrep's interface.

       --random
           Display messages in random order

       --reverse | -R
           Display messages in reverse order (exiqgrep: "-R")

       -s string
           Same as "$shown_message_size eq <string>" (exiqgrep)

       --spool path
           Set the path to the exim spool to use.  This value will have the arguments to "--queue", and "--input" or input appended, or be ignored if "--input" is a full path. If not specified, exipick uses
           the value from "exim [-C config] -n -bP spool_directory", and if this call fails, the  /opt/exim/spool from build time (Local/Makefile) is used. See also "--config".

       --show-rules
           Show the internal representation of each criterion specified

       --show-tests
           Show the result of each criterion on each message

       --show-vars variable[,variable...]
           Show the value for variable for each displayed message.  variable will be a regular expression if it begins with a circumflex.

       --size
           Show the total bytes used by each displayed message

       --thaw cache file
           Read queue information cached from a previous "--freeze" run

       --sort variable[,variable...]
           Display matching messages sorted according to variable

       --unsorted
           Do not apply any sorting to output

       --version
           Display the version of this command

       -x  Same as "!$deliver_freeze" (exiqgrep)

       -y  Same as "$message_age < <seconds>" (exiqgrep)

       -z  Same as $deliver_freeze (exiqgrep)

CRITERIA
       Exipick decides which messages to display by applying a test against each message.  The rules take the general form of "VARIABLE OPERATOR VALUE".  For example, "$message_age > 60".  When exipick is
       deciding which messages to display, it checks the $message_age variable for each message.  If a message's age is greater than 60, the message will be displayed.  If the message's age is 60 or less
       seconds, it will not be displayed.

       Multiple criteria can be used.  The order they are specified does not matter.  By default all criteria must evaluate to true for a message to be displayed.  If the "--or" option is used, a message is
       displayed as long as any of the criteria evaluate to true.

       See the VARIABLES and OPERATORS sections below for more details

OPERATORS
       BOOLEAN
           Boolean variables are checked simply by being true or false.  There is no real operator except negation.  Examples of valid boolean tests:

             $deliver_freeze
             !$deliver_freeze

       NUMERIC
           Valid comparisons are <, <=, >, >=, ==, and !=.  Numbers can be integers or floats.  Any number in a test suffixed with d, h, m, s, M, K, or B will be multiplied by 86400, 3600, 60, 1, 1048576,
           1024, or 1 respectively.  Examples of valid numeric tests:

             $message_age >= 3d
             $local_interface == 587
             $message_size < 30K

       STRING
           The string operators are =, eq, ne, =~, and !~.  With the exception of "=", the operators all match the functionality of the like-named perl operators.  eq and ne match a string exactly.  !~, =~,
           and = apply a perl regular expression to a string.  The "=" operator behaves just like =~ but you are not required to place // around the regular expression.  Examples of valid string tests:

             $received_protocol eq esmtp
             $sender_address = example.com
             $each_recipients =~ /^a[a-z]{2,3}@example.com$/

       NEGATION
           There are many ways to negate tests, each having a reason for existing.  Many tests can be negated using native operators.  For instance, >1 is the opposite of <=1 and eq and ne are opposites.  In
           addition, each individual test can be negated by adding a ! at the beginning of the test.  For instance, "!$acl_m1 =~ /^DENY$/" is the same as "$acl_m1 !~ /^DENY$/".  Finally, every test can be
           specified by using the command line argument "--not".  This is functionally equivalent to adding a ! to the beginning of every test.

VARIABLES
       With a few exceptions the available variables match Exim's internal expansion variables in both name and exact contents.  There are a few notable additions and format deviations which are noted below.
       Although a brief explanation is offered below, Exim's spec.txt should be consulted for full details.  It is important to remember that not every variable will be defined for every message.  For
       example, $sender_host_port is not defined for messages not received from a remote host.

       Internally, all variables are represented as strings, meaning any operator will work on any variable.  This means that "$sender_host_name > 4" is a legal criterion, even if it does not produce
       meaningful results.  Variables in the list below are marked with a 'type' to help in choosing which types of operators make sense to use.

         Identifiers
           B - Boolean variables
           S - String variables
           N - Numeric variables
           . - Standard variable matching Exim's content definition
           # - Standard variable, contents differ from Exim's definition
           + - Non-standard variable

       S . $acl_c0-$acl_c9, $acl_m0-$acl_m9
           User definable variables.

       B + $allow_unqualified_recipient
           TRUE if unqualified recipient addresses are permitted in header lines.

       B + $allow_unqualified_sender
           TRUE if unqualified sender addresses are permitted in header lines.

       S . $authenticated_id
           Optional saved information from authenticators, or the login name of the calling process for locally submitted messages.

       S . $authenticated_sender
           The value of AUTH= param for smtp messages, or a generated value from the calling processes login and qualify domain for locally submitted messages.

       S . $bheader_*, $bh_*
           Value of the header(s) with the same name with any RFC2047 words decoded if present.  See section 11.5 of Exim's spec.txt for full details.

       S + $bmi_verdicts
           The verdict string provided by a Brightmail content scan

       N . $body_linecount
           The number of lines in the message's body.

       N . $body_zerocount
           The number of binary zero bytes in the message's body.

       S + $data_path
           The path to the body file's location in the filesystem.

       B + $deliver_freeze
           TRUE if the message is currently frozen.

       B + $dont_deliver
           TRUE if, under normal circumstances, Exim will not try to deliver the message.

       S + $each_recipients
           This is a pseudo variable which allows you to apply a test against each address in $recipients individually.  Whereas "$recipients =~ /@aol.com/" will match if any recipient address contains
           aol.com, "$each_recipients =~ /@aol.com$/" will only be true if every recipient matches that pattern.  Note that this obeys "--and" or "--or" being set.  Using it with "--or" is very similar to
           just matching against $recipients, but with the added benefit of being able to use anchors at the beginning and end of each recipient address.

       S + $each_recipients_del
           Like $each_recipients, but for $recipients_del

       S + $each_recipients_undel
           Like $each_recipients, but for $recipients_undel

       B . $first_delivery
           TRUE if the message has never been deferred.

       S . $header_*, $h_*
           This will always match the contents of the corresponding $bheader_* variable currently (the same behaviour Exim displays when iconv is not installed).

       S + $header_path
           The path to the header file's location in the filesystem.

       B . $host_lookup_deferred
           TRUE if there was an attempt to look up the host's name from its IP address, but an error occurred that during the attempt.

       B . $host_lookup_failed
           TRUE if there was an attempt to look up the host's name from its IP address, but the attempt returned a negative result.

           TRUE if the message is a locally-generated error message.

       S . $local_scan_data
           The text returned by the local_scan() function when a message is received.

       B . $manually_thawed
           TRUE when the message has been manually thawed.

       S . $message_headers
           A concatenation of all the header lines except for lines added by routers or transports.  RFC2047 decoding is performed

       S . $message_headers_raw
           A concatenation of all the header lines except for lines added by routers or transports.  No decoding or translation is performed.

       N . $message_linecount

           The epoch time at which the message was received.

       S # $recipients
           The list of envelope recipients for a message.  Unlike Exim's version, this variable always contains every recipient of the message.  The recipients are separated by a comma and a space.  See also
           $each_recipients.

       N . $recipients_count
           The number of envelope recipients for the message.

           generated addresses.  See also $each_recipients_del.

       N + $recipients_del_count
           The number of envelope recipients for the message which have already been delivered.  Note that this is the count of original recipients to which the message has been delivered.  It does not

       B + $sender_local
           TRUE if the message was locally generated.

       B + $sender_set_untrusted
           TRUE if the envelope sender of this message was set by an untrusted local caller.

       S + $shown_message_size
           This non-standard variable contains the formatted size string.  That is, for a message whose $message_size is 66566 bytes, $shown_message_size is 65K.

       S . $smtp_active_hostname
           The value of the active host name when the message was received, as specified by the "smtp_active_hostname" option.

       S . $spam_score
           The spam score of the message, for example '3.4' or '30.5'.  (Requires exiscan or WITH_CONTENT_SCAN)

       S . $spam_score_int
           The spam score of the message, multiplied by ten, as an integer value.  For instance '34' or '305'.  (Requires exiscan or WITH_CONTENT_SCAN)
