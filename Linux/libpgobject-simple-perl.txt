NAME
       PGObject::Simple - Minimalist stored procedure mapper based on LedgerSMB's DBObject

VERSION
       Version 3.0.2

SYNOPSIS
         use PGObject::Simple;
         my $obj = PGObject::Simple->new(%myhash);
         $obj->set_dbh($dbh); # Database connection

       To call a stored procedure with enumerated arguments.

         my @results = $obj->call_procedure(
             funcname     => $funcname,
             funcschema   => $funcname,
             args         => [$arg1, $arg2, $arg3],
         );

       You can add something like a running total as well:

         my @results = $obj->call_procedure(
             funcname      => $funcname,
             funcschema    => $funcname,
             args          => [$arg1, $arg2, $arg3],
             running_funcs => [{agg => 'sum(amount)', alias => 'total'}],
         );

       To call a stored procedure with named arguments from a hashref.  This is typically done when mapping object properties in to stored procedure arguments.

         my @results = $obj->call_dbmethod(
             funcname      => $funcname,
             funcschema    => $funcname,
             running_funcs => [{agg => 'sum(amount)', alias => 'total'}],
         );

       To call a stored procedure with named arguments from a hashref with overrides.

         my @results = $obj->call_dbmethod(
             funcname      => 'customer_save',
             funcschema    => 'public',
             running_funcs => [{agg => 'sum(amount)', alias => 'total'}],
             args          => { id => undef }, # force to create new!
         );

DESCRIPTION
       PGObject::Simple  a  top-half  object system for PGObject which is simple and inspired by (and a subset functionally speaking of) the simple stored procedure object method system of LedgerSMB 1.3.
       The framework discovers stored procedure APIs and dispatches to them and can therefore be a base for application-specific object models and much more.

       PGObject::Simple is designed to be light-weight and yet robust glue between your object model and the RDBMS's stored procedures. It works by looking up the stored  procedure  arguments,  stripping
       them  of  the  conventional prefix 'in_', and mapping what is left to object property names. Properties can be overridden by passing in a hashrefs in the args named argument. Named arguments there
       will be used in place of object properties.

       This system is quite flexible, perhaps too much so, and it relies on the database encapsulating its own logic behind self-documenting stored procedures using consistent  conventions.  No  function
       which  is expected to be discovered can be overloaded, and all arguments must be named for their object properties. For this reason the use of this module fundamentally changes the contract of the
       stored procedure from that of a fixed number of arguments in fixed types contract to one where the name must be unique and the stored procedures must be coded to the application's interface.  This
       inverts the way we typically think about stored procedures and makes them much more application friendly.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   new
       This  constructs  a new object.  Basically it copies the incoming hash (one level deep) and then blesses it.  If the hash passed in has a dbh member, the dbh is set to that.  This does not set the
       function prefix, as this is assumed to be done implicitly by subclasses.

   set_dbh($dbh)
       Sets the database handle (needs DBD::Pg 2.0 or later) to $dbh

   dbh
       Returns the database handle for the object.

   associate($pgobject)
       Sets the db handle to that from the $pgobject.

   _set_funcprefix
       This sets the default funcprefix for future calls.  The funcprefix can still be overridden by passing in an explicit '' in a call.  This is used to "claim" a certain set of  stored  procedures  in
       the database for use by an object.

       It is semi-private, intended to be called by subclasses directly, perhaps in constructors, but not from outside the object.

   _set_funcschema
       This sets the default funcschema for future calls.  This is overwridden by per-call arguments, (PGObject::Util::DBMethod provides for such overrides on a per-method basis).

   _set_registry
       This  sets  the  registry for future calls.  The idea here is that this allows for application object model wrappers to set which registry they are using, both for predictability and ensuring that
       interoperability is possible.

   call_dbmethod
       Does a straight-forward mapping (as described below) to the stored procedure arguments.  Stored procedure arguments are looked up, a leading  'in_'  is  stripped  off  where  it  exists,  and  the
       remaining  string  mapped back to an object property.  The $args{args} hashref can be used to override arguments by name.  Unknown properties are handled simply by passing a NULL in, so the stored
       procedures should be prepared to handle these.

       As with call_procedure below, this returns a single hashref when called in a scalar context, and a list of hashrefs when called in a list context.

       NEW IN 2.0: We now give preference to functions of the same name over properties.  So $obj->foo() will be used before $obj->{foo}.  This enables better data encapsulation.

   call_procedure
       This is a lightweight wrapper around PGObject->call_procedure which merely passes the currently attached db connection in.  We use the previously set funcprefix and dbh by default but other values
       can be passed in to override the default object's values.

       This returns a single hashref when called in a scalar context, and a list of hashrefs when called in a list context.  When called in a scalar  context  it  simply  returns  the  single  first  row
       returned.

WRITING CLASSES WITH PGObject::Simple
       Unlike PGObject, which is only loosely tied to the functionality in question and presumes that relevant information will be passed over a functional interface, PGObject is a specific framework for
       object-oriented coding in Perl.  It can therefore be used alone or with other modules to provide quite a bit of functionality.

       A  PGObject::Simple object is a blessed hashref with no gettors or setters.  This is thus ideal for cases where you are starting and just need some quick mappings of stored procedures to hashrefs.
       You reference properties simply with the $object->{property} syntax.  There is very little encapsulation in objects, and very little abstraction except when it comes to the actual stored procedure
       interfaces.   In essence, PGObject::Simple generally assumes that the actual data structure is essentially a public interface  between  the  database  and  whatever  else  is  going  on  with  the
       application.

       The general methods can then wrap call_procedure and call_dbmethod calls, mapping out to stored procedures in the database.

       Stored  procedures  must  be written to relatively exacting specifications.  Arguments must be named, with names prefixed optionally with 'in_' (if the property name starts with 'in_' properly one
       must also prefix it).

       An example of a simple stored procedure might be:

          CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION customer_get(in_id int) returns customer
          RETURNS setof customer language sql as $$

          select * from customer where id = $1;

          $$;

       This stored procedure could then be called with any of:

          $obj->call_dbmethod(
             funcname => 'customer_get',
          ); # retrieve the customer with the $obj->{id} id

          $obj->call_dbmethod(
             funcname => 'customer_get',
             args     => {id => 3 },
          ); # retrieve the customer with the id of 3 regardless of $obj->{id}

          $obj->call_procedure(
             funcname => 'customer_get',
             args     => [3],
          );
