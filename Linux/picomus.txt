NAME
       picomus - Minimal Unsatisfiable Core (MUS) generator

SYNOPSIS
       picomus [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

DESCRIPTION
       PicoMUS  is  a  satisfiability  (SAT)  solver  that generates a minimal
       unsatisfiable core, using the PicoSAT library.

OPTIONS
       -h     print this command line option summary and exit

       -v     enable verbose output

       If no input filename is given, or the input filename is "-", then stan‐
       dard  input is used.  If the output filename is "-", then standard out‐
       put is used.  If no output filename is given, then the MUS is  computed
       but not printed.

CONFORMING TO
       This  program  uses DIMACS CNF format as input.  The output conforms to
       the standard SAT solver format used at SAT competitions.

EXIT STATUS
       The output is a number of lines.  Most of these  will  begin  with  "c"
       (comment),  and  give  detailed technical information.  The output line
       beginning with "s" declares whether or not it is satisfiable.  The line
       "s  SATISFIABLE" is produced if it is satisfiable (exit status 10), and
       "s UNSATISFIABLE" is produced if it is  not  satisfiable  (exit  status
       20).
