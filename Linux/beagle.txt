NAME
       Beagle - Genotype calling, genotype phasing and imputation of ungenotyped markers

SYNOPSIS
       java -Xmx[GB]g -jar /usr/share/beagle/beagle.jar [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Beagle  performs  genotype  calling,  genotype phasing, imputation of ungenotyped markers, and identity-by-descent segment detection. Genotypic imputation works on phased haplotypes using a Li and
       Stephens haplotype frequency model.  Beagle also implements the Refined IBD algorithm for detecting homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) and identity-by-descent (IBD) segments.

OPTIONS
   Data input/output parameters
       gt=filename
              Optional
              Specifies a VCF file containing a GT (genotype) format field for each marker.  If a genotype contains the phased allele separator, "|", then Beagle will preserve the phase of  the  genotype
              during the analysis.  If you use the gt argument, all genotypes in the output file will be phased and non-missing.

       gl=filename
              Optional
              Specifies a VCF file containing a GL or PL (genotype likelihood) format field for each marker.  Any data in the GT format field will be ignored.  If both GL and PL format fields are present
              for a marker, the GL format will be used.

       gtgl=filename
              Optional
              Specifies  a VCF file containing a GT, GL or PL format field for each marker.  If a genotype is non-missing, Beagle will ignore the genotype likelihood.  If both GL and PL format fields are
              present for a marker, the GL field will be used.

       ref=filename
              Optional
              Specifies a VCF file containing phased reference genotypes.  See the impute parameter.

       out=prefix
              Required
              Specifies the output filename prefix.  The prefix may be an absolute or relative filename, but it cannot be a directory name.

       excludesamples=filename
              Optional
              Specifies a file containing non-reference samples (one sample per line) to be excluded from the analysis and output files.

       excludemarkers=filename
              Optional
              Specifies a file containing markers (one marker per line) to be excluded from the analysis and the output files.  An excluded marker identifier can either be  an  identifier  from  the  VCF
              record’s ID field or a genomic coordinate in the format: CHROM:POS.

       map=filename
              Optional
              Specifies  a  PLINK  format  genetic map on the cM scale.  HapMap GrCh36 and GrCh37 genetic maps in PLINK format are available for download from the Beagle website.  Use of a genetic map is
              recommended if you are imputing ungenotyped markers.  If no genetic map is specified, Beagle will assume a constant recombination rate of 1 cM / Mb.

       chrom=chrom:start-end
              Optional
              Specifies a chromosome or chromosome interval using a chromosome identifier in the VCF file and the starting and ending positions of the interval.  The entire chromosome, the  beginning  of
              the chromosome, and the end of a chromosome can be specified by chrom=[chrom], chrom=[chrom:-end], and chrom=[chrom:start-] respectively.

       maxlr=number_≥_1
              Default = 5000
              Specifies  the  maximum  likelihood ratio at a genotype.  If M is the maximum of the likelihoods of each possible genotype, any likelihood that is less than (M ⁄ maxlr) is set to 0.0 to im‐
              prove computational efficiency.

   General parameters
       nthreads=positive_integer
              Default: machine-dependent
              Specifies the number of threads of execution.  If no nthreads parameter is specified, the nthreads parameter will be set equal to the number of CPU cores on the host machine.

       lowmem=true/false
              Default = false
              Specifies whether a memory efficient algorithm should be used.  The memory efficient algorithm increases run-time by a factor less than 2.0.

       window=positive_integer
              Default = 50000
              Specifies the number of markers to include in each sliding window.  The window parameter must be at least twice as large as the overlap parameter.  The window parameter controls the  amount
              of memory used in the analysis.  For human data, it is recommended that the window parameter be greater than or equal to the typical number of markers in 5 cM.

       overlap=positive_integer
              Default = 3000
              Specifies the number of markers of overlap between sliding windows.  For human data, it is recommended that the overlap be set to the typical number of markers in 0.5 cM (when ibd=false) or
              2.0 cM (when ibd=true).

       seed=integer
              Default = -99999
              Specifies the seed for the random number generator.

   Phasing and imputation parameters
       niterations=non-negative_integer
              Default = 5
              Specifies  the  number  of  phasing iterations.  The phasing iterations are preceded by 10 burn-in iterations which carry out the Beagle version 4.0 phasing algorithm.  If you want to phase
              your data with the Beagle 4.0 phasing algorithm, use niterations=0.  Accuracy and compute time increase with the number of iterations.

       impute=true/false
              Default = true
              Specifies whether markers that are present in the reference panel but absent in your data will be imputed.  This option has no effect if the ref and gt arguments are not used.

       gprobs=true/false
              Default = false
              Specifies whether a GP (genotype probability) format field will be included in the output VCF file when imputing ungenotyped markers.  By default, a GP fields is not printed  because  a  DS
              (alternate allele dose) format field is always printed when imputing ungenotyped markers.

       ne=integer
              Default = 1000000
              Specifies  the effective population size when imputing ungenotyped markers.  The default value is suitable for a large outbred human population.  Smaller values in the hundreds or thousands
              for the ne parameter are suggested for inbred human and animal populations.

       err=non-negative_number
              Default = 0.0001
              Specifies the allele miscall rate.  The default value should give good results for most sequence and SNP array data.

       cluster=non-negative_number
              Default = 0.005
              Specifies the maximum cM distance between individual markers that are combined into an aggregate marker when imputing ungenotyped markers.

   IBD parameters
       ibd=true/false
              Default = false
              Specifies whether IBD analysis will be performed when the gt argument is used.

       ibdlod=non-negative_integer
              Default = 3.0
              Specifies the minimum LOD score for reported IBD.

       ibdscale=non-negative_number
              Default: data-dependent
              Specifies the scale parameter used to build the haplotype frequency model for IBD analysis.  If no ibdscale parameter is specified the scale parameter for the IBD analysis will  be  set  to
              max{2, sqrt[sample size]/100}, which we have found to work well for outbred populations.

       ibdtrim=non-negative_integer
              Default = 40
              Specifies  the  number  of markers trimmed from the end of a shared haplotype when testing for IBD.  Note: The default ibdtrim parameter is designed for European samples genotyped with a 1M
              SNP array (~ 1 marker per 3 kb).  For human SNP array data, it is recommended to set the ibdtrim parameter to the typical number of markers in a 0.15 cM region.  Pilot studies  of  randomly
              selected genomic regions can be used to fine-tune the values of the ibdtrim parameter.
