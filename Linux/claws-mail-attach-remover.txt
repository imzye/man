NAME
       claws-mail-attach-remover - remove attachments from mail messages

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-attach-remover package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-attach-remover is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       Enables the removal of all attachments from the selected message. When doing right-click a message on message list, choose the “Remove attachments” option from the displayed submenu.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named att_remover.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

CAVEATS
       Currently there is no way you can select individual attachments for removal. It's all or nothing.
