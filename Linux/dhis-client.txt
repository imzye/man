NAME
     dhid — Dynamic Host Information System client.

SYNOPSIS
     dhid [-h] [-p port] [-P pidfile] [-f conffile]

DESCRIPTION
     dhid is the DHIS client daemon. After setting up with a DHIS provider, each machine may run a dhid daemon (in background) in order to update its dynamic IP ad‐
     dress within the server.

     /etc/dhid.conf should be configured according to the provider's assigned parameters.

     Once running, dhid sends echo request packets to the server and expects a reply. Once received, dhid tries to authenticate at the server either in secure on
     insecure mode. From then on, and providing authentication was successful, the client waits and replies to queries originated at the server. If the server
     doesn't receive acknowledgments of these packets the host is marked offline.  Likewise, if the client doesn't receive queries for a period of time the offline
     stage is restored.

     Therefore, the only thing a DHIS host needs is to run the dhid client.  The server is able to determine when the host is online and the server tables are up‐
     dated automatically.

OPTIONS
     -h      Show usage information.
