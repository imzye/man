NAME
       xml-rpc-api2txt - Print out a description of an XML-RPC API as text

SYNOPSIS
       xml-rpc-api2txt server-url

DESCRIPTION
       xml-rpc-api2txt  queries  an  XML-RPC  server  using the XML-RPC Instrospection API designed by Edd Dumbill.  It then prints the results to standard output in a nicely formatted form, suitable for
       sending via e-mail.

       You can find a list of supported XML-RPC server libraries (and patches for many others) at http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/hacks.php.

OPTIONS
       server-url
              The name of the server to query.  Try http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/interop.cgi.

BUGS
       xml-rpc-api2txt assumes that method descriptions are ASCII text, not HTML as specified in the standard.  (In practice, both conventions are often seen.)
