NAME
       nsxiv - Neo Simple X Image Viewer

SYNOPSIS
       nsxiv [-abcfhiopqrtvZ0] [-A FRAMERATE] [-e WID] [-G GAMMA] [-g GEOMETRY] [-N NAME] [-n NUM] [-S DELAY] [-s MODE] [-z ZOOM] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       nsxiv is a simple image viewer for X.

       It  has  two  modes  of operation: image and thumbnail mode. The default is image mode, in which only the current image is shown. In thumbnail mode a grid of small previews is displayed, making it
       easy to choose an image to open.

       Please note, that the fullscreen mode requires an EWMH/NetWM-compliant window manager.

OPTIONS
       -A, --framerate FRAMERATE
              Play animations with a constant frame rate set to FRAMERATE.  If FRAMERATE is set to 0 then animation playback is disabled.

       -a, --animate
              Play animations of multi-frame images.

       -b     Do not show statusbar.

       --bar, --no-bar
              Enables or disables statusbar.  --no-bar is equivalent to -b.

       -c, --clean-cache
              Remove all orphaned cache files from the thumbnail cache directory and exit.

       -e, --embed WID
              Embed nsxiv's window into window whose ID is WID.

       -f, --fullscreen
              Start in fullscreen mode.

       -G, --gamma GAMMA
              Set image gamma to GAMMA (-32..32).

       -g, --geometry GEOMETRY
              Set window position and size. See section GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS of X(7) for more information on GEOMETRY argument.

       -h, --help
              Print brief usage information to standard output and exit.

       -i, --stdin
              Read names of files to open from standard input. Also done if FILE is `-'.

       -N, --name NAME
              Set the window name (i.e the "Instance" name of WM_CLASS as described in ICCCM) to NAME.

       -n, --start-at NUM
              Start at picture number NUM.

       -o, --stdout
              Write list of all marked files to standard output when quitting. In combination with -i, --stdin nsxiv can be used as a visual filter/pipe.

       -p, --private
              Enable private mode, in which nsxiv does not write any cache or temporary files.

       -q, --quiet
              Be quiet, and disable warnings to standard error stream.

       -r, --recursive
              Search the given directories recursively for images to view.

       -S, --ss-delay DELAY
              Start in slideshow mode. Set the delay between images to DELAY seconds.  DELAY may be a floating-point number.

       -s, --scale-mode MODE
              Set scale mode according to MODE character. Supported modes are: [d]own, [f]it, [F]ill, [w]idth, [h]eight.

       -t, --thumbnail[=no]
              Start in thumbnail mode. The long option accepts an optional "no" to disable it.

       -v, --version
              Print version information to standard output and exit.

       -Z, --zoom-100
              The same as `-z 100'.

       -z, --zoom ZOOM
              Set zoom level to ZOOM percent.

       -0, --null
              Use NULL-separator. With this option, output of -o and file-list sent to the key-handler and the input of -i will be separated by a NULL character.

       --anti-alias[=no]
              Enables anti-aliasing, when given no as an argument, disables it instead.

       --alpha-layer[=no]
              Enables checkerboard background for alpha layer, when given no as an argument, disables it instead.

       --cache-allow, --cache-deny CACHE-PATHS
              List of directories to whitelist or blacklist for thumbnail caching.  See THUMBNAIL CACHING section for more information on the argument format.  These options are  mutually  exclusive,  if
              they are specified more than once then only the final one takes effect.

CONFIGURATION
       The following X resources are supported under "Nsxiv" (e.g.  Nsxiv.bar.font ):

       window.background
              Color of the window background

       window.foreground
              Color of the window foreground

       bar.font
              Name of Xft bar font

       bar.background
              Color of the bar background. Defaults to window.background

       bar.foreground
              Color of the bar foreground. Defaults to window.foreground

              Color of the mark foreground. Defaults to window.foreground

       Please see xrdb(1) on how to change them.

       An X resources entry with an empty value means the default (defined in config.h) will be used.

WINDOW TITLE
       The  window  title  can  be  replaced  with  the  output of a user-provided script, which is called by nsxiv whenever any of the relevant information changes.  The path of this script is $XDG_CON‐
       FIG_HOME/nsxiv/exec/win-title and the arguments given to it (where "Optional" arguments might be empty) are:

       $1  resolved absolute path of the current file

       $2  current file number

       $3  total file count

       $4  image width (Optional: Disabled on thumbnails mode)

       $5  image height (Optional: Disabled on thumbnails mode)

       $6  current zoom (Optional: Disabled on thumbnails mode)

       The term file is used rather than image as nsxiv does not precheck that the input files are valid images. Total file count may be different from the actual count of valid images.

       There is also an example script installed together with nsxiv as /usr/share/doc/nsxiv/examples/win-title.

STATUS BAR
       The information displayed on the left side of the status bar can be replaced with the output of user-provided script.

       The script that is called by nsxiv whenever an image gets loaded is located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nsxiv/exec/image-info and the arguments given to it are:

       $1  path to image file (as provided by the user)

       $2  image width

       $3  image height

       $4  fully resolved path to the image file

       In thumbnail mode, the script that is called is located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nsxiv/exec/thumb-info and the arguments given to it are:

       $1  path to image file (as provided by the user)

       $2  empty

       $3  empty

       $4  fully resolved path to the image file

       There are also example scripts installed together with nsxiv as /usr/share/doc/nsxiv/examples/image-info and /usr/share/doc/nsxiv/examples/thumb-info.

EXTERNAL KEY HANDLER
       Additional external keyboard commands can be defined using a handler program located in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nsxiv/exec/key-handler.  The handler is invoked by pressing Ctrl-x.  The next key combo  is
       passed  as  its  first  argument. Passed via stdin are the images to act upon: all marked images, if in thumbnail mode and at least one image has been marked, otherwise the current image. nsxiv(1)
       will block until the handler terminates. It then checks which images have been modified and reloads them.

       By default nsxiv(1) will send one image per-line to stdin, however when using -0 the image list will be NULL separated and the environment variable "$NSXIV_USING_NULL" will be set to 1.

       The key combo argument has the following form: "[C-][M-][S-]KEY", where C/M/S indicate Ctrl/Meta(Alt)/Shift modifier states and KEY is the X keysym as listed in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h  with‐
       out the "XK_" prefix.  If KEY has an uppercase equivalent, S-KEY is resolved into it. For instance, K replaces S-k and Scedilla replaces S-scedilla, but S-Delete is sent as-is.

       There is also an example script installed together with nsxiv as /usr/share/doc/nsxiv/examples/key-handler.

THUMBNAIL CACHING
       nsxiv stores all thumbnails under $XDG_CACHE_HOME/nsxiv/.

       Use the command line option -c to remove all orphaned cache files. Additionally, run the following command afterwards inside the cache directory to remove empty subdirectories:

              find . -depth -type d -empty ! -name '.' -exec rmdir {} \;

       The  option  --cache-allow  or  --cache-deny may be used to whitelists or blacklist certain directories from being cached.  The argument is a : separated list of paths. A * at the beginning of the
       path indicates that path should be matched recursively.

       For example: --cache-allow "/user/pictures:*/media/pictures" whitelists "/user/pictures" directory non-recursively and "/media/pictures" directory recursively. Nothing outside these  two  directo‐
       ries will be cached.  And --cache-deny "*/secret" will enable blacklist mode and will not cache anything inside "/secret" or it's subdirectories.
