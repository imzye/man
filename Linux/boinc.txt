NAME
       boinc - The BOINC client program.

SYNOPSIS
       boinc [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The BOINC "client", boinc, is the heart of BOINC.  It controls which project applications are run on your computer, downloading "Tasks" and uploading the resulting files from completed tasks. boinc is
       usually run in the background, ideally as a daemon. It can then be controlled either by a graphical tool called the BOINC Manager, boincmgr(1), or a command-line tool called boinccmd(1), by  means  of
       Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) over port 31416.

       The BOINC client can be controlled by command-line options, configuration files, and environment variables. Standard usage is simply to start the client running in the background.

OPTIONS
       These  command-line  options for boinc can be used to control how BOINC is started. Once the client has started, you should use a separate program, (boincmgr(1) or boinccmd(1)) which communicates with
       it by means of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).

   GENERAL OPTIONS
       --help Show options.

       --version
              Show version info.

       --run_cpu_benchmarks
              Run the CPU benchmarks.

       --check_all_logins
              For idle detection, check remote logins too.

       --daemon
              Run as daemon. Will redirect stderr and stdout to syslog.

       --dir path
              Use given dir as the client working directory.

       --no_gpus
              Don't check for GPUs.

       --no_info_fetch
              Don't fetch project list or client version info from boinc.berkeley.edu.

       --skip_cpu_benchmarks
              Don't run CPU benchmarks.

       --start_delay X
              Delay starting apps for X secs.

   PROJECT OPTIONS
       --attach_project URL key
              Attach to a project using URL and authenticator.

       --show_projects
              Show attached projects.

       --detach_project URL
              Detach from project specified by URL.

       --reset_project URL
              Reset (clear) the projectspecified by URL.

       --update_prefs URL
              Contact the project specified by URL to update preferences

   COMMUNICATION OPTIONS
       --allow_remote_gui_rpc
              Allow RPC connections from remote hosts.

       --gui_rpc_port port
              Port for RPCs.

       --no_gui_rpc
              Omits creation of a socket as required for the remote control of the client. Consequently the client cannot be controlled by external tools like GUIs (boincmgr etc.) or the console command tool
              (boinccmd).

   DEBUGGING OPTIONS
       --abort_jobs_on_exit
              When client exits, abort and report tasks.

       --allow_multiple_clients
              Allow more than one client instance per host.

       --exit_after_app_start N
              Exit N seconds after an app starts. Useful to look at the files in the slot directory.

       --exit_after_finish
              Exit right after finishing a task. Useful to look at the files in the slot directory.

       --exit_before_start
              Exit right before starting a task. Useful to look at the files in the slot directory.

       --exit_before_upload
              Exit right before starting an upload.

       --exit_when_idle
              Exit when there are no more tasks to work on.

       --fetch_minimal_work
              Fetch only 1 task per device.

       --file_xfer_giveup_period N
              Give up on file transfers after N sec.

       --master_fetch_interval N
              Limiting the period of project master file dowload retries.

       --master_fetch_period N
              Reload a project's master file after N RPC failures.

       --master_fetch_retry_cap N
              Exponential backoff limit for downloading project master files.

       --no_priority_change
              Run applications at same priority as client.

       --pers_giveup N
              Giveup time for persistent file transfer errors.

       --pers_retry_delay_max N
              Maximum time (sec) for file transfer exponential backoff.

       --pers_retry_delay_min N
              Minimum time (sec) for file transfer exponential backoff.

       --redirectio
              Redirect stdout and stderr to log files (stdoutdae.txt and stderrdae.txt).

       --retry_cap N
              Limit the maximum exponential backoff time.

       --sched_retry_delay_max N
              Maximum time (sec) for project RPC exponential backoff.

       --sched_retry_delay_min N
              Minimum time (sec) for project RPC exponential backoff.

       --unsigned_apps_ok
              Allow unsigned apps (for testing).

ACCESS CONTROL FOR GUI RPC
       By default the client accepts GUI RPC connections only from programs on the same host, which means that any user on this host can control the client.
