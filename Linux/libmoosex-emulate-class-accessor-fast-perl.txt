NAME
       MooseX::Adopt::Class::Accessor::Fast -
         Hijack Class::Accessor::Fast in %INC;

SYNOPSYS
           use MooseX::Adopt::Class::Accessor::Fast;
           use CAF::Using::Module;
           #that's it! JustWorks

DESCRIPTION
       This module attempts to hijack Class::Accessor::Fast in %INC and replace it with MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast. Make sure it is loaded before the classes you have that use
       <Class::Accessor::Fast>. It is meant as a tool to help you migrate your project from Class::Accessor::Fast, to
        MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast and ultimately, to Moose.
