NAME
       buckle -  Nostalgia bucklespring keyboard sound

SYNOPSIS
       buckle [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Buckle emulates the sound of an old IBM Model-M space saver bucklespring keyboard while typing within an X session.

       It  runs  as a background process and plays back the sound of each key pressed and released on the keyboard, just as if using an IBM Model-M.  The sound of each key has carefully been sampled, and
       is played back while simulating the proper distance and direction for a realistic 3D sound palette of pure nostalgic bliss.
