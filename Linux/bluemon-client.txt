DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the bluemon-client command.

       bluemon-client listens for events from the bluemon daemon and can start or stop programs when the given device is connected or disconnected. This can be used to perform actions like locking the termi‐
       nal when you walk away from it.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -u           --upcmd
                 The command to be run when the device is connected.

       -p           --protect
                 Try and protect against spoofing on the DBUS.  Requires signals to come from a process owned by the root user.
