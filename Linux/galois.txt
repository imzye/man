NAME
       galois - falling blocks game with blocks of various shapes and sizes

SYNOPSIS
       galois

DESCRIPTION
       Galois  is  a  computer game of the "falling blocks" type, but with unique features.  Unlike most other games of that type, it is not limited to blocks made of four two-dimensional, square bricks:
       you can choose among several different brick shapes, blocks composed of more or fewer bricks, and even between two- and three-dimensional games.

       Galois is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

CONFIGURATION
       Select Preferences from the application menu (if your environment supports that), or Game/Preferences from the menu bar to modify game settings and control keys.

FILES
       <config_dir>/galois/galois.conf : configuration file
       <data_dir>/galois/galois.res : scores file

       <config_dir> and <data_dir> are the paths returned by the glibmm functions get_user_config_dir() and get_user_data_dir() , respectively.  Typical values on GNU/Linux systems are $HOME/.config  and
       $HOME/.local/share
