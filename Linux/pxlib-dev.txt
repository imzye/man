NAME
       PX_get_data_short — Get value from short data field

SYNOPSIS
       #include <paradox.h>

       int PX_get_data_short(pxdoc_t *pxdoc, char *data, int len, short int *value)

DESCRIPTION
       Converts a data field as it stored in the database file into a short integer for the host architecture. You should use this function instead of accessing the data directly.

       data points to the start of the data field in the record. It must be calculated by summing up all field length before the field to operate on and add it to the base pointer of the record.

              Note:

              This function is deprecated and obsolete if PX_retrieve_record(3) is used.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 if the value is NULL, -1 in case of an error and 1 otherwise.
