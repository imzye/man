NAME
       sqfstar - tool to create a squashfs filesystem from a tar archive

SYNOPSIS
         cat xxx.tar | sqfstar [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [exclude files]
         zcat xxx.tgz | sqfstar [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [exclude files]
         xzcat xxx.tar.xz | sqfstar [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [exclude files]
         zstdcat xxx.tar.zst | sqfstar [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [exclude files]

DESCRIPTION
       Squashfs  is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4/zstd compression to compress both files, inodes and directo‐
       ries.  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum  of
       1Mbytes (default block size 128K).

       Squashfs  is  intended  for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block de‐
       vice/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed.

OPTIONS
   Filesystem build options:
       -comp COMP
              select COMP compression. Compressors available: gzip (default), lzo, lz4, xz, zstd, lzma.

       -b BLOCK_SIZE
              set data block to BLOCK_SIZE.  Default 128 Kbytes. Optionally a suffix of K or M can be given to specify Kbytes or Mbytes respectively.

       -reproducible
              build filesystems that are reproducible (default).

       -not-reproducible
              build filesystems that are not reproducible.

       -mkfs-time TIME

       -fstime TIME
              synonym for mkfs-time.

       -all-time TIME
              set all file timestamps to TIME, which is an unsigned 32-bit int indicating seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01).

       -exports
              make the filesystem exportable via NFS.

ENVIRONMENT
       SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
              If  set,  this  is  used  as  the  filesystem  creation  timestamp.   Also  any  file  timestamps which are after SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH will be clamped to
              SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.  See https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/ for more information.

EXAMPLES
       sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
              Create a Squashfs filesystem from the uncompressed tar file "archive.tar".  Sqfstar will use the default compressor (normally gzip), and block size of
              128 Kbytes.

       zcat archive.tgz | sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS
              Create  a  Squashfs  filesystem from the compressed tar file "archive.tgz". Sqfstar will use the default compressor (normally gzip), and block size of
              128 Kbytes.

       sqfstar -b 1M -comp zstd IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
              Use a block size of 1 Mbyte and Zstandard compression to create the filesystem.

       sqfstar -root-uid 0 -root-gid 0 IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
              Tar files do not supply a definition for the root directory, and the default is to make the directory owned/group owned by the user  running  Sqfstar.
              The above command sets the ownership/group ownership to root.

       sqfstar -root-mode 0755 IMAGE.SQFS < archive.tar
              The default permissions for the root directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx).  The above command sets the permissions to 0755 (rwxr-xr-x).

       sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS file1 file2 < archive.tar
              Exclude file1 and file2 from the tar file when creating filesystem.

       sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS "*.gz" < archive.tar
              Exclude any files in the top level directory which matches the wildcard pattern "*.gz".

       sqfstar IMAGE.SQFS "... *.gz" < archive.tar
              Exclude any file which matches the wildcard pattern "*.gz" anywhere within the tar file.  The initial "..." indicates the wildcard pattern is "non-an‐
              chored" and will match anywhere.

       Note: when passing wildcarded names to Sqfstar, they should be quoted (as in the above examples), to ensure that they are not processed by the shell.
