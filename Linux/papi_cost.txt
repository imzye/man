NAME
       papi_cost - papi_cost utility.

       file papi_cost.c

NAME
       papi_cost - computes execution time costs for basic PAPI operations.

Synopsis
       papi_cost [-dhs] [-b bins] [-t threshold]

Description
       papi_cost is a PAPI utility program that computes the min / max / mean
       / std. deviation of execution times for PAPI start/stop pairs and for
       PAPI reads. This information provides the basic operating cost to a
       user's program for collecting hardware counter data. Command line
       options control display capabilities.

Options
       · -b < bins > Define the number of bins into which the results are
         partitioned for display. The default is 100.
       · -d Display a graphical distribution of costs in a vertical histogram.
       · -h Display help information about this utility.
       · -s Show the number of iterations in each of the first 10 standard
         deviations above the mean.
       · -t < threshold > Set the threshold for the number of iterations to
         measure costs. The default is 100,000.
Bugs
       There are no known bugs in this utility. If you find a bug, it should
       be reported to the PAPI Mailing List at ptools-perfapi@icl.utk.edu.
