NAME
       ibdiscover.pl - annotate and compare InfiniBand topology

SYNOPSIS
       ibdiscover.pl

DESCRIPTION
       ibdiscover.pl  uses a topology file create by ibnetdiscover and a discover.map file which the network administrator creates which indicates the nodes to be expected and a ibdiscover.topo file which is
       the expected connectivity and produces a new connectivity file (discover.topo.new) and outputs the changes to stdout. The network administrator can choose to replace the "old" topo file with  the  new
       one or certain changes in.

       The syntax of the ibdiscover.map file is:

       <nodeGUID>|port|"Text for node"|<NodeDescription from ibnetdiscover format>

       e.g.

       8f10400410015|8|"ISR 6000"|# SW-6IB4 Voltaire port 0 lid 5

       8f10403960558|2|"HCA 1"|# MT23108 InfiniHost Mellanox Technologies

       The syntax of the old and new topo files (ibdiscover.topo and ibdiscover.topo.new) are:

       <LocalPort>|<LocalNodeGUID>|<RemotePort>|<RemoteNodeGUID>

       e.g.

       10|5442ba00003080|1|8f10400410015

       These topo files are produced by the ibdiscover.pl tool.
