CADO.CONF(5)                                                                                File Formats Manual                                                                                CADO.CONF(5)

NAME
       cado.conf - Capability Ambient DO: configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The  /etc/cado.conf  file is used to configure which ambient cabalities can be provided by cado to users.  cado uses the capability cap_dac_read_search to access /etc/cado.conf, so this configura‐
       tion does not need to be readable by users.

       All lines beginning with the sign '#' are comments.

       Non-comment lines have the following syntax
              list_of_capabilities: list_of_users_and_groups
       or
              list_of_capabilities: list_of_users_and_groups: list_of_auth_commands

       Both list_of_capabilities and list_of_users_and_groups are comma separated lists of identifiers.

       Items of list_of_capabilities are capability names or capability masks (exadecimal numbers).  For brevity, the cap_ prefix of capability names can be omitted (e.g. net_admin and cap_net_admin have
       the same meaning).

       Items of list_of_users_and_groups are usernames or groupnames (groupnames must be prefexed by '@').

       list_of_auth_commands is a command or a list of commands separated by semicolon (;). If present, cado runs all the sequence of commands it grants the capabilities as defined in  the  current  line
       only if all return zero as their exit status.

       Example of cado.conf file:

            # Capability Ambient DO configuration file
            # cado.conf

            net_admin: @netadmin,renzo: /usr/bin/logger cado net_admin $USER; /bin/echo OK
            net_admin: @privatenet: /usr/local/lib/cado_autorize_privatenet
            net_admin,net_bind_service,net_raw,net_broadcast: @vxvdex
            cap_kill: renzo

       In  this  example  the  renzo's processes can be granted (by cado) cap_net_admin and cap_kill.  cap_net_admin can be acquired by processes owned by users belonging to the netadmin group.  Users in
       vxvdex can provide their processes with a subset of cap_net_admin, cap_net_bind_service, cap_net_raw and cap_net_broadcast
