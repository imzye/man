NAME
       colortest-python - Display color test chart and convert between color values

SYNOPSIS
         colortest-python [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Displays 256, 88 and 16 color tables depending on what the terminal supports. Also provides for conversion between 256 and 88 color values.

       The program automatically detects 8, 16, 88, 256 color capabilities (via ncurses) and displays the appropriate color charts. Program can display the colors as blocks or 2d cubes optionally with
       color values overlaid in int or hex values, it can show the full rgb text string and show the display with a vertical (default) or horizontal orientation.

       In addition to the color charts it can also convert between 256 and 88 color values. This can be useful when converting various terminals like between urxvt and xterm-256.

       The goal of this program was to provide the functionality of all the various Perl and sh scripts in one place with some bells and whistles.
