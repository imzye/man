NAME
     nbfs2tga — Nintendo raw NBFS image to TGA converter

SYNOPSIS
     nbfs2tga [options] nbfs nbfp tga [width [height]]

DESCRIPTION
     nbfs2tga converts Nintendo's raw NBFS images into common TGA images.  Both an NBFS file, containing the pixel data, and an NBFP file with the palette data are needed.  If no height is specified, it is
     calculated using the width value and the size of the NBFS file.  If no width is specified either, this tool tries to guess the dimensions.  It might guess the wrong dimensions.

     nbfs
         The name of the NBFS file to read.  The NBFS contains the pixel graphics part of the image.
     nbfp
         The name of the NBFP file to use.  The NBFP file contains the palette part of the image.
     tga
         The resulting TGA file will be written there.
     width
         The width of the NBFS image.
     height
         The height of the NBFS image.

EXAMPLES
     Convert an NBFS+NBFP into a TGA and specify dimensions:

           $ nbfs2tga a.nbfs a.nbfp a.tga 64 64

     Convert an NBFS+NBFP into a TGA and only specify width:

           $ nbfs2tga a.nbfs a.nbfp a.tga 64

     Convert an NBFS+NBFP into a TGA and guess image dimensions:

           $ nbfs2tga a.nbfs a.nbfp a.tga
