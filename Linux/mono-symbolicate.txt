SYNOPSIS
       mono-symbolicate <msym dir> <input file>

       mono-symbolicate store-symbols <msym dir> [<dir>]+

DESCRIPTION
       mono-symbolicate  is  a tool that converts a stack trace with <filename
       unknown>:0 into one with file names and line numbers.

       When mono-symbolicate is called with a symbol directory and a file con‐
       taining a stacktrace:

       mono-symbolicate <msym dir> <input file>

       The  tool  writes into stdout the file contents while adding file loca‐
       tion to stack frames when it is possible to symbolicate with  the  sym‐
       bols available on the symbol directory.

       Managed  symbols  .exe/.dll  can  be  added  to the symbol directory by
       doing:

       mono-symbolicate store-symbols <msym dir> [<dir>]+
