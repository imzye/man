NAME
       ntthal - Provides Primer3's alignment functionality based on nearest-neighbor thermodynamical approach

DESCRIPTION
       ntthal is analogous to ntdpal.  Between two sequences, ntthal finds alignment/sec structure, that has the highest melting temperature. Ntthal is based on nearest-neighbor thermodynamical approach.

SYNOPSIS
       ntthal OPTIONS oligo

OPTIONS
       -mv monovalent_conc  - concentration of monovalent cations in mM, by default 50 mM

       -dv divalent_conc    - concentration of divalent cations in mM, by default 0 mM

       -n  dNTP_conc        - concentration of deoxynycleotide triphosphate in mM, by default 0 mM

       -d  dna_conc         - concentration of DNA strands in nM, by default 50 nM

       -a  mode             - alignment type, END1, END2, ANY and HAIRPIN, by default ANY (when duplex)

       -t  temp             - temperature at which duplex is calculated, by default 37C

       -r                   - causes the alignment NOT to be displayed on stderr, _only_ Tm is printed

       -maxloop size        - the maximum size of secondary structures loops.

              Default is 30 (this is maximum allowed length, currently).

       -path <path>         - the path to the thermodynamic parameter files

       -s1 DNA_oligomer

       -s2 DNA_oligomer
