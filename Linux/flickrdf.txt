FLICKRDF(1)                 General Commands Manual                FLICKRDF(1)

NAME
       flickrdf - call Flickr API

SYNOPSIS
       flickrdf [-d DELAY] [-a FROB] [-h] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       flickrdf is a utility that uses the photos.getInfo API to interpret the
       description fields and the tags for a photo URI into  RDF  triples.  If
       raptor is present, it will be used to provide proper serializing to RDF
       rather than the built in and hacky ntriples/turtle output.

       Machine tags when they are found are scanned for  xmlns:prefix=uri  and
       then all other machine tags with that prefix turn into triples. Several
       prefixes are also pre-defined  by  the  library  to  automatically  get
       turned into triples without an xmlns, such as blue:, cell:, filter: and
       geo:. Non-machine tags are not yet interpreted.

OPTIONS
