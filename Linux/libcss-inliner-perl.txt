NAME
       CSS::Inliner::Parser - Interface through which to read/write CSS files while respecting the cascade order

       NOTE: This sub-module very seriously focuses on respecting cascade order. As such this module is not for you
             if you want to modified a stylesheet once it's read. If you are looking for that functionality you may
             want to look at the sister module, CSS::Simple

SYNOPSIS
        use CSS::Inliner::Parser;

        my $css = new CSS::Inliner::Parser();

        $css->read({ filename => 'input.css' });

        #perform manipulations...

        $css->write({ filename => 'output.css' });

DESCRIPTION
       Class for reading and writing CSS. Unlike other CSS classes on CPAN this particular module focuses on respecting the order of selectors. This is very useful for things like... inlining CSS, or for
       similar "strict" CSS work.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ([ OPTIONS ])
           Instantiates the CSS::Inliner::Parser object. Sets up class variables that are used during file parsing/processing.

           warns_as_errors (optional). Boolean value to indicate whether fatal errors should occur during parse failures.

METHODS
       read_file( params )
           Opens and reads a CSS file, then subsequently performs the parsing of the CSS file necessary for later manipulation.

           This method requires you to pass in a params hash that contains a filename argument. For example:

           $self->read_file({ filename => 'myfile.css' });

       read( params )
           Reads css data and parses it. The intermediate data is stored in class variables.

           Compound  selectors  (i.e. "a, span") are split apart during parsing and stored separately, so the output of any given stylesheet may not match the output 100%, but the rules themselves should
           apply as expected.

           This method requires you to pass in a params hash that contains scalar css data. For example:

           $self->read({ css => $css });

       write_file()
           Write the parsed and manipulated CSS out to a file parameter

           This method requires you to pass in a params hash that contains a filename argument. For example:

           $self->write_file({ filename => 'myfile.css' });

       write()
           Write the parsed and manipulated CSS out to a scalar and return it

           This code makes some assumptions about the nature of the prelude and data portions of the stored css rules and possibly is insufficient.

       content_warnings()
           Return back any warnings thrown while parsing a given block of css

           Note: content warnings are initialized at read time. In order to receive back content feedback you must perform read() first.

       get_rules( params )
           Get an array of rules representing the composition of the stylesheet. These rules are returned in the exact order that they were discovered. Both qualified and at rules are  returned  by  this
           method. It is left to the caller to pull out the kinds of rules your application needs to accomplish your goals.

           The structures returned match up with the fields set while adding the rules via the add_x_rule collection methods.

           Specifically at-rules will contain a type, prelude and block while qualified rules will contain a selector and declarations.

       add_qualified_rule( params )
           Add a qualified CSS rule to the ruleset store.

           The  most  common type of CSS rule is a qualified rule. This term became more prominent with the rise of CSS3, but is still relevant when handling earlier versions of the standard. These rules
           have a prelude consisting of a CSS selector, along with a data block consisting of various rule declarations.

           Adding a qualified rule is trivial, for example: $self->add_qualified_rule({ selector => 'p > a', block => 'color: blue;' });

       add_at_rule( params )
           Add an at-rule to the ruleset store.

           The less common variants of CSS rules are know as at-rules. These rules implement various behaviours through various expressions containing a rule type, prelude and associated data block.  The
           standard is evolving here, so it is not easy to enumerate such examples, but these rules always start with @.

           At rules are a little more complex, an example: $self->add_at_rule({ type => '@media', prelude => 'print', block => 'body { font-size: 10pt; }' });
