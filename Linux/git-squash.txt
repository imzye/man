NAME
       git-squash - squash N last changes up to a ref´ed commit

SYNOPSIS
       git-squash  [<--squash-msg>]  <source-branch|commit  ref> [<commit-mes‐
       sage>]

DESCRIPTION
       Squash the N last changes in the current branch, where N is  the  range
       of commits from the given ref up to HEAD.

OPTIONS
       <source-branch>

       Branch to squash on the current branch.

       <commit  reference>  A  commit  reference  (has  to be from the current
       branch) can also be used as the first  argument.  A  range  of  commits
       sha..HEAD will be squashed.

       <--squash-msg>

       Commit  the squash result with the concatenated squashed committed mes‐
       sages. This option can not be used together with <commit-message>.

       <commit-message>

       If commit-message is given, commit the squashed result,  otherwise  the
       squash remains just added to the index and is not committed.

EXAMPLES
       # squash changes and follow up with separate commit step
       $ git squash my-other-branch
       Updating a2740f5..533b19c
       Fast-forward
       Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
        my-changed-file | 1 +
        1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
       $ git commit -m "New commit without a real merge"

       # squash and commit with given message
       $ git squash HEAD~3 "Commit message"

       # squash and commit and concatenate all messages
       $ git squash --squash-msg @~3
