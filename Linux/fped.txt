NAME
       fped - Footprint editor

SYNOPSIS
       fped   [-k] [-p|-P [-s scale]] [-T [-T]] [cpp_option ...] [in_file [out_file]]

DESCRIPTION
       fped  is an editor that allows the interactive creation of footprints of electronic components. Footprint definitions are stored in a text format that resem‐
       bles a programming language.  The language is constrained such that anything that can be expressed in the  textual  definition  also  has  a  straightforward
       equivalent  operation  that  can  be  performed  through  the  GUI.  A description of the GUI can be found here: http://downloads.qi-hardware.com/people/wer‐
       ner/fped/gui.html
