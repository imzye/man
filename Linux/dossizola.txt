NAME
       dossizola - Isola game with nice graphics

SYNOPSIS
       dossizola [ -h ] [ -f ] [ -w ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the dossizola command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       The goal of the Isola game is to block the opponent by destroying the squares which surround him.  In each turn, each player must first move to one of the squares adjacent to his current position,
       and then destroy a square of his choice.  The first player who is unable to move loses.

       Do'SSi Zo'la provides several extension to the original rules, by allowing several moves and/or to destroy several squares in each turn.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -f     Run in full-screen mode.

       -w     Run in windowed mode.
