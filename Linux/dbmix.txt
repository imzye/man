NAME
       DBMix - Digital Audio Mixing System

SYNOPSIS
       dbcat [options]
       dbfsd [options]
       dbin [options]
       dbmixer

DESCRIPTION
       The  DBMix  system is able to combine sound from various sources into a single audio stream.  Think of it as a virtual DJ mixing desk.  Mixing uses a Fourier
       synthesis algorithm to maintain sound quality in the output stream.

       The dbfsd daemon serves as DBMix's backend--that's where most of the real synthesis work is done.  Several clients allow to connect different  audio  sources
       to  the backend.  dbin links line-in, or microphone input from the sound card to DBMix.  And there's dbcat, a pretty generic tool that redirects its standard
       input to a dbfsd channel.  Actual DJ work is done using the graphical frontend dbmixer.

       For an in-depth description of each application, see its respective man page.
