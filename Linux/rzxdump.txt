NAME
       rzxdump — List contents of Sinclair ZX Spectrum input recording files

SYNOPSIS
       rzxdump [OPTION] rzxfile...

DESCRIPTION
       rzxdump  outputs  a  description of the contents of RZX input recording
       files.

OPTIONS
       -s     any snapshot found in the RZX file will be dumped to a file. The
              filename is the name of the RZX file, followed by the block num‐
              ber and the snapshot extension, e.g. `game_0.szx'.  Unlike  rzx‐
              tool,  the  snapshot  is not processed by libspectrum and is ex‐
              tracted unaltered.

              give brief usage help, listing available options.

       -V, --version
              output version information.

       rzxfile
              specifies an input recording  file  whose  contents  are  to  be
              listed.

BUGS
       The  contents  of  compressed blocks are not displayed with in a useful
       fashion.
