NAME
       vamps - Tool to recompress and modify the structure of a DVD

SYNOPSIS
       vamps  [--evaporate|-e  factor]  [--ps-evaporate|-E  factor] [--audio|-a a-streama-stream...] [--subpictures|-s s-stream,s-stream,...]  [--verbose|-v] [--inject|-i injections-file] [--preserve|-p]
       [--ps-size|-S input-bytes] <input>output ...

DESCRIPTION
       Vamps was written to make cheap backups of DVDs under Linux.

       Vamps builds a wrapper around the requantizer to extract the elementary MPEG2 video stream from the DVD's program stream, feed it through the requantizer and finally re-pack it  into  the  program
       stream  again. Besides this, Vamps allows one to select audio and subtitle streams that should be copied into the output stream. This gives another small gain of disk space, since unwanted streams
       may be discarded.

       Vamps is only a very basic, but nevertheless essential tool to transcode DVD videos to a smaller size.  Vamps does not need to write temporary data files, which is a  major  advantage.   Vamps  is
       very fast. The downside is, that Vamps is not capable of making DVD backups on its own.

OPTIONS
       For options that require an argument, each duplication will override the previous argument value.

       --evaporate, -e factor
              factor by which the embedded elementary video stream will approximately be shrunk (>=1.0)

       --ps-evaporate, -E factor
              factor by which the whole program stream will approximately be shrunk (>=1.0) -e and -E are mutually exclusive.

       --audio, -a a-streama-stream...
              select audio streams to keep. First stream is 1.

       --subpictures, -s s-streams-stream...
              select subtitle streams to keep. First stream is 1.

       --verbose, -v
              Increase verbosity level by one.

       --inject, -i injections-file
              Load  internal  variable  settings  from file to seamlessly continue previous run. Write internal variables to file at program termination.  If file does not exist, it is created. Useful to
              shrink several parts (chapters, titles) to a single target DVD.

       --preserve, -p
              Preserve numbering of audio and subtitle streams. If called without this option, Vamps renumbers the streams to ascending numbers starting with 1. This option disables  renumbering  so  the
              original stream numbers are kept.

       --ps-size, -S input-bytes
              If the input for Vamps does not come from a file (e.g. a pipe), the size of the full input program stream *MUST* be supplied in the command line. Size is in bytes.
