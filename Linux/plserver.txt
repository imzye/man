NAME
       plserver - PLplot graphics server

SYNOPSIS
       plserver [args]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the plserver, command.

       plserver  is  just a front-end to the pltkMain() function.  Structured along the preferred lines for extended wish'es.  It typically runs as a child process from the PLplot TK driver to render output.
       Can use either TK send or Tcl-DP RPC for communication, depending on how it is invoked.

       Note that plserver can be used the same way as wish or dpwish, as it contains the functionality of each of these (except the -notk Tcl-DP command-line option is not supported).

       See /usr/share/doc/plplot/plplot.ps.gz for more details.
