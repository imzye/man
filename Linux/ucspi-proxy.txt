NAME
       ucspi-proxy - Copy data between a UCSPI client and server

SYNOPSIS
       ucspi-proxy [ -v ] [ -t TIMEOUT ] [ HOST PORT ]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is a simple loop copying data from a UCSPI server (file descriptor 0) to a client, and from a client to a server (FD 1).  If either socket closes, ucspi-proxy exits.  The other ucspi-
       proxy-* programs are based on this simple loop and have similar usage.

       If  HOST  and  PORT  are given on the command line, ucspi-proxy will make a TCP connection with the given parameters.  If neither are present, ucspi-proxy will use file descriptor 6 for the client
       socket, as provided by UCSPI client programs.

OPTIONS
       -l MAXLINE
              The maximum length of lines (from either server or client) to copy to the log. Defaults to 64.

       -t TIMEOUT
              When making an connection, ucspi-proxy will wait a maximum of TIMEOUT seconds before giving up.  Defaults to 30.

       -v     Print messages about errors and byte counts.  Without this option, ucspi-proxy is silent.

RETURN VALUE
       Exits 0 if a normal end of file was reached on one of the sockets.  Otherwise it exits 1.
