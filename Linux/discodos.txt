NAME
       disco-search - search, edit and update DiscoDOS releases and tracks

SYNOPSIS
       disco search [--help] [--mix | --discogs-update | --brainz-update | --edit] [--track] [--pos] [--resume] search_terms

DESCRIPTION
       the  search  command  searches  for releases and tracks in the Discogs collection. Several actions can be executed on the found items, eg. adding to a mix, updating track info from Discogs or
       fetching additional information from MusicBrainz/AcousticBrainz or simply adding track information by hand (user-defined BPM/key, track notes, user-defined AcousticBrainz recording ID).

ARGUMENTS
       search_terms
               The collection is searched for these terms. When offline, it searches through all releases' artists/titles only (eg tracknames not considered).  When online, the  Discogs  API  search
               engine  is  used  and also tracknames, artists, labels and catalog numbers are looked through. If your search term consists of multiple words, put them inside double quotes (eg.  "foo
               bar term"). If you instead put a number as your search term, it is assumed you want to view exactly the Discogs release with the given ID. If search term is the special keyword "all",
               a list of all releases in the DiscoBASE is shown (including weblinks to Discogs/MusicBrainz release pages). In combination with -u, -z or -zz respectively,  all  tracks  are  updated.
               Note that this is exactely the same as " disco import " in combination with those options.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               show this help message and exit

       -m MIX_NAME, --mix MIX_NAME
               adds a track of the found release to the given mix ID (asks which track to add in case -t is missing).

       -u, --discogs-update
               updates found release/track with Discogs track/artist details (asks which track to update in case -t is missing).

       -z, --brainz-update
               updates  found  release/track  with  additional  info from MusicBrainz and AcousticBrainz. (asks which track to update in case -t is missing) -z quick match, -zz detailed match (takes
               longer, but more results).

       -e, --edit
               edits/adds details to a found release/track. Editable fields: key, BPM, key notes, general track notes, custom MusicBrainz recording ID. (asks which track to edit in case -t is  miss‐
               ing).

       -t TRACK_NUMBER, --track TRACK_NUMBER
               in  combination  with  -m this option adds the given track number (eg. A1, AA, B2, ...) to the mix selected using .Fl m ; in combination with -z or -u the given track is the one being
               updated with *Brainz or Discogs details; in combination with -e the given track is to one to be edited.

       -p POS_IN_MIX, --pos POS_IN_MIX
               in combination with -m this option states that we'd like to insert the track at the given position (eg. 1, 14, ...), rather than at the end of the mix; in combination with -z, -zz, -u
               or -e this option is ignored.

       --resume OFFSET
               resumes long-running processes at the given offset position (expects a number). You can combine this option currently with *Brainz matching operations only ( -z, -zz )
