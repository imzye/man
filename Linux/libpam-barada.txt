NAME
       pam_barada - PAM module to allow HOTP authentication

SYNOPSIS
       pam_barada.so

DESCRIPTION
       This PAM  module is designed to provide two-factor authentication support, based on an algorithm outlined in RFC 4226 known as HOTP.

       And  that's  why  this exists. It's an implementation of the HOTP protocol in the form of a PAM module. Basically, in addition to a normal password, users are also assigned a 128 bit key and arbi‐
       trary-length PIN number. Every time you'd like to login using a OTP, you calculate a secure hash based on your assigned PIN and an increasing counter, the result of which is a  six  character  one
       time password.

       While  this module could be used in conjunction with many different client devices, it was written specifically with Android devices in mind.  There is companion software which runs on Android, so
       that your phone essentially becomes a SecureID token.  All you need to do is open up the software, type in your PIN, and you get back a 6-character number that you can use to login to your system.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Only the auth type is provided.

EXAMPLES
       Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to HOTP style login:

              auth    sufficient  pam_barada.so
