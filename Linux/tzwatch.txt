NAME
       tzwatch - Display the time in a number of time zones, specified by the user

SYNOPSIS
       tzwatch [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Tzwatch displays the time in a number of time zones, specified by the user.  The list of time zones (format as TZ variable) is kept in ${HOME}/.tzlist. The time zone is chosen using tzselect.

OPTIONS
       -c     Configure time zones (add or remove).

       -f FORMAT
              Display time according to FORMAT (see 'date' command).

       If no command line options are given, the time in each zone at the given moment is printed.

REMARKS
       ${HOME}/.tzlist could be edited by hand, with a valid value for the TZ variable on each line.

       Tzwatch was written by Drew Parsons <dparsons@debian.org>.  This manual page was written by Joop Stakenborg <pa3aba@debian.org>, for the Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).
