NAME
           Math::Amoeba - Multidimensional Function Minimisation

SYNOPSIS
           use Math::Amoeba qw(ConstructVertices EvaluateVertices Amoeba MinimiseND);
           my ($vertice,$y)=MinimiseND(\@guess,\@scales,\&func,$tol,$itmax,$verbose);
           my @vertices=ConstructVertices(\@vector,\@offsets);
           my @y=EvaluateVertices(\@vertices,\&func);
           my ($vertice,$y)=Amoeba(\@vertices,\@y,\&func,$tol,$itmax,$verbose);

DESCRIPTION
       This is an implimenation of the Downhill Simpex Method in Multidimensions (Nelder and Mead) for finding the (local) minimum of a function. Doing this in Perl makes it easy for that function to
       actually be the output of another program such as a simulator.

       Arrays and the function are passed by reference to the routines.

       "MinimiseND"
           The  simplest  use  is  the  MinimiseND  function.  This  takes  a reference to an array of guess values for the parameters at the function minimum, a reference to an array of scales for these
           parameters (sensible ranges around the guess in which to look), a reference to the function, a convergence tolerence for the minimum, the maximum number of  iterations  to  be  taken  and  the
           verbose flag (default ON).  It returns an array consisting of a reference to the function parameters at the minimum and the value there.

       "Amoeba"
           The  Amoeba  function is the actual implimentation of the Downhill Simpex Method in Multidimensions. It takes a reference to an array of references to arrays which are the initial n+1 vertices
           (where n is the number of function parameters), a reference to the function valuation at these vertices, a reference to the function, a convergence  tolerence  for  the  minimum,  the  maximum
           number of iterations to be taken and the verbose flag (default ON).  It returns an array consisting of a reference to the function parameters at the minimum and the value there.

       "ConstructVertices"
           The ConstructVertices is used by MinimiseND to construct the initial vertices for Amoeba as the initial guess plus the parameter scale parameters as vectors along the parameter axis.

       "EvaluateVertices"
           The EvaluateVertices takes these set of vertices, calling the function for each one and returning the vector of results.

EXAMPLE
           use Math::Amoeba qw(MinimiseND);
           sub afunc {
             my ($a,$b)=@_;
             print "$a\t$b\n";
             return ($a-7)**2+($b+3)**2;
           }
           my @guess=(1,1);
           my @scale=(1,1);
           ($p,$y)=MinimiseND(\@guess,\@scale,\&afunc,1e-7,100);
           print "(",join(',',@{$p}),")=$y\n";

       produces the output
