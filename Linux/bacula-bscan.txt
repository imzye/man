NAME
        bscan - Bacula's 'Scan tape'

SYNOPSIS
       bscan [options] bacula-archive

DESCRIPTION
       The  purpose  of bscan is to read (scan) a Bacula Volume and to recreate or update the database contents with the information found on the Volume.  This is done in a non-destructive way. This per‐
       mits restoring database entries that have been lost by pruning, purging, deleting, or a database corruption problem.

       Normally, it should not be necessary to run the bscan command because the database is self maintaining, and most corrupted databases can be repaired by the tools provided by the database  vendors.
       In addition, if you have maintained bootstrap files during backups, you should be able to recover all your data from the bootstrap file without needed an up to date catalog.
