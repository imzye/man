SYNOPSIS
       pvfs2-ln -s [-Vvh] target link_name

DESCRIPTION
       The  pvfs2-ln  utility creates a soft link (symlink) at link_name which
       points to target where target will  be  in  an  OrangeFS  volume.   The
       link_name  may refer to files across file systems and even non-existent
       files.

       The options are as follows:

       -V     Display verbose messages.

       -v     Print version number and exit.

       -h     Display synopsis.
