       Many thanks to "perl-qa" for arguing about this so much that I just went ahead and did it :)

       Thanks to Aristotle for suggesting a better way to die or bailout.

       Thanks to 'swillert' (<http://use.perl.org/~swillert/>) for suggesting a better implementation of my "dumper explain" idea (<http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/37004>).
