KISSATTACH(8)            Linux System Managers Manual            KISSATTACH(8)

NAME
       kissattach, spattach - Attach a KISS or 6PACK interface

SYNOPSIS
       kissattach [-b] [-6] [-l] [-m mtu] [-v] tty port [inetaddr]

       spattach [-b] [-l] [-m mtu] [-v] tty port [inetaddr]

DESCRIPTION
       Attach  a KISS or a 6PACK interface to what is normally a tty line con‐
       nected to a TNC in KISS or 6PACK mode. This program  will  turn  itself
       into a background process. To down an interface send its attach process
       a SIGTERM.

       Kissattach takes many of the parameters  for  the  port  from  the  ax‐
       ports(5)  file. If the speed parameter in the file is not equal to zero
       then it is used for the serial port speed, a zero value means  that  no
       speed  is  set.  The paclen parameter is used for the device mtu unless
       overridden by a value on the command line.

       The tty argument will typically be that of a serial port with a KISS or
       6PACK  TNC  attached,  although it could be a pseudo tty or a KISS port
       emulator such as an SCC card. Kissattach supports BSD-style pseudo-ter‐
       minals as well as the Unix98 pty's. If the tty argument is "/dev/ptmx",
       then Unix98 behaviour will automaticaly take effekt. With Unix98 pty's,
       the  slave  tty  name  could not be forseen. That's why kissattach will
       print the corresponding slave pty name as a separate line on stdout.

       The port argument is the name of a port  as  given  in  the  axports(5)
       file.

       The  optional inetaddr argument is the IP address of the new interface.
       Some time it was mandatory argument (although due to historical reasons
       this  restriction  is lifted if the old -i option is used). But there's
       really not a need for the interface to have an IP address assigned to.

OPTIONS
       -6              Use the 6PACK line discipline instead of KISS. This  is
                       the default if the program is called as spattach.

       -i inetaddr     Set the internet address of the interface. This address
                       may either be a dotted decimal address or a host  name.
                       This  option  is  now  depreciated and the program will
                       complain about it, though still work.

       -l              Log messages to the system log, the default is not to.

       -b              Allow broadcasts on the interface (default no - because
                       for e.g. samba broadcasts are a pain..)

       -m mtu          Sets  the  mtu  of  the interface. If this value is not
                       given then the value is taken from the paclen parameter
                       in axports.

       -v              Display the version.
