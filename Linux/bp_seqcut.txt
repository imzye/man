NAME
       bp_seqcut.pl - cut FASTA sequences with a given range

USAGE
        bp_seqcut.pl [options -h,-s,-e,-f,-w] <FILES>...
        bp_seqcut.pl [options -h,-f,-w] s-e <FILES>...

          -h this help message
          -s which residue to start cutting on
          -e which residue to finish cutting on
          -f format of the files, defaults to FASTA but you can specify anything supported by SeqIO from BioPerl
          -w hard wrap width, this might not be supported depending on which format you are using

Description
       A script to cut FASTA sequences with a given range `fastacut -s 1 -e 10 *.fasta` or `fastacut 1-10 *.fasta`.  This is just a convenience wrapper around the Bio::SeqIO module. Useful if you wish to
       trim out a section of an alignment to build a profile of a specific region of sequence.
