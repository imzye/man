NAME
       co2brinepvt - compute and print pvt properties for co2 with brine

SYNOPSIS
       co2brinepvt [OPTIONS] PROPERTY PHASE PRESSURE TEMPERATURE [SALINITY] [RS] [RV] [SALTMODEL] [THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_GAS] [THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_LIQUID] [THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_SALT]

DESCRIPTION
       co2brinepvt  computes  PVT  PROPERTY  of a brine/co2 system. The computation is performed for a given PHASE (oil or brine), PRESSURE (in bar), TEMPERATURE (in Celsius),  SALINITY (salt molality in
       mol/kg) and RS (amount of dissolved CO2 in Brine in SM3/SM3), RV (amount of vaporized water in Gas in SM3/SM3), salt model (SALTMODEL), model of thermal mixing of  gas,  liquid,  amd  salt  (THER‐
       MAL_MIXING_MODEL_GAS ans THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_LIQUID, respectively).

       See CO2STORE in the OPM manual for more details.

       PROPERTY, the property computed, may be one of
              - density (the density)
              - invB (the inverse phase formation volume factor
              - viscosity
              - rSat (saturated dissolution factor)
              - internalEnergy (internal Energy)
              - enthalpy
              - diffusionCoefficient (the diffusion coefficient)

       SALTMODEL, the model to use for salt, may be one of
              - 0 = no salt activity
              - 1 = Rumpf et al (1996) [default]
              - 2 = Duan-Sun in Spycher & Pruess (2009)
              - 3 = Duan-Sun in Sycher & Pruess (2005)

       THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_GAS, the model of thermal mixing for gas, may be
       one of
              - 0 = pure component [default]
              - 1 = ideal mixing

       THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_LIQUID, the model of thermal mixing for liquid, may be
       one of
              - 0 = pure component
              - 1 = ideal mixing
              - 2 = heat of dissolution according to duan sun [default]

       THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_SALT, the model of thermal mixing for salt, may be
       one of
              - 0 = pure water
              - 1 = model in MICHAELIDES [default]
