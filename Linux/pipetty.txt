pipetty(1)                  General Commands Manual                 pipetty(1)

NAME
       pipetty - a tool to pipe from a pseudoterminal

SYNOPSIS
       pipetty command [ args...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       pipetty  lets you make a program unaware that its output is being redi‐
       rected.  This is usually useful for tools that detect  whether  they're
       run  from  a  terminal and modify their output, typically colorizing it
       only when run interactively.

       Usually, disabling colors when redirected is a good thing as most tools
       can't  cope with ANSI codes.  Use pipetty when you do want colors, like
       when you're going to feed that output to ansi2html or less -R.

CAVEATS
       Certain programs, such as bash, don't quite like their stdin to be on a
       different terminal than stdout.

SEE ALSO
       ansi2html, ansi2txt, less.
