NAME
       pcp - Recursive, parallel copy of directory trees

SYNOPSIS
          pcp [options] <source> [<source> ...] <destination>

DESCRIPTION
       The  pcp  command  is a is a wrapper that starts several sync processes to copy directory trees in parallel. This is allows much better copying performance on file system that have relatively high
       latency when retrieving individual files like S3QL.

       Note: Using this program only improves performance when copying from an S3QL file system. When copying to an S3QL file system, using pcp is more likely to decrease performance.

OPTIONS
       The pcp command accepts the following options:

          --log <target>
                 Destination for log messages. Specify none for standard output or syslog for the system logging daemon. Anything else will be interpreted as a file name. Log files will be  rotated  when
                 they reach 1 MiB, and at most 5 old log files will be kept. Default: None

          --quiet
                 be really quiet

          --debug-modules <modules>
                 Activate  debugging output from specified modules (use commas to separate multiple modules, 'all' for everything). Debug messages will be written to the target specified by the --log op‐
                 tion.

          --debug
                 Activate debugging output from all S3QL modules. Debug messages will be written to the target specified by the --log option.

          --version
                 just print program version and exit

          -a     Pass -aHAX option to rsync.

          --processes <no>
                 Number of rsync processes to use (default: 10).

EXIT CODES
       pcp may terminate with the following exit codes:

       0      Everything went well.

       1      An unexpected error occurred. This may indicate a bug in the program.

       2      Invalid command line argument or configuration file key.
