NAME
       pdsend - send messages to pd on this or a remote machine

SYNOPSIS
       pdsend port-number [hostname] [udp|tcp]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdsend  sends  messages  to pd(1), via a socket connection, from pdsend's standard input.  This input can be any stream of Pd messages separated by semicolons.  This is probably the easiest way to
       control pd from another application.  The protocol used is easy to implement and is called FUDI.

       The port number should agree with the port number of a "netreceive" object within pd.  The hostname is "localhost" by default and can be a domain name or an IP address.  The protocol is  "tcp"  by
       default;  this  does  a  handshake  to guarantee that all messages arrive complete and in their correct order; if you are sending messages locally or point-to-point you can often get away with the
       faster udp protocol instead.

       You can also use this to talk to a Max "pdnetreceive" object or even just a "pdreceive" in another shell.  If  you're  writing  another  program  you're  welcome  to  just  grab  the  sources  for
       pdsend/pdreceive and adapt them to your own ends; they're part of the Pd distribution.
