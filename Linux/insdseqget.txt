NAME
       insdseqget - format sequences from GenBank as an XML INSDSet

SYNOPSIS
       insdseqget [-] [-d filename] [-i filename] [-m n/p/b] [-n] [-o filename] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       insdseqget retrieves biological sequence data from GenBank (according to an input list of GI accession numbers) and prints it out as an XML INSDSet document.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -      Print usage message

       -d filename
              Input file name for date list (desired accessions, one per line, followed by a blank line and a list of allowed dates, also one per line)

       -i filename
              Input file name for GI list (default = stdin)

       -m n/p/b
              Molecule type:
              n      Nucleotide (default)
              p      Protein
              b      Both

       -n     Return only new records (for which the given GI refers to an old version)

       -o filename
              Output file name for the XML INSDSet (default = stdout)

       -v     Fetch SNP Variations
