NAME
       vdoaudit - confirm the reference counts of a VDO device

SYNOPSIS
       vdoaudit [options...]  filename

DESCRIPTION
       vdoaudit  adds  up  the  logical  block  references to all physical blocks of a VDO device found in filename, then compares that sum to the stored number of logical blocks. It also confirms all of the
       actual reference counts on all physical blocks against the stored reference counts. Finally, it validates that the slab summary approximation of the free blocks in each slab is correct.

       If --verbose is specified, a line item will be reported for each inconsistency; otherwise a summary of the problems will be displayed.

OPTIONS
