Excel::Template::Container::Loop(3pm)                                               User Contributed Perl Documentation                                               Excel::Template::Container::Loop(3pm)

NAME
       Excel::Template::Container::Loop - Excel::Template::Container::Loop

PURPOSE
       To provide looping

NODE NAME
       LOOP

INHERITANCE
       Excel::Template::Container

ATTRIBUTES
       •   NAME

           This is the name of the loop. It's used to identify within the parameter set what variables to expose to the children nodes each iteration.

CHILDREN
       None

EFFECTS
       None

DEPENDENCIES
       None

USAGE
         <loop name="LOOPY">
           ... Children here ...
         </loop>

       In the above example, the children nodes would have access to the LOOPY array of hashes as parameters. Each iteration through the array would expose a different hash of parameters to the children.

       These loops work just like HTML::Template's loops. (I promise I'll give more info here!)

       There  is  one  difference  - I prefer using Perl-like scoping, so accessing of variables outside the LOOP scope from within is perfectly acceptable. You can also hide outside variables with inner
       values, if you desire, just like Perl.
