NAME
       protoc - compile protocol buffer description files

SYNOPSIS

       protoc [--cpp_out=OUT_DIR] [--java_out=OUT_DIR] [--python_out=OUT_DIR] [-IPATH | --proto_path=PATH] PROTO_FILE

       protoc {-h | --help}

       protoc --version

DESCRIPTION
       protoc is a compiler for protocol buffers definitions files. It can can generate C++, Java and Python source code for the classes defined in PROTO_FILE.

OPTIONS
       -IPATH, --proto_path=PATH
           Specify the directory in which to search for imports. May be specified multiple times; directories will be searched in order. If not given, the current working directory is used.

       --cpp_out=OUT_DIR
           Enable generation of C++ bindings and store them in OUT_DIR.

       --java_out=OUT_DIR
           Enable generation of Java bindings and store them in OUT_DIR.

       --python_out=OUT_DIR
           Enable generation of Python bindings and store them in OUT_DIR.

       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

       --version
           Show version of program.

       Note that at least one of the --cpp_out, --java_out and --python_out options must be given (otherwise the program has nothing to do). It's also possible to specify more than one.

BUGS
       The program currently exits with code 255 for all errors, which makes it hard to differentiante from scripts the actual error.
