NAME
       OgreXMLConverter - converts data between XML and Ogre binary formats

SYNOPSIS
       OgreXMLConverter [-i] [-e] [-l lodlevels] [-d loddist] [[-p lodpercent][-f lodnumtris]] sourcefile [destfile]

DESCRIPTION
       OgreXMLConverter converts data between XML and Ogre binary formats.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -i     Interactive mode - prompt for options

       -e     DON'T generate edge lists (for stencil shadows)

       -r     DON'T reorganise vertex buffers to OGRE recommended format

       -t     Generate tangents (for normal mapping)

       The following options are only applicable when converting XML to Mesh:

       -l lodlevels
              Number of LOD levels

       -d loddist
              Distance increment to reduce LOD

       -p lodpercent
              Percentage triangle reduction amount per LOD

       -f lodnumtris
              Fixed vertex reduction per LOD

       sourcefile
              Name of the file to convert

       destfile
              Optional  name of file to write to. If you don't specify this OGRE works it out through the extension and the XML contents if the source is XML. For example test.mesh becomes test.xml,
              test.xml becomes test.mesh if the XML document root is <mesh> etc.
