NAME
       gmap - Genomic Mapping and Alignment Program

SYNOPSIS
       gmap [OPTIONS...] <FASTA files...>, or cat <FASTA files...> | gmap [OPTIONS...]

OPTIONS
   Input options (must include -d or -g)
       -D, --dir=directory
              Genome directory.  Default (as specified by --with-gmapdb to the configure program) is /var/cache/gmap

       -d, --db=STRING
              Genome database.  If argument is '?' (with the quotes), this command lists available databases.

       -k, --kmer=INT
              kmer size to use in genome database (allowed values: 16 or less).  If not specified, the program will find the highest available kmer size in the genome database

       --sampling=INT
              Sampling to use in genome database.  If not specified, the program will find the smallest available sampling value in the genome database within selected k-mer size

       -g, --gseg=filename
              User-supplied genomic segments.  If multiple segments are provided, then every query sequence is aligned against every genomic segment

       -1, --selfalign
              Align one sequence against itself in FASTA format via stdin (Useful for getting protein translation of a nucleotide sequence)

       -2, --pairalign
              Align two sequences in FASTA format via stdin, first one being genomic and second one being cDNA

       --cmdline=STRING,STRING
              Align these two sequences provided on the command line, first one being genomic and second one being cDNA

       --align-fraction=FLOAT
              Process only the given fraction of reads, selected at random If --align-fraction and --part are given, --align-fraction takes precedence

       -q, --part=INT/INT
              Process only the i-th out of every n sequences e.g., 0/100 or 99/100 (useful for distributing jobs to a computer farm).

       --input-buffer-size=INT
              Size of input buffer (program reads this many sequences at a time for efficiency) (default 1000)

       Computation options

       -B, --batch=INT
              Batch mode (default = 2)

                       Mode     Positions       Genome
                         0      mmap            mmap
                         1      mmap & preload  mmap
               (default) 2      mmap & preload  mmap & preload
                         3      allocate        mmap & preload
                         4      allocate        allocate
                         5      allocate        allocate     (same as 4)

       Note: For a single sequence, all data structures use mmap
              If mmap not available and allocate not chosen, then will use fileio (very slow)

       --use-shared-memory=INT
              If 1, then allocated memory is shared among all processes on this node If 0 (default), then each process has private allocated memory

       --nosplicing
              Turns off splicing (useful for aligning genomic sequences onto a genome)

       --max-deletionlength=INT
              Max  length  for  a  deletion  (default  30).   Above this size, a genomic gap will be considered an intron rather than a deletion.  If the genomic gap is less than --max-deletionlength and
              greater than --min-intronlength, a known splice site or splice site probabilities of 0.80 on both sides will be reported as an intron.

       --min-intronlength=INT
              Min length for one internal intron (default 9).  Below this size, a genomic gap will be considered a deletion rather than an intron.  If the genomic gap is  less  than  --max-deletionlength
              and greater than --min-intronlength, a known splice site or splice site probabilities of 0.80 on both sides will be reported as an intron.

       --max-intronlength-middle=INT
              Max  length  for  one internal intron (default 500000).  Note: for backward compatibility, the -K or --intronlength flag will set both --max-intronlength-middle and --max-intronlength-ends.
              Also see --split-large-introns below.

       --max-intronlength-ends=INT
              Max length for first or last intron (default 10000).  Note: for backward compatibility, the -K or --intronlength flag will set both --max-intronlength-middle and --max-intronlength-ends.

       --split-large-introns
              Sometimes GMAP will exceed the value for --max-intronlength-middle, if it finds a good single alignment.  However, you can force GMAP to split such alignments by using this flag

       --end-trimming-score=INT
              Trim ends if the alignment score is below this value where a match scores +1 and a mismatch scores -3 The value should be 0 (default) or negative.  A negative allows some mismatches at  the
              ends of the alignment

       --trim-end-exons=INT
              Trim end exons with fewer than given number of matches (in nt, default 12)

       -w, --localsplicedist=INT
              Max length for known splice sites at ends of sequence (default 2000000)

       -L, --totallength=INT
              Max total intron length (default 2400000)

       -x, --chimera-margin=INT
              Amount of unaligned sequence that triggers search for the remaining sequence (default 30).  Enables alignment of chimeric reads, and may help with some non-chimeric reads.  To turn off, set
              to zero.

       --no-chimeras
              Turns off finding of chimeras.  Same effect as --chimera-margin=0

       -t, --nthreads=INT
              Number of worker threads

       -c, --chrsubset=string
              Limit search to given chromosome

       --strand=STRING

       --canonical-mode=INT
              Reward for canonical and semi-canonical introns 0=low reward, 1=high reward (default), 2=low reward for high-identity sequences and high reward otherwise

       --cross-species
              Use a more sensitive search for canonical splicing, which helps especially for cross-species alignments and other difficult cases

       --allow-close-indels=INT
              Allow an insertion and deletion close to each other (0=no, 1=yes (default), 2=only for high-quality alignments)

              Allow microexons only if one of the splice site probabilities is greater than this value (default 0.95)

       --indel-open
              In dynamic programming, opening penalty for indel

       --indel-extend
              In  dynamic programming, extension penalty for indel Values for --indel-open and --indel-extend should be in [-127,-1].  If value is < -127, then will use -127 instead.  If --indel-open and
              --indel-extend are not specified, values are chosen adaptively, based on the differences between the query and reference

       --cmetdir=STRING
              Directory for methylcytosine index files (created using cmetindex) (default is location of genome index files specified using -D, -V, and -d)

              run the cmetindex or atoiindex programs (which also cover the ttoc modes) on the genome

       -p, --prunelevel

       Output options

       -n, --npaths=INT
              Maximum number of paths to show (default 5).  If set to 1, GMAP will not report chimeric alignments, since those imply two paths.  If you want a single alignment plus  chimeric  alignments,

       --gff3-fasta-annotation=INT
              Whether to include annotation from the FASTA header into the GFF3 output Values: 0 (default): Do not include

       1: Wrap all annotation as Annot="<header>"
              2: Include key=value pairs, replacing brackets with quotation marks

              and replacing spaces between key=value pairs with semicolons

       Options for SAM output

       --no-sam-headers
              Do not print headers beginning with '@'

       --sam-use-0M
              Insert 0M in CIGAR between adjacent insertions and deletions Required by Picard, but can cause errors in other tools

       --sam-extended-cigar
              Use extended CIGAR format (using X and = symbols instead of M,
               to indicate matches and mismatches, respectively

       --sam-flipped
              Flip the query and genomic positions in the SAM output.  Potentially useful with the -g flag when short reads are picked as query sequences and longer reads as picked as genomic sequences

       --force-xs-dir
              For RNA-Seq alignments, disallows XS:A:? when the sense direction is unclear, and replaces this value arbitrarily with XS:A:+.  May be useful for some programs, such as Cufflinks, that can‐
              not handle XS:A:?.  However, if you use this flag, the reported value of XS:A:+ in these cases will not be meaningful.

       --md-lowercase-snp
              In MD string, when known SNPs are given by the -v flag,
               prints difference nucleotides as lower-case when they,
               differ from reference but match a known alternate allele

       --action-if-cigar-error
              Action to take if there is a disagreement between CIGAR length and sequence length Allowed values: ignore, warning (default), noprint, abort Note that the noprint option does not print  the
              CIGAR string at all if there is an error, so it may break a SAM parser

       Options for quality scores

       --quality-protocol=STRING
              Protocol for input quality scores.  Allowed values: illumina (ASCII 64-126) (equivalent to -J 64 -j -31) sanger   (ASCII 33-126) (equivalent to -J 33 -j 0)

       Default is sanger (no quality print shift)
              SAM output files should have quality scores in sanger protocol

              Or you can specify the print shift with this flag:

       -j, --quality-print-shift=INT
              Shift FASTQ quality scores by this amount in output (default is 0 for sanger protocol; to change Illumina input to Sanger output, select -31)
