NAME
       pscp — parallel file upload program

SYNOPSIS
       pscp  [-vAr] [-h hosts_file] [-H [user@]host[:port]] [-l user] [-p par]
       [-o outdir] [-e errdir] [-t timeout] [-O options] [-x  args]  [-X  arg]
       local remote

DESCRIPTION
       pscp  is  a  program for copying files in parallel to a number of hosts
       using the scp program.  It provides features such as passing a password
       to scp, saving output to files, and timing out.

OPTIONS
       -h host_file
       --hosts host_file
              Read hosts from the given host_file.  Lines in the host file are
              of the form [user@]host[:port] and can include blank  lines  and
              comments (lines beginning with "#").  If multiple host files are
              given (the -h option is used more than once), then pscp  behaves
              as  though these files were concatenated together.  If a host is
              specified multiple times, then pscp will connect the given  num‐
              ber of times.

       -H     [user@]host[:port]
       --host [user@]host[:port]
       -H     "[user@]host[:port] [ [user@]host[:port ] ... ]"
       --host "[user@]host[:port] [ [user@]host[:port ] ... ]"
              Add  the  given  host strings to the list of hosts.  This option
              may be given multiple times, and may be used in conjunction with
              the -h option.

       -l user
       --user user
              Use  the given username as the default for any host entries that
              don't specifically specify a user.

       -p parallelism
       --par parallelism
              Use the given number as the maximum number of concurrent connec‐
              tions.

       -t timeout
       --timeout timeout
              Make  connections  time  out  after the given number of seconds.
              With a value of 0, pscp will not timeout any connections.

       -o outdir
       --outdir outdir
              Save standard output to files in the given directory.  Filenames
              are of the form [user@]host[:port][.num] where the user and port
              are only included for hosts that explicitly specify  them.   The
              number is a counter that is incremented each time for hosts that
              are specified more than once.

       -e errdir
       --errdir errdir
              Save standard error to files in the given directory.   Filenames
              are of the same form as with the -o option.

       -x args
       --extra-args args
              Passes extra SSH command-line arguments (see the ssh(1) man page
              for more information about SSH arguments).  This option  may  be
              specified  multiple times.  The arguments are processed to split
              on whitespace, protect text within quotes, and escape with back‐
              slashes.   To pass arguments without such processing, use the -X
              option instead.

       -X arg
       --extra-arg arg
              Passes a single SSH command-line argument (see  the  ssh(1)  man
              page  for  more information about SSH arguments).  Unlike the -x
              option, no processing is performed on  the  argument,  including
              word  splitting.   To  pass multiple command-line arguments, use
              the option once for each argument.

       -O options
       --options options
              SSH options in the format used in  the  SSH  configuration  file
              (see  the  ssh_config(5)  man  page for more information).  This
              option may be specified multiple times.

       -A
       --askpass
              Prompt for a password and pass it to ssh.  The password  may  be
              used  for either to unlock a key or for password authentication.
              The password is transferred in a fairly secure manner (e.g.,  it
              will  not  show up in argument lists).  However, be aware that a
              root user on your system could potentially intercept  the  pass‐
              word.

       -v
       --verbose
              Include error messages from ssh with the -i and \ options.

       -r
       --recursive
              Recursively copy directories.

TIPS
       The  ssh_config  file can include an arbitrary number of Host sections.
       Each host entry specifies ssh options which apply  only  to  the  given
       host.   Host  definitions  can even behave like aliases if the HostName
       option is included.  This ssh feature, in combination  with  pssh  host
       files, provides a tremendous amount of flexibility.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status codes from pscp are as follows:

       0      Success

       1      Miscellaneous error

       2      Syntax or usage error

       3      At least one process was killed by a signal or timed out.

       4      All  processes  completed, but at least one scp process reported
              an error (exit status other than 0).
