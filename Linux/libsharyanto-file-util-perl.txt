NAME
       SHARYANTO::File::Flock - Yet another flock module

VERSION
       version 0.56

SYNOPSIS
        use SHARYANTO::File::Flock;

        # try to acquire exclusive lock. if fail to acquire lock within 60s, die.
        my $lock = SHARYANTO::File::Flock->lock($file);

        # explicitly unlock
        $lock->release;

        # automatically unlock if object is DESTROY-ed.
        undef $lock;

DESCRIPTION
       This is yet another flock module. It is a more lightweight alternative to File::Flock with some other differences:

       •   OO interface only

       •   Autoretry (by default for 60s) when trying to acquire lock

           I prefer this approach to blocking/waiting indefinitely or failing immediately.

METHODS
   $lock = SHARYANTO::File::Flock->lock($path, \%opts)
       Acquire  an  exclusive  lock  on  $path.  $path  will be created if not already exists. If $path is already locked by another process, will retry (by default for 60 seconds). Will die if failed to
       acquire lock.

       Will automatically unlock if $lock goes out of scope. Upon unlock, will remove $path if it was created and is still empty (this behavior is the same as File::Flock).

       Available options:

       •   retries => INT (default: 60)

           Number of retries (equals number of seconds, since retry is done every second).

   $lock->unlock
       Unlock.

   $lock->release
       Synonym for unlock().

CAVEATS
       Not yet tested on Windows. Some filesystems do not support inode?

SEE ALSO
       File::Flock

       File::Flock::Tiny which is also tiny, but does not have the autoremove and autoretry capability which I want. See also: https://github.com/trinitum/perl-File-Flock-Tiny/issues/1

       flock() Perl function.
