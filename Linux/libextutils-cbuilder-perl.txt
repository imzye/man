NAME
       ExtUtils::CBuilder::Platform::Windows - Builder class for Windows platforms

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the Windows-specific parts of ExtUtils::CBuilder.  Most of the Windows-specific stuff has to do with compiling and linking C code.
       Currently we support the 3 compilers perl itself supports: MSVC, BCC, and GCC.

       This module inherits from "ExtUtils::CBuilder::Base", so any functionality not implemented here will be implemented there.  The interfaces are defined by the
       ExtUtils::CBuilder documentation.
