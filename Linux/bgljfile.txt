NAME
       Bgljfile - a Jvm Access File Generator

SYNOPSIS
       bgljfile [ options ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Bgljfile  is  a  Jvm Access File generator. It produces file that suits
       Bigloo option -bgljfile. A Jvm Access File is a scheme list. Each  ele‐
       ments  of  that list is a list of at least two elements: a module name,
       the Java class file that implements that module.

OPTIONS
       file          Is an file implementing a module.   Bgljfile  reads  that
                     file to discover the name of the implemented module.

       -base         Set the Jvm base package.

       -o <file>     Print  Module  Access  File  into file. The default is to
                     print the list on the standard output device.

       -suffix <suf> Adds suf to the bgljfile source file suffixes  list.  De‐
                     fault suffixes are "scm", "sch" and "bgl".

EXAMPLE
       If the three files exists and contain legal Bigloo module clause, then:

          $ bgljfile foo.scm bar.scm gee.scm

       could print out a list like:

       (
         (foo "./foo")
         (bar "./bar")
         (gee "./gee")
       )
