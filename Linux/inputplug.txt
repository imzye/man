NAME
       inputplug - XInput event monitor

SYNOPSIS
       inputplug [-v] [-n] [-d] [-0] -c command-prefix

       inputplug [-h|--help]

DESCRIPTION
       inputplug is a daemon which connects to a running X server and monitors its XInput hierarchy change events. Such events arrive when a device is being attached or removed, enabled or disabled etc.

       When a hierarchy change happens, inputplug parses the event notification structure, and calls the command specified by command-prefix. The command receives four arguments:

       command-prefix event-type device-id device-type device-name

       Event type may be one of the following:

       •   XIMasterAdded

       •   XIMasterRemoved

       •   XISlaveAdded

       •   XISlaveRemoved

       •   XISlaveAttached

       •   XISlaveDetached

       •   XIDeviceEnabled

       •   XIDeviceDisabled

       Device type may be any of those:

       •   XIMasterPointer

       •   XIMasterKeyboard

       •   XISlavePointer

       •   XISlaveKeyboard

       •   XIFloatingSlave

       Device identifier is an integer. The device name may have embedded spaces.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
           Show help (--help shows more details).

       -v  Be a bit more verbose.

       -n  Start up, monitor events, but don't actually run anything.  With verbose more enabled, would print the actual command it'd run. This implies -d.

       -d  Don't daemonise. Run in the foreground.

       -0  On start, trigger added and enabled events for each plugged devices. A master device will trigger the "added" event while a slave device will trigger both the "added" and the "enabled" device.

       -c command-prefix
           Command prefix to run. Unfortunately, currently this is passed to execvp(3) directly, so spaces aren't allowed. This is subject to change in future.

       -p pidfile
           Write the process ID of the running daemon to the file pidfile

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY
           X11 display to connect to.
