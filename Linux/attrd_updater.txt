NAME
       Pacemaker - Part of the Pacemaker cluster resource manager

SYNOPSIS
       attrd_updater -n <attribute> <command> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       attrd_updater - query and update Pacemaker node attributes

OPTIONS
       -?, --help
              This text

       -$, --version
              Version information

       -V, --verbose
              Increase debug output

       -n, --name=value
              The attribute's name

   Commands:
       -U, --update=value
              Update attribute's value in pacemaker-attrd. If this causes the value to change, it will also be updated in the cluster configuration.

       -B, --update-both=value
              Update attribute's value and time to wait (dampening) in pacemaker-attrd. If this causes the value or dampening to change, the attribute will also be written to the cluster configuration, so be
              aware that repeatedly changing the dampening reduces its effectiveness.

       -Y, --update-delay
              Update attribute's dampening in pacemaker-attrd (requires -d/--delay). If this causes the dampening to change, the attribute will also be written to the cluster configuration, so be aware  that
              repeatedly changing the dampening reduces its effectiveness.

       -Q, --query
              Query the attribute's value from pacemaker-attrd

       -D, --delete
              Delete attribute from pacemaker-attrd. If a value was previously set, it will also be removed from the cluster configuration

       -R, --refresh
              (Advanced) Force the pacemaker-attrd daemon to resend all current values to the CIB

   Additional options:
       -d, --delay=value
              The time to wait (dampening) in seconds for further changes before writing

       -s, --set=value
              (Advanced) The attribute set in which to place the value

       -N, --node=value
              Set the attribute for the named node (instead of the local one)

       -A, --all
              Show values of the attribute for all nodes (query only)

       -l, --lifetime=value
              (Not yet implemented) Lifetime of the node attribute (silently ignored by cluster)

       -p, --private
              If this creates a new attribute, never write the attribute to CIB
