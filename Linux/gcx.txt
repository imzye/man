NAME
       gcx - astronomical image processing and photometry

SYNOPSIS
       gcx [options] [files...]

DESCRIPTION
       gcx  is  an  astronomical image processing and data reduction tool, with an easy to use graphical user interface.  It provides a complete set of data reduction functions for CCD photometry, with frame
       WCS fitting, automatic star identification, aperture photometry of target and standard stars, single-frame ensemble photometry solution finding, multi-frame color coefficient fitting, extinction coef‐
       ficient fitting, and all-sky photometry, as well as general-purpose astronomical image processing functions (bias, dark, flat, frame alignment and stacking); It can function as a FITS viewer.

       For  automating data reduction of large numbers of frames, gcx implements recipe files. These files contain specific information about the objects measured in each field. Once a recipe file is created
       for a given field, any number of frames of that field can be reduced without user intervention.

       The program can control CCD cameras and telescopes, and implement automatic observation scripting. Cameras are controlled through a hardware-specific server,  to  which  gcx  connects  through  a  TCP
       socket. It generates FITS files with comprehensive header information.

       Telescopes and mounts using the LX200 protocol are supported. gcx uses it's automatic field identification functions to refine telecope pointing accuracy.

OPTIONS
       When invoked without arguments, the program runs in GUI mode. Most functions are also accessible through command line options, descibed below.

       -h, --help
              Print command line options.

       --help-all
              Print all the on-line help on stdout.

       --version
              Print program version.

       -D, --debug <level>
              Set debug level to <level>; 0=quiet, 4=noisy.

       -o, --output <file_name>
              Set output file name for import, convert and frame operations.

       -r, --rcfile <config_file>
              Load configuration file.

       -S, --set <option>=<value>
              Set the value of an option overriding the configuration file.

       -i, --interactive
              Force display frames as they are being processed.

Observation Scripting, Photometry and File Conversion Options
       -p, --recipe <recipe_file>
              Load recipe file (searches rcp_path).

       -P, --phot-run <recipe_file>
              Load recipe file and run photometry in batch mode. Report in native format.

       -V, --phot-run-aavso <recipe_file>
              Load recipe file and run photometry in batch mode. Report in AAVSO format.

       If <recipe_file> is set to one of the following three special tokens, the recipe will change depeding on information in the frame header:

       _TYHCO_
              will create a recipe on-the-fly from Tycho catalog data (if available);

       _OBJECT_
              will search the recipe path for a file with the same name as the object in the frame (ending in .rcp);

       _AUTO_ will search for a recipe by object name, and if that is not found, create a tycho one.

       --import <catalog name>
              Convert a tabular catalog file to the gcx Lisp-like format. Reads stdin.  Current table formats are: gcvs, gcvs-pos, landolt, henden, sumner.

       --merge <recipe_file>
              Merge a new recipe file over the one loaded with the --recipe option. Checks are made for either positional or name duplicates.  Only stars brighter than mag_limit are merged.

       --set-target
              Specify a target object to be merged into a recipe file. It will also set the recipe object, ra and dec fields.

       --make-tycho-rcp <radius>
              Create a recipe file for the object specified with --object using  tycho2 stars in a box radius arcminutes around the object.

       --rcp-to-aavso <recipe_file>
              Convert  a  recipe  file  to the aavso db (tab-delimited) format.  If the file argument is '-', stdin is read.  The recipe comment and star comment fields are interpreted to get some db fields.
              See the --help-all output for more info.

       -T, --rep-to-table <report_file>
              Convert a report file to tabular format.  If an output file name is not specified (with the '-o' argument), stdout is used.  If the file argument is '-', stdin is read.  The format of the table
              is specified by the value of the .file.tab_format option, see below.

       -O, --obsfile <obs_file>
              Load/run observation scripting file (searches obs_path).

       -n, --to-pnm
              Convert a fits file to 8-bit pnm.  If an output file name is not specified (with the '-o' argument), stdout is used.

       -j, --object
              Specify a target object (useful for setting an initial wcs when there isn't enough information present in the fits headers).

       --mag-limit
              Set a magnitude limit for the output of import and merge commands.

CCD Reduction Options
       -d, --dark <dark_frame>
              Set the dark frame / do dark subtraction.

       -b, --bias <bias_frame>
              Set the bias frame / do bias subtraction.

       -f, --flat <flat_frame>
              Set the flat field frame / flatfield.

       -G, --gaussian-blur <fwhm>
              Set blur FWHM / apply Gaussian blur.

       -a, --align <align_ref_frame>
              Set the alignment reference frame / align frames.

       -A, --add-bias <bias>
              Set the value of a constant bias to add to all frames / add a bias to frames.

       -M, --multiply <multiplier>
              Set a constant to multiply all frames with / multiply frames by a scalar.

       Multiplication is performed before addition.

       -u, --update-file
              Save reduction results overwriting the original files.

       -s, --stack
              Stack the frames using the method set in the configration file; for some methods additive background alignment is performed.

       -F, --superflat
              Stack the frames using an multiplicative background alignment procedure; the frames should be already dark-substracted.

       -N, --no-reduce
              Do not run the reduction operations, just load the frame list / reduction options.

       When  any of the CCD reduction options is set and the -i flag is not specified, the reduction operations are run in batch mode on all the supplied fits files. When no output file is specified or -i is
       set, the files are loaded into the batch processing file list, the reduction options set in the dialog, and the program starts up in gui mode

Report Converter Format String
       The report converter option converts the native gcx output to a fixed-width tabular format that is easy to import in other programs for further  processing.  The  table's  format  is  defined  by  the
       .file.tab_format configuration option.  The option string consists of tokens separated by spaces.  There are two types of tokens: option tokens, and column tokens.

       Options tokens set global table options when present. They can appear anywhere in the format string.

       tablehead
              Generate a table header line containing the column titles.

       collist
              Generate a list of columns with position information at the start of the output.

       res_stats
              Generate a line with descriptive statistics on the stars' residuals at the end of each frame.

       Column tokens specify what information gets output in each column.  The first column token corresponds to the first output column, and so on in order. Each column token can optionally be followed by a
       specifier of the form: width.precision. The width excludes a single character spacer between the columns. Supported colum tokens are:

       name [w]
              Output the star's designator.

       ra [w] Output the right ascension in h:m:s format.

FILES
       The native image file format of gcx is FITS. The program will read 16-bit integer and 32-bit float files (BITPIX = 16 or BITPIX = -32), and save 16-bit integer files. The  internal  representation  of
       images is in 32-bit floating point.

       gcx supports transparent compression and decompression of fits files when  zcat and  gzip are available and their path is set in the corresponding options.

       Configuration  options  are  stored  in  ~/.gcxrc. The options can be edited in GUI mode, or directly in the file itself. A template configuration file can be created by selecting "save" in the option
       editing dialog.

       The program reads several object catalog formats. See the relevant chapter in the User's manual for information on how to set up catalogs.  Catalogs are normally placed under /usr/share/gcx/catalogs.

       Documentation files usually reside in the "docs" directory of the source distribution or in  /usr/share/doc/gcx.

       Example data is distributed separately from the main source.  When installed from a package it usually goes to /usr/share/doc/gcx/examples.

AUTHOR
       gcx was written by Radu Corlan, with valuable contributions from Alexandru Dan Corlan (Tycho2 searching, porting of GSC searching code); Liam Girdwood (various  routines  from  the  libnova  library);
       Pertti  Paakkonen (GUI improvements). The star search algorithm is similar to (and inspired by) the one in Elwood Downey's XEphem. WCS conversion routines are taked from classic AIPS. The GSC scanning
       routines are adapted from the code distributed with the catalog.
