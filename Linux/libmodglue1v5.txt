NAME
       ptywrap - fool programs into thinking they are talking to a pseudo-tty

SYNOPSIS
       ptywrap

DESCRIPTION
       ptywrap is a simple tool to wrap other programs' input/output streams in a pseudo-tty.

       Many programs determine whether or not they should buffer their input/output based on whether or not these are connected to a pseudo-tty. Ptywrap can be used
       to fool programs into thinking that they are connected to a pseudo-tty even if they are not (e.g. even if the input/output is redirected to a file).
