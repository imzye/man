NAME
       extractBCITrees - part of mauveAligner package reads all trees and their posterior from a set of MrBayes .trprobs files

SYNOPSIS
       extractBCITrees <random seed> <BCI threshold> <max output trees> <MrBayes .trprobs input file 1 .. N> <nexus output file>

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  reads  all  trees and their posterior from a set of MrBayes .trprobs files and sums and normalizes posteriors for each topology.  All trees that meet a Bayes Credible Interval threshold
       will be saved, up to some maximum number of trees.  <BCI Threshold> A number between 0 and 1 giving the BCI threshold.  0.9 is a good choice.  <max output trees>      Limit the  output  to  this  many
       trees.  All trees in the input file must have the same number of taxa and the same taxon labels
