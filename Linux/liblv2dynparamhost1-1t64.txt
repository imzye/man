NAME
       liblv2dynparamhost1-1 - LV2 plugin interface extension

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the liblv2dynparamhost1-1

       liblv2dynparamhost1-1  is  a LV2 plugin interface extension that enables plugin parameters to appear and disappear (i.e. number of voices). It also allows nested grouping of parameters. Groups can
       be used for things like ADSR abstraction, i.e. group of 4 float parameters.

       The extension has been initially created to allow exposing the full functionality of the zynadd LV2 plugin (part of the zyn project) and to allow generic UI - provided by a  host  (zynjacku).  The
       extension allows but does not requires generic UI. Plugin writters are free to provide custom UI for their plugin.

       The extension should be suitable for all plugins that expose many and/or complex data types, like samplers, non-trivial synths, etc.
