NAME
       update-gap-workspace - manage a GAP workspace.

SYNOPSIS
       update-gap-workspace

       update-gap-workspace update

              Create or update the GAP workspace.

       update-gap-workspace delete

              Delete the GAP workspace.

DESCRIPTION
       At  start  up,  GAP  load  all  libraries and packages available on the system.  This take several seconds. To save time, GAP can store the result of this initialisation in a `workspace'.  update-gap-
       workspace help to manage such workspaces.  update-gap-workspace can be run as root to manage the system-wide workspace.  update-gap-workspace can be run as a normal user. In this case the workspace is
       stored in $HOME/gap/workspace.gz.

       Note  that  you  need  to rebuild the workspace each time GAP packages are added, removed or updated. To automate that task, if the system-wide workspace exists, it is automatically updated whenever a
       GAP-related Debian package is installed or upgraded.

       The gap script will automatically load such workspace at start up.

              The system-wide GAP workspace.
       $HOME/gap/workspace.gz:
