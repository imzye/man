NAME
     apspreview — preview PostScript file(s) as generated by apsfilter

SYNOPSIS
     apspreview [-Pqueue] [-Zoptions] [input...]
     apspreview [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     With apspreview you can create a PostScript representation of the file(s) you are about to print in order to check it before actually printing.

     Your file(s) will be converted to PostScript according to the queue specific configuration, and afterwards you will be able to print all or some pages from your PostScript viewer application (gv,
     kghostview or ghostview).

OPTIONS
     -h          show help screen
     -Pqueue     select a printer queue (different from the default one)
     -Zoptions   use apsfilter command line options (comma-separated list)
     input...    input file(s) [default: stdin]

NOTES
     If you use the -P option, please remember to pass the same printer queue on to the lpr(1) command.

     Be careful if your printer queue configuration includes a setting to create multiple pages per sheet (PS_NUP=2, PS_NUP=4 or PS_NUP=8).  In order to make sure that apsfilter(1) does not repeat n-up
     printing, use the 1pps command line option when actually printing the file.

     apspreview only works correctly with entries in /etc/printcap that have been created by /usr/share/apsfilter/SETUP. All configuration settings will be copied from the relevant apsfilterrc files.

FILES
     /etc/printcap                       printer capability data base
     /usr/share/apsfilter/bin/apsfilter  apsfilter script
     /usr/bin/aps2file                   tool to save apsfilter output to a file

BUGS
     See apsfilter software center - http://www.apsfilter.org/ - for new versions, bugfixes and known bugs.

     Please use the new tool apsfilter-bug(1) to release bug- or problem reports. It automatically presents you a form in an editor window which asks you some standard questions.  If you save and quit the
     editor session, then this report is sent automatically via e-mail to the proper apsfilter mailinglist.

     If apsfilter fails to print something or prints it in a way you wouldn't expect and you want to report an apsfilter error then please save the debugging output of one print session using the new
     aps2file(1) utility by typing aps2file -D -Z options file > /dev/null 2> file.debug and including the debugging output in the file file.debug into the edit session of the apsfilter-bug utility, so that
     it is included into the mail to the apsfilter mailinglist.

     Please note that you need to run /bin/sh (Bourne Shell), bash or a compatible shell, so that the above mentioned output redirection works. Under C-shell (/bin/csh) or tcsh it would't work. If you don't
     know, then simply make sure you use the Bournce shell by typing /bin/sh or bash, then you should have no problems with redirection of stdout and stderr (> /dev/null 2> file.debug).
