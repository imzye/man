NAME
       uARMSolver – universal Association Rule Mining Solver

SYNOPSIS
       uARMSolver [-v|-?]  [-sSETUP_FILE|-s SETUP_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       The  framework  is  written fully in C++ and runs on all platforms.  It allows users to preprocess their data in a transaction database, to make discretization of data, to search for association rules
       and to guide a presentation/visualization of the best rules found using external tools.  As opposed to the existing software packages or frameworks, this also supports numerical and real-valued  types
       of  attributes  besides  the categorical ones.  Mining the association rules is defined as an optimization and solved using the nature-inspired algorithms that can be incorporated easily.  Because the
       algorithms normally discover a huge amount of association rules, the framework enables a modular inclusion of so-called visual guiders for extracting the knowledge hidden in data, and visualize  these
       using external tools.

       -sSETUP_FILE, -s SETUP_FILE
              Path to a setup file (default arm.set).  See the FILES section for details.

FILES
       This section describes how to describes how to configure a universal ARM Solver (uARMSolver) using a setup file.  See also the -s option.  The setup file consists of three sections, including:

              · a problem definition,

              · parameter setting of a selected algorithm for solving ARM, and

              · parameter setting of a selected visualization method.

       Lines starting with the % character are comments and are not checked for syntax.

   PROBLEM DEFINITION
       The problem definition begins with the reserved word Problem, then curly brackets enclosing a series of parameter definitions.  Each parameter definition is a line of the form:
              parameter = value
       The following parameters are supported:

              Tdbase_name = file_name
                     path of the transaction database

              Rule_name = file_name
                     path of an existing archive of mined association rules

              Out_name = file_name
                     path where the archive of mined association rules will be written

              Period = integer_value
                     how many periods are captured by archive files

       The  Period  parameter  determines  whether  more transaction databases or archive files are processed by the solver simultaneously.  When its value is more than one, the solver expects that files are
       named with extensions according to their sequence numbers, e.g., is denotes as a sequence number (e.g., .1, .2, ..., .k.  When the Period is set to one, a single input file representing  the  transac‐
       tion database or ARM archive is processed.

   ALGORITHM SELECTION
       A line of the form:
              Algorithm = mnemonic
       selects a particular ARM solver algorithm.  For example, the Differential Algorithm has mnemonic DE, Particle Swarm Optimization has mnemonic PSO, and so on.

       When  the  algorithm is NONE, the solver does not perform optimization.  Instead, it expects an ARM archive produced by another traditional algorithm (such as Apriori) and focuses on the visualization
       section of the process.

   ALGORITHM-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS
       Next are algorithm-specific parameter blocks.  These begin with a line of the form
              mnemonic_PARAM
       followed by curly brackets enclosing a series of parameter definitions of the form
              mnemonic_param = value
       For example, the Differential Algorithm (DE) supports the following parameters:

              DE_NP = integer_value
                     population size of DE algorithm

              DE_FES = integer_value
                     maximum number of fitness function evaluations

              DE_RUNS = integer_value
                     maximum number of an independent DE runs

              DE_F = float_value
                     scaling factor used by DE mutation strategy

              DE_CR = float_value
                     crossover parameter controlling the DE mutation strategy

              DE_STRATEGY = integer_value in [1,12]
                     specific DE mutation strategy

   VISUALIZATION SELECTION
       In the future, the solver will support a visualization method.  A line of the form:
              Visualization = mnemonic
       selects a particular method of preparing the data from the ARM archive for visualization.

       Two algorithms are planned:

       FLOW   River flow

       METRO  Metro map

       Method NONE will disable visualization preparation.

   VISUALIZATION PARAMETERS
       Visualization methods will have method-specific parameter blocks similar to the algorithm-specific parameter blocks for the ARM solver.
