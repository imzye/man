NAME
       lbzcmp, lbzdiff - compare compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       lbzcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ]
       lbzdiff [ diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zcmp  and  lbzdiff are used to invoke the cmp or the diff program on files compressed via lbzip2.  All options specified are passed directly to cmp or diff.  If only file1 is specified, it is compared
       to the uncompressed contents of file1.bz2.  If two files are specified, their contents (uncompressed if necessary) are fed to cmp or diff.  The input files are not modified.  The exit status from  cmp
       or diff is preserved.

SEE ALSO
       cmp(1), diff(1), lbzmore(1), lbzgrep(1), lbzforce(1), lbzip2(1), lbzexe(1)

BUGS
       Messages from the cmp or diff programs may refer to file names such as "-" instead of to the file names specified.
