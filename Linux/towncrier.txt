DESCRIPTION
       towncrier is a utility to produce useful, summarised news files for your project.  Rather than reading the VCS history to produce it, or having one single file which developers all write to, town‐
       crier reads “news fragments” which contain information useful to end users.

OPTIONS
       --config CONFIG_FILE
              Use the specified CONFIG_FILE to configure program behaviour.  (Default: towncrier.toml or, if that does not exist, pyproject.toml)

       --dir FRAGMENTS_DIR
              Manage news fragments in the directory FRAGMENTS_DIR, relative to the project directory.  (Default: newsfragments)

       -v
       --version
              Emit the program version.

       -h
       --help Describe how to use the program.

COMMANDS
        [build] [--name PROJECT_NAME] [--version RELEASE_VERSION] [--date RELEASE_DATE] [--draft] [--yes] [--keep]

              Discover  all the news fragments in FRAGMENTS_DIR, and collate them.  Render them as a news document for project PROJECT_NAME released on RELEASE_DATE as version RELEASE_VERSION.  Then, ap‐
              pend the generated news document to the configured news file, use Git to stage the resulting file, and finally prompt the user for whether to  delete  the  news  fragment  files.   (Or,  if
              --draft  is  specified:  Emit the news file text to the standard error stream, and do not change any files.)  If --yes is specified, omit the prompt and assume “yes” to delete news fragment
              files.

              If --keep is specified, omit the prompt and assume “no” to delete news fragment files.

       create [--content CONTENT] [--edit|--no-edit] FRAGMENT_FILE

              Create a news fragment with filename FRAGMENT_FILE.  If --content is specified, populate the news fragment file with text content CONTENT.  If --edit is specified, launch the  default  text
              editor with the news fragment file.

       check [--compare-with GIT_COMMIT]

              Compare the current news file and fragments to those in the Git commit GIT_COMMIT (default: origin/master); then, if the news file is the same, report any additional fragments found.
