NAME
       Algorithm::Dependency::Ordered - Implements an ordered dependency hierarchy

VERSION
       version 1.112

DESCRIPTION
       Algorithm::Dependency::Ordered implements the most common variety of Algorithm::Dependency, the one in which the dependencies of an item must be acted upon before the item itself can be acted
       upon.

       In use and semantics, this should be used in exactly the same way as for the main parent class. Please note that the output of the "depends" method is NOT changed, as the order of the depends is
       not assumed to be important.  Only the output of the "schedule" method is modified to ensure the correct order.

       For API details, see Algorithm::Dependency.
