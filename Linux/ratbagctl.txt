NAME
       ratbagctl - inspect and modify configurable mice

SYNOPSIS
       ratbagctl [<options>] list
       ratbagctl [<options>] <device> <command> ...

DESCRIPTION
       The ratbagctl tool queries or changes a device's settings.

       This tool usually needs ratbagd to be running.

OPTIONS
       --version, -V
               Show program's version number and exit.

       --verbose, -v
               Print debugging output. Multiple -v options increase the verbosity. For example, -vvv will show the protocol output.

       --nocommit
               Do not immediately write the settings to the mouse. This allows multiple parameters to be set in a script, and the last call to ratbagctl will write them all.

       --help, -h
               Print the help.
