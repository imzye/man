DESCRIPTION
       This is an implementation of the classic Chinese Abacus (Suanpan) which has its origins in the 12th century.

       The device has two decks.  Each deck, separated by a partition, normally has 13 rails on which are mounted beads.  Each rail on the top deck contains 1 or 2 beads, and each rod on the bottom  deck
       contains  4  or 5 beads.  Each bead on the upper deck has a value of five, while each bead on the lower deck has value of one.  Beads are considered counted, when moved towards the partition sepa‐
       rating the decks, i.e.  to add a value of one, a bead in the bottom deck is moved up, and to add a value of 5, a bead in the top deck is moved down.

       The basic operations of the abacus are addition and subtraction.  Multiplication can be done by mentally multiplying the digits and adding up the intermediate  results  on  the  abacus.   Division
       would be similar where the intermediate results are subtracted.  There are techniques like using your thumb and forefinger which does not apply with mouse entry.  Also with multiplication, one can
       carry out calculations on different parts of the abacus for scratch work, here it is nice to have a long abacus.

       The  pre-WWII Japanese Abacus (Soroban) (or Korean Jupan) is similar to the Chinese Abacus but has only one bead per rail on the top deck.  The later Japanese Abacus was further simplified to have
       only 4 beads per rail on the bottom deck.

       The Roman Hand-Abacus predates the Chinese Abacus and is very similar to the later Japanese Abacus, but seems to have fallen out of use with the Fall of the Roman Empire (at least 3 are  in  exis‐
       tence).   The  Roman Abaci are brass plates where the beads move in slots.  In addition to the normal 7 columns of beads, they generally have 2 special columns on the right side.  In two examples:
       the first special column was for 12ths (12 uncia (ounces) = 1 as) and had one extra bead in the bottom deck.  Also the last column was a combination of halves, quarters, and twelfths of  an  ounce
       and  had  no beads in the top deck and 4 beads at the bottom (beads did not have to come to the top to be counted but at one of 3 marked points where the top bead was for halves, the next bead for
       quarters, and the last two beads for twelfths).  In another surviving example: the 2 special columns were switched and the combination column was broken into 3 separate slots.  If available, deci‐
       mal input is ignored.

       The Russian Abacus was invented in the 17th century, here the beads are moved from right to left.  It has colored beads in the middle for ease of use.  Quarters represent 1/4 Rubles and  are  only
       present historically on the Russian Abacus (Schoty).  Some of the older Schoty have a extra place for the 1/4 Kopek (quarter percent) as well as the 1/4 Ruble (quarter).

       The Danish Abacus was used in the early 20th century in elementary schools as a teaching aid.

       The  Medieval  Counter  is  a  primitive form of the abacus and was used in Europe as late as the 1600s.  It was useful considering they were using it with Roman Numerals.   This is similar to the
       Salamis Greek Tablet from 4th or 5th Century BCE.

       The Mesoamerican Nepohualtzintzin is a Japanese Abacus base 20.  The Mesoamericans had base 20 with the exception of the 3rd decimal place where instead of 20*20=400 the third place marked 360 and
       the 4th place was 20*360, etc..  They independently created their own zero (only the Sumerian and early Babylonian culture (base 60) and India (base 10) have done this) but the anomaly  took  away
       its true power.

       An  easy  way of figuring out time in seconds given hours, minutes, and seconds, can be done on the abacus with Sumerian abacus with topFactor 10, topNumber 5 and bottomNumber 9 using base 60.  No
       written record of such a device exits but its plausible that one did.

       The Chinese Solid-and-Broken-Bar System is a base 12 numbering system and not really an abacus.  When the abacus is setup in this way though (topFactor 3, topNumber 3,  bottomNumber  2,  base  12,
       displayBase 12), it is easy to relate the two.

       The signed bead is an invention of the author, and is not present on any historical abacus (to his knowledge) and is used to represent negatives.  "New & Improved" abacus models have two auxiliary
       decks  stacked  above the principal deck that enable multiplication, division, square-root, and cube-root computations to be performed with equal ease as addition and subtraction  (well, so I have
       read).

FEATURES
       Click "mouse-left" button on a bead you want to move.  The beads will shift themselves to vacate the area of the column that was clicked.

       Click "mouse-right" button, or press "C" or "c" keys, to clear the abacus.

       Press "-" or "_" keys to complement the beads on the rails.

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo last move.

       Press "R" or "r" keys to redo the last undo.

       Press "I" or "i" keys to increment the number of rails.  Press "D" or "d" keys to decrement the number of rails.

       Press "F" or "f" keys to switch between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Danish, Roman, and Medieval formats.  There is an extra "Generic" format, this allows one to break  some  rules  binding
       the other formats (for example, if one wanted more beads on top deck than on bottom deck you would use this, in addition to resource option changes).

       Press "V" or "v" keys to change the Roman Nvmerals format. (Pardon typo/humor, but ran out of letters).

       Press "~" key to toggle Latin Numerals (when Roman Nvmerals and quarter beads or twelfth beads are activated).

       Press "G" or "g" keys to toggle (usu.) commas between groups of digits.

       Press "#" key to toggle place on rail (or between rails) for group and decimal separators.

       Press "|" key to toggle vertical placement (best for Russian and Danish Abacus, and Medieval Counters).

       Press "S" or "s" keys to toggle the sign bead.

       Press "P" or "p" keys to change the piece setting from none|quarter|eighth|twelfth beads.  Originally intended for the Roman Hand Abacus (twelfths) and the Russian Abacus (quarter rubles).

       Press "T" or "t" keys to change piece percent setting for none|quarter|eighth|twelfth beads.  Originally intended for the older Russian Abacus (quarter kopeks).

       Press  "B"  or  "b" keys to change subdeck setting to be interpretted as none|quarter|eighth|twelfth beads.  Originally intended for Roman Hand Abacus twelfths and possibly eighths.  For twelfths,
       the the lowest value of two at bottom of the rightmost column of beads are a twelfth of the column second from right.  Middle is worth a quarter and the top is worth a half.  For  eighths,  middle
       and bottom are both worth an eight and the top a half.  (For quarters, all are worth a quarter.)

       Press "K" or "k" to toggle the subdeck separation

       Press "L" or "l" to toggle which side the subdeck symbols are placed.

       Press "M" or "m" keys to switch between it, uk, and fr museum formats.

       Press "Z" or "z" keys to change the Roman markerz on the frame.

       Press "O" or "o" keys to toggle the demo mode.

       Press "$" key to toggle the teach mode.

       In teach mode, "+" key toggles starting side to sum, ""*" key toggles for starting side for multiplicand.

       Press ">" or "." keys to speed up the movement of beads.  Press "<" or "," keys to slow down this movement.

       Press "@" key to toggle the sound.

       Press "Esc" key to hide program.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       The abacus may be resized.  Beads will reshape depending on the room they have.  Demo Mode: In this mode, the abacus is controlled by the program.  When started with the demo option, a second win‐
       dow  is presented that should be placed directly below the abacus-window. Descriptive text, and user prompts are displayed in this window.  Pressing 'q' during the demo will quit it.  Clicking the
       left mouse-button with the pointer in the window will restart the demo (beginning of current lesson).

               tracted, and the number of text lines (4).  This can be edited to add text to the lesson and used as a new demo keeping the generated numbers and the number of  lines  constant.   (Windows
               version writes to abacus.xml.)

       -[no]demo
               This  option  specifies to run in demo mode.  In this mode, the abacus is controlled by the current lesson (resource name "demo").  When started with the demo option, a window contains de‐
               scriptive text, and user prompts are displayed in this window.  Pressing 'q' during the demo will quit it.  Clicking the left mouse-button with the pointer in the window will  restart  the
               demo (beginning of current lesson).  The demo uses abacusDemo.xml and currently there are 4 editions possible (Chinese, Japanese (and Roman), Korean, and Russian (and Danish)).

       -demopath path
               This option specifies the path for the demo, possibly something like /usr/local/share/games/xabacus (resource name "demoPath"), with the file name of abacusDemo.xml.  For this to work, the
               program must be compiled with XML2 or else will use a brief static fallback demo.

       -demofont fontstring
               This option specifies the font for the explanatory text that appears in the secondary window, during the demo.  The default font is 18 point Times-Roman (-*-times-*-r-*-*-*-180-*). The al‐
               ternate font is 8x13.

       -demofg color
               This option specifies the foreground of the abacus demo window (resource name "demoForeground").

       -demobg color
               This option specifies the background of the abacus demo window (resource name "demoBackground").

       -[no]teach
               This  option  specifies  to run in teach mode.  In this mode, the abacus is controlled by 2 numbers separated by an operator: "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication,
               and  "/" for division.  The square root operation is represented by the number to be operated on followed by the character "v" (this leaves you with an answer from which you must divide by
               2).  Similarly, the cube root operation is represented by the number to be operated on followed by the character "u" (this leaves you with an answer from  which  you  must  divide  by  3).
               Press return key to progress through the steps (resource name "teach").

       -[no]rightToLeftAdd
               This  option  specifies  the  order  for  teach starting side for addition and subtraction.  The default is the traditional left to right.  Right to left seems easier though (resource name
               "rightToLeftAdd").

       -[no]rightToLeftMult
               This option specifies the order for teach starting side for multiplication.  The default is the traditional left to right.  Right to left seems more straight forward (resource name "right‐
               ToLeftMult").

       -[no]lee
               This option allows you to turn on and off the two extra auxiliary abaci (resource name "lee").

       -rails int
               This option specifies the number of rails (resource name "rails").

       -leftAuxRails int

       -rightAuxRails int
               This option allows you to set the number of the rails for the right auxiliary abacus in Lee's Abacus (resource name "rightAuxRails").

       -[no]vertical
               This option allows you to set the abacus to allow a Russian orientation (resource name "vertical").

       -colorScheme int
               This option specifies the color scheme for the abacus (resource name "colorScheme") where 0-> none, 1-> darken middle bead (2 beads if even), 2-> darken  first bead of  a  group,  4->  use
               secondary  color for second half of a row of beads (but if odd color middle bead), 8-> use secondary color for second third of a row of beads, 16-> use secondary color in alternate groups.
               Use a mask of 31 for combinations.

       -[no]slot
               This option allows you to have either slots or rails (resource name "slot").

               This option allows you to set the abacus to allow negatives (resource name "sign").

       -decimalPosition int
               This option specifies the number of rails to the right of the decimal point (normally 2) (resource name "decimalPosition").

       -anomaly int
               This option specifies the offset from the base for a multiplicative factor of the rail with the anomaly (if none, this is set to 0) (resource name "anomaly").

       -shiftAnomaly int
               This option specifies the offset from decimal point for the anomaly (usually 2) (resource name "shiftAnomaly").

       -anomalySq int

       -displayBase int
               This option specifies the base displayed (default is base 10) (resource name "displayBase").  If this is different then "base" then it is implemented using "long long" and the  calculation
               is  limited by its bounds.  Also the fractional part does not scale with the "displayBase" so if the "displayBase" is greater than the "base" it looses some precision.  Also no rounding is
               done.

               This option allows you to put a pixel space between all the beads so there is room for the bead to move when pressed (resource name "pressOffset").

       -romanNumerals {none|ancient|modern}
               This option allows you to set the abacus to allow Roman Numerals (resource name "romanNumerals").  Modern Roman Numerals above 3999 are normally represented with bars on top, due to  ASCII
               constraints  this  is represented instead in lower case (historically case was ignored).  Roman Numerals above 3,999,999 were not represented historically.  Roman numerals change with dis‐
               playBase in an "experimental" way.  When used with twelfths and subdecks, named fraction symbols are used.  Due to ASCII constraints the sigma is represented as E, the backwards C is  rep‐
               resented as a Q, the mu as a u, and the Z with a - through the center as a z.  If available, decimal input is ignored.

       -[no]latin
               This option allows you to set the abacus to allow latin fractions instead of symbolic in the Roman numeral output (resource name "latin").

       -romanMarkers {none|ancient|modern|late|alt}
               This option allows you to set Roman numerals of a specific type on the frame of the abacus (resource name "modernRoman").

       -chinese

       Luis Fernandes, <elf AT ee.ryerson.ca> wrote an independent program (xabacus 1.00) with a demo mode and postscript file.  I tried, with his permission, to take the best features of both  into  one
       program.  Also, I had help with some of the abacus in the Java version by Sarat Chandran, <saratcmahadevan AT yahoo.com> and some of these ideas were ported back into this X version.
