NAME
       coax - determine impedance of a coaxial structure, where the inner may be offset from the centre if necessary.

SYNOPSIS
       coax [-O offset] d D Er

DESCRIPTION
       coax  computes the impedance of a coaxial cable, given the outside diameter of the inner conductor d, the internal diameter of the outer conductor D and the relative permittivity of the dielectric Er.
       If there is an offset between the inner and outer (i.e. the coax is eccentric), the offset can be given as a option. coax uses the equation
       Zo=59.95849160 ln(x+sqrt(x^2-1)) /sqrt(Er)  Ohms
       where x=(d^2+D^2-4 O^2)/(2*D*d)

FILES
       coax does not read/write any files.
