NAME
       caveexpress - 2D platformer with physics-based gameplay

SYNOPSIS
       caveexpress [option]

DESCRIPTION
       Caveexpress  is a classic 2D platformer with physics-based gameplay and dozens of levels. Master your pedal-powered flying machine to pick up packages from your cave-dwelling clients and drop them
       off at the collection point.

       But beware! Mighty mastodons, terrifying pterodactyls and others would rather see you extinct.

OPTIONS
       -server
              Start the server for the game (headless mode).

       -set <varname> <value>
              Change the value of a config variable.

CONSOLE COMMANDS
       Open the in-game console with SHIFT+ESC. Just type a config variable name there to get the current value. The console commands can also be triggered from the commandline by just  putting  a  -  in
       front of it.

       -loglevel <LEVEL>
              Possible level values are: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR

CONFIG VARIABLES
       These  variables  can be modified by using the -set command - or by providing default values for some of them in the config.lua file in the asset directory. You can override any file by putting it
       into the same subdir as in your installation folder into ~/.local/share/caveexpress
