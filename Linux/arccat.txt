ARGUMENTS
       job ...
              list of jobids and/or jobnames

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The  arccat command displays the stdout or stderr of running jobs. It can also display A-REX's error log of a job. The job can be referred to either by the jobid that was returned by arcsub(1) at sub‐
       mission time or by its jobname if the job description that was submitted contained a jobname attribute.

       More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were submitted with the same jobname the stdout, stderr or A-REX error log of all those jobs are shown. If the --joblist option is used
       the list of jobs is read from a file with the specified filename. By specifying the --all option, the stdout, stderr or A-REX error log of all active jobs will be shown.

       The --cluster option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. See arcsub(1) for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option. The --status option can be used to select jobs
       in a specific state. These options can be repeated several times. See arstat(1) for possible state values.

       Only jobs where the stdout or stderr argument was given in the job description can display the contents of those files.

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

       ~/.arc/jobs.xml
              This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This list
              is  used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the --all option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the --joblist option a different file can be used
              than the default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       X509_USER_PROXY
              The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard location.

       ARC_LOCATION
              The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not specified the install location will be determined from the path to the command being executed, and if this fails  a
              WARNING will be given stating the location which will be used.

       ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
              The  location  of  ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The default location is $ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc (\ in
              Windows).
