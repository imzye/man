NAME
       psfs2mda - extract the font from a dump of the IBM PC MDA ROM

SYNOPSIS
       psfs2mda [--compaq] [--comment=text] INPUT14 INPUT8 [INPUT8_ALT] OUTPUTFILE
DESCRIPTION
       psfs2mda generates an MDA character ROM image from two or three PSF-format screen fonts. The output file can be used to create a new character ROM for an original IBM CGA or MDA, or (with the --compaq
       option) a Compaq CGA.

       You must supply either two or three input files. The first file is used for the 14-pixel font, the second for the 8-pixel font, and the third, if present, for the alternative (thin) 8-pixel  font.  If
       the  third  file  is  not present, psfs2mda will attempt to use characters 256-511 of the second file.  If the second file only has 256 characters, the alternative 8-pixel font will be the same as the
       main 8-pixel font.

       Note that the physical ROM chip used in an IBM MDA or CGA is a 9264, with a pinout which differs from the normal 27xx range.

OPTIONS
       --compaq
              Output a ROM image suitable for the Compaq Portable/Deskpro CGA, rather than the IBM MDA/CGA.

       --comment=message
              When outputting in Compaq format, it is possible to embed a message (usually a copyright message) in unused bytes of the ROM. This option sets the message to include.
