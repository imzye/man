DESCRIPTION
       The  X Window System provides support for changing the image on a display screen after a user-settable period of inactivity to avoid burning the cathode ray tube phosphors.  However, no interfaces
       are provided for the user to control the image that is drawn.  This extension allows an external ``screen saver'' client to detect when the alternate image is to be displayed and  to  provide  the
       graphics.

       Current  X  server implementations typically provide at least one form of ``screen saver'' image.  Historically, this has been a copy of the X logo drawn against the root background pattern.  How‐
       ever, many users have asked for the mechanism to allow them to write screen saver programs that provide capabilities similar to those provided by other window systems.  In particular,  such  users
       often wish to be able to display corporate logos, instructions on how to reactivate the screen, and automatic screen-locking utilities.  This extension provides a means for writing such clients.

   Assumptions
       This  extension exports the notion of a special screen saver window that is mapped above all other windows on a display.  This window has the override-redirect attribute set so that it is not sub‐
       ject to manipulation by the window manager.  Furthermore, the X identifier for the window is never returned by QueryTree requests on the root window, so  it  is  typically  not  visible  to  other
       clients.

       XScreenSaverQueryExtension  returns True if the XScreenSaver extension is available on the given display.  A client must call XScreenSaverQueryExtension before calling any other XScreenSaver func‐
       tion in order to negotiate a compatible protocol version; otherwise the client will get undefined behavior (XScreenSaver may or may not work).

       If the extension is supported, the event number for ScreenSaverNotify events is returned in the value pointed to by event_base.  Since no additional errors are defined by this extension,  the  re‐
       sults of error_base are not defined.

       XScreenSaverQueryVersion  returns  True  if  the  request succeeded; the values of the major and minor protocol versions supported by the server are returned in major_version_return and minor_ver‐
       sion_return .

       XScreenSaverAllocInfo allocates and returns an XScreenSaverInfo structure for use in calls to XScreenSaverQueryInfo.  All fields in the structure are initialized to zero.  If  insufficient  memory
       is available, NULL is returned.  The results of this routine can be released using XFree.

       XScreenSaverQueryInfo returns information about the current state of the screen server in saver_info and a non-zero value is returned.  If the extension is not supported, saver_info is not changed
       and 0 is returned.

       The state field specifies whether or not the screen saver is currently active and how the til-or-since value should be interpreted:

       Off The screen is not currently being saved; til-or-since specifies the number of milliseconds until the screen saver is expected to activate.

       On  The screen is currently being saved; til-or-since specifies the number of milliseconds since the screen saver activated.

       Disabled
           The screen saver is currently disabled; til-or-since is zero.

       The kind field specifies the mechanism that either is currently being used or would have been were the screen being saved:

       Blanked
           The video signal to the display monitor was disabled.

       Internal
           A  server-dependent,  built-in  screen saver image was displayed; either no client had set the screen saver window attributes or a different client had the server grabbed when the screen saver
           activated.

       External
           The screen saver window was mapped with attributes set by a client using the ScreenSaverSetAttributes request.

       The idle field specifies the number of milliseconds since the last input was received from the user on any of the input devices.
       The event-mask field specifies which, if any, screen saver events this client has requested using ScreenSaverSelectInput.

       XScreenSaverSelectInput asks that events related to the screen saver be generated for this client.  If no bits are set in event-mask, then no events will be generated.  Otherwise, any  combination
       of the following bits may be set:

       ScreenSaverNotify
               If this bit is set, ScreenSaverNotify events are generated whenever the screen saver is activated or deactivated.

       ScreenSaverCycle
               If this bit is set, ScreenSaverNotify events are generated whenever the screen saver cycle interval passes.

       XScreenSaverSetAttributes  sets  the attributes to be used the next time the external screen saver is activated.  If another client currently has the attributes set, a BadAccess error is generated
       and the request is ignored.
       Otherwise, the specified window attributes are checked as if they were used in a core CreateWindow request whose parent is the root.  The override-redirect field is ignored as it is implicitly set
       to True.  If the window attributes result in an error according to the rules for CreateWindow, the request is ignored.
       Otherwise, the attributes are stored and will take effect on the next activation that occurs when the server is not grabbed by another client.  Any resources specified for the background-pixmap or
       cursor attributes may be freed immediately.  The server is free to copy the background-pixmap or cursor resources or to use them in place; therefore, the effect of changing the contents  of  those
       resources  is undefined.  If the specified colormap no longer exists when the screen saver activates, the parent's colormap is used instead.  If no errors are generated by this request, any previ‐
       ous screen saver window attributes set by this client are released.
       When the screen saver next activates and the server is not grabbed by another client, the screen saver window is created, if necessary, and set to the specified attributes and events are generated
       as usual.  The colormap associated with the screen saver window is installed.  Finally, the screen saver window is mapped.
       The window remains mapped and at the top of the stacking order until the screen saver is deactivated in response to activity on any of the user input devices, a  ForceScreenSaver  request  with  a
       value of Reset, or any request that would cause the window to be unmapped.
       If  the  screen  saver activates while the server is grabbed by another client, the internal saver mechanism is used.  The ForceScreenSaver request may be used with a value of Active to deactivate
       the internal saver and activate the external saver.
       If the screen saver client's connection to the server is broken while the screen saver is activated and the client's close down mode has not been RetainPermanent or  RetainTemporary,  the  current
       screen saver is deactivated and the internal screen saver is immediately activated.
       When  the screen saver deactivates, the screen saver window's colormap is uninstalled and the window is unmapped (except as described below).  The screen saver XID is disassociated with the window
       and the server may, but is not required to, destroy the window along with any children.
       When the screen saver is being deactivated and then immediately reactivated (such as when switching screen savers), the server may leave the screen saver window mapped (typically to avoid generat‐
       ing exposures).

       XScreenSaverUnsetAttributes instructs the server to discard any previous screen saver window attributes set by this client.

       XScreenSaverRegister stores the given XID in the _SCREEN_SAVER_ID property (of the given type) on the root window of the specified screen.  It returns zero if an error is encountered and the prop‐
       erty is not changed, otherwise it returns non-zero.

       XScreenSaverUnregister removes any _SCREEN_SAVER_ID from the root window of the specified screen.  It returns zero if an error is encountered and the property is changed, otherwise it returns non-
       zero.

       XScreenSaverGetRegistered returns the XID and type stored in the _SCREEN_SAVER_ID property on the root window of the specified screen.  It returns zero if an error is encountered or if  the  prop‐
       erty does not exist or is not of the correct format; otherwise it returns non-zero.

       XScreenSaverSuspend temporarily suspends the screensaver and DPMS timer if suspend is 'True', and restarts the timer if suspend is 'False'.
       This function should be used by applications that don't want the screensaver or DPMS to become activated while they're for example in the process of playing a media sequence, or are otherwise con‐
       tinuously presenting visual information to the user while in a non-interactive state. This function is not intended to be called by an external screensaver application.
       If  XScreenSaverSuspend  is  called  multiple  times  with  suspend  set  to 'True', it must be called an equal number of times with suspend set to 'False' in order for the screensaver timer to be
       restarted. This request has no affect if a client tries to resume the screensaver without first having suspended it.  XScreenSaverSuspend can thus not be used by one client to resume  the  screen‐
       saver if it's been suspended by another client.
       If  a  client  that has suspended the screensaver becomes disconnected from the X server, the screensaver timer will automatically be restarted, unless it's still suspended by another client. Sus‐
       pending the screensaver timer doesn't prevent the screensaver from being forceably activated with the ForceScreenSaver request, or a DPMS mode from being set with the DPMSForceLevel request.
       XScreenSaverSuspend also doesn't deactivate the screensaver or DPMS if either is active at the time the request to suspend them is received by the X server. But once they've been deactivated, they
       won't automatically be activated again, until the client has canceled the suspension.

ERRORS
       XScreenSaverSelectInput, XScreenSaverQueryInfo, XScreenSaverSetAttributes and XScreenSaverUnsetAttributes will generate a BadDrawable error if drawable is not a valid drawable identifier.  If  any
       undefined bits are set in event-mask, a BadValue error is generated by XScreenSaverSelectInput .

AVAILABILITY
       XScreenSaverSuspend is available in version 1.1 and later versions of the X Screen Saver Extension. Version 1.1 was first released with X11R7.1.
