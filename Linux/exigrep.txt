NAME
       EXIGREP - Search Exim's main log

SYNOPSIS
       exigrep [-l] pattern [log file] ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  exigrep utility is a Perl script that searches one or more main log files for entries that match a given pattern.  When it finds a match, it extracts all the log entries for the relevant message,
       not just those that match the pattern.  Thus, exigrep can extract complete log entries for a given message, or all mail for a given user, or for a given host, for example.

       The -l flag means ‘literal’, that is, treat all characters in the pattern as standing for themselves.  Otherwise the pattern must be a Perl regular expression.  The pattern match is  case-insensitive.
       If no file names are given on the command line, the standard input is read.

       If  the  location of a zcat command is known from the definition of ZCAT_COMMAND in Local/Makefile, exigrep automatically passes any file whose name ends in COMPRESS_SUFFIX through zcat as it searches
       it.
