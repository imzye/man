NAME
       bundlewrap - Decentralized configuration management system with Python

SYNOPSIS
       bundlewrap [-h] [-a] [-A] [-d] [-r DIRECTORY] [--version] {apply, debug, groups, hash, items, lock, metadata, nodes, plot, repo, run, stats, test, verify, zen} ...

DESCRIPTION
       BundleWrap fills the gap between complex deployments using Chef or Puppet and old school system administration over SSH. You do not need to know any Python in order to use Bundlewrap, but you can eas‐
       ily extend your bundles using Python.

       While most other config management systems rely on a client-server architecture, BundleWrap works off a repository cloned to your local machine.

       It then automates the process of SSHing into your servers and making sure everything is configured the way it's supposed to be. You won't have to install anything on managed servers.

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
       -h, --help show this help message and exit

       -a, --add-host-keys
              set StrictHostKeyChecking=no instead of yes for SSH

       -A, --adhoc-nodes
              treat unknown node names as adhoc 'virtual' nodes that receive configuration only through groups whose member_patterns match the node name given on the command line (which also has to be a  re‐
              solvable hostname)

       -d, --debug
              print debugging info (implies -v)

       -r DIRECTORY, --repo-path DIRECTORY
              Look for repository at this path (defaults to current working directory)

       --version
              show program's version number and exit

SUBCOMMANDS:
       use 'bw <subcommand> --help' for more info

       apply  Applies the configuration defined in your repository to your nodes

       debug  Start an interactive Python shell for this repository

       groups Lists groups in this repository (deprecated, use `bw nodes -a`)

       hash   Shows a SHA1 hash that summarizes the entire configuration for this repo, node, group, or item.

       items  List and preview items for a specific node

       lock   Manage locks on nodes used to prevent collisions between BundleWrap users

       metadata
              View a JSON representation of a node's metadata

       nodes  List all nodes in this repository

       plot   Generates DOT output that can be piped into `dot -Tsvg -ooutput.svg`.  The resulting output.svg can be viewed using most browsers.

       repo   Various subcommands to manipulate your repository

       run    Run a one-off command on a number of nodes

       stats  Show some statistics about your repository

       test   Test your repository for consistency (you can use this with a CI tool like Jenkins)

       verify Inspect the health or 'correctness' of a node without changing it
