NAME
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPerlFast - Quickly detects the minimum version of Perl required for your dist

VERSION
       version 0.005

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin uses Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast to automatically find the minimum version of Perl required for your dist and adds it to the prereqs.

        # In your dist.ini:
        [MinimumPerlFast]

       This plugin will search for files matching "/\.(t|pl|pm)$/i" in the "lib/", "bin/", and "t/" directories.

ATTRIBUTES
   version
       The minimum version of perl for this module. Determining this is the reason for existence of this module, but if necessary this can easily be overridden.

   default_version
       The minimum version that is used if no minimum can be detected. By default it's 5.008 because that's the oldest that "Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast" can detect.
