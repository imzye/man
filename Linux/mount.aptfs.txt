NAME
       mount.aptfs - a FUSE filesystem that displays unpacked sources packages from APT

SYNOPSIS
       mount.aptfs mountpoint [options]

DESCRIPTION
       AptFs  is  a FUSE-based filesystem that provides a view to unpacked Debian source packages obtained using apt-get source as regular folders.  Binary packages are modelled as symbolic links pointing to
       their respective source package.

       AptFs maintains a sliding window of unpacked sources packages - it would not be very helpful if commands such as:

        % find /path/to/aptfs

       unpacked the entire APT archive into the temporary directory. To specify the number of packages to keep unpacked at one time, use the -o max_unpacked_packages=NUM option.

SECURITY
       By default, AptFs does not verify GPG signatures of source packages. This is because the large number of calls to GnuPG cause deadlocking in both AptFs and other programs using GnuPG. GPG verification
       is also slow.

       One can re-enable verification using passing -o secure=1 when mounting AptFs.
