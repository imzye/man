NAME
       sd2-accc - Speed Dreams 2 multi-layer generator for tracks

SYNOPSIS
       sd2-accc [option] <input .ac file> < output .acc file> [dist] [-order order-string]

DESCRIPTION
       sd2-accc is intended to add multi-texturing to the track models built in the native Ac3d file format.

OPTIONS
       -strip stripify any ac3d output models

       +o     ac3d to ac3d: the result file is optimized in using groups by zone of track track must be named TKMNxxx dist is used to determine the distance of the objects

       +om    ac3d to ac3d: the result is a vertex merged unique obj for smooth car only

       -o     ac3d to obj +s ac3d to ac3d with strips (used for cars)

       +es -angle-of-smooth
              ac3d  to  ac3d  with  strips (used for cars) and extended ac3d file output (computed normals) angle is in degrees: example: +es 80.0 clkdtm_o.ac clkdtm.ac the output file will also contains the
              secondary textcoord for the env sliding

       +et    ac3d to ac3d with triangles (used for cars) and extended ac3d file output (normals normals)

       +etn   ac3d to ac3d with triangles no split and extended ac3d file output (normals normals)

       +shad  ac3d to ac3d with triangles, create a new ac3d file used for track shading vertical mapping of a single texture

       -order order-string
              only used with +es , +s and +et orderstring is the order of the objects during the save for example: HB;OB;OBM is the names of the objet separate by a semicolon for imported NFS cars the object
              name HB must be used instead of: HB

       -g output filename
              for grouping multilayer ac3d track

       -l0 input filename
              the base geometry

       -l1 input filename
              the base geometry map-tiled

       -l2 input filename
              the base geometry skids/and grass details

       -l3 input filename
              the base geometry shadows

       -d3 val
              the max distance of groups in tkmn

       -d2 val
              the distance of group 2 in tkmn

       -d1 val
              the distance of group 1 in tkmn

       -S val the distance of splitting for TERRAIN* objects

       -es    for extended ac3d file format for strips

       -nts   no texture split (for debug)
