NAME
       pyp - The Pyed Piper: A Modern Python Alternative to awk, sed and Other Unix Text Manipulation Utilities

SYNOPSIS
       pyp [options] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       pyp, the Pyed Piper, is a command line tool for text manipulation. It is similar to awk and sed in functionality, but its subcommands are Python based, and thus more familiar to many programmers.

       It can operate both on a per-line base and on the complete input stream.  Different features can be pipelined in a single command by using the pipe character familiar from shell commands.

       pyp backs up its input for reruns with modified commands, and can save commands as macros. On the downside, the rerun feature makes it unsuitable for continuous pipe operation.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, use --manual.

       -h, --help
              Show this help message and exit.

       -m, --manual
              Prints out extended help.

       -l, --macro_list
              Lists all available macros.

       -s MACRO_SAVE_NAME, --macro_save=MACRO_SAVE_NAME
              Saves current command as macro. use "#" for adding
              comments  EXAMPLE:
              pyp -s "great_macro # prints first letter" "p[1]".

       -f MACRO_FIND_NAME, --macro_find=MACRO_FIND_NAME
              Searches for macros with keyword or user name.

       -d MACRO_DELETE_NAME, --macro_delete=MACRO_DELETE_NAME
              Deletes specified public macro.

       -g, --macro_group
              Specify group macros for save and delete; default is user.

       -t TEXT_FILE, --text_file=TEXT_FILE
              Specify text file to load. For advanced users,
              you should typically cat a file into pyp.

       -x, --execute
              Execute all commands.

       -c, --turn_off_color
              Prints raw, uncolored output.

       -u, --unmodified_config
              Prints out generic PypCustom.py config file.

       -b BLANK_INPUTS, --blank_inputs=BLANK_INPUTS
              Generate this number of blank input lines; useful for
              generating numbered lists with variable 'n'.

       -n, --no_input
              Use with command that generates output with no input;
              same as --dummy_input 1.

       -k, --keep_false
              Print blank lines for lines that test as False.
              default is to filter out False lines from the output.

       -r, --rerun
              Rerun based on automatically cached data from the last run.
              Use this after executing "pyp", pasting input into the shell,
              and hitting CTRL-D.
