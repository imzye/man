NAME
       fm - control frequency, volume, mute/unmute of FM radio card

SYNOPSIS
       fm  [ -h ] [ -o ] [ -q ] [ -d device ] [ -t tuner ] [ -T none | forever
              | time ] on | off | + | - | freq [ volume ]

DESCRIPTION
       fm is a program to control the frequency, volume, and mute/unmute state
       of  an  FM  radio  card,  using the video4linux interface introduced in
       2.1.x series Linux kernels.

   OPTIONS
       -h     Print a usage message to standard output, and exit.

       -o     Ignore frequency range limits of card.  Use if you suspect  that
              the  card  supports  a wider frequency range than its driver be‐
              lieves.

       -q     Quiet mode.  Keeps information on station and volume from  being
              printed on standard output.

       -d device
              Sets device as the device to tune.  The default is /dev/radio0.

       -t tuner
              Sets  tuner  as the tuner on the selected device to adjust.  The
              default is tuner 0.  Most  radio  devices  have  only  a  single
              tuner.

       -T none | forever | time
              After  tuning, sleep for the time specified or forever.  Time is
              specified in seconds by default.  A suffix of m  indicates  min‐
              utes, h indicates hours, or d indicates days.

              The  -T option is useful with radio card drivers that only main‐
              tain the tuner settings while the tuner's  file  descriptor  re‐
              mains open.  Try using this option if running fm ordinarily pro‐
              duces only a single "pop" from your speakers.

       freq   Frequency to tune the radio to,  in  MHz.   For  instance,  88.9
              specifies  a  frequency  of  88.9 MHz.  AM tuner values are also
              specified in MHz; for instance, 530 kHz would  be  specified  as
              .530.

       on     Turn the radio on (unmute).

       off    Turn the radio off (mute).

       volume Specify  the  desired volume, in percent.  Not all radio devices
              support volume control.

       +      Increase the current volume.

       -      Decrease the current volume.

CONFIGURATION
       fm reads $HOME/.fmrc, if it exists, to obtain default  settings.   Each
       line may take one of the following forms:

       VOL percent
              Specifies default volume (default: 12.5%).

       INCR percent
              Volume increment used for + and - options (default: 10%).

       TIME   Default sleep time (default: none).

       All other lines are ignored.
