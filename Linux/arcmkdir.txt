ARGUMENTS

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       The  arcmkdir  command creates directories on grid storage elements and indexing services.  If the parent directory does not exist and -p is not specified, then arcmkdir will probably fail, but it de‐
       pends on the protocol. The permissions on the new directory are the default of the server, or if the protocol requires them to be specified then the directory is only  readable/writable/searchable  by
       the user (the equivalent of 700 on a file system).

       If  url  starts  from  '@', the remaining argument is assumed to be a path to a local file containing a list of URLs, one per line.  In this case arcmkdir performs like it were called multiple times -
       once for every URL.

       Depending on the installed libraries (check with -P ), the following protocols may be used: file  (file://  prefix  may  be omitted), http, https, httpg, ftp, gsiftp, srm, root.

FILES
       ~/.arc/client.conf
              Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client configuration file. By using the --conffile option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       X509_USER_PROXY
              The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless the proxy is in a non-standard location.

       ARC_LOCATION
              The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not specified the install location will be determined from the path to the command being executed, and if this fails  a
              WARNING will be given stating the location which will be used.

       ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
              The  location  of  ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The default location is $ARC_LOCATION/lib/arc (\ in
              Windows).

EXAMPLE
