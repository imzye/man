DESCRIPTION
       Parallel Python Network Server

OPTIONS
       -h     this help message

       -d     debug

       -a     enable auto-discovery service

       -r     restart worker process after each task completion

       -n <proto>
              protocol number for pickle module

       -c <path>
              path to config file

       -i <interface>
              interface to listen

       -b <broadcast>
              broadcast address for auto-discovery service

       -p <port>
              port to listen

       -t <seconds>
              timeout to exit if no connections with clients exist

       -k <seconds>
              socket timeout in seconds which is also the maximum time a remote job could be executed. Increase this value if you have long running jobs or decrease if connectivity to remote ppservers is of‐

       -P pid_file
              file to write PID to

SECURITY
       Due to the security concerns it is highly recommended to run ppserver.py with an non-trivial secret key (-s command line argument) which should be paired with the matching secret keyword of PP  Server
       class constructor. An alternative way to set a secret key is by assigning pp_secret variable in the configuration file .pythonrc.py which should be located in the user home directory (please make this
       file readable and writable only by user).  The secret key set in .pythonrc.py could be overridden by command line argument (for ppserver.py) and secret keyword (for PP Server class constructor).
