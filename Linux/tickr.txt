NOTES
       Mouse usage:

       - To open the main menu, right-click inside Tickr area.

       - You can import feed subscriptions from another feed reader with ´File > Import Feed List (OPML)'.

       - To add a new feed, open 'File > Feed Organizer (RSS/Atom)', then look for 'New Feed -> Enter URL' at the bottom of the window, click 'Clear' and type or paste the feed URL.

       - To open a link in your browser, left-click on text.

       - Use mouse wheel to either adjust Tickr scrolling speed or open the ´Selected Feed Picker' window to quickly move between selected feeds (use <ctrl> + mouse wheel for alternative action.)

       - Basically, use 'File > Feed Organizer (RSS|Atom)' to manage your feed list, select feeds, subscribe to new ones, and 'Edit > Preferences' to tweak Tickr appearance and behaviour.

       Local resources:

       - file:///path/file_name is considered an URL and will be XML-parsed, ie a RSS or Atom format is expected.

       - /path/file_name will be processed as a non-XML text file, ie the file will be read 'as is'.

       You can set your favourite browser in the Full Settings window.  Otherwise, the system default one will be looked for.

       Tickr parses command line  arguments  and  looks  for  option(s)  then  for  one  resource,  the  rest  of  the  line  is  ignored.  It  also  reads  configuration  file  'tickr-conf'  located  in
       /home/<user_name>/.tickr/ if it exists (or ´tickr-conf<n>' if an instance id has been set to n.) See FILES.

       Command line options override configuration file ones which override default ones.
