NAME
       gringo - a grounder for non-ground logic programs

SYNOPSIS
       gringo [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gringo command.

       gringo is a grounder that, given an input program with first-order variables, computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program in aspif format. Its output can be processed further with answer
       set solver clasp. Starting with gringo series 5, its output is no longer directly compatible with solvers like smodels or cmodels reading smodels format.  Use the lpconvert converter for translat‐
       ing aspif format to smodels format.

OPTIONS
       These  programs  follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the potassco-
       guide at https://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/guide/.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.
