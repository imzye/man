NAME
       cvsservice - a DCOP service for accessing CVS repositories

SYNOPSIS
       cvsservice [ generic-options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The CVS service is a DCOP service for accessing and working with remote CVS repositories.  Applications may link with this library to access the DCOP service directly from C++.  Alternatively, scripts
       may access the service using the standard dcop(1) command-line tool.

       DCOP is the Desktop Communication Protocol used throughout KDE.

       The CVS DCOP service consists of the following three parts:

       CvsService
              The main interface to the functionality of the cvs(1) command line client.  There is one method for each CVS command, e.g., add, checkout, commit, etc.  The methods assemble  the  command  line
              arguments, create a CvsJob and return a DCOPRef object for it to the caller.  There is one instance of this service for each application instance.

       Repository
              This DCOPObject manages the configuration data of the current CVS repository.  The data is automatically updated when other service instances change it.

       CvsJob This  class  represents  a  CVS  job.   You can execute and cancel it, and you can retrieve the output of the cvs client by either connecting to the proper DCOP signals or by using the output()
              method.  There are two types of jobs.  First the non-concurrent job which has to run alone, like cvs update or import.  Second the jobs which can run concurrently like cvs log or annotate.

       The CVS service is provided with Cervisia, which is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.

OPTIONS
       For a full summary of options, run cvsservice --help.
