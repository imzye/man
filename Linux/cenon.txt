       Cenon

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the Cenon command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       Cenon is a graphical tool of a special kind. Build upon a modular graphical core, Cenon offers a wide variety of possibilities and applications  -  not  only
       Desktop Publishing. The best of all, Cenon is free software, available with full source codes, and at home on many computer platforms.
