NAME
       webgrab - Capture a snapshot of a web page

SYNOPSIS
       webgrab [OPTIONS] URL OUTFILE [...]

DESCRIPTION
       webgrab loads a page from the web (specified by URL) and renders it to a local file. The format of the file is determined from its file name. Currently, pdf, jpg, png, and many other bitmap file
       formats are supported in Linux, while only pdf is supported on Mac and Windows. This discrepancy will be addressed once Qt’s QWebEngine technology matures.

OPTIONS
       -p
           Specifies that output should be split into pages. (Valid for pdf output only.)

       -t, -s, -m, -l, -h
           Specifies that output images should be tiny, small, medium, large, or huge, which is to say 160, 320, 640, 1280, or 2560 pixels wide.

BUGS
       There may be bugs. Please contact the author if one bites you.
