NAME
       update-bgoffice-dicts - automate updating of bgoffice dictionaries

SYNOPSIS
           update-bgoffice-dicts [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       update-bgoffice-dicts automates the downloading and updating of bgoffice dictionaries. It uses debconf(7) to ask the user which dictionaries to download, then invokes bgoffice-dict-download(1) to
       download them, and finally extracts the files in the right directory, so that bgoffice can find them.

       The last part will fail unless update-bgoffice-dicts is run as root.

OPTIONS
       --no-ask
           Normally,  debconf  won't ask the questions that are already seen by the user.  That behaviour is disabled by default, as it is quite useful to be able to change your dictionary selection when
           invoking update-bgoffice-dicts. If you want to simply re-download and unpack the dictionaries, based on a previously made selection, use that option.
