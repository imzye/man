NAME
       cricket - A program to manage the collection and display of time-series data

SYNOPSIS
       cricket-compile
       /usr/share/cricket/collector
       /usr/lib/cgi-bin/cricket/grapher.cgi

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the programs associated with Cricket.

       cricket-compile
              The cricket-compile program compiles the Cricket config tree (found in /etc/cricket) into the format read by the collector. It is normally run after editing the files in the config tree. No
              options are needed.

       collector
              The collector program reads a Cricket configuration from /etc/cricket, compiled by the cricket-compile command, and collects and stores data according to the information found there.  It is
              normally run periodically from a cron(8) job.

       grapher.cgi
              grapher.cgi  is  a  CGI  program  to  display  the  data  collected  by  Cricket  in a graphical format. It is usually accessed using a web browser, e.g. using the URL http://localhost/cgi-
              bin/cricket/grapher.cgi.  It will allow you to navigate around all of the targets in the config tree.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the HTML format; see below.

SEE ALSO
       The programs are documented fully by various HTML documents available via the help system, or directly in /usr/share/doc/cricket.
