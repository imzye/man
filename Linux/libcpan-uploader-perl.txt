CPAN-UPLOAD(1p)                                                                     User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                     CPAN-UPLOAD(1p)

NAME
       cpan-upload - upload a distribution to the CPAN

VERSION
       version 0.103018

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise
       that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

USAGE
         usage: cpan-upload [options] file-to-upload-1 [ file-to-upload-2 ... ]
           -v --verbose       enable verbose logging
           -h --help          display this help message
           --dry-run          do not actually upload anything

           -u --user          your PAUSE username
           -p --password      the password to your PAUSE account
           -d --directory     a dir in your CPAN space in which to put the file
           --http-proxy       URL of the http proxy to use in uploading
           --ignore-errors    instead of aborting, continue to next file on error
           -c --config        config file to use; defaults to ~/.pause
           --md5              compute MD5 checksums of the files
           --retries          number of retries to perform on upload failure
           --retry-delay      number of seconds to wait between retries

CONFIGURATION
       If you have a ".pause" file in your home directory, it will be checked for a username and password.  It should look like this:

         user EXAMPLE
         password your-secret-password

       You can GnuPG-encrypt this file if you wish, but you must install Config::Identity and configure your gpg-agent as Config::Identity currently doesn't prompt for a password at decryption time:

           # Follow the prompts, setting your key as the "recipient"
           # Use ^D once you've finished typing out your authentication information
           gpg -ea > $HOME/.pause
           # OR, encrypt a file you already created:
           gpg -ea $HOME/.pause && mv $HOME/.pause{.asc,}
