NAME
       psblack - PostScript filter.

SYNOPSIS
       psblack < input_PostScript_file > output_PostScript_file

DESCRIPTION
       psblack is a filter which reads a PostScript file as input and writes a PostScript file as output.  In the output file the filter forces a black background and scales the intensity values (values with
       R=G=B) so that any intensity greater than or equal to .8 is mapped to white.  This filter works only on PostScript files produced by ctrans - the CGM translator in the NCAR Graphics software.
