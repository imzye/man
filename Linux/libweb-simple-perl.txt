NAME
       Web::Simple::Deployment - various deployment options

DESCRIPTION
       This file documents common deployment methods for Web::Simple. If you feel one is missing, please ask in the IRC channel and we'll work with you to add it.

CGI
       The most basic deployment option is as a CGI script loading and running your Web::Simple-module:

         #!/usr/bin/env perl

         use Your::Web::Simple::App;
         Your::Web::Simple::App->run_if_script;

       Save that as script.cgi and your web server will handle it correctly.

Plack-Server
       This works in with exactly the same code as CGI deployment. However instead of letting your web server load script.cgi, you run this on the command line:

         plackup script.cgi

   Self-contained CGI
       Sometimes your app is so small that you have only one or two tiny classes that you want to run as a CGI script. Web::Simple offers a helpful mechanism to achieve that.

         #!/usr/bin/env perl

         use Web::Simple 'HelloWorld';   # enables strictures and warnings for the file
                                         # additionally, HelloWorld is upgraded to a
                                         # Web::Simple application
         {
           package HelloWorld;

           sub dispatch_request {
             sub (GET) {
               [
                 200,
                 [ 'Content-type', 'text/plain' ],
                 [ 'Hello world! It is a fine ' . HelloWorld::Helper->day ]
               ]
             },
             sub () {
               [ 405, [ 'Content-type', 'text/plain' ], [ 'Method not allowed' ] ]
             }
           }
         }

         {
           package HelloWorld::Helper;

           use DateTime;

           sub day {
             return DateTime->now->day_name;
           }
         }

         HelloWorld->run_if_script;
