NAME
       buttercup - behaviour-driven testing for Emacs Lisp packages

SYNOPSIS
       buttercup [-h|--help DIR] [-L|--directory DIR] [-f|--funcall FUNCTION] [-l|--load FILE] [--eval|--execute EXPR] [--p|--pattern PATTERN] [--c|--no-color] [--traceback STYLE] dir...

DESCRIPTION
       buttercup invokes the Buttercup testing framework for Emacs Lisp addons for tests found in the directories passed on the command line.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display usage information.

       -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
              Only run tests in files matching the Emacs regular expression PATTERN.  May be passed multiple times.

       -L DIR, --directory DIR, -f FUNCTION, --funcall FUNCTION, -l FILE, --load FILE, --eval EXPR, --execute EXPR
              Passed  on  when  invoking  Emacs in batch mode to run the test suite.  For example, most invocations will pass -L . to include the current project in the load-path.  May be passed multiple
              times.  See emacs(1) for full descriptions of each option.

       -c PATTERN, --no-color PATTERN
              Disable Buttercup's coloured output.

       --traceback STYLE
              When printing backtraces for errors that occur during tests, print them in the chosen STYLE. Available styles are "full", which shows the full function call for each stack frame on a single
              line, "crop", which truncates each stack frame to 80 characters (the default), and "pretty", which uses Emacs' pretty-printing facilities to print each stack frame, and also annotates  each
              frame with a lambda or M to indicate whether it is a normal function call or a macro/special form.

                                                                                                                                                                                               BUTTERCUP(1)
