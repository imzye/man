NAME
       surfraw - a fast unix command line interface to WWW services

SYNOPSIS
       surfraw elviname [options] search words ...
       sr elviname [options] search words ...
       sr -elvi
       sr [options] bookmark [search words]

DESCRIPTION
       Surfraw  provides  a  fast unix command line interface to a variety of popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power.  It reclaims google, altavista, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
       slashdot and many others from the false‐prophet, pox‐infested heathen lands of html‐forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.

       Surfraw consists of a collection of elvi, each of which knows how to search a specific web site.  To see the list of elvi type:

        surfraw -elvi

       Note that sr is an alias for surfraw, so that could equally be

        sr -elvi

       To search using an elvis use:

        sr elviname [options] search terms..

       For example, to search google for information on Debian ports, using the "I'm feeling lucky" option:

        sr google -l debian ports

   Adding the elvi to your path
       If you are a regular user of surfraw, you will probably get sick of typing sr or surfraw each time. You can regain the old behaviour of running the elvi directly by adding the  elvi  directory  (‐
       /usr/lib/surfraw) to your path, either manually or using surfraw-update-path(1).

   Bookmarks
       Surfraw supports bookmarks. To add a bookmark, add it to /etc/xdg/surfraw/bookmarks or $HOME/.config/surfraw/bookmarks

       The format of the bookmarks file is simple, each bookmark is on a separate line, with the bookmark and URL separated by whitespace, eg:

        ntk   http://www.ntk.net/

       If  the  url  contains  the string %s, you can specify an optional argument to the bookmark. Without an argument, only the domain will be returned. With arguments, %s will be replaced by the argu‐
       ments. This obviates the need to create elvi for sites with very simple search options.

       To invoke a bookmark, use "surfraw bookmark" or "sr bookmark", and if an elvis of that name doesn't exist, it searches for a bookmark of that name instead.

       There are some example bookmarks in /etc/xdg/surfraw/bookmarks

OPTIONS
       Use  sr elviname -local-help for elvi‐specific options.

       The following options work with all elvi.

       -help  Show summary of options (including elvi‐specific options).

       -local-help
              Show elvi‐specific options.

       -version
              Show version of program.

       -browser=EXECUTABLE
              Set browser (default: sensible-browser).

       -elvi  Display a list of other Surfraw mechanisms for conquering evil.

       -escape-url-args=yes|no
              Apply url escaping to arguments (default: yes)

       -q|-quote
              Bracket all arguments with " characters (default: no).  Note that putting quotes round arguments works now, so you can do, for example:

               sr google foo "bar baz" bam

              and the quoting is passed on to the search engine

EXAMPLES
        $ sr ask why is jeeves gay?
        $ surfraw google -results=100 RMS, GNU, which is sinner, which is sin?
        $ sr austlii -method=phrase dog like
        $ /usr/lib/surfraw/rhyme -method=perfect Julian

CONFIGURATION
       Surfraw uses the XDG basedir spec (http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html) to locate config files. The default locations are shown below, but can be modified  by  set‐
       ting the environment variables $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS.  See the spec for more details.

       Surfraw gets its configuration from three sources, in order:

       1.  Environment variables

       2.  /etc/xdg/surfraw/conf

       3.  $HOME/.config/surfraw/conf

       /etc/xdg/surfraw.conf and $HOME/.config/surfraw/conf are both fragments of bourne‐shell style shell script.

       /etc/xdg/surfraw.conf  should  use  def and defyn to define variables.  These functions set variables unless they are already set by the environment.  defyn is used for boolean configuration vari‐
       ables, def for all others. For instance:

        def     SURFRAW_text_browser  /usr/bin/lynx
        defyn   SURFRAW_graphical          no

       $HOME/.config/surfraw/conf should use sh‐style entries, eg:

        SURFRAW_text_browser=/usr/bin/lynx
        SURFRAW_graphical=no

       This is because you want them to override environment variables unconditionally.
