NAME
       runmirrors.mirror - Downstream mirror list for runmirrors

DESCRIPTION
       ftpsync  is  part of the ftpsync suite for mirroring Debian and Debian-like repositories of packages.  As there are way too many mirrors of Debian to populate them all from the machine that gener‐
       ates the archive (“ftp-master”), mirrors are organized in a tree-shaped hierarchy.  Thus, every mirror has exactly one upstream from which it syncs, and each mirror can have any  number  of  down‐
       streams which in turn sync from it.
