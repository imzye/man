NAME
       subuser - install, administer, and run desktop applications with Docker.

SYNOPSIS
       subuser [SUBCOMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       subuser  allows  you  to install and administer desktop applications contained using Docker. This is useful if you need to provide portability across Linux distributions or hightened security. The
       applications have limited access to the main system and user files. Access is granted solely through a whitelisting permissions file.

OPTIONS
       Pass the --help option to any subcommand in order to find its options.  The following subcommands are available:

       subuser
              Add, remove, and configure subusers

       run    Run subusers

       repository
              Add and configure repositories

       update Update subuser images

       remove-old-images
              Remove unused images to free up disk space

       registry
              Interact with the subuser registry

       list   List subusers and images

       describe
              Describe subusers and images

       repair Repair your subuser installation. Useful after migrating to a new system.

       pkg    Create new subuser images

       dev    Use subuser to create portable and reproducible dev environments

       version
              Print subuser's version information

EXAMPLES
       To create a subuser named web-browsing based on the iceweasel image

              $ subuser subuser add web-browsing iceweasel@default

       To run that subuser

              $ subuser run web-browsing

       To create a second subuser, also based on the iceweasel image, but this time reserved for internet banking

              $ subuser subuser add internet-banking iceweasel@default

       To run that subuser

              $ subuser run internet-banking

       To add a subuser to the PATH

              $ subuser subuser add-to-path internet-banking

       To update your subuser images

              $ subuser update all

       All updates are atomic, and you can continue to use your subusers while the update command is running.  If you find that an older version of a subuser's image was better, you can always roll  back
       the update for that subuser

              $ subuser registry log
              $ subuser lock-subuser-to internet-banking <commit-hash-from-log>
