NAME
       pecomato - a portable picture-embedded metadata processor

SYNOPSIS
       pecomato [OPTION...] OP [EXPR] FILE [FILE...]

       pecomato [OPTION...] OP [EXPR] @FILE

       usage of form OP EXPR only concerns OP mode dump-value, see below.

       use @file to read a list of files from that file. the file must contain exactly one filename to process per line (don't escape anything, filenames are taken as-is).

DESCRIPTION
       pecomato  is  basically  designed  to  display any kind of information embedded in picture files, as well as checking, filtering, extracting, removing, adding and fixing such information. In other
       words, it's a metadata processor.

       It supports the following file formats: JPEG/JFIF, Adobe PSD and FFO, raw IPTC.  And it knows about the following metadata formats: JFIF, IPTC, Exif, Adobe and Fotostation. More file and  metadata
       formats might be supported later: TIFF, etc.

       One of its main goals is to check the validity of parsed metadata as well as optionally check the strict compliance to official standards. On another hand, it aims to provide ways of fixing broken
       or not compliant chunks as well as providing general basic functions to manipulate the metadata.

OPTIONS
       general options:

        -v, --version
              show version number then exit

        -h, --help
              show this usage help then exit

            --list
              list all supported embedded data structures

        -l, --log-level NUM
              define verbosity (see possible values below)

        -c, --check-compliance
              perform full checks to test the strict validity and compliance of structures to official formats

       filtering and extracting options:

        -b, --backup
              create backup files of (re)written files if necessary

        -d, --target-dir DIRNAME
              target directory for all written files

        -f, --fix
              fix metadata inconsistencies when possible

       extracting options:

        -x, --extract TYPE
              extract and save metadata to a standalone file (see below for a list of metadata types that can be extracted)

        -t, --ext EXTENSION
              define what filename extension to use when writing metadata that is extracted (default: .iptc)

        -a, --append-ext
              append extension to original filename when saving the extracted metadata (default: replace original file extension)

       filtering options:

        -i, --include EXPR
              a filter expression describing the datasets to keep

        -i, --include @FILE
              or a file containing a list of datasets to keep, all other datasets will be filtered out.  if not used, all datasets will be kept

        -e, --exclude EXPR
              a filter expression describing the datasets to filter out

        -e, --exclude @FILE
              a file containing a list of datasets to filter out, all other datasets will be kept. if not used all datasets will be kept

        --edit EXPR
              a filter edit expression describing the datasets to add

        --edit @FILE
              or a file containing a list of datasets to add.  datasets won't be inserted if that breaks compliance to the standards

        --test
              don't override original file, create *.rewrite file.  this option only affects rewriting of source files

       dump options:

        -w, --wrap NUM
              max column for wrapping (num must be in range [8-1024]). default is to dump unwrapped

POSSIBLE OPS
        check just check embedded data structures

        dump  show embedded data (headers only)

        dump-full
              show all embedded data (including values)

        dump-value
              show requested value (headers only)

        filter
              filter embedded data (see -i, -e and --edit)

DUMP-VALUE EXPRESSIONS
       IPTC.<record>

       same as filter include/exclude expression, see below:

FILTER INCLUDE/EXCLUDE EXPRESSIONS
       IPTC.<record>

       where <record> can be either:

       all:               *

       hexadecimal unary: 0xhhhh

       hexadecimal range: 0xhhhh-0xhhhh

       decimal unary:     nnn:nnn

       decimal ranges:    nnn:nnn-nnn

                          nnn:*

       examples:

       IPTC.0x0219

       IPTC.0x0300-0x0364

       IPTC.3:0-100

FILTER EDIT EXPRESSIONS
       IPTC.<record>=<type>:<value>

       where <record> can be either:

       hexadecimal unary: 0xhhhh

       decimal unary:     nnn:nnn

       where <type> can be either:

       hex

       text

       and <value> is:

       hex:  [a-zA-Z0-9] pairs

       text: any char (even widechars) on the line is taken as text, until

             a newline is found

       examples:

       IPTC.0x0200=hex:0002

       IPTC.0x0219=text:this is a keyword

        2     warning and error messages

        3     informative, warning and error messages

        4     all messages including debug ones

        Adobe Photoshop files (commonly .psd, .pdd, .ffo)

        FotoStation files (commonly .fdp, .ipt)

        standalone IPTC metadata (commonly .iptc)
