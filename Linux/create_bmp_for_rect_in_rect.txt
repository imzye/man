NAME
       create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect - bitmap generator for rectangular conductor inside rectangular conductor (part of atlc)

SYNOPSIS

WARNING
       This  man  page  is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages are produced.  The
       best documentation that was current at the time the version was produced should be found on your hard drive, usually at
       /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
       although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors are corrected in the documentation and placed at http://atlc.sourceforge.net/  be‐
       fore a new release of atlc is released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

DESCRIPTION
       create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect  is  a pre-processor for atlc, the finite difference program that is used to calculate the properties of a two and three conductor electrical transmission line of arbitrary
       cross section. The program create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect is used as a fast way of generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics program), for a rectangular conductor inside a  rectangular  con‐
       ductor, with two dieletrics, like this:

       The  parameters  'W' and 'H' and the inner dimensions of the outer conductor.  The outer dimensions of the inner conductor are 'w' and 'c'. The inner conductor is assumed to rest on a dielectric (Er2)
       which is 'd' wide and outer conductor an the inner conductor is offset 'b' from the left hand sidewall of the outer conductor. The whole region is surrounded by a dielectric of  relative  permittivity
       'Er1'. The dielectrics 'Er1' and then 'Er1' and 'Er2' will both be 1.0

       The bitmap is printed to the file specifiled as the last argument

       create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect -f filename.bmp W H a b c d w h Er1 Er2

       The bitmaps produced by create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect are 24-bit bit colour bitmaps, as are required by atlc.

       The  permittivities  of  the  bitmap, set by 'Er1' and 'Er2', determine the colours in the bitmap. If Er1 or Er2 is 1.0, 1.0006, 2.1, 2.2, 2.33, 2.5, 3.3, 3.335, 3.7, 4.8, 10.2 or 100, then the colour
       corresponding to that permittivity will be set according to the colours defined in COLOURS below. If Er1 is not one of those permittivities, the region of permittivity Er1 will be set  to  the  colour
       0xCAFF00.  If  Er2  is not one of those values, then the region of the image will be set to the colour 0xAC82AC. The program atlc does not know what these permittivites are, so they atlc, must be told
       with the comand line option -d, as in example 4 below.

OPTIONS
       -b bitmapsize
       is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy to which atlc is able to calculate the transmission line's properties. The default value for 'bitmapsize' is normally 4, although this is set
       at compile time. The value can be set anywhere from 1 to 15, but more than 8 is probably not sensible.

       -f outfile
       Set the output filename. By default, the bitmap is sent to stdout, but it *must* be sent to a file, with this option, or as described above.

       -v
       Causes create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect to print some data to stderr. Note, nothing extra goes to standard output, as that is expected to be redirected to a bitmap file.

COLOURS
       The  24-bit  bitmaps  that  atlc  expects,  have  8  bits  assigned  to  represent  the  amount of red, 8 for blue and 8 for green. Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making a total of
       256*256*256=16777216 colours.  Every one of the possible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the stating the exact amount of red, green and blue, as in:

       red         = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
       green       = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00
       blue        = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff
       black       = 000,000,000 or 0x000000
       white       = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff
       Brown       = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff
       gray        = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e

       Some colours, such as pink, turquoise, sandy, brown, gray etc may mean slightly different things to different people. This is not so with atlc, as the program expects the colours below to  be  EXACTLY
       defined  as  given.  Whether you feel the colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in your bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour recognised by atlc, or you must define it with a
       command line option (see OPTIONS and example 5 below).
       red    = 255,000,000 or 0xFF0000 is the live conductor.
       green  = 000,255,000 or 0x00FF00 is the grounded conductor.
       blue   = 000,000,000 or 0x0000FF is the negative conductor

       All bitmaps must have the live (red) and grounded (green) conductor. The blue conductor is not currently supported, but it will be used to indicate a negative conductor, which will be  needed  if/when
       the program gets extended to analyse directional couplers.

       The following dielectrics are recognised by atlc and so are produced by create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect.

       white     255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as Er=1.0    (vacuum)
       pink      255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air)
       L. blue   130,052,255 or 0x8235EF as Er=2.1    (PTFE)
       Mid gray  142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2    (duroid 5880)
       mauve     255.000,255 or 0xFF00FF as Er=2.33  (polyethylene)
       yellow    255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5    (polystyrene)
       sandy     239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3    (PVC)
       brown     188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335  (epoxy resin)
       Turquoise 026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8    (glass PCB)
       Dark gray 142,142,142 or 0x696969 as Er=6.15   (duroid 6006)
       L. gray   240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2  (duroid 6010)
       D. orange 213,160,067 or 0xD5A04D as Er=100.0 (mainly for test purposes)

EXAMPLES
       Here are a few examples of the use of create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect. Again, see the html documentation in atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs/index.html for more examples.

       In the first example, there is just an air dielectric, so Er1=Er2=1.0.  The inner of 1x1 inches (or mm, miles etc) is placed centrally in an outer with dimensions 3 x 3 inches.

       The exact place where the dielectric starts (a) and its width (d) are unimportant, but they must still be entered.

       % create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 > ex1.bmp
       % atlc ex1.bmp

       In  this  second example, an inner of 15.0 mm x 0.5 mm is surrounded by an outer with internal dimensions of 61.5 x 20.1 mm. There is a material with permittivity 2.1 (Er of PTFE) below the inner con‐
       ductor. The output from create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect is sent to a file ex1.bmp, which is then processed by atlc

       % create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect 61.5 20.1 5 22 0.5 50 15 5 1.0 2.1 > ex2.bmp
       % atlc ex2.bmp

       In example 3, the bitmap is made larger, to increase accuracy, but otherwise this is identical to the second example.  % create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect -b7 61.5 20.1 5 22 0.5 50 15 5 1.0 2.1 > ex3.bmp
       % atlc ex3.bmp

       In the fourth example, materials with permittivites 2.78 and 7.89 are used. While there is no change in how to use create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect, since these permittivities are not known, we  must  tell
       atlc  what  they  are.  % create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect 61 20 1 4 22 0.5 50 15 5 2.78 7.89 > ex5.bmp % atlc -d CAFF00=2.78 -d AC82AC=7.89 ex5.bmp In the sixth and final example, the -v option is used to
       print some extra data to stderr from create_bmp_for_rect_in_rect.
