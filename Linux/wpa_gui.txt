NAME
       wpa_gui - WPA Graphical User Interface

SYNOPSIS
       wpa_gui [ -p path to ctrl sockets ]  [ -i ifname ]  [ -m seconds ]  [ -t ]  [ -q ]

OVERVIEW
       wpa_gui is a QT graphical frontend program for interacting with wpa_supplicant. It is used to query current status, change configuration and request interactive user input.

       wpa_gui  supports  (almost)  all of the interactive status and configuration features of the command line client, wpa_cli. Refer to the wpa_cli manpage for a comprehensive list of the interactive mode
       features.

COMMAND ARGUMENTS
       -p path
              Change the path where control sockets should be found.

       -i ifname
              Specify the interface that is being configured. By default, choose the first interface found with a control socket in the socket path.

       -m seconds
              Set the update interval in seconds for the signal strength meter. This value must be a positive integer, otherwise meter is not enabled (default behavior).

       -t     Start program in the system tray only (if the window manager supports it). By default the main status window is shown.

       -q     Run program in the quiet mode - do not display tray icon pop-up messages.
