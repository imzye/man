SYNOPSIS
       dzen2-dbar [-w characters] [-s symbol] [-min minvalue] [-max maxvalue] [-l string] [-nonl]

DESCRIPTION
       dbar is an application that generates semi graphical progress meters, from some values you supply to it.

       See the usage examples for a description of the expected input format.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -max   Value to be considered 100% (default: 100)

       -min   Value to be considered 0% (default: 0)

       -w     Number of charcaters to be considered 100% in the bar  (default: 25 )

       -s     Symbol represeting the percentage value in the bar (default: =  )

       -l     label to be prepended to the bar (default: '' )

       -nonl  no new line, don't put '0 at the end of the bar    (default: do print '0)

USAGE EXAMPLES
       Static 0% and 100% mark or single value input:

              Command: echo 25 | dzen2-dbar -m 100 -l Sometext
              Output: Sometext  25% [======                   ]

       If your 100% mark changes dynamically or 2-values input:

              Output: 33% [========                 ]

       If your value range is not between [0, maxval] or 3-values input:

              Command: echo "50 -25 150" | dzen2-dbar
              Output: 43% [===========              ]
