NAME
       pcilib - a library for accessing PCI devices

DESCRIPTION
       The PCI library (also known as pcilib and libpci) is a portable library for accessing PCI devices and their configuration space.

ACCESS METHODS
       The library supports a variety of methods to access the configuration space on different operating systems. By default, the first matching method in this list is used, but you can specify override
       the decision (see the -A switch of lspci).

       linux-sysfs
              The /sys filesystem on Linux 2.6 and newer. The standard header of the config space is available to all users, the rest only to root. Supports extended configuration space, PCI domains, VPD
              (from Linux 2.6.26), physical slots (also since Linux 2.6.26) and information on attached kernel drivers.

       linux-proc
              The /proc/bus/pci interface supported by Linux 2.1 and newer. The standard header of the config space is available to all users, the rest only to root.

       intel-conf1
              Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. Available on i386 and compatibles on Linux, Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Windows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires root privileges.

       intel-conf2
              Direct  hardware  access  via Intel configuration mechanism 2. Available on i386 and compatibles on Linux, Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Windows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires root privileges. Warning:
              This method is able to address only the first 16 devices on any bus and it seems to be very unreliable in many cases.

       mmio-conf1
              Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1 via memory-mapped I/O.  Mostly used on non-i386 platforms. Requires root privileges. Warning: This method  needs  to  be  properly
              configured via the mmio-conf1.addrs parameter.

       mmio-conf1-ext
              Direct  hardware  access via Extended PCIe Intel configuration mechanism 1 via memory-mapped I/O.  Mostly used on non-i386 platforms. Requires root privileges. Warning: This method needs to
              be properly configured via the mmio-conf1-ext.addrs parameter.

       ecam   Direct hardware access via PCIe ECAM (Enhanced Configuration Access Mechanism).  Available on all PCIe-compliant hardware. Requires root privileges and access to physical memory  (on  Linux
              systems  disabled CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM option). On ACPI compatible systems is ECAM mapping read from the MCFG table specified by the ecam.acpimcfg parameter. On EFI compatible systems, ACPI
              MCFG table can be located in physical memory via EFI system table specified by the ecam.efisystab parameter. On FreeBSD/NetBSD systems, physical address of ACPI MCFG table can be located by
              kenv or sysctl interface when the ecam.bsd parameter is not disabled. On x86 BIOS compatible systems, ACPI MCFG table can be located in physical memory by scanning x86 BIOS memory when  the
              ecam.x86bios parameter is not disabled. Alternatively ECAM mappings can be specified by the ecam.addrs parameter which takes precedence over ACPI MCFG table. This option is required on sys‐
              tems without ACPI and also on systems without EFI or x86 BIOS.

       fbsd-device
              The /dev/pci device on FreeBSD. Requires root privileges.

       aix-device
              Access method used on AIX. Requires root privileges.

       nbsd-libpci
              The /dev/pci0 device on NetBSD accessed using the local libpci library.

       obsd-device
              The /dev/pci device on OpenBSD. Requires root privileges.

       dump   Read the contents of configuration registers from a file specified in the dump.name parameter. The format corresponds to the output of lspci -x.

       darwin Access method used on Mac OS X / Darwin. Must be run as root and the system must have been booted with debug=0x144.

       win32-cfgmgr32
              Device  listing on Windows systems using the Windows Configuration Manager via cfgmgr32.dll system library. This method does not require any special Administrator rights or privileges. Con‐
              figuration Manager provides only basic information about devices, assigned resources and device tree structure. There is no access to the PCI configuration space but libpci either tries  to
              use  other  access  method to access configuration space or it provides read-only virtual emulation based on information from Configuration Manager. Other access method can be chosen by the
              win32.cfgmethod parameter. By default the first working one is selected (if any). Starting with Windows 8 (NT 6.2) it is not possible to retrieve resources from 32-bit  application  or  li‐
              brary on 64-bit system.

       win32-sysdbg
              Access  to the PCI configuration space via NT SysDbg interface on Windows systems. Process needs to have Debug privilege, which local Administrators have by default. Not available on 64-bit
              systems and neither on recent 32-bit systems. Only devices from the first domain are accessible and only first 256 bytes of the PCI configuration space is accessible via this method.

       win32-kldbg
              Access to the PCI configuration space via Kernel Local Debugging Driver kldbgdrv.sys. This driver is not part of the Windows system but is part of the Microsoft WinDbg tool. It is  required
              to  have  kldbgdrv.sys  driver  installed  in the system32 directory or to have windbg.exe or kd.exe binary in PATH.  windbg.exe or kd.exe binary contains embedded kldbgdrv.sys driver which
              libpci can automatically unpack and register. Because of embedded driver usage, it is required that architecture of windbg.exe or kd.exe binary matches the system architecture, and not  the
              libpci  application architecture. Therefore for running i386 libpci application on AMD64 system, it is required to have AMD64 version of kldbgdrv.sys driver in the native system32 directory
              or AMD64 version of windbg.exe or kd.exe binary in the PATH. i386 versions of these binaries would not work. win32-kldbg access method compiled for 32-bit applications supports both  32-bit
              and also 64-bit OS host systems, therefore i386 libpci application with win32-kldbg method can access PCI config space also on AMD64 host system.  kldbgdrv.sys driver has some restrictions.
              Process needs to have Debug privilege and Windows system has to be booted with Debugging option. Debugging option can be enabled by calling (takes effect after next boot): bcdedit /debug on

       aos-expansion
              Access method used on PowerPC Amiga running OS4+. Access is made through Expansion.library. It offers read and write access to configuration space.

       rt-thread-smart
              The  /proc/pci  filesystem  provided  by RT-Thread Smart OS. This method requires PCI support (with the procfs feature enabled) to be available in the driver subsystem, and the DFS v2-based
              procfs must be mounted in a rootfs-enabled environment.  It provides access to the standard PCI configuration space, with limited information available.

PARAMETERS
       The library is controlled by several parameters. They should have sensible default values, but in case you want to do something unusual (or even something weird), you can override them (see the -O
       switch of lspci).

   Parameters of specific access methods
       dump.name
              Name of the bus dump file to read from.

       fbsd.path
              Path to the FreeBSD PCI device.

       nbsd.path
              Path to the NetBSD PCI device.

       obsd.path
              Path to the OpenBSD PCI device.

       proc.path
              Path to the procfs bus tree.

       sysfs.path
              Path to the sysfs device tree.

       rt-thread-smart-dm.path
              Path to the rt-thread smart DM procfs device tree.

       devmem.path
              Path to the /dev/mem device or path to the \Device\PhysicalMemory NT section or name of the platform specific physical address access method. Generally on POSIX systems it is path to memory
              device and on Windows systems it is path to memory NT section. Additionally on 32-bit Windows systems are recognized also platform methods: vxdcall, w32skrnl. On DOS/DJGPP systems are  rec‐
              ognized  only platform methods: auto, devmap, physmap.  DJGPP's devmap method uses DPMI 1.0 functions 0508H (Map Device in Memory Block) and 0509H (Map Conventional Memory in Memory Block).
              DJGPP's physmap method uses DPMI 0.9 function 0800H (Physical Address Mapping). DJGPP's auto parameter automatically chooses one of the mentioned method supported by the system.

       mmio-conf1.addrs
              Physical addresses of memory-mapped I/O ports for Intel configuration mechanism 1.  CF8 (address) and CFC (data) I/O port addresses are separated by slash and multiple addresses for differ‐
              ent PCI domains are separated by commas.  Format: 0xaddr1/0xdata1,0xaddr2/0xdata2,...

       mmio-conf1-ext.addrs
              Physical addresses of memory-mapped I/O ports for Extended PCIe Intel configuration mechanism 1.  It has same format as mmio-conf1.addrs parameter.

       ecam.addrs
              Physical addresses of PCIe ECAM mappings. Each mapping must contains first PCI bus number and physical address where mapping starts. And then it may contain the length of the  mapping,  the
              last  PCI  bus number and PCI domain number. When the last PCI bus number is not provided then it is calculated from the length of the mapping or it is assumed 0xff. When length of the map‐
              ping is provided then it is calculated from the last PCI bus number. And when PCI domain is not provided then 0x0 is assumed. All numbers must be supplied in hexadecimal form (leading  pre‐
              fix 0x is not required). Multiple mappings are separated by commas.  Format: [domain:]start_bus[-end_bus]:start_addr[+length],...

       ecam.acpimcfg
              Path to the ACPI MCFG table. Processed by the glob(3) function, so it may contain wildcards (*).

       ecam.efisystab
              Path to the EFI system table.

       ecam.bsd
              When not set to 0 then use BSD kenv or sysctl to find ACPI MCFG table. Default value is 1 on BSD systems.

       ecam.x86bios
              When not set to 0 then scan x86 BIOS memory for ACPI MCFG table. Default value is 1 on x86 systems.

       win32.cfgmethod
              Config space access method to use with win32-cfgmgr32 on Windows systems. Value auto or an empty string selects the first access method which supports access to the config space on Windows.
              Value win32-cfgmgr32 or none only builds a read-only virtual emulated config space with information from the Configuration Manager.

   Parameters for resolving of ID's via DNS
       net.domain
              DNS domain containing the ID database.

       net.cache_name
              Name of the file used for caching of resolved ID's. An initial ~/ is expanded to the user's home directory.

   Parameters for resolving of ID's via UDEV's HWDB
       hwdb.disable
              Disable use of HWDB if set to a non-zero value.
