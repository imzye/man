              evaluate expression '...' before initialization

       -e '...'
              evaluate expression '...' after initialization

SEE ALSO
       The documentation for Macaulay2 is available locally starting in ${prefix}/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/index.html, where ${prefix} is replaced by the directory prefix used when the pack‐
       age was installed.  The directory is available as the value of the Macaulay2 variable prefixDirectory, but the best way to get to the documentation is to run the command viewHelp in Macaulay2.

       The home page for Macaulay2 is https://macaulay2.com/.
