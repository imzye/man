NAME
       svim - Structural variant caller for long sequencing reads

DESCRIPTION
       usage: svim [-h] [--version] {reads,alignment} ...

       SVIM  (pronounced  SWIM) is a structural variant caller for long reads.  It discriminates six different variant classes: deletions, tandem and interspersed duplications, inversions, insertions and
       translocations. SVIM is unique in its capability of extracting both the genomic origin and destination of duplications.

       SVIM consists of four major steps: - COLLECT detects signatures for SVs in long read alignments - CLUSTER merges signatures that come from the same SV - COMBINE combines  clusters  from  different
       genomic regions and classifies them into distinct SV types - GENOTYPE uses alignments spanning SVs to determine their genotype

       SVIM  can  process  two types of input. Firstly, it can detect SVs from raw reads by aligning them to a given reference genome first ("SVIM.py reads [options] working_dir reads genome").  Alterna‐
       tively, it can detect SVs from existing reads alignments in SAM/BAM format ("SVIM.py alignment [options] working_dir bam_file").

   positional arguments:
       {reads,alignment}
              modes

       reads  Detect SVs from raw reads. Align reads to given reference genome first.

       alignment
              Detect SVs from an existing alignment

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       --version, -v
              show program's version number and exit
