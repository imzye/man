DESCRIPTION
       The  gnmmanage  program can perform various managing operations on geo‐
       graphical networks in GDAL. In addition to creating and  deleting  net‐
       works this includes capabilities of managing network's features, topol‐
       ogy and rules.

       -info  Different information about network: system  and  class  layers,
              network metadata, network spatial reference.

       create Create network.

              -f <format_name>
                     Output file format name.

              -t_srs <srs_name>
                     Spatial reference input.

              -dsco NAME=VALUE
                     Network creation option set as pair name=value.

       import <src_dataset_name>
              Import layer with dataset name to copy.

              -l layer_name

              Layer name in dataset. If unset, 0 layer is copied.

       connect <gfid_src> <gfid_tgt> <gfid_con>
              Make  a  topological connection, where the gfid_src and gfid_tgt
              are vertices and gfid_con is edge (gfid_con can be  -1,  so  the
              system edge will be inserted).

              Manually assign the following values:

              -c <cost>
                     Cost / weight

              -ic <invcost>
                     Inverse cost

              -dir <dir>
                     Direction of the edge.

       disconnect <gfid_src> <gfid_tgt> <gfid_con>
              Removes the connection from the graph.

       rule <rule_str>
              Creates a rule in the network by the given rule_str string.

       autoconnect <tolerance>
              Create  topology  automatically  with the given double tolerance
              and layer names. In no layer name provided all layers of network
              will be used.

       delete Delete network.

       change Change blocking state of network edges or vertices.

              -bl <gfid>
                     Block  feature  before  the main operation. Blocking fea‐
                     tures are saved in the special layer.

              -unbl <gfid>
                     Unblock feature before the main operation.

              -unblall
                     Unblock all blocked features before the main operation.

       <gnm_name>
              The network to work with (path and name).

       <layer>
              The network layer name.
