NAME
       timblclient - a simple client to access the Tilburg Memory Based Learner Server

SYNOPSIS
       timblclient -h host -p port [-i inputfile] [-i outputfile] [--batch] [-b basename]

DESCRIPTION
       timblclient connects to a TimblServer on 'host':'port' and sends it the normal instructions. (see timblserver )

OPTIONS
       The timblclient options are

       -i inputfile
              a series of timblserver commands.

              When BATCH is specified, inputfile is supposed to be a 'normal' Timbl testfile. Every line is send to the timblserver as a 'classify' command.  Default is stdin.

       -o outputfile
              Where to put the results. Default is stdout.

       --batch
              When --batch is specified, the input from 'inputfile' is not interpreted as timblserver commands, but as instances that will be send 'as is' prepended by a classify instruction.

       -h host
              connect to the server on 'host'

       -p port
              connect to 'port' on 'host'

       -b basename
              set the base in TimblServer to 'base'

BUGS
       This is just a simple testprogram, and rather clumsy.
