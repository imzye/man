NAME
       claws-mail-archiver-plugin - archive messages to compressed files

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the claws-mail-archiver-plugin package.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       claws-mail-archiver-plugin is a plugin (loadable module) for the Claws Mail mailer.

       This plugin uses libarchive to extend Claws Mail features with archiving capabilities. Several archive formats are available, with or without compression.

USAGE
       Before using a plugin you must instruct Claws Mail to load it on startup.

       For this you must go “Configuration” menu on main window toolbar, open “Plugins...”  dialog, click on the “Load plugin...”  button and select the plugin file, named archive.so, and press the
       “Open” button.

SEE ALSO
       claws-mail(1), libarchive-formats(5), claws-mail-extra-plugins(7).
