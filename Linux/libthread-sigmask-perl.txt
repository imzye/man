NAME
       Thread::SigMask - Thread specific signal masks

VERSION
       version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
        use Thread::SigMask qw/sigset/;
        use POSIX qw/SIG_BLOCK SIG_UNBLOCK/;

        sigmask(SIG_BLOCK, $sigset);
        ...
        sigmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, $sigset);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides per-thread signal masks. On non-threaded perls it will be effectively the same as POSIX::sigprocmask. The interface works exactly the same as sigprocmask.

FUNCTIONS
   sigmask($how, $newset, $oldset = undef)
       Change and/or examine calling process's signal mask. This uses "POSIX::SigSet" objects for the newset and oldset arguments. The behavior of the call is dependent on the value of how.

       •   SIG_BLOCK

           The set of blocked signals is the union of the current set and the set argument.

       •   SIG_UNBLOCK

           The signals in set are removed from the current set of blocked signals. It is permissible to attempt to unblock a signal which is not blocked.

       •   SIG_SETMASK

           The set of blocked signals is set to the argument set.

       If  oldset  is  defined, the previous value of the signal mask is stored in oldset. If newset is NULL, then the signal mask is unchanged (i.e., how is ignored), but the current value of the signal
       mask is nevertheless returned in oldset (if it is not NULL).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Parts of this documentation is shamelessly stolen from POSIX and Linux' sigprocmask(2).
