              [ -terminal ]
              [ -X ]
              [ -axis [(axis0) low hi] [(axis1) low hi]  ...]

       note: [] denotes `optional' option or argument,
             () hints at the wanted arguments for options
             {} denotes default (compiled-in) parameters

       (note: defaults may have been changed by editing joy2key.c)

DESCRIPTION
       joy2key  monitors the joystick (normally /dev/input/js0) and sends keyboard events to an X window, terminal, or raw console.  In the case of X, xwininfo(1) is used to retrieve the window ID, which
       should not be a problem as this is a standard utility in most X11 distributions.  To find the symbolic name of a particular key, see include/X11/keysymdef.h.  In terminal mode, joy2key  sends  the
       ascii  character  given  on  the  command  line (that is, "joy2key -buttons a" means send lowercase 'a' when the first joystick button is pushed).  In raw console mode, please consult the document
       "rawscancodes" included in this distribution for the proper scancodes.

   Options
       -X     Send X events.  May be compiled out of your copy of joy2key.

       -rawconsole
              For SVGALIB and similar programs that put the keyboard in raw mode.  Sends scancodes.  May be compiled out of your copy of joy2key.

       -terminal
              Send ascii characters.  May be compiled out of your copy of joy2key.

       -axis  Specifies actions to send when passing low/high values for each axis.  Specified in pairs, from axis0 ... axisN, that is, the X axis is axis0, then the Y axis (axis1), then if  you  have  a
              joystick hat that may be axis 2 and 3, etc.  To figure out which axis is which, use the jstest program that comes with the joystick driver.

       -buttons
              Similar to -arrows, but for buttons.  Goes from button0 ... buttonN, specifying key to send for each button on joystick.  Use the jstest program to determine the numbering for each button.

       -thresh
              Specifies low/high thresholds to use (i.e. at what point moving the stick or pressing the gamepad triggers an event) in pairs, for each joystick axis.

       -dev   Specifies joystick device to use.  Defaults /dev/input/js0 (first joystick)

       -autorepeat
              Turns on and optionally specifies autorepeat frequency, i.e.  the number of times per second a button which is held down will be repeated.

       -deadzone
              Controls sensitivity when manually calibrating.

       -rcfile
              Sets the rc file to look in.

       -config
              Reads in a config in an rc file.

FILES
       /dev/js[01]  The joystick driver.  Must be installed for joy2key to work.  Joy2key only supports versions 1.0+ of the joystick driver.  Older versions of joy2key use the 0.8.0 joystick driver.  If
       for some reason a 1.0+ joystick driver does not work for you, use joy2key 1.2.

       The Linux joystick driver is available at

       http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/

       ~/.joy2keyrc Rc file searched for commands in -config.

BUGS
       I don't like writing man pages, so this man page may be buggy :)
