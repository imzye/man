NAME
       rpl8 - Firmware loader for DVD drives

SYNOPSIS
       rpl8 /dev/cdrom [-[dump-only]|firmwarefile]

DESCRIPTION
       rpl8 is a program for Linux 2.4 and upwards that uploads firmware to DVD drives (mostly DVD+RW).

       rpl8 stands for RICOH Program Loader 8, though it also supports Program Loader 9.

       The program never updates Program Loader code so that you should always be able to downgrade your firmware in case something goes wrong.

       So far rpl8 has been tested with the following:
       * HP dvd100i
       * Ricoh MP5120A
       * Philips DVDRW208
       * HP dvd200i

       To run rpl8 correctly, make sure you have no media in drive.  Optionally go to single user mode and reboot after uploading the new firmware.

OPTIONS
       -[dump-only]
              Only backs up the firmware.  Note that you might have to reboot even after this.

BUGS
       Getting messages like this is "normal"
