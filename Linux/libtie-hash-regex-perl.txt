NAME
       Tie::Hash::Regex - Match hash keys using Regular Expressions

SYNOPSIS
         use Tie::Hash::Regex;
         my %h;

         tie %h, 'Tie::Hash::Regex';

         $h{key}   = 'value';
         $h{key2}  = 'another value';
         $h{stuff} = 'something else';

         print $h{key};  # prints 'value'
         print $h{2};    # prints 'another value'
         print $h{'^s'}; # prints 'something else'

         print tied(%h)->FETCH('k'); # prints 'value' and 'another value'

         delete $h{k};   # deletes $h{key} and $h{key2};

       or (new! improved!)

         my %h : Regex;

DESCRIPTION
       Someone asked on Perlmonks if a hash could do fuzzy matches on keys - this is the result.

       If there's no exact match on the key that you pass to the hash, then the key is treated as a regex and the first matching key is returned. You can force it to leap straight into the regex checking
       by passing a qr'ed regex into the hash like this:

         my $val = $h{qr/key/};

       "exists" and "delete" also do regex matching. In the case of "delete" all values matching your regex key will be deleted from the hash.

       One slightly strange thing. Obviously if you give a hash a regex key, then it's possible that more than one key will match (consider $h{qw/./}).  It might be nice to be able to do stuff like:

         my @vals = $h{$pat};

       to get all matching values back. Unfortuately, Perl knows that a given hash key can only ever return one value and so forces scalar context on the "FETCH" call when using the tied interface. You
       can get round this using the slightly less readable:

         my @vals = tied(%h)->FETCH($pat);

   ATTRIBUTE INTERFACE
       From version 0.06, you can use attributes to define your hash as being tied to Tie::Hash::Regex. You'll need to install the module Attribute::Handlers. Simply declare your hash using the attribute
       syntax:

           my %hash :Regex;

METHODS
   FETCH
       Get a value from the hash. If there isn't an exact match try a regex match.

   EXISTS
       See if a key exists in the hash. If there isn't an exact match try a regex match.

   DELETE
       Delete a key from the hash. If there isn't an exact match try a regex match.
