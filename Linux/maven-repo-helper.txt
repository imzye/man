NAME
       Maven - Patches the POM files using the Maven dependency rules.

SYNOPSIS
       mh_patchpoms [option]...

DESCRIPTION
       Reads the file debian/$package.poms and transforms each POM file listed in the .poms file into a POM file using the Debian versions of the libraries. Also keeps a backup of each POM file which can
       be restored with mh_unpatchpoms

OPTIONS

       -h --help: show this text

       -V --version: show the version

       -p<package> --package=<package>: package to act on

       -k --keep-pom-version: keep the original version of the POMs but,

              convert all other versions in dependencies and plugins If there is a parent POM, keeps its version except when the parent is already registered in the Maven repository

       -e<version>, --set-version=<version>: set the version for the POM,

              do not use the version declared in the POM file.

       -r<rules> --rules=<rules>: path to the file containing the

              rules to apply when cleaning the POM.  Optional, the default location is debian/maven.rules

       -R<rule>, --extra-rule=<rule>: extra rule to apply when cleaning the POM

              May occur multiple times, instead of or in addition to -r

       -u<rules> --published-rules=<rules>: path to the file containing the

              extra rules to publish in the property debian.mavenRules in the cleaned POM.  Optional, the default location is debian/maven.publishedRules

       -U<rule>, --extra-published-rule=<rule>: extra rule to publish

              May occur multiple times, instead of or in addition to -u

       -i<rules> --ignore-rules=<rules>: path to the file containing the

              rules used to remove certain dependencies from the cleaned POM Optional, the default location is debian/maven.ignoreRules

       -I<rule>, --extra-ignore-rule=<rule>: extra rule used to remove dependencies

              from the transformed POM May occur multiple times, instead of or in addition to -i

       -c<rules> --clean-ignore-rules=<rules>: path to the file containing the

              rules  use  to  remove  certain dependencies from the cleaned POM, in addition to the ignore rules specified previously. This is useful in situations such as when the Maven clean target re‐
              quires more dependencies or plugins to ignore than the build target.  All rules defined in clean-ignore-rules will be added to the existing rules in ignore-rules.  Optional, the default lo‐
              cation is debian/maven.cleanIgnoreRules

       -s --no-rules: don't apply any rules for converting versions,

              do not even convert versions to the default 'debian' version

       --no-publish-used-rule: don't publish the rule used to transform

              a POM's own attributes in debian.mavenRules

       -d --debian-build: transform during a Debian build, which means that

              some POM elements will be removed

       -b --build-no-docs: if the build doesn't need to build documentation, use this

              option to remove some POM elements (in particular plugins) which are useless here and may require extra dependencies and make the packaging harder.

       -m<repo root>--maven-repo=<repo root>: location of the Maven repository,

              used to force the versions of the Maven plugins used in the current POM file with the versions found in the repository

       -v --verbose: show more information while running

       -n --no-act: don't actually do anything, just print the results
