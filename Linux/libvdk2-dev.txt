       vdk-config-2 [-v --version] [-h --help] [-l --libs] [--libs-only-L] [--libs-only-l] [-c --cflags] [-d --define]

DESCRIPTION
       vdk-config-2 is a tool that is used to configure to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use VDK(2).

       --libs-only-l
               Print only the -l part of the --libs.

       -c --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a VDK(2) program.
