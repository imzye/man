NAME
       buildd-uploader - upload built packages for buildd

       buildd-uploader

VERSION
       This man page documents the packaged version of buildd-uploader.  This version is maintained by the buildd-tools project developers on Alioth (https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd-tools/).

       There  is  also  a version maintained by Ryan Murray which is adapted to build daemon needs, with similar functionality.  This version should be equally capable of working in a buildd setup, but has a
       number of enhancements aimed at making it suitable for use by end-users.
