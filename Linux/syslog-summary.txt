SYSLOG-SUMMARY(1)                                                                        Syslog-Summary User Manual                                                                       SYSLOG-SUMMARY(1)

NAME
       syslog-summary - summarize the contents of a syslog log file

SYNOPSIS

       syslog-summary [-s | --state= filename] [-i | --ignore= filename] [-d | --debug] [-r | --repeat] logfile...

       syslog-summary [-h | --help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the syslog-summary command.

       syslog-summary summarizes the contents of log files via the syslog(3) service, by displaying each unique (except for the time) line once, and also the number of times such a line occurs in the
       input. The lines are displayed in the order they occur in the input.

OPTIONS
       -i filename, --ignore=filename
           Read regular expressions from filename and ignore lines in the logfiles that match them.

       -s filename, --state=filename
           Read state information from filename. The state contains information about the already reported parts of a log file, and prevents syslog-summary from reporting the same things many times. This
           is useful when syslog-summary is run from crontab every hour. The file is created, if it doesn´t exist already.

       -r, --repeat
           Merge "last message repeated * times" lines with the repeated event.

       -d, --debug
           Enable verbose messages when errors occur (i.e. "debug mode").

       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

FILES
       /etc/syslog-summary/ignore.rules
           Default ignore.rules file with default regular expressions.

DIAGNOSTICS
       When reporting a bug, please run syslog-summary with the -d (or --debug) flag enabled.

       syslog-summary provides some return codes, that can be used in scripts:
       Code   Diagnostic
       0      Program exited successfully.
       1      Something went wrong, please run the program with the debug messages enabled.
