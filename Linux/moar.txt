NAME
       moar - a runtime for Raku

SYNOPSIS
           moar --version
           moar [--dump] [--crash] [--libpath=...] [--full-cleanup] inputfile

DESCRIPTION
       "moar" is the binary of MoarVM, (short for Metamodel On A Runtime Virtual Machine). It can be used to execute ".moarvm" bytecode files.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       moar respects the following environment variables:

       MVM_JIT_DISABLE
           Disables the just-in-time compiler (JIT). This is ignored if MoarVM was built without JIT support.

       MVM_SPESH_DISABLE
           Disables the runtime bytecode specializer / optimizer.

       MVM_SPESH_INLINE_DISABLE
           Disables inlining of call frames inside the bytecode specializer.

       MVM_SPESH_OSR_DISABLE
           Disables the on-stack replacement feature of the bytecode specializer.

       MVM_CROSS_THREAD_WRITE_LOG
           Tells MoarVM to insert instrumentation to detect when a thread does a write to an object it didn't allocate and doesn't have a lock for.

       MVM_CROSS_THREAD_WRITE_LOG_INCLUDE_LOCKED
           Same as MVM_CROSS_THREAD_WRITE_LOG, except objects that are locked are included as well.
