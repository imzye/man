NAME
       klcc - compile a program against klibc

SYNOPSIS
       klcc [gcc options] [-o outfile] infile...

DESCRIPTION
       klcc is a wrapper around gcc(1) and ld(1) which compiles and links a program against the klibc tiny C library.  It supports most gcc options.

       Unlike  gcc,  klcc  compiles  with optimization on by default.  Furthermore, the optimization level used depends on whether or not -g is specified, since klcc frequently uses options in the normal
       case which makes debugging impossible.  Therefore, compile without -g, -O, -f or -m option to use the default optimization level; this will generally result in the smallest binaries.  You may want
       to use -s when linking, however.  Use -O0 to compile without any optimization whatsoever; this may not work depending on the version of gcc used.

       -nostdinc
              allows to turn off klibc include files.

       Use the -shared or -static option to compile for and link against shared or static klibc.  Note that shared klibc only supports running against the exact same klibc binary as the binary was linked
       with.

       In addition to standard gcc options, klcc supports options of the form -print-klibc-option, which prints the corresponding klibc configuration option.
