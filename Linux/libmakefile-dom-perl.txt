NAME
       MDOM::Node - Abstract MDOM Node class, an Element that can contain other Elements

INHERITANCE
         MDOM::Node
         isa MDOM::Element

SYNOPSIS
         # Create a typical node (a Document in this case)
         my $Node = MDOM::Document->new;

         # Add an element to the node( in this case, a token )
         my $Token = MDOM::Token::Word->new('my');
         $Node->add_element( $Token );

         # Get the elements for the Node
         my @elements = $Node->children;

         # Find all the barewords within a Node
         my $barewords = $Node->find( 'MDOM::Token::Word' );

         # Find by more complex criteria
         my $my_tokens = $Node->find( sub { $_[1]->content eq 'my' } );

         # Remove all the whitespace
         $Node->prune( 'MDOM::Token::Whitespace' );

         # Remove by more complex criteria
         $Node->prune( sub { $_[1]->content eq 'my' } );

DESCRIPTION
       The "MDOM::Node" class provides an abstract base class for the Element classes that are able to contain other elements MDOM::Document, MDOM::Statement, and MDOM::Structure.

       As well as those listed below, all of the methods that apply to MDOM::Element objects also apply to "MDOM::Node" objects.

METHODS
   scope
       The "scope" method returns true if the node represents a lexical scope boundary, or false if it does not.

   add_element $Element
       The "add_element" method adds a MDOM::Element object to the end of a "MDOM::Node". Because Elements maintain links to their parent, an Element can only be added to a single Node.

       Returns true if the MDOM::Element was added. Returns "undef" if the Element was already within another Node, or the method is not passed a MDOM::Element object.

   elements
       The "elements" method accesses all child elements structurally within the "MDOM::Node" object. Note that in the base of the MDOM::Structure classes, this "DOES" include the brace tokens at either
       end of the structure.

       Returns a list of zero or more MDOM::Element objects.

       Alternatively, if called in the scalar context, the "elements" method returns a count of the number of elements.

   first_element
       The "first_element" method accesses the first element structurally within the "MDOM::Node" object. As for the "elements" method, this does include the brace tokens for MDOM::Structure objects.

       Returns a MDOM::Element object, or "undef" if for some reason the "MDOM::Node" object does not contain any elements.

   last_element
       The "last_element" method accesses the last element structurally within the "MDOM::Node" object. As for the "elements" method, this does include the brace tokens for MDOM::Structure objects.

       Returns a MDOM::Element object, or "undef" if for some reason the "MDOM::Node" object does not contain any elements.

   children
       The "children" method accesses all child elements lexically within the "MDOM::Node" object. Note that in the case of the MDOM::Structure classes, this does NOT include the brace tokens at either
       end of the structure.

       Returns a list of zero of more MDOM::Element objects.

       Alternatively, if called in the scalar context, the "children" method returns a count of the number of lexical children.

   schildren
       The "schildren" method is really just a convenience, the significant-only variation of the normal "children" method.

       In list context, returns a list of significant children. In scalar context, returns the number of significant children.

   child $index
       The "child" method accesses a child MDOM::Element object by its position within the Node.

       Returns a MDOM::Element object, or "undef" if there is no child element at that node.

   schild $index
       The lexical structure of the Perl language ignores 'insignificant' items, such as whitespace and comments, while MDOM treats these items as valid tokens so that it can reassemble the file at any
       time. Because of this, in many situations there is a need to find an Element within a Node by index, only counting lexically significant Elements.

       The "schild" method returns a child Element by index, ignoring insignificant Elements. The index of a child Element is specified in the same way as for a normal array, with the first Element at
       index 0, and negative indexes used to identify a "from the end" position.

   contains $Element
       The "contains" method is used to determine if another MDOM::Element object is logically "within" a "MDOM::Node". For the special case of the brace tokens at either side of a MDOM::Structure
       object, they are generally considered "within" a MDOM::Structure object, even if they are not actually in the elements for the MDOM::Structure.

       Returns true if the MDOM::Element is within us, false if not, or "undef" on error.

   find $class | \&wanted
       The "find" method is used to search within a code tree for MDOM::Element objects that meet a particular condition.

       To specify the condition, the method can be provided with either a simple class name (full or shortened), or a "CODE"/function reference.

         # Find all single quotes in a Document (which is a Node)
         $Document->find('MDOM::Quote::Single');

         # The same thing with a shortened class name
         $Document->find('Quote::Single');

         # Anything more elaborate, we so with the sub
         $Document->find( sub {
               # At the top level of the file...
               $_[1]->parent == $_[0]
               and (
                       # ...find all comments and POD
                       $_[1]->isa('MDOM::Token::Pod')
                       or
                       $_[1]->isa('MDOM::Token::Comment')
               )
         } );

       The function will be passed two arguments, the top-level "MDOM::Node" you are searching in and the current MDOM::Element that the condition is testing.

       The anonymous function should return one of three values. Returning true indicates a condition match, defined-false (0 or '') indicates no-match, and "undef" indicates no-match and no-descend.

       In the last case, the tree walker will skip over anything below the "undef"-returning element and move on to the next element at the same level.

       To halt the entire search and return "undef" immediately, a condition function should throw an exception (i.e. "die").

       Note that this same wanted logic is used for all methods documented to have a "\&wanted" parameter, as this one does.

       The "find" method returns a reference to an array of MDOM::Element objects that match the condition, false (but defined) if no Elements match the condition, or "undef" if you provide a bad
       condition, or an error occurs during the search process.

       In the case of a bad condition, a warning will be emitted as well.

   find_first $class | \&wanted
       If the normal "find" method is like a grep, then "find_first" is equivalent to the Scalar::Util "first" function.

       Given an element class or a wanted function, it will search depth-first through a tree until it finds something that matches the condition, returning the first Element that it encounters.

       See the "find" method for details on the format of the search condition.

       Returns the first MDOM::Element object that matches the condition, false if nothing matches the condition, or "undef" if given an invalid condition, or an error occurs.

   find_any $class | \&wanted
       The "find_any" method is a short-circuiting true/false method that behaves like the normal "find" method, but returns true as soon as it finds any Elements that match the search condition.

       See the "find" method for details on the format of the search condition.

       Returns true if any Elements that match the condition can be found, false if not, or "undef" if given an invalid condition, or an error occurs.

   remove_child $Element
       If passed a MDOM::Element object that is a direct child of the Node, the "remove_element" method will remove the "Element" intact, along with any of its children. As such, this method acts
       essentially as a 'cut' function.

   source
       Returns the makefile source for the current node

   prune $class | \&wanted
       The "prune" method is used to strip MDOM::Element objects out of a code tree. The argument is the same as for the "find" method, either a class name, or an anonymous subroutine which returns
       true/false. Any Element that matches the class|wanted will be deleted from the code tree, along with any of its children.

       The "prune" method returns the number of "Element" objects that matched and were removed, non-recursively. This might also be zero, so avoid a simple true/false test on the return false of the
       "prune" method. It returns "undef" on error, which you probably should test for.
