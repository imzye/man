NAME
       curseofwar - Real Time Strategy Game for Linux

SYNOPSIS
       curseofwar [ -c port ] [ -C IP ] [ -d difficulty ] [ -e port ]
              [ -E clients ] [ -h ] [ -H height ] [ -i inequality ]
              [ -l countries ] [ -q quality ] [ -r ] [ -R seed ] [ -s speed ] [ -S shape ] [ -T ] [ -v ] [ -W width ]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a fast-paced action strategy game for Linux implemented using ncurses user interface.

       Unlike most RTS, you are not controlling units, but focus on high-level strategic planning: Building infrastructure, securing resources, and moving your armies.

       The core game mechanics turns out to be quite close to WWI-WWII type of warfare, however, there is no explicit reference to any historical period.

OPTIONS
       -c port
              Clients's port (19150 is default).

       -C IP  Start a client and connect to the provided server's IP-address.

       -d [ee|e|n|h|hh]
              Difficulty level (AI) from the easiest to the hardest (default is normal).

       -e port
              Server's port (19140 is default).

       -E [1|2| ... L]
              Start a server for not more than L clients.

       -h     Display this help

       -H height
              Map height (default is 21, maximum is 29)

       -i [0|1|2|3|4]
              Inequality between the countries (0 is the lowest, 4 in the highest).

       -l [2|3| ... N]
              Sets L, the number of countries (default is N).

       -q [1|2| ... L]
              Choose player's location by its quality (1 = the best available on the map, L = the worst). Only in the singleplayer mode.

       -r     Absolutely random initial conditions, overrides options -l, -i, and -q.

       -R seed
              Specify a random seed (unsigned integer) for map generation.

       -s [p|sss|ss|s|n|f|ff|fff]
              Game speed from the slowest to the fastest (default is normal).

       -S [rhombus|rect|hex]
              Map shape (rectangle is default). Max number of countries N=4 for rhombus and rectangle, and N=6 for the hexagon.

       -T     Show the timeline.

       -v     Display the version number

       -W width
              Map width (default is 21, maximum is 40)

HOW TO PLAY
       Normally, the game starts with 4 small countries in the corners of the map.  You start as the ruler of the Green country, and your goal is to conquer the whole map.

       Tiles

       The map is made of hexagonal tiles. They are:

       /\^   Mountains, cannot be populated

       /$\   Gold mines, cannot be populated too.
             This is the source of gold for your country.
             To control a mine, surround it with your army

        n    Villages, have the slowest population growth (+10%)

       i=i   Towns, average population growth (+20%)

       W#W   Fortresses, high population growth (+30%)

        -    Grassland, normal habitable territory

       People

       People  are  your  primary resource. Thriving popluation is essential for your victory.  Every tile can support at most 499 people from each country.  When people from more than one country occupy
       the same tile, they fight.  The country that has the highest population at the tile is called the tile owner.  The population of the tile owner is shown on all grassland tiles as follows:

        .      1 - 3    citizens
       ..      4 - 6
       ...     7 - 12
        :     13 - 25
       .:     26 - 50
       .:.    51 - 100
        ::   101 - 200
       .::   201 - 400
       :::   400 - 499

       People migrate from highly populated tiles to less populated tiles.

       Population grows only in cities. In villages by 10%, in towns by 20%, and fortresses by 30% every simulation step. By controlling cities, you control their surrounding territory.

       Flags

       Every country can put flags on the map. Flags change migration rates, so that people of your country start gathering at the tiles with flags.  Player's flags are shown as white "P"  on  the  right
       side of a tile.  Flags of the computer opponents are shown as "x" on the left side of a tile.

       The flags can be used to increase population of your own cities, as well as for conquering foreign territories.

       When  countries  are  fighting  for a city, and if the damage to the defender's army is significant, the city can be destroyed: A fortress becomes a town, a town becomes a village, and the village
       gets completely burnt by the invaders.

       Countries

       Computer opponents differ in personality, and it affects the way they fight.

CONTROLS
       Arrow keys and H, J, K, L are for moving the cursor

       R or V   build village -> town -> fortress

       Space    add/remove a flag
       X        remove all your flags
       C        remove a half of your flags

       S        slower
       F        faster

       Q        quit

MULTIPLAYER
       To start a server for two players:

              curseofwar -E 2

       To start a client and connect to the server:

              curseofwar -C <server's IP>

       To specify ports, use -e option for server's port, and -c option for client's port. By default, servers are using port 19140, and clients are using port 19150.

       Examples:
         Start a server for a single client using port 11111

              curseofwar -E 1 -e 11111

         To connect to it:

              curseofwar -C <server's IP> -e 11111

         Alternatively, to connect to it using port 12345 on the client's side:

              curseofwar -C <server's IP> -c 12345 -e 11111

       Note that all needed map options must be setup when you start a server, the map and other data are transmitted to clients, once they are connected.

       Example:
         Server for 3 clients, no computer opponents, hexagonal map, and equal
         conditions for all:

              curseofwar -E3 -l3 -S hex -i0

       Game speed cannot be changed by a client, so it must be set initially by the server. Not all data is sent to clients (e.g. info about population is not sent in full).

       Multiplayer mode is at relatively early development stage. Changes may occure at any moment. When you play with other people, make sure that you are using the same version of the game.  Hopefully,
       game's client-server communication protocol will be improved in future. All communication is made via UDP.

       Please, report you problems with multiplayer.

EXAMPLES
       A good and easy mode to start playing:

              curseofwar -i4 -q1 -dee

       Or, on a smaller map:

              curseofwar -i4 -q1 -dee -W16 -H16
