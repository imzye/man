NAME
       ftpscrub - scrub the proftpd scoreboard file of stale entries

SYNOPSIS
       ftpscrub

DESCRIPTION
       The  ftpscrub  command  provides  a way to scrub the scoreboard file on
       demand, at times which suit the site best.  This should be run periodi‐
       cally on sites which run proftpd in inetd mode.

OPTIONS
       -h,--help   Display  a short usage description, including all available
                   options.

       -f,--file scoreboard-file
                   Specify the full path to proftpd's run-time scoreboard file
                   (configured    via    the   ScoreboardFile   directive   in
                   proftpd.conf ).  If proftpd's default  directory  has  been
                   changed  via this directive, ftpscrub must either be recom‐
                   piled, or this  option  must  be  used  in  order  to  find
                   proftpd's scoreboard.

       -v,--verbose
                   Reports  additional  information while scrubbing the score‐
                   board.
