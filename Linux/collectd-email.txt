NAME
       collectd-email - Documentation of collectd's "email plugin"

SYNOPSIS
         # See collectd.conf(5)
         LoadPlugin email
         # ...
         <Plugin email>
           SocketGroup "collectd"
           SocketPerms "0770"
           MaxConns 5
         </Plugin>

DESCRIPTION
       The "email plugin" opens an UNIX-socket over which one can submit email statistics, such as the number of "ham", "spam", "virus", etc. mails received/handled, spam scores and matched spam checks.

       This plugin is intended to be used with the Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::Collectd SpamAssassin-plugin which is included in contrib/, but is of course not limited to that use.

OPERATION
       This plugin collects data indirectly by providing a UNIX-socket that external programs can connect to. A simple line based protocol is used to communicate with the plugin:

       •   E-Mail type (e.g. "ham", "spam", "virus", ...) and size (bytes):

             e:<type>:<size>

           If "size" is less than or equal to zero, "size" is ignored.

       •   Spam score:

             s:<value>

       •   Successful spam checks (e.g. "BAYES_99", "SUBJECT_DRUG_GAP_C", ...):

             c:<type1>[,<type2>,...]

           Each line is limited to 256 characters (including the newline character).  Longer lines will be ignored.
