NAME
       PostSRSd - Sender Rewriting Scheme daemon for Postfix

SYNOPSIS
       postsrsd -s<file> -d<domain> [other options]

DESCRIPTION
       Sender Rewriting Scheme implementation for Postfix.

       The  Sender  Rewriting  Scheme (SRS) is a technique to forward mails from domains which deploy the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to prohibit other Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) from sending mails on
       their behalf. With SRS, an MTA can circumvent SPF restrictions by replacing the envelope sender with a temporary email address from one of their own domains. This temporary address is bound to the
       original sender and only valid for a certain amount of time, which prevents abuse by spammers.
