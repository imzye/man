NAME
       smtpping — SMTP benchmarking and measurement tool

SYNOPSIS
       smtpping [-dqrJ46C] [-p port] [-w wait] [-c count] [-P parallel] [-s size] [-f file] [-H hello] [-S sender] recipient [@server]

DESCRIPTION
       smtpping is a small tool that performs SMTP server delay, delay variation and throughput measurements.

       It  must be invoked with the recipient email address. Normally, the server should also be specified (prefixed with @); otherwise smtpping will try to find the recipient domain's MX record, falling
       back on A/AAAA records.

       The following options are available:

       -4      Use IPv4.

       -6      Use IPv6.

       -p port
               Specifies the TCP port to use (default: 25).

       -w wait
               Time in milliseconds to wait between pings (default: 1000).

       -c count
               Number of pings to send (default: unlimited).

       -P processes
               Number of parallel worker processes (default: 1). To measure throughput, it's recommended to use -r and -w0 with this option.

       -s size
               Ping message size in kilobytes (default: 10). Cannot be used in conjunction with the -f option.

       -f file
               Send the specified email file (message/rfc822) instead of a generated message. Cannot be used in conjunction with the -s option.

       -H helo
               HELO name (default: localhost.localdomain).

       -S sender
               Sender address (default: <>).

       -C      Use CHUNKING (BDAT)

       -r      Display rate instead of transaction delays. To measure throughput, it's recommended to use -w0 and possibly -P with this option.

       -q      Display less verbose output.

       -d      Display more verbose output.
