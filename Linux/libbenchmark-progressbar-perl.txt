Benchmark::ProgressBar(3pm)                                                         User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                         Benchmark::ProgressBar(3pm)

NAME
       Benchmark::ProgressBar - Display Progress Bar While You Wait For Your Benchmark

SYNOPSIS
         use Benchmark::ProgressBar qw(cmpthese);

         cmpthese(10_000, {
           a => sub { ... },
           b => sub { ... },
         } );

DESCRIPTION
       This is a VERY crude combination of Benchmark.pm and Term::ProgressBar.  Basically I got sick of waiting for my benchmarks to finish up without knowing an ETA.

       You can use it as a drop-in replacement for Benchmark.pm, but the only functions that would display a progress bar are the ones listed here: cmpthese, timethese, and timeit.

       This is achieved via crude (a VERY crude) re-definition of Benchmark.pm's subrountines, so you shouldn't be mixing it with Benchmark.pm (I don't know why you would)

       It does the job for me, YMMV. Patches are welcome.
