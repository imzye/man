NAME
       oxigraph-serve - Start Oxigraph HTTP server in read-write mode

SYNOPSIS
       oxigraph serve [-l|--location] [-b|--bind] [--cors] [--union-default-graph] [--timeout-s] [-h|--help]

DESCRIPTION
       Start Oxigraph HTTP server in read-write mode

OPTIONS
       -l, --location <LOCATION>
              Directory in which the data should be persisted

              If not present, an in-memory storage will be used.

       -b, --bind <BIND> [default: localhost:7878]
              Host and port to listen to

       --cors Allows cross-origin requests

       --union-default-graph
              If the SPARQL queries should look for triples in all the dataset graphs by default (i.e., without `GRAPH` operations)

              This is equivalent as setting the union-default-graph option in all SPARQL queries

       --timeout-s <TIMEOUT_S>
              Timeout for request processing in seconds

              Currently only used for SPARQL queries

              Might be used to set up things like HTTP query timeout

       -h, --help
              Print help (see a summary with '-h')

                                                                                                   serve                                                                                  oxigraph-serve(1)
