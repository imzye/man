NAME
       math2oogl - convert Mathematica grphics object to OOGL format

SYNOPSIS
       math2oogl
       math2oogl -togeomview objectname geomview-path

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the math2oogl command.

       math2oogl converts Mathematica graphics objects, read from standard in‐
       put, to OOGL format, written to standard output.   SurfaceGraphics  and
       MeshGraphics objects are converted to an OOGL MESH; a Graphics3D object
       is converted to OFF; and a BezierPatch is converted to a BEZuvn.

       Note that we expect the graphics objects to have been processed  as  in
       OOGL.m,  i.e. provide dimension and meshrange information and print out
       the colors before the points for SurfaceGraphics objects,  and  convert
       the characters "(){}, " to a newline.
