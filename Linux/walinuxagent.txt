Linux distributions support
       Our  daily automation tests most of the Linux distributions supported by Azure ⟨https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros⟩; the Agent can be used on other
       distributions as well, but development, testing and support for those are done by the open source community.

       Testing is done using the develop branch, which can be unstable. For a stable build please use the master branch instead.

Introduction
       The Microsoft Azure Linux Agent (waagent) manages Linux provisioning and VM interaction with the Azure Fabric Controller. It provides the following functionality for Linux IaaS deployments:

              • Image Provisioning

                • Creation of a user account

                • Configuring SSH authentication types

                • Deployment of SSH public keys and key pairs

                • Setting the host name

                • Publishing the host name to the platform DNS

                • Reporting SSH host key fingerprint to the platform

                • Resource Disk Management

                • Formatting and mounting the resource disk

                • Configuring swap space

              • Networking

                • Manages routes to improve compatibility with platform DHCP servers

                • Ensures the stability of the network interface name

              • Kernel

                • Configure virtual NUMA (disable for kernel )

                • Configure SCSI timeouts for the root device (which could be remote)

              • Diagnostics

                • Console redirection to the serial port

              • SCVMM Deployments

                • Detect and bootstrap the VMM agent for Linux when running in a System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012R2 environment

              • VM Extension

                • Inject component authored by Microsoft and Partners into Linux VM (IaaS) to enable software and configuration automation

                • VM Extension reference implementation on GitHub ⟨https://github.com/Azure/azure-linux-extensions⟩

Communication
       The information flow from the platform to the agent occurs via two channels:

              • A boot-time attached DVD for IaaS deployments.  This DVD includes an OVF-compliant configuration file that includes all provisioning information other than the actual SSH keypairs.

              • A TCP endpoint exposing a REST API used to obtain deployment and topology configuration.

   HTTP Proxy
       The Agent will use an HTTP proxy if provided via the http_proxy (for http requests) or https_proxy (for https requests) environment variables. Due to limitations of Python, the agent does not
       support HTTP proxies requiring authentication.

       Similarly, the Agent will bypass the proxy if the environment variable no_proxy is set.

       Note that the way to define those environment variables for the Agent service varies across different distros. For distros that use systemd, a common approach is to use Environment  or  Envi‐
       ronmentFile in the [Service] section of the service definition, for example using an override or a drop-in file (see "systemctl edit" for overrides).

       Example

           # cat /etc/systemd/system/walinuxagent.service.d/http-proxy.conf
           [Service]
           Environment="http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:80/"
           Environment="https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:80/"
           #

       The Agent passes its environment to the VM Extensions it executes, including http_proxy and https_proxy, so defining a proxy for the Agent will also define it for the VM Extensions.

       The  ⟨#httpproxyhost-httpproxyport⟩  configuration  variables,  if  used,  override the environment settings. Note that this configuration variables are local to the Agent process and are not
       passed to VM Extensions.

Requirements
       The following systems have been tested and are known to work with the Azure Linux Agent.  Please note that this list may differ from the official list of supported systems  on  the  Microsoft
       Azure Platform as described here ⟨https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros⟩.

       Waagent depends on some system packages in order to function properly:

              • Python 2.6+

              • OpenSSL 1.0+

              • OpenSSH 5.3+

              • Filesystem utilities: sfdisk, fdisk, mkfs, parted

              • Password tools: chpasswd, sudo

              • Text processing tools: sed, grep

              • Network tools: ip-route

Installation
       Installing via your distribution's package repository is the only method that is supported.

       You  can  install from source for more advanced options, such as installing to a custom location or creating custom images. Installing from source, though, may override customizations done to
       the Agent by your distribution, and is meant only for advanced users. We provide very limited support for this method.

       To install from source, you can use setuptools:

           sudo python setup.py install --register-service

       For Python 3, use:

           sudo python3 setup.py install --register-service

       You can view more installation options by running:

           sudo python setup.py install --help

       The agent's log file is kept at /var/log/waagent.log.

       Lastly, you can also customize your own RPM or DEB packages using the configuration samples provided in the deb and rpm sections below. This method is also meant for  advanced  users  and  we
       provide very limited support for it.

Upgrade
       Upgrading  via  your  distribution's  package  repository  or using automatic updates are the only supported methods. More information can be found here: Update Linux Agent ⟨https://learn.mi‐
       crosoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/update-linux-agent⟩

       To upgrade the Agent from source, you can use setuptools. Upgrading from source is meant for advanced users and we provide very limited support for it.

           sudo python setup.py install --force

       Restart waagent service,for most of linux distributions:

           sudo service waagent restart

       For Ubuntu, use:

           sudo service walinuxagent restart

       For CoreOS, use:

           sudo systemctl restart waagent

Command line options
   Flags
       -verbose: Increase verbosity of specified command

       -force: Skip interactive confirmation for some commands

   Commands
       -help: Lists the supported commands and flags.

       -deprovision: Attempt to clean the system and make it suitable for re-provisioning, by deleting the following:

              • All SSH host keys (if Provisioning.RegenerateSshHostKeyPair is 'y' in the configuration file)

              • Nameserver configuration in /etc/resolv.conf

              • Root password from /etc/shadow (if Provisioning.DeleteRootPassword is 'y' in the configuration file)

              • Cached DHCP client leases

              • Resets host name to localhost.localdomain

       WARNING! Deprovision does not guarantee that the image is cleared of all sensitive information and suitable for redistribution.

       -deprovision+user: Performs everything under deprovision (above) and also deletes the last provisioned user account and associated data.

       -version: Displays the version of waagent

       -serialconsole: Configures GRUB to mark ttyS0 (the first serial port) as the boot console. This ensures that kernel bootup logs are sent to the serial port and made available for debugging.

       -daemon: Run waagent as a daemon to manage interaction with the platform. This argument is specified to waagent in the waagent init script.

       -start: Run waagent as a background process

       -collect-logs [-full]: Runs the log collector utility that collects relevant agent logs for debugging and stores them in the agent folder on disk. Exact location will be shown when  run.  Use
       flag -full for more exhaustive log collection.

Configuration
       A configuration file (/etc/waagent.conf) controls the actions of waagent. Blank lines and lines whose first character is a # are ignored (end-of-line comments are not supported).

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

       Extensions.Enabled=y
       Extensions.GoalStatePeriod=6
       Provisioning.Agent=auto
       Provisioning.DeleteRootPassword=n
       Provisioning.RegenerateSshHostKeyPair=y
       Provisioning.SshHostKeyPairType=rsa
       Provisioning.MonitorHostName=y
       Provisioning.DecodeCustomData=n
       Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData=n
       Provisioning.PasswordCryptId=6
       Provisioning.PasswordCryptSaltLength=10
       ResourceDisk.Format=y
       ResourceDisk.Filesystem=ext4
       ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt/resource
       ResourceDisk.MountOptions=None
       ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n
       ResourceDisk.EnableSwapEncryption=n
       ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=0
       Logs.Verbose=n
       Logs.Collect=y
       Logs.CollectPeriod=3600
       OS.AllowHTTP=n
       OS.RootDeviceScsiTimeout=300
       OS.EnableFIPS=n
       OS.OpensslPath=None
       OS.SshClientAliveInterval=180
       OS.SshDir=/etc/ssh
       HttpProxy.Host=None
       HttpProxy.Port=None

       The  various  configuration options are described in detail below. Configuration options are of three types : Boolean, String or Integer. The Boolean configuration options can be specified as
       "y" or "n". The special keyword "None" may be used for some string type configuration entries as detailed below.

   Configuration File Options
   Extensions.Enabled
       Type: Boolean
       Default: y

       This allows the user to enable or disable the extension handling functionality in the agent. Valid values are "y" or "n". If extension handling is disabled,  the  goal  state  will  still  be
       processed  and  VM status is still reported, but only every 5 minutes.  Extension config within the goal state will be ignored. Note that functionality such as password reset, ssh key updates
       and backups depend on extensions. Only disable this if you do not need extensions at all.

       Note: disabling extensions in this manner is not the same as running completely without the agent. In order to do that, the provisionVMAgent  flag  must  be  set  at  provisioning  time,  via
       whichever API is being used. We will provide more details on this on our wiki when it is generally available.

   Extensions.WaitForCloudInit
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       Waits for cloud-init to complete (cloud-init status --wait) before executing VM extensions.

       Both cloud-init and VM extensions are common ways to customize a VM during initial deployment. By default, the agent will start executing extensions while cloud-init may still be in the 'con‐
       fig' stage and won't wait for the 'final' stage to complete. Cloud-init and extensions may execute operations that conflict with each other (for example, both of them may try to install pack‐
       ages). Setting this option to 'y' ensures that VM extensions are executed only after cloud-init has completed all its stages.

       Note that using this option requires creating a custom image with the value of this option set to 'y', in order to ensure that the wait is performed during the initial deployment of the VM.

   Extensions.WaitForCloudInitTimeout
       Type: Integer
       Default: 3600

       Timeout in seconds for the Agent to wait on cloud-init. If the timeout elapses, the Agent will continue executing VM extensions. See Extensions.WaitForCloudInit for more details.

   Extensions.GoalStatePeriod
       Type: Integer
       Default: 6

       How often to poll for new goal states (in seconds) and report the status of the VM and extensions. Goal states describe the desired state of the extensions on the VM.

       Note:  setting  up  this parameter to more than a few minutes can make the state of the VM be reported as unresponsive/unavailable on the Azure portal. Also, this setting affects how fast the
       agent starts executing extensions.

   AutoUpdate.UpdateToLatestVersion
       Type: Boolean Default: y

       Enables auto-update of the Extension Handler. The Extension Handler is responsible for managing extensions and reporting VM status. The core functionality of the agent is contained in the Ex‐
       tension Handler, and we encourage users to enable this option in order to maintain an up to date version.

       When this option is enabled, the Agent will install new versions when they become available. When disabled, the Agent will not install any new versions, but it will use the most  recent  ver‐
       sion already installed on the VM.

       Notes:  1.  This  option  was added on version 2.10.0.8 of the Agent. For previous versions, see AutoUpdate.Enabled.  2. If both options are specified in waagent.conf, AutoUpdate.UpdateToLat‐
       estVersion overrides the value set for AutoUpdate.Enabled.  3. Changing config option requires a service restart to pick up the updated setting.

       For more information on the agent version, see our FAQ ⟨https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent/wiki/FAQ#what-does-goal-state-agent-mean-in-waagent---version-output⟩.  For more  information  on
       the  agent  update,  see our FAQ ⟨https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent/wiki/FAQ#how-auto-update-works-for-extension-handler⟩.  For more information on the AutoUpdate.UpdateToLatestVersion vs
       AutoUpdate.Enabled, see our FAQ ⟨https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent/wiki/FAQ#autoupdateenabled-vs-autoupdateupdatetolatestversion⟩.

   AutoUpdate.Enabled
       Type: Boolean
       Default: y

       Enables auto-update of the Extension Handler. This flag is supported for legacy reasons and we strongly recommend using AutoUpdate.UpdateToLatestVersion instead.  The difference between these
       2 flags is that, when set to 'n', AutoUpdate.Enabled will use the version of the Extension Handler that is pre-installed on the image, while AutoUpdate.UpdateToLatestVersion will use the most
       recent version that has already been installed on the VM (via auto-update).

       On most distros the default value is 'y'.

   Provisioning.Agent
       Type: String Default: auto

       Choose which provisioning agent to use (or allow waagent to figure it out by specifying "auto"). Possible options are "auto" (default), "waagent", "cloud-init", or "disabled".

   Provisioning.Enabled (removed in 2.2.45)
       Type: Boolean Default: y

       This allows the user to enable or disable the provisioning functionality in the agent. Valid values are "y" or "n". If provisioning is disabled, SSH host and user keys in the image  are  pre‐
       served and any configuration specified in the Azure provisioning API is ignored.

       Note: This configuration option has been removed and has no effect. waagent now auto-detects cloud-init as a provisioning agent (with an option to override with Provisioning.Agent).

   Provisioning.MonitorHostName
       Type: Boolean Default: n

       Monitor host name changes and publish changes via DHCP requests.

   Provisioning.MonitorHostNamePeriod
       Type: Integer Default: 30

       How often to monitor host name changes (in seconds). This setting is ignored if MonitorHostName is not set.

   Provisioning.UseCloudInit
       Type: Boolean Default: n

       This  options  enables / disables support for provisioning by means of cloud-init.  When true ("y"), the agent will wait for cloud-init to complete before installing extensions and processing
       the latest goal state. Provisioning.Enabled must be disabled ("n") for this option to have an effect. Setting Provisioning.Enabled to true ("y") overrides this option and  runs  the  built-in
       agent provisioning code.

       Note: This configuration option has been removed and has no effect. waagent now auto-detects cloud-init as a provisioning agent (with an option to override with Provisioning.Agent).

   Provisioning.DeleteRootPassword
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If set, the root password in the /etc/shadow file is erased during the provisioning process.

   Provisioning.RegenerateSshHostKeyPair
       Type: Boolean
       Default: y

       If  set,  all  SSH host key pairs (ecdsa, dsa and rsa) are deleted during the provisioning process from /etc/ssh/. And a single fresh key pair is generated.  The encryption type for the fresh
       key pair is configurable by the Provisioning.SshHostKeyPairType entry. Please note that some distributions will re-create SSH key pairs for any missing encryption types when the SSH daemon is
       restarted (for example, upon a reboot).

   Provisioning.SshHostKeyPairType
       Type: String
       Default: rsa

       This can be set to an encryption algorithm type that is supported by the SSH daemon on the VM. The typically supported values are "rsa", "dsa" and "ecdsa".  Note that "putty.exe"  on  Windows
       does not support "ecdsa". So, if you intend to use putty.exe on Windows to connect to a Linux deployment, please use "rsa" or "dsa".

   Provisioning.MonitorHostName
       Type: Boolean
       Default: y

       If  set,  waagent  will  monitor  the  Linux  VM for hostname changes (as returned by the "hostname" command) and automatically update the networking configuration in the image to reflect the
       change. In order to push the name change to the DNS servers, networking will be restarted in the VM. This will result in brief loss of Internet connectivity.

   Provisioning.DecodeCustomData
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If set, waagent will decode CustomData from Base64.

   Provisioning.ExecuteCustomData
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If set, waagent will execute CustomData after provisioning.

   Provisioning.PasswordCryptId
       Type: String
       Default: 6

       Algorithm used by crypt when generating password hash.

              • 1 - MD5

              • 2a - Blowfish

              • 5 - SHA-256

              • 6 - SHA-512

   Provisioning.PasswordCryptSaltLength
       Type: String
       Default: 10

       Length of random salt used when generating password hash.

   ResourceDisk.Format
       Type: Boolean
       Default: y

       If set, the resource disk provided by the platform will be formatted and mounted by waagent if the filesystem type requested by the user in "ResourceDisk.Filesystem" is  anything  other  than
       "ntfs". A single partition of type Linux (83) will be made available on the disk. Note that this partition will not be formatted if it can be successfully mounted.

   ResourceDisk.Filesystem
       Type: String
       Default: ext4

       This  specifies  the  filesystem  type for the resource disk. Supported values vary by Linux distribution. If the string is X, then mkfs.X should be present on the Linux image. SLES 11 images
       should typically use 'ext3'. BSD images should use

   ResourceDisk.MountPoint
       Type: String
       Default: /mnt/resource

       This specifies the path at which the resource disk is mounted.

   ResourceDisk.MountOptions
       Type: String
       Default: None

       Specifies disk mount options to be passed to the mount -o command. This is a comma separated list of values, ex. 'nodev,nosuid'. See mount(8) for details.

   ResourceDisk.EnableSwap
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If set, a swap file (/swapfile) is created on the resource disk and added to the system swap space.

   ResourceDisk.EnableSwapEncryption
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If set, the swap file (/swapfile) is mounted as an encrypted filesystem (flag supported only on FreeBSD.)

   ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB
       Type: Integer
       Default: 0

       The size of the swap file in megabytes.

   Logs.Verbose
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If set, log verbosity is boosted. Waagent logs to /var/log/waagent.log and leverages the system logrotate functionality to rotate logs.

   Logs.Collect
       Type: Boolean
       Default: y

       If set, agent logs will be periodically collected and uploaded to a secure location for improved supportability.

       NOTE: This feature relies on the agent's resource usage features (cgroups); this flag will not take effect on any distro not supported.

   Logs.CollectPeriod
       Type: Integer
       Default: 3600

       This configures how frequently to collect and upload logs. Default is each hour.

       NOTE: This only takes effect if the Logs.Collect option is enabled.

   OS.AllowHTTP
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If SSL support is not compiled into Python, the agent will fail all HTTPS requests.  You can set this option to 'y' to make the agent fall-back to HTTP, instead of failing the requests.

       NOTE: Allowing HTTP may unintentionally expose secure data.

   OS.EnableRDMA
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If set, the agent will attempt to install and then load an RDMA kernel driver that matches the version of the firmware on the underlying hardware.

   OS.EnableFIPS
       Type: Boolean
       Default: n

       If set, the agent will emit into the environment "OPENSSL_FIPS=1" when executing OpenSSL commands. This signals OpenSSL to use any installed FIPS-compliant libraries.  Note that the agent it‐
       self has no FIPS-specific code. If no FIPS-compliant certificates are installed, then enabling this option will cause all OpenSSL commands to fail.

   OS.MonitorDhcpClientRestartPeriod
       Type: Integer Default: 30

       The agent monitor restarts of the DHCP client and restores network rules when it happens. This setting determines how often (in seconds) to monitor for restarts.

   OS.RootDeviceScsiTimeout
       Type: Integer
       Default: 300

       This configures the SCSI timeout in seconds on the root device. If not set, the system defaults are used.

   OS.RootDeviceScsiTimeoutPeriod
       Type: Integer
       Default: 30

       How often to set the SCSI timeout on the root device (in seconds). This setting is ignored if RootDeviceScsiTimeout is not set.

   OS.OpensslPath
       Type: String
       Default: None

       This can be used to specify an alternate path for the openssl binary to use for cryptographic operations.

   OS.RemovePersistentNetRulesPeriod
       Type: Integer
       Default: 30

       How often to remove the udev rules for persistent network interface names (75-persistent-net-generator.rules and /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules) (in seconds)

   OS.SshClientAliveInterval
       Type: Integer
       Default: 180

       This values sets the number of seconds the agent uses for the SSH ClientAliveInterval configuration option.

   OS.SshDir
       Type: String
       Default: /etc/ssh

       This option can be used to override the normal location of the SSH configuration directory.

   HttpProxy.Host, HttpProxy.Port
       Type: String
       Default: None

       If set, the agent will use this proxy server for HTTP/HTTPS requests. These values will override the http_proxy or https_proxy environment variables. Lastly, HttpProxy.Host is required (if to
       be used) and HttpProxy.Port is optional.

   CGroups.EnforceLimits
       Type: Boolean
       Default: y

       If set, the agent will attempt to set cgroups limits for cpu and memory for the agent process itself as well as extension processes. See the wiki for further details on this.

   CGroups.Excluded
       Type: String
       Default: customscript,runcommand

       The list of extensions which will be excluded from cgroups limits. This should be comma separated.

   Telemetry
       WALinuxAgent collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services. The data collected is used to track service health and  assist  with  Azure  support  re‐
       quests. Data collected does not include any personally identifiable information. Read our privacy statement ⟨http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839⟩ to learn more.

       WALinuxAgent  does not support disabling telemetry at this time. WALinuxAgent must be removed to disable telemetry collection. If you need this feature, please open an issue in GitHub and ex‐
       plain your requirement.
