NAME
       tcs - translate character sets

SYNOPSIS
       tcs [ -slcv ] [ -f ics ] [ -t ocs ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tcs interprets the named file(s) (standard input default) as a stream of characters from the ics character set or format, converts them to runes, and then converts them into a stream of characters
       from  the ocs character set or format on the standard output.  The default value for ics and ocs is utf, the UTF encoding described in utf(6).  The -l option lists the character sets known to tcs.
       Processing continues in the face of conversion errors (the -s option prevents reporting of these errors).  The -c option forces the output to contain only correctly  converted  characters;  other‐
       wise, 0x80 characters will be substituted for UTF encoding errors and 0xFFFD characters will substituted for unknown characters.

       The -v option generates various diagnostic and summary information on standard error, or makes the -l output more verbose.

       Tcs recognizes an ever changing list of character sets.  In particular, it supports a variety of Russian and Japanese encodings.  Some of the supported encodings are
