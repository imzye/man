NAME
       libinput - tool to interface with libinput

SYNOPSIS
       libinput [--help|--version] <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       libinput is a library to handle input devices and provides device detection and input device event processing for most Wayland compositors and the X.Org xf86-input-libinput driver.

       The  libinput tools are a set of tools to debug, interface with and analyze data for libinput. These tools create libinput contexts separate from that of the compositor/X server and cannot change set‐
       tings in a running session.  See section COMMANDS for a list of available commands.

       libinput's API documentation and details on features and various high-level concepts are available online at https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/

       The man page for the X.Org xf86-input-libinput driver is libinput(4).
