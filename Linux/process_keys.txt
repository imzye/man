NAME
       process_keys - Web of Trust analysis

SYNTAX
       process_keys [ -S ]

DESCRIPTION
       process_keys takes the output from pgpring(1) and turns it into suitable input for keyanalyze(1).

       pgpring must be called with the -S option to also dump signatures.

       It acts as a filter, reading from stdin and writing to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -S     Accept keys that are not selfsigned.  Not recommended.
