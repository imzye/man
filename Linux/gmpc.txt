NAME
       GMPC - Gnome Music Player Client

SYNOPSIS
       GMPC [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       GMPC is a fully featured but still very lightweight gtk client for the music player daemon (MPD).

       It provides several different ways to browse your music. Based on the file system, tags, search and metadata.

       GMPC can show the following types of metadata:

       * Album covers
       * Artist images
       * Lyrics
       * Guitar tabs
       * Album information
       * Artist biography
       * Similar artist
       * Similar songs

       GMPC uses plugins to fetch metadata and can be extended using plugins.
