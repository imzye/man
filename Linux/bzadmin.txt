NAME
       bzadmin - a text based client for BZFlag

SYNOPSIS
       bzadmin  [-help]  [-hide  msgtype[,msgtype]...]   [-show  msgtype[,msg‐
       type]...]  [-ui {curses | stdboth | stdin  |  stdout}]  callsign[:pass‐
       word]@hostname[:port] [command] [command] ...

DESCRIPTION
       bzadmin is a textbased client for the game BZFlag. It can't be used for
       playing, but it can be used to see when  players  join  and  leave  the
       game,  to  see  the chat messages, and to send messages and commands to
       the server, as well as see several other vital game messages.

       When you start bzadmin without any  command  line  options  other  than
       callsign  and  hostname  a  simple  curses-based user interface will be
       started (unless you built bzadmin without curses support). This  inter‐
       face  is divided into three rectangles; the output window (which covers
       almost all of the terminal), the target window, and the input window.

       The output window is where messages from the server will be shown.

       The target window shows the name of the player that will  receive  your
       next  message, or 'all' if it will be a public message.  You can change
       target by using the left and right arrow keys.

       The input window is where you type your messages. It also supports  tab
       completion  of  commands  and callsigns. You can clear the input window
       with the key combination Ctrl-U, and you can generate a  /kick  command
       for  the  current  target  with  the F5 key (if the current target is a
       player). You can also generate a ban command  for  the  current  target
       with the F6 key, but this only works if you are an admin and the server
       has sent you that players IP address (as a response  to  a  /playerlist
       command).

       The  curses  user interface also has a simple menu system where you can
       edit the server variables (if you are an admin) and see a player  list.
       If  you  are  an  admin you can also see the IP addresses in the player
       list, if you have sent a /playerlist command. The menu  shows  up  when
       you  hit  the  F2 key.  It only covers the upper half of the screen, so
       you can still see what's going on in the game. You can navigate through
       the  menu with the up and down arrow keys, and use the enter key to se‐
       lect submenus and other menu items. If you hit  F2  again  the  command
       prompt  will regain keyboard focus, but the menu will still be visible.
       If you hit F2 a third time the menu will go away.

   Options
              -help          Show a simple help text.

              -hide msgtype[,msgtype]...
                             Tell bzadmin not to show these message types. The
                             available  message  types  are  chat, join, kill,
                             leave, pause,  ping,  rabbit,  spawn,  time,  and
                             over.  By default chat, join, kill, leave, pause,
                             and rabbit are shown. You can  also  change  this
                             while  bzadmin is running with the commands /show
                             <msgtype>  and  /hide  <msgtype>,  and  from  the
                             curses menu.

              -show msgtype[,msgtype]...
                             Tell  bzadmin  to  show  these message types. See
                             -hide for a list of available message types. If a
                             message type is listed both in -show and -hide it
                             will not be shown.

              -ui {curses | stdboth | stdin | stdout}
                             Select the user  interface  that  you  want.  The
                             curses  interface  is  the default, and it is de‐
                             scribed above.
                             The stdin interface reads user commands from  the
                             standard  in stream and sends them to the server.
                             All server output is ignored.
                             The stdout interface prints all server output  to
                             the  standard  out stream.  All user input is ig‐
                             nored.
                             The stdboth interface is a combination  of  stdin
                             and stdout - it prints server output to the stan‐
                             dard out stream, and reads user commands from the
                             standard in stream.

              callsign[:password]@hostname[:port]
                             Specifies  the callsign that you want your client
                             to use, and the hostname where the BZFlag  server
                             is.  The port number is optional, and the default
                             value is 5154.

              command        You can specify messages and commands to send  to
                             the server on the command line. BZAdmin will con‐
                             tinue running after sending  the  specified  com‐
                             mands.

   Examples
              bzadmin admin@localhost:5154
                             Join  the game on localhost, port 5154, using the
                             callsign 'admin'.

              bzadmin admin@localhost '/passwd secretpass' '/ban 192.168.0.2'
                             Connect to the server at localhost and ban the IP
                             192.168.0.2.

              bzadmin -ui stdout spy@bzserver.xy | grep magicword
                             Connect  to bzserver.xy and print all server mes‐
                             sages that contain 'magicword'.
