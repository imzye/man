NAME
       drawterm - connect to Plan 9 CPU servers from other operating systems

SYNOPSIS
       drawterm [-d] [-a authserver] [-c cpuserver] [-e encription_hash_algs] [-k keyspec] [-s secstoreserver] [-u username] [-C command args ...]

DESCRIPTION
       drawterm is not a Plan 9 program.  It is a program that users of non-Plan 9 systems can use to establish graphical cpu(1) connections with Plan 9 CPU servers.  Just as a real Plan 9 terminal does,
       a  drawterm  serves its local name space as well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and screen) to a remote CPU server, which mounts this name space on /mnt/term and starts a shell.  Typically,
       either explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell to start rio(1).

       By default, drawterm uses the CPU server $cpu or cpu, and the authentication server $auth or auth,

OPTIONS
       This program follows the syntax of the cpu(1) Plan 9 command.

       A summary of options is included below.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -a     Specifies the authentication server to use. If not present uses the $auth environment variable, if present, or tries with a host name of auth.

       -c     Specifies the cpu server to use. If not present uses the $cpu environment variable, if present, or tries with a host name of cpu.

       -u     Specifies the username to authenticate with. If not present uses the $USER environment variable, if present, or asks interactively for an username.

       -s     Specifies the secstore server to use.

       -C     Specifies a command to be executed remotely.

       -e,-k  Allow for selecting the hash algorithm and keys used, they have the same meaning as in cpu(1).

SOURCE
       In Plan 9 distributions, /sys/src/cmd/unix/drawterm.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Drawterm prints most diagnostics in its own window.

BUGS
       Although at first drawterm may seem like a Plan 9 terminal, in fact it is just a way to provide a CPU server with some terminal devices.  The difference is important because one cannot run  termi‐
       nal-resident programs when using drawterm.  The illusion can be improved by delicate adjustments in /usr/$user/lib/profile.

       Should import latest /dev/draw to allow resize of window

       Should copy 9term code and make console window a real 9term window instead.

       Should implement /dev/label.
