NAME
       python-mkdebian - Generate a suitable Debian source package for a standard distutils application

SYNOPSIS
       python-mkdebian [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This script generates a reasonably Debian Policy compliant Debian source package for a Python application that uses distutils properly. It assumes that there are no public Python modules, and gen‐
       erates just a single application binary package.

       Information  is taken from setup.py's generated .egg-info file: author, project name, description, version, upstream source, license, and required and provided Python modules (which are translated
       to Debian python library package names, and automatically added as package dependencies).

       It generates a simple cdbs/python-support rules file.

       python-mkdebian was designed to be used with the DistUtilsExtra.auto module, which calculates required Python dependencies automatically. However, it makes no explicit assumptions about  DistUtil‐
       sExtra, so if setup.py has complete information it will work with any distutils setup.

OPTIONS
       --force-control=FORCE_CONTROL
              Force  control  file  behaviour.  Can  be  one  of  "none" (keep unchanged), "deps" (only update dependencies), or "full" (recreate whole file). By default only dependencies will be updated
              ("deps").

       --force-copyright
              Force whole copyright file to be recreated. By default it will not touch an already existing copyright file, so that you can customize them.

       --force-rules
              Force whole rules file to be recreated. By default it will not touch an already existing rules file, so that you can customize them.

       --changelog=CHANGELOG
              Add changelog entry to debian/changelog (can be specified multiple times)

       --dependency=PACKAGENAME
              Add additional debian package dependency (can be specified multiple times)

       --prefix=PREFIX
              Ask for installing all your modules in the dedicated PREFIX (default is /usr)

       --version
              Show program's version number and exit

       -h, --help
              Show this help message and exit
