NAME
       nfs.systemd - managing NFS services through systemd.

SYNOPSIS
       nfs-utils.service
       nfs-server.service
       nfs-client.target
       etc

DESCRIPTION
       The  nfs-utils  package  provides a suite of systemd unit files and generators which allow the various services to be started and managed.  These unit files and generators ensure that the services
       are started in the correct order, and the prerequisites are active before dependant services start.  As there are quite a few unit files and generators, it is not immediately obvious how  best  to
       achieve certain results.  The following subsections attempt to cover the issues that are most likely to come up.

   Configuration
       The  standard  systemd  unit files do not provide any easy way to pass any command line arguments to daemons so as to configure their behavior.  In many case such configuration can be performed by
       making changes to /etc/nfs.conf or other configuration files (see nfs.conf(5)).  When that is not convenient, a distribution might provide systemd "drop-in" files which replace the ExecStart= set‐
       ting to start the program with different arguments.  For example a drop-in file systemd/system/nfs-mountd.service.d/local.conf containing
              [Service]
              EnvironmentFile=/etc/sysconfig/nfs
              ExecStart=
              ExecStart= /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd $RPCMOUNTDOPTS
       would cause the nfs-mountd.service unit to run the rpc.mountd program using, for arguments, the value given for RPCMOUNTDOPTS in /etc/sysconfig/nfs.  This allows for seamless integration with  ex‐
       isting configuration tools.

   Enabling unit files
       There are three unit files which are designed to be manually enabled.  All others are automatically run as required.  The three are:

       nfs-client.target
              This should be enabled on any host which ever serves as an NFS client.  There is little cost in transparently enabling it whenever NFS client software is installed.

       nfs-server.service
              This must be enabled to provide NFS service to clients.  It starts and configures the required daemons in the required order.

       nfs-blkmap.service
              The  blkmapd  daemon is only required on NFS clients which are using pNFS (parallel NFS), and particularly using the blocklayout layout protocol.  If you might use this particular extension
              to NFS, the nfs-blkmap.service unit should be enabled.

       Several other units which might be considered to be optional, such as rpc-gssd.service are careful to only start if the required configuration file exists.  rpc-gssd.service will not start if  the
       krb5.keytab file does not exist (typically in /etc).

   Restarting NFS services
       Most NFS daemons can be restarted at any time.  They will reload any state that they need, and continue servicing requests.  This is rarely necessary though.

       When  configuration  changes  are made, it can be hard to know exactly which services need to be restarted to ensure that the configuration takes effect.  The simplest approach, which is often the
       best, is to restart everything.  To help with this, the nfs-utils.service unit is provided.  It declares appropriate dependencies with other unit files so that
              systemctl restart nfs-utils
       will restart all NFS daemons that are running.  This will cause all configuration changes to take effect except for changes to mount options lists in /etc/fstab or /etc/nfsmount.conf.   Mount  op‐
       tions can only be changed by unmounting and remounting filesystem.  This can be a disruptive operation so it should only be done when the value justifies the cost.  The command
              umount -a -t nfs; mount -a -t nfs
       should unmount and remount all NFS filesystems.

   Masking unwanted services
       Rarely  there  may be a desire to prohibit some services from running even though there are normally part of a working NFS system.  This may be needed to reduce system load to an absolute minimum,
       or to reduce attack surface by not running daemons that are not absolutely required.

       Three particular services which this can apply to are rpcbind, idmapd, and rpc-gssd.  rpcbind is not part of the nfs-utils package, but it used by several NFS services.  However it is  not  needed
       when only NFSv4 is in use.  If a site will never use NFSv3 (or NFSv2) and does not want rpcbind to be running, the correct approach is to run
              systemctl mask rpcbind
       This  will disable rpcbind, and the various NFS services which depend on it (and are only needed for NFSv3) will refuse to start, without interfering with the operation of NFSv4 services.  In par‐
       ticular, rpc.statd will not run when rpcbind is masked.

       idmapd is only needed for NFSv4, and even then is not needed when the client and server agree to use user-ids rather than user-names to identify the owners of files.  If idmapd is not  needed  and
       not wanted, it can be masked with
              systemctl mask idmapd
       rpc-gssd is assumed to be needed if the krb5.keytab file is present.  If a site needs this file present but does not want rpc-gssd running, it can be masked with
              systemctl mask rpc-gssd

   Generators
       systemd unit generators are small executables placed in /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/ to dynamically extend the unit file hierarchy.  The nfs-utils package provides three:

       nfsroot-generator
              It creates the sysroot.mount unit to mount /sysroot via NFSv4 in the initrd, if it detects one the following options in the kernel command line:

              root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=[<server>:]<path>[,<options>]

                     Defined in <kernel_source>/Documentation/admin-guide/nfs/nfsroot.rst

              root=nfs[4]:[<server>:]<path>[:<options>]

                     Defined in dracut.cmdline(7).

                     NOTE: Although "nfs" can be used as type indicator for the mountpoint, the mount unit will use always "nfs4".

       nfs-server-generator
              It  creates  ordering dependencies between nfs-server.service and various filesystem mounts: it should start before any "nfs" mountpoints are mounted, in case they are loop-back mounts, and
              after all exported filesystems are mounted, so there is no risk of exporting the underlying directory.

       rpc-pipefs-generator
              It creates ordering dependencies between NFS services and the rpc_pipefs mountpoint.

FILES
       /etc/nfs.conf
       /etc/nfsmount.conf
       /etc/idmapd.conf

       Also similar files in /usr/etc and in related conf.d drop-in directories.
