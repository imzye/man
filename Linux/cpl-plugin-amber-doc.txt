NAME
       amber_selector - AMBER OI frame selector

SYNOPSIS
       esorex amber_selector [OPTIONS] FILE.sof

DESCRIPTION
       This  recipe  selects frames stored in an AMBER OI product by various methods and writes a filtered OI product. After selecting a method one can set a selection criteria for every baseline by
       defining the variables X1, X2, and X3. If only one baseline is available, X2 and X3 can be neglected. Moreover one can choose the combining method  of  the  single  criteria  by  setting  the
       Boolean variable ANDselection.

       If ANDselection is not set (--ANDselection=FALSE), a frame passes the filter if at least one of the selection criteria (X1 || X2 || X3) is fulfilled.

       If ANDselection is set (--ANDselection=TRUE), a frame passes the filter only if ALL selection criteria (X1 && X2 && X3) are fulfilled.

       If AverageFrames is set (--AverageFrames=TRUE), the final product will contain the average of the frames

       Please note, that for three baselines in both cases the visibility triplet is written to the product file!

OPTIONS
       --selection-method <str>
              Selection  methods  (str;  default:  ´Fringe_SNR_gt_x´).  The  full  name  of  this  option  for  the  EsoRex  configuration  file  is  amber.amber_selector.selection_method [default =
              Fringe_SNR_gt_x].

       --X1 <float>
              X1 Value (float; default: 2.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is amber.amber_selector.selection_x1 [default = 2.0].

       --X2 <float>
              X2 Value (float; default: 2.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is amber.amber_selector.selection_x2 [default = 2.0].

       --X3 <float>
              X3 Value (float; default: 2.0). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is amber.amber_selector.selection_x3 [default = 2.0].

       --ANDselection <bool>
              X1, X2, and X3 combining method (bool; default: False). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file is amber.amber_selector.selection_ANDselection [default = False].

       --AverageFrames <bool>
              Average all frames after selection (bool; default: False). The full name of this option for the EsoRex configuration file  is  amber.amber_selector.selection_AverageFrames  [default  =
              False].

       Note that it is possible to create a configuration file containing these options, along with suitable default values. Please refer to the details provided by the 'esorex --help' command.
