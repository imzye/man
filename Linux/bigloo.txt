NAME
       bigloo v2.3 - `a practical Scheme compiler'

SYNOPSIS
       bigloo [ options ] [ input ]

DESCRIPTION
       Bigloo  is a Scheme compiler. Scheme is defined in an IEEE standard for
       the Scheme Programming Language but Bigloo does not entirely conform to
       it.  The  compiler  produces  either C files or Java class files. The C
       files are then compiled by any ISO C compiler to  produce  .o  or  exe‐
       cutable  files.  Bigloo is a module compiler which means that it is al‐
       lowed to compile several files and to link them together to produce  an
       unique executable.

OPTIONS
       options         Many  options  are  available.  Type  `bigloo -help' to
                       print them.

       -jvm            Produces Java class files instead of C files. This  op‐
                       tion has to be used when compiling and when linking.

       -no-jvmjar      Disable jar file production when linking with -jvm.

       input           If  an input file is provided, Bigloo compiles it. Oth‐
                       erwise the interpreter is entered. Input must be a rec‐
                       ognized Scheme source file name (i.e.  a file name with
                       a recognized suffix (see -suffix option)).

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Each Bigloo's user can use a special configuration file. This file must
       be  named  `~/.bigloorc'. This file makes it possible to modify the be‐
       haviour of the compiler. This file is a regular Scheme file which  con‐
       tains expressions bound in an environment where compiler parameters are
       bound.  See the documentation for details.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       BIGLOOHEAP      Set the environment size (in  megabytes).  The  default
                       value is 4.

       TMPDIR          Set  the  temporary  directory.  The  default  value is
                       `/tmp'.

       BIGLOOLIB       The path to find the Bigloo's library.

       BIGLOOJAVAOPT   Java Virtual Machine options when running Bigloo a  ap‐
                       plication.

FILES
       /.../lib/bigloo/2.3a/bigloo.heap -- saved heap image for the compiler.
       /.../lib/bigloo/2.3a/bigloo.jheap  -- saved heap image for the compiler
       for -jvm compiations.
       /.../lib/bigloo/2.3a/bigloo.h -- definitions which  are  #include'd  in
       the C code.
