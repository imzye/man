NAME
       hmmpress - prepare an HMM database for hmmscan

SYNOPSIS
       hmmpress [options] <hmmfile>

DESCRIPTION
       Starting from a profile database <hmmfile> in standard HMMER3 format, construct binary compressed datafiles for hmmscan.  The hmmpress step is required for hmmscan to work.

       Four  files  are  created: <hmmfile>.h3m, <hmmfile>.h3i, <hmmfile>.h3f, and <hmmfile>.h3p.  The <hmmfile>.h3m file contains the profile HMMs and their annotation in a binary format.  The <hmmfile>.h3i
       file is an SSI index for the <hmmfile>.h3m file.  The <hmmfile>.h3f file contains precomputed data structures for the fast heuristic filter (the MSV filter).  The <hmmfile>.h3p file  contains  precom‐
       puted data structures for the rest of each profile.

       <hmmfile> may not be '-' (dash); running hmmpress on a standard input stream rather than a file is not allowed.

OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

       -f     Force; overwrites any previous hmmpress'ed datafiles. The default is to bitch about any existing files and ask you to delete them first.
