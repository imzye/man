NAME
       cf-key - make private/public key-pairs for CFEngine authentication

SYNOPSIS
       cf-key [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       The CFEngine key generator makes key pairs for remote authentication.

       --trust-key, -t value
              Make cf-serverd/cf-agent trust the specified public key. Argument value is of the form [[USER@]IPADDR:]FILENAME where FILENAME is the local path of the public key for client at IPADDR address.

       --color, -C value
              Enable colorized output. Possible values: 'always', 'auto', 'never'. If option is used, the default value is 'auto'

CFENGINE
       CFEngine  provides  automated  configuration management of large-scale computer systems. A system administrator describes the desired state of a system using CFEngine policy code. The program cf-agent
       reads policy code and attempts to bring the current system state to the desired state described. Policy code is downloaded by cf-agent from a cf-serverd daemon. The daemon cf-execd is responsible  for
       running cf-agent periodically.
       Documentation for CFEngine is available at http://cfengine.com/documentation/.

PROMISE THEORY
       CFEngine  is  built  on principles from promise theory, proposed by Mark Burgess in 2004. Promise theory is a model of voluntary cooperation between individual, autonomous actors or agents who publish
       their intentions to one another in the form of promises. A promise is a declaration of intent whose purpose is to increase the recipient's certainty about a claim of past, present or future behaviour.
       For  a promise to increase certainty, the recipient needs to trust the promiser, but trust can also be built on the verification that previous promises have been kept, thus trust plays a symbiotic re‐
       lationship with promises.
       For an introduction to promise theory, please see http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3294/
