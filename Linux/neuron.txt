NAME
       nrniv - Command-line interface for NEURON

SYNOPSIS
       nrniv [FILE] [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the nrniv command.

       nrniv is an interactive interface to the NEURON simulation environment for computational models of physiological neurons.

       If started without parameters, it will display an interactive hoc interpreter.  nrniv can be toggled to use Python instead by using the -python flag.
       If a .hoc file is supplied as an argument, the file will be executed immediately, and no interactive hoc interpreter will be shown.
