NAME
       rdp_classifier - taxonomic assignment from next generation sequencing

USAGE:
       rdp_classifier [-f <arg>] [-g <arg>] [-o <arg>] [-q <arg>] [-t <arg>] [-w <arg>]

DESCRIPTION
       The RDP Classifier is a nave Bayesian classifier that can rapidly and accurately provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment.

       -f,--format <arg>
              all  tab  delimited  output  format:  [allrank|fixrank|db]. Default is allrank.  allrank: outputs the results for all ranks applied for each sequence: seqname, orientation, taxon name,
              rank, conf, ...  fixrank: only outputs the results for fixed ranks in order: domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus db: outputs the seqname, trainset_no,  tax_id,  conf.  This  is
              good for storing in a database

       -g,--gene <arg>
              16srrna|fungallsu, the default training model for 16S rRNA or Fungal LSU genes. This option will be overwritten by --train_propfile option

       -o,--outputFile <arg>
              output file name for classification assignment

       -q,--queryFile <arg>
              query file contains sequences in one of the following formats: Fasta, Genbank and EMBL

       -t,--train_propfile <arg>
              specify  a  property  file contains the mapping of the training files if it's located outside of data/classifier/.  Note: the training files and the property file should be in the same
              directory.  The default property file is set to data/classifier/16srrna/rRNAClassifier.properties.

       -w,--minWords <arg>
              minimum number of words for each bootstrap trial, Default is 1/8 of the words. Minimum is 5
