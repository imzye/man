NAME
       Test::JSON::Schema::Acceptance - Acceptance testing for JSON-Schema based validators

VERSION
       version 1.029

SYNOPSIS
       This module allows the JSON Schema Test Suite <https://github.com/json-schema/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite> tests to be used in perl to test a module that implements the JSON Schema specification
       ("json-schema"). These are the same tests that many modules (libraries, plugins, packages, etc.) use to confirm support of json-schema. Using this module to confirm support gives assurance of
       interoperability with other modules that run the same tests in different languages.

       In the JSON::Schema::Modern module, a test could look like the following:

         use Test::More;
         use JSON::Schema::Modern;
         use Test::JSON::Schema::Acceptance;

         my $accepter = Test::JSON::Schema::Acceptance->new(specification => 'draft7');

         $accepter->acceptance(
           validate_data => sub ($schema, $input_data) {
             return JSON::Schema::Modern->new($schema)->validate($input_data);
           },
           todo_tests => [ { file => 'dependencies.json' } ],
         );

         done_testing();

       This would determine if JSON::Schema::Modern's "validate" method returns the right result for all of the cases in the JSON Schema Test Suite, except for those listed in "skip_tests".

DESCRIPTION
       JSON Schema <http://json-schema.org> is an IETF draft (at time of writing) which allows you to define the structure of JSON.

       From the overview of the draft 2020-12 version of the specification <https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.3>:

           This document proposes a new media type "application/schema+json" to identify a JSON Schema for describing JSON data. It also proposes a further optional media type,
           "application/schema-instance+json", to provide additional integration features. JSON Schemas are themselves JSON documents. This, and related specifications, define keywords allowing authors
           to describe JSON data in several ways.

           JSON Schema uses keywords to assert constraints on JSON instances or annotate those instances with additional information. Additional keywords are used to apply assertions and annotations to
           more complex JSON data structures, or based on some sort of condition.

       This module allows other perl modules (for example JSON::Schema::Modern) to test that they are JSON Schema-compliant, by running the tests from the official test suite, without having to manually
       convert them to perl tests.

       You are unlikely to want this module, unless you are attempting to write a module which implements JSON Schema the specification, and want to test your compliance.

CONSTRUCTOR
         Test::JSON::Schema::Acceptance->new(specification => $specification_version)

       Create a new instance of Test::JSON::Schema::Acceptance.

       Available options (which are also available as accessor methods on the object) are:

   specification
       This determines the draft version of the schema to confirm compliance to.  Possible values are:

       •   "draft3"

       •   "draft4"

       •   "draft6"

       •   "draft7"

       •   "draft2019-09"

       •   "draft2020-12"

       •   "latest" (alias for "draft2020-12")

       •   "draft-next"

       The default is "latest", but in the synopsis example, JSON::Schema::Modern is testing draft 7 compliance.

       (For backwards compatibility, "new" can be called with a single numeric argument of 3 to 7, which maps to "draft3" through "draft7".)

   supported_specifications
       The version(s) that the implementation supports; used to skip adding remote resources that reference unsupported schema versions (for cross-schema tests). Defaults to "[ $self->specification ]".

   test_dir
       Instead of specifying a draft specification to test against, which will select the most appropriate tests, you can pass in the name of a directory of tests to run directly. Files in this directory
       should be .json files following the format described in <https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/blob/main/README.md>.

   additional_resources
       A  directory of additional resources which should be made available to the implementation under the base URI "http://localhost:1234". This dataset is automatically provided if you did not override
       "test_dir"; otherwise, you need to supply it yourself, if any tests require it (for example by containing "{"$ref": "http://localhost:1234/foo.json/#a/b/c"}").  If  you  supply  an  "add_resource"
       value to "acceptance" (see below), this will be done for you.

   verbose
       Optional. When true, prints version information and the test result table such that it is visible during "make test" or "prove".

   include_optional
       Optional. When true, tests in subdirectories (most notably optional/ are also included.

   skip_dir
       Optional.  Pass  a  string  or  arrayref consisting of relative path name(s) to indicate directories (within the test directory as specified above with "specification" or "test_dir") which will be
       skipped. Note that this is only useful currently with "include_optional => 1", as otherwise all subdirectories would be skipped anyway.

   results
       After calling "acceptance", a list of test results are provided here. It is an arrayref of hashrefs with four keys:

       •   file - the filename

       •   pass - the number of pass results for that file

       •   todo_fail - the number of fail results for that file that were marked TODO

       •   fail - the number of fail results for that file (not including TODO tests)

   results_text
       After calling "acceptance", a text string tabulating the test results are provided here. This is the same table that is printed at the end of the test run.

   test_schemas
       Optional. A boolean that, when true, will test every schema against its specification metaschema. (When set, "specification" must also be set.)

       This normally should not be set as the official test suite has already been sanity-tested, but you may want to set this in development environments if you are using your own test files.

       Defaults to false.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   acceptance
       Accepts a hash of options as its arguments.

       (Backwards-compatibility mode: accepts a subroutine which is used as "validate_json_string", and a hashref of arguments.)

       Available options are:

       validate_data

       A subroutine reference, which is passed two arguments: the JSON Schema, and the inflated data structure to be validated. This is the main entry point to your JSON Schema library being tested.

       The subroutine can return either one value or two:

       * a boolean value indicating whether the schema was valid for the input or not (required) * a value containing the result of the evaluation (which will be JSONified in the test output) (optional)

       Either "validate_data" or "validate_json_string" is required.

       validate_json_string

       A subroutine reference, which is passed two arguments: the JSON Schema, and the JSON string containing the data to be validated. This is an alternative to "validate_data" above,  if  your  library
       only accepts JSON strings.

       The subroutine can return either one value or two:

       * a boolean value indicating whether the schema was valid for the input or not (required) * a value containing the result of the evaluation (which will be JSONified in the test output) (optional)

       Exactly one of "validate_data" or "validate_json_string" is required.

       add_resource

       Optional. A subroutine reference, which will be called at the start of "acceptance" multiple times, with the arguments:

       •   a URI (string): the canonical uri to use for the new resource

       •   a data structure containing schema data to be associated with that URI, for use in some tests that use additional resources (see above).

       •   a list of key-value pairs (optional), containing additional options to be passed to the subroutine: keys currently limited to "specification_version".

       If  you  do  not  provide this option, you will be responsible for ensuring that those additional resources are made available to your implementation for the successful execution of the tests that
       rely on them.

       For more information, see <https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html#rfc.section.9.1.2>.

       tests

       Optional. Restricts tests to just those mentioned (the conditions are ANDed together, not ORed).  The syntax can take one of many forms:

         # run tests in this file
         tests => { file => 'dependencies.json' }

         # run tests in these files
         tests => { file => [ 'dependencies.json', 'refRemote.json' ] }

         # run tests in this file with this group description
         tests => {
           file => 'refRemote.json',
           group_description => 'remote ref',
         }

         # run tests in this file with these group descriptions
         tests => {
           file => 'const.json',
           group_description => [ 'const validation', 'const with object' ],
         }

         # run tests in this file with this group description and test description
         tests => {
           file => 'const.json',
           group_description => 'const validation',
           test_description => 'another type is invalid',
         }

         # run tests in this file with this group description and these test descriptions
         tests => {
           file => 'const.json',
           group_description => 'const validation',
           test_description => [ 'same value is valid', 'another type is invalid' ],
         }

       todo_tests

       Optional. Mentioned tests will run as "TODO". Uses arrayrefs of the same hashref structure as "tests" above, which are ORed together.

         todo_tests => [
           # all tests in this file are TODO
           { file => 'dependencies.json' },
           # just some tests in this file are TODO
           { file => 'boolean_schema.json', test_description => 'array is invalid' },
           # .. etc
         ]

   json_prettyprint
       JSON-encodes a data structure in a format suitable for human view, used for printing test diagnostics.

   json_encoder
       Provides access to the object that provides the "json_prettyprint" method.
