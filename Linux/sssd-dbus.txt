NAME
       sssd-ifp - SSSD InfoPipe responder

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the configuration of the InfoPipe responder for sssd(8). For a detailed syntax reference, refer to the “FILE FORMAT” section of the sssd.conf(5) manual page.

       The InfoPipe responder provides a public D-Bus interface accessible over the system bus. The interface allows the user to query information about remote users and groups over the system bus.

   FIND BY VALID CERTIFICATE
       The following options can be used to control how the certificates are validated when using the FindByValidCertificate() API:

       •   ca_db

       •   p11_child_timeout

       •   certificate_verification

       For more details about the options see sssd.conf(5).

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       These options can be used to configure the InfoPipe responder.

       allowed_uids (string)
           Specifies the comma-separated list of UID values or user names that are allowed to access the InfoPipe responder. User names are resolved to UIDs at startup.

           Default: 0 (only the root user is allowed to access the InfoPipe responder)

           Please note that although the UID 0 is used as the default it will be overwritten with this option. If you still want to allow the root user to access the InfoPipe responder, which would be
           the typical case, you have to add 0 to the list of allowed UIDs as well.

       user_attributes (string)
           Specifies the comma-separated list of white or blacklisted attributes.

           By default, the InfoPipe responder only allows the default set of POSIX attributes to be requested. This set is the same as returned by getpwnam(3) and includes:

           name
               user's login name

           uidNumber
               user ID

           gidNumber
               primary group ID

           gecos
               user information, typically full name

           homeDirectory
               home directory

           loginShell
               user shell

           It is possible to add another attribute to this set by using “+attr_name” or explicitly remove an attribute using “-attr_name”. For example, to allow “telephoneNumber” but deny “loginShell”,
           you would use the following configuration:

               user_attributes = +telephoneNumber, -loginShell

           Default: not set. Only the default set of POSIX attributes is allowed.

       wildcard_limit (integer)
           Specifies an upper limit on the number of entries that are downloaded during a wildcard lookup that overrides caller-supplied limit.

           Default: 0 (let the caller set an upper limit)
