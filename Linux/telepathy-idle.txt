NAME
       telepathy-idle - Telepathy connection manager for IRC

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/telepathy/telepathy-idle

DESCRIPTION
       Idle implements the Telepathy D-Bus specification for Internet Relay Chat, allowing Telepathy clients like empathy(1) to connect to IRC servers.

       It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and should usually be started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful to start it manually for debugging.

OPTIONS
       There are no command-line options.

ENVIRONMENT
       IDLE_LOGFILE=filename
              If  set,  debug  output will go to the given file rather than to stderr.  If + is prepended to the filename (e.g.  IDLE_LOGFILE=+idle.log), debug output will be appended to the file; other‐
              wise, any existing file will be replaced.

       IDLE_DEBUG=type
              May be set to "all" for full debug output, or various undocumented options (which may change from release to release) to filter the output.
