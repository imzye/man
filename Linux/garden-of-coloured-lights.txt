NAME
       garden - Garden of Coloured Lights

SYNOPSIS
       garden

DESCRIPTION
       Garden of Coloured Lights is an abstract vertical shooter with music elements.  The enemies, in fact, are kind of musical. Part of what stands out about Garden of Coloured Lights are its graphics,
       that  even  though  are  kept quite simple, are also carefully taken care of. Every ship still has moving parts and mechanisms that open and close, and every level is different, even though all of
       them share a common theme.

KEYS
       Left, Right, Up, Down
              move the fighter across the screen

       Z      fire weapon 1

       X      fire weapon 2

       C      fire weapon 3

       V      slow down movement

       Key controls can be modified inside the game options menu.

CONFIGURATION
       garden doesn't accept any command line arguments. Configuration is via the file ~/.garden/init.txt, which also records scores and configured key controls.

       The following configuration can only be done by editing init.txt (under the heading [Misc]):

       Windowed
              Use Windowed = 0 for fullscreen, Windowed = 1 to run in a window (default).

       vsync  Turning vsync on (vsync = 1) eliminates a graphic shearing effect which some people might find annoying, but can slow things down on older systems.  Default is vsync = 0.
