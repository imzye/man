NAME
       CGI::Application::Plugin::RequireSSL - Force SSL in specified pages or modules

VERSION
       Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
           use CGI::Application::Plugin::RequireSSL;

           sub login_form :RequireSSL {
               my $self = shift;
               # etc
           }

DESCRIPTION
       CGI::Application::Plugin::RequireSSL allows individual run modes or whole modules to be protected by SSL. If a standard HTTP request is received, you can specify whether an error is raised or if
       the request should be redirected to the HTTPS equivalent URL.

EXPORT
       Exported methods:
           config_requiressl, mode_redirect

USAGE
   run mode-level protection
       run mode protection is specified by the RequireSSL attribute after the method name:

           sub process_login :RequireSSL {
               my $self = shift;
           }

   Module-level protection
       You can protect a complete module by setting the 'require_ssl' parameter in your instance script:

           use MyApp;
           my $webapp = MyApp->new(
               PARAMS => {require_ssl => 1}
           );
           $webapp->run();

   Redirecting to a protected URL.
       By default, an error is raised if a request is made to a protected run mode or module using HTTP. However, you can specify that the request is redirected to the HTTPS url by setting the
       rewrite_to_ssl parameter as long as the requested method is not POST:

           my $webapp = MyApp->new(
               PARAMS => {rewrite_to_ssl => 1}
           );

   Turning off checks.
       If you need to turn off checks, simply set the ignore_check parameter when configuring the plugin (see "config_requiressl" below).

   Reverting to HTTP
       Once a successful request is made to a protected run mode or module, subsequent requests to a non-protected run mode or module will revert to using HTTP.  To prevent this from happening, set the
       parameter keep_in_ssl in the configuration (see "config_requiressl" below)

METHODS
   config_requiressl
       Optionally configure the plugin in your cgiapp_init method

           $self->config_requiressl(
               keep_in_ssl => 0,
               ignore_check => 0,
           )

       Valid parameters are:

       •   keep_in_ssl - if set, all subsequent requests following one to a protected run mode or module will be via HTTPS.

       •   ignore_check - ignore SSL schecking. This is useful if your application is deployed in an environment that doesn't support SSL.

   mode_redirect
       This is a run mode that will be automatically called if the request should be redirected to the equivalent HTTP or HTTPS URL. You should not call it directly.
