NAME
     pwqgen — Generate quality controllable random passphrase

SYNOPSIS
     pwqgen [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The pwqgen program generates a random passphrase using the libpasswdqc library.  Strength of the generated passphrase depends on the amount of randomness read from /dev/urandom.

OPTIONS
     random=N
             (default: random=47) The size of randomly-generated passphrase in bits (24 to 136).

     config=FILE
             Load config FILE in the passwdqc.conf format.  This file may define any options described in passwdqc.conf(5), but only the random and config options are honored by pwqgen.

     --version
             Output pwqgen program version and exit.

     -h, --help
             Output pwqgen help text and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     pwqgen exits with non-zero status when it encounters invalid config file, invalid option, invalid parameter value, when it fails to obtain enough randomness, and in any case when it fails to generate a
     passphrase.

FILES
     /etc/passwdqc.conf (not read unless this suggested file location is specified with the config=/etc/passwdqc.conf option).

SEE ALSO
