NAME
       subnetcalc — IPv4/IPv6 Subnet Calculator

SYNOPSIS
       subnetcalc [Address | Address Prefix | Address Netmask | Address/Prefix | Address/Netmask] [-n] [-uniquelocal] [-uniquelocalhq] [-nocolour | -nocolor] [-v | -version]

DESCRIPTION
       subnetcalc  is  an  IPv4/IPv6  subnet address calculator. For given IPv4 or IPv6 address and netmask or prefix length, it calculates network address, broadcast address, maximum number of hosts and
       host address range. Also, it prints the addresses in binary format for better understandability. Furthermore, it prints useful information on specific address types (e.g.  type,  scope,  interface
       ID, etc.).

ARGUMENTS
       The following arguments have to be provided:

       Address
               The  IP  address.  If  a hostname is provided here, it is tried to resolve the address by a DNS server and the first returned address is used. Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) are sup‐
               ported.

       Netmask/Prefix
               The netmask or prefix length (0-32 for IPv4; 0-128 for IPv6).

       -n      Skip trying a reverse DNS lookup.

       -uniquelocal
               Given an IPv6 address, the first 48 bits of the address are replaced by a randomly chosen IPv6 Unique Local prefix in fc00::/7 (see also RFC 4193). Under Linux and FreeBSD, /dev/urandom is
               used for random number generation.

       -uniquelocalhq
               Like -uniquelocal, but using /dev/random instead on Linux and FreeBSD systems for highest-quality random number generation. On other systems, this option is equal  to  -uniquelocal.  Note,
               that reading from /dev/random may take some time. You can speed up this process by delivering random input e.g. by pressing keys or moving the mouse.

       -nocolour | -nocolor
               Turns colourised output off.

       -v | -version
               Just prints program version.
