NAME
       sysprofile - modular centralized shell configuration

DESCRIPTION
       sysprofile  is  a  generic  approach  to  configure shell settings in a modular and centralized way mostly aimed at avoiding work for lazy sysadmins.  It has only been tested to work with the bash
       shell.

       It basically consists of the small /etc/sysprofile shell script which invokes other small shell scripts having a .bash suffix which are contained in the /etc/sysprofile.d/ directory.   The  system
       administrator can drop in any script he wants without any naming convention other than that the scripts need to have a .bash suffix to enable automagic sourcing by /etc/sysprofile.

       This  mechanism  is  set up by inserting a small shell routine into /etc/profile for login shells and optionally into /etc/bashrc and/or /etc/bash.bashrc for non-login shells from where the actual
       /etc/sysprofile script is invoked:

           if [ -f /etc/sysprofile ]; then
                   . /etc/sysprofile
           fi

       For using "sysprofile" under X11, one can source it in a similar way from /etc/X11/Xsession or your X display manager's Xsession file to provide the same shell environment as under the console  in
       X11.  See the example files in /usr/share/doc/sysprofile/ for illustration.

       For usage of terminal emulators with a non-login bash shell under X11, take care to enable sysprofile via /etc/bash.bashrc.  If not set this way, your terminal emulators won't come up with the en‐
       vironment defined by the scripts in /etc/sysprofile.d/.

       Users  not  wanting /etc/sysprofile to be sourced for their environment can easily disable it's automatic mechanism.  It can be disabled by simply creating an empty file called $HOME/.nosysprofile
       in the user's home directory using e.g. the touch(1) command.

       Any single configuration file in /etc/sysprofile.d/ can be overridden by any user by creating a private $HOME/.sysprofile.d/ directory which may contain a user's own version of  any  configuration
       file  to  be  sourced instead of the system default.  It's names have just to match exactly the system's default /etc/sysprofile.d/ configuration files.  Empty versions of these files contained in
       the $HOME/.sysprofile.d/ directory automatically disable sourcing of the system wide version.

       Naturally, users can add and include their own private script inventions to be automagically executed by /etc/sysprofile at login time.

OPTIONS
       There are no options other than those dictated by shell conventions.  Anything is defined within the configuration scripts themselves.

SEE ALSO
       The README files and configuration examples contained in /etc/sysprofile.d/ and the manual pages bash(1), xdm(1x), xdm.options(5), and wdm(1x).  Recommended further reading is  everything  related
       with shell programming.

       If you need a similar mechanism for executing code at logout time check out the related package syslogout(8) which is a very close companion to sysprofile.

BUGS
       sysprofile  in its current form is mainly restricted to bash(1) syntax.  In fact it is actually  a rather embarrassing quick and dirty hack than anything else - but it works.  It  serves the prac‐
       tical need to enable a centralized bash configuration  until something better becomes available.  Your constructive criticism in making  this  into something better" is  very  welcome.   Before  i
       forget to mention it: we take patches... ;-)
