NAME
       valkey-server - Persistent key-value database

SYNOPSIS
       valkey-server configfile

DESCRIPTION
       Valkey is a key-value database. It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile and other datatypes (such as lists and sets) are natively supported.

OPTIONS
       configfile
              Read options from specified configuration file.

NOTES
       On Debian GNU/Linux systems, valkey-server is typically started via the /etc/init.d/valkey-server initscript, not manually. This defaults to using /etc/valkey/valkey.conf as a configuration file.
