NAME
       makesimple - De-sugar GNU makefiles to its simplest form using the GmakeDB parser

SYNOPSIS
           $ makesimple -f myGNUmakefile.mk > simplest.mk

DESCRIPTION
       The makesimple script is a makefile simplifier. It converts a full-fledged GNU makefile to a highly de-sugared basic makefile which is almost a call-path tree dump.
