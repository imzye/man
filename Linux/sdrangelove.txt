NAME
       sdrangelove - a Qt software defined radio application

DESCRIPTION
       Uses  a re-purposed DVB-T receiver as a software defined radio to receive narrow band FM signals and demodulate to audio. Written for and incorporated in the
       osmocom rtl-sdr project.

       Narrowband FM is commonly used by public service agencies and commercial dispatch operations in the VHF and UHF bands.  Also can demodulate Wideband  FM,  as
       found in the 88-108 MHz FM broadcast band.  Experimental options include AM, LSB, USB and DSB demodulation.

       Much  software  is available for the RTL2832. Most of the user-level packages rely on the librtlsdr library which comes as part of the rtl-sdr codebase. This
       codebase contains both the library itself and also a number of command line tools such as rtl_test, rtl_sdr, rtl_tcp, and rtl_fm. These  command  line  tools
       use the library to test for the existence of RTL2832 devices and to perform basic data transfer functions to and from the device.

       Because most of the RTL2832 devices are connected using USB, the librtlsdr library depends on the libusb library to communicate with the device.

USAGE
       With  a suitable antenna for receiving the signal attached to the rtl-sdr supported device, this program will output the digital audio data decoded from that
       signal. The data can be listened to by piping to Sox or aplay applications to play the stream on the computer sound card.

SYNOPSIS
       rtl_fm [-f freq] [-options] [filename]

OPTIONS
       -f frequency_to_tune_to [Hz]
               use multiple -f for scanning, (requires squelch)
               ranges supported, -f 118M:137M:25k

       [-M modulation (default: fm)]
               fm, wbfm, raw, am, usb, lsb
               wbfm == -M fm -s 170k -o 4 -A fast -r 32k -l 0 -E deemp
               raw mode outputs 2x16 bit IQ pairs

       -s sample_rate (default: 24k)

       -d device_index (default: 0)

       -g tuner_gain (default: automatic)

       -l squelch_level (default: 0/off)

       -o oversampling (default: 1, 4 recommended)
               for fm squelch is inverted

       [-o oversampling (default: 1, 4 recommended)]

       -p ppm_error (default: 0)

       [-E enable_option (default: none)]
               use multiple -E to enable multiple options
                  edge:   enable lower edge tuning
                  dc:     enable dc blocking filter
                  deemp:  enable de-emphasis filter
                  direct: enable direct sampling
                  offset: enable offset tuning

       filename ('-' means stdout)
               omitting the filename also uses stdout

Experimental options
       [-r resample_rate (default: none / same as -s)]

       [-t squelch_delay (default: 10)]
                +values will mute/scan, -values will exit

       [-F fir_size (default: off)]
                  enables low-leakage downsample filter
                  size can be 0 or 9.  0 has bad roll off

       -A std/fast/lut choose atan math (default: std)

       filename
               (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)
               (omitting the filename also uses stdout)

PLUGINS
       The plan is to use Qt based plugins to add features:

       pogsag

       ads-b

       apco p25

       tetra

       FreeDV
