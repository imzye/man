NAME
       pk4-replace - build sources and replace currently installed packages

SYNOPSIS
       pk4-replace [options]

DESCRIPTION
       pk4-replace builds the sources in the current directory using sbuild, then replaces the subset of currently installed binary packages with the newly built packages.

OPTIONS
       -dry_run
              Print the build command and exit

EXAMPLES
                            # Fetch the i3 source, apply a bugfix, rebuild and replace installed packages:
                     pk4 i3
                     patch -p1 < /tmp/myfix.patch
                     pk4-replace

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The following attributes can be configured in ~/.config/pk4/pk4.deb822:

       Build-Command strings
              The command to use for building the sources in the current directory. Must write the path to the resulting .changes file to the pipe /proc/self/fd/3 when done.

       Example (default):

              Build-Command:
                sbuild
                --post-build-commands
                echo %SBUILD_CHANGES > /proc/self/fd/3
                -A
                --no-clean-source
                --dpkg-source-opt=--auto-commit

       Example (illustrating how one line is one argv element):

              Build-Command:
                sbuild
                --post-build-commands
                echo %SBUILD_CHANGES > /proc/self/fd/3
                -d
                stretch
