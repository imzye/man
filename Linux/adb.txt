NAME
       adb - CLI Client for ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Server

SYNOPSIS
       adb [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] command [COMMAND_OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Connects to the ADB Server via its smart socket interface.  Allows sending requests, receives responses and manages lifecycle of the adb server.

       Tasks are performed via commands.  Some commands are fulfilled directly by the server while others are "forwarded over to the adbd(ADB daemon) running on the device.

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
       -a     Listen on all network interfaces, not just localhost.

       -d     Use USB device (error if multiple devices connected).

       -e     Use TCP/IP device (error if multiple TCP/IP devices available).

       -s SERIAL     Use device with given SERIAL (overrides $ANDROID_SERIAL).

       -t ID     Use device with given transport ID.

       -H     Name of adb server host [default=localhost].

       -P PORT     Smart socket PORT of adb server [default=5037].

       -L SOCKET     Listen on given socket for adb server [default=tcp:localhost:5037].

       --one-device SERIAL|USB     Server will only connect to one USB device, specified by a SERIAL number or USB device address (only with 'start-server' or 'server nodaemon').

       --exit-on-write-error     Exit if stdout is closed.

GENERAL COMMANDS:
       devices [-l]     List connected devices.
