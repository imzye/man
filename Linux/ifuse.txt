NAME
       ifuse - Mount directories of an iOS device locally using fuse.

       ifuse MOUNTPOINT [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Mount directories of an iOS device locally using fuse. By default the media directory is mounted, options allow to also mount the sandbox container of an app, an app's documents folder or even the
