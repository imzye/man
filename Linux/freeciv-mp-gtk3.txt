DESCRIPTION
       Freeciv  is  a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each
       player becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ul‐
       timate goal: To become the greatest civilization.

       Players  of  Civilization II® by Microprose® should feel at home, since
       one aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

       Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders  and  enthusi‐
       asts, and is easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out
       there!

       This is the custom  content  installer  program  -  see  also  freeciv-
       server(6) freeciv-client(6) .

       This  program allows users to select and download add-on content ("mod‐
       packs") for Freeciv from the Internet, either from a list maintained by
       the  Freeciv  team, or by using a URL obtained by other means. It takes
       care of installing the files in the correct place under the user's home
       directory for this version of Freeciv; it does not install anything for
       system-wide use.

       freeciv-mp-cli is a version of the modpack installer usable  from  com‐
       mand  line.  By default it lists modpacks from the default list or from
       list specified with --List. One can then run it again by giving  appro‐
       priate URL from the list for --install parameter.

       This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details re‐
       garding the operation of freeciv-mp-XXX see README.modpack_installer in
       the  Freeciv distribution, and the documentation at the Freeciv website
       ⟨http://www.freeciv.org/⟩

OPTIONS
       All options have a short form (single hyphen and single letter)  and  a
       long  form (double hyphen and a complete word); their effects are iden‐
       tical.

       -d level_number, --debug level_number
              Sets the amount of debugging information to be logged.   Accept‐
              able values for the level_number are:

              0    for fatal messages only.

              1    for fatal and error messages.

              2    for fatal, error and normal messages (default).

              3    for fatal, error, normal, and verbose messages.

       -h, --help
              Prints a short summary of the command line options.

       -i URL, --install URL
              Automatically install modpack from a given URL.

       -L URL, --List URL
              Gets modpack list from given URL, rather than the standard loca‐
              tion on the Freeciv team's servers.

       -p directory, --prefix directory
              Installs modpacks under given directory hierarchy.

       -v, --version
              Prints the version number and exits.

FILES
       freeciv modpack installer installs files to the  following  subdirecto‐
       ries  of the user's home directory (or another directory specified with
       --prefix), as appropriate:

       • .freeciv/scenarios/

       • .freeciv/2.6/

       The modpack installer maintains a record of installed modpack names and
       versions in these files:

       • .freeciv/scenarios/.control/modpacks.db

       • .freeciv/2.6/.control/modpacks.db

       This  information is used for display, and for deciding whether any new
       modpacks' dependencies are already satisfied. It is  not  used  by  the
       other Freeciv programs, and can fairly safely be removed if it gets out
       of sync with the actual state of installed  modpacks.  These  are  text
       files whose format is subject to change.

ENVIRONMENT
       freeciv modpack installer accepts these environment variables:

       HOME   Specifies the user's home directory.

       http_proxy
              Set this variable accordingly when using a proxy.

       LANG  or  LANGUAGE
              Sets the language and locale on some platforms.

       LC_ALL  or  LC_CTYPE
              Similar to LANG (see documentation for your system).

       USER   Specifies the username of the current user.
