NAME
       openms-common - library for LC/MS data management and analysis - common files

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents briefly the openms-common package that ships shared data for the OpenMS software framework. OpenMS offers an infrastructure for the development of mass spectrometry-re‐
       lated software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization solutions. OpenMS offers analyses for various quantitation protocols, including label-free quantitation, SILAC, iTRAQ, SRM, SWATH…  It  provides
       build-in  algorithms  for de-novo identification and database search, as well as adapters to other state-of-the art tools like X!Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA… OpenMS supports the Proteomics Standard Ini‐
       tiative (PSI) formats for MS data and supports easy integration of tools into workflow engines like Knime, Galaxy, WS-Pgrade, and TOPPAS via the TOPPtools concept and a unified parameter handling.
