NAME
       findproxyfile - returns full path to GSI Proxy file

SYNOPSIS
       findproxyfile  [--proxycache=PATH]  [--delegation-id=ID] [--user-dn=DN]
       [--outsidecache]

DESCRIPTION
       findproxyfile returns full path to a GSI  Proxy  file,  either  in  the
       proxy  cache maintained by the GridSite G-HTTPS and delegation portType
       functions, or in other standard places.

       If a User DN is given findproxyfile uses the value of the  --proxycache
       argument,  the GRST_PROXY_PATH or the compile time default to determine
       the location of the proxy cache directory.  The directory  is  searched
       for  a proxy having the given User DN and Delegation ID. (If no Delega‐
       tion ID is specificed, then the default value is used.)

       If findproxyfile does not find a proxy or if a User DN  is  not  given,
       but   --outsidecache   was   given,   then   the  environment  variable
       X509_USER_PROXY and the standard location /tmp/x509up_uUID are searched
       as well.

OPTIONS
       --proxycache=PATH
              Give  the path of the proxy cache directory explicitly, overrid‐
              ing the default and the GRST_PROXY_PATH environment variable  if
              present.

       --delegation-id=ID
              The  optional  delegation ID is search for in the proxy cache in
              addition to the User DN. If absent, the  default  Delegation  ID
              value is searched for.

       --user-dn=DN
              The DN of the full user certificate associated with the proxy to
              be searched for in the proxy cache. (This is not the DN  of  any
              proxy  earlier  in  the  chain:  it is a the DN of a certificate
              issued by a recognised CA.)

       --outsidecache
              If a User DN is not given, or a proxy not found  in  the  cache,
              then  search for a proxy using X509_USER_PROXY environment vari‐
              able and file name of form /tmp/x509up_uUID as well.

RETURN VALUE
       If a proxy is found, its full path is output on standard out.

EXIT CODES
       0 is returned on succcess. Non-zero otherwise.

BUGS
       In this version, no attempt is made to verify or validate the proxies.
