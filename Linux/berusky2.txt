DESCRIPTION
       The  game based on Berusky that is also available for Debian, though this is the enhanced 3D version. Berusky 2 is a game that challenges your visual/spatial thinking and the ability to find a way
       to resolve a logic task.

       The entire game takes place in a 3D environment while you slip into the role of different bugs and lead them out of a maze. In addition to arbitrary turning and level  zooming  all  logical  plots

       In comparison to the first part, new logical elements, a simple linear story accompanied by comic series, various 3D environments, water surfaces and others have been added.
