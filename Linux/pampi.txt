NAME
       pampi-nonfree - program to download a few JS and CSS files to user space

SYNOPSIS

       pampi-nonfree

DESCRIPTION
       pampi-nonfree allows one to install a few JS and CSS files, which cannot be part of the Debian package, because they are non-free (non-commercial license terms), or because they are old frozen
       versions of packages which are distributed by Debian.
