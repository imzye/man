NAME
       Net::SSLGlue::SMTP - make Net::SMTP able to use SSL

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::SSLGlue::SMTP;
           my $smtp_ssl = Net::SMTP->new( $host,
               SSL => 1,
               SSL_ca_path => ...
           );

           my $smtp_plain = Net::SMTP->new( $host );
           $smtp_plain->starttls( SSL_ca_path => ... );

DESCRIPTION
       Net::SSLGlue::SMTP extends Net::SMTP so one can either start directly with SSL or switch later to SSL using the STARTTLS command.

       By default it will take care to verify the certificate according to the rules for SMTP implemented in IO::Socket::SSL.

METHODS
       new The  method "new" of Net::SMTP is now able to start directly with SSL when the argument "<SSL =" 1>> is given. In this case it will not create an IO::Socket::INET object but an IO::Socket::SSL
           object. One can give the usual "SSL_*" parameter of IO::Socket::SSL to "Net::SMTP::new".

       starttls
           If the connection is not yet SSLified it will issue the STARTTLS command and change the object, so that SSL will now be used. The usual "SSL_*" parameter of IO::Socket::SSL will be given.

       peer_certificate ...
           Once the SSL connection is established the object is derived from IO::Socket::SSL so that you  can  use  this  method  to  get  information  about  the  certificate.  See  the  IO::Socket::SSL
           documentation.

       All of these methods can take the "SSL_*" parameter from IO::Socket::SSL to change the behavior of the SSL connection. The following parameters are especially useful:

       SSL_ca_path, SSL_ca_file
           Specifies the path or a file where the CAs used for checking the certificates are located. This is typically "etc/ssl/certs" on UNIX systems.

       SSL_verify_mode
           If set to 0, verification of the certificate will be disabled. By default it is set to 1 which means that the peer certificate is checked.

       SSL_verifycn_name
           Usually  the  name given as the hostname in the constructor is used to verify the identity of the certificate. If you want to check the certificate against another name you can specify it with
           this parameter.
