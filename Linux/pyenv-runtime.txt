NAME
       pyenv - Simple Python version management

SYNOPSIS
       pyenv <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.

        To start using pyenv

       1. Append the following to $HOME/.bashrc

                      if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
                          export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
                          eval "$(pyenv init - bash)"
                      fi

          Appending this line enables shims. Please make sure this line is placed toward the end of the shell configuration file since it manipulates PATH during the initialization.

          Debian note: Modify only your ~/.bashrc file instead of creating
                       ~/.bash_profile

          Binaries on Debian division

          The pyenv-runtime package provides a minimal subset of the full pyenv functionality, suitable for shared environments (e.g., HPC clusters with

          NFS-mounted home directories). Unlike the full pyenv package, pyenv-runtime does not support version installation or management

          commands (like install, uninstall, global, or local), which are intended for use only on management hosts.

          The following pyenv subcommands are supported in pyenv-runtime:
          commands
          exec
          help
          hooks
          init
          latest
          prefix
          rehash
          shims
          version
          version-file
          version-name
          version-origin
          versions
          whence
          which
          These  commands  correspond  directly  to  the  wrappers  installed  under /usr/lib/pyenv/libexec/ and are sufficient to use Python versions already present in the shared $(pyenv root)/versions
          directory.

          Zsh note: Modify your ~/.zshrc file instead of  ~/.bashrc

          Warning: If you configured your system so  that BASH_ENV variable  points to .bashrc. You should almost certainly put the above mentioned line  into .bash_profile, and not into .bashrc.  Other‐
          wise you may observe strange behaviour, such as pyenv getting into an infinite loop. See #264 https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/264 for details.

       2. Restart your shell so the path changes take effect. You can now begin using pyenv.

                      exec "$SHELL"

       3. Install Python versions into $(pyenv root)/versions. For example, to download and install Python 3.6.12, run:

                      pyenv install 3.6.12

       NOTE:  If you need to pass configure option to build, please use CONFIGURE_OPTS environment variable. If you are having trouble installing a python version, please visit the wiki page about Common
       Build Problems https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems

       Proxy note: If you use a proxy, export HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.

   Stop using pyenv
       The simplicity of pyenv makes it easy to temporarily disable it, or uninstall from the system.  To disable pyenv managing your Python versions, simply remove the pyenv init line  from  your  shell
       startup configuration. This will remove pyenv shims directory from PATH, and future invocations like python will execute the system Python version, as before pyenv.

       pyenv will still be accessible on the command line, but your Python apps won't be affected by version switching.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

COMPARISON
       pyenv does...

       •   Let you change the global Python version on a per-user basis.

       •   Provide support for per-project Python versions.

       •   Allow you to override the Python version with an environment variable.

       •   Search commands from multiple versions of Python at a time. This may be helpful to test across Python versions with tox

       In contrast with pythonbrew and pythonz, pyenv does not...

       •   Depend on Python itself. pyenv was made from pure shell scripts. There is no bootstrap problem of Python.

       •   Need to be loaded into your shell. Instead, pyenv's shim approach works by adding a directory to your $PATH.

       •   Manage virtualenv. Of course, you can create virtualenv  yourself, or pyenv-virtualenv  to automate the process.

How It Works
       At  a  high level, pyenv intercepts Python commands using shim executables injected into your PATH, determines which Python version has been specified by your application, and passes your commands
       along to the correct Python installation.

   Understanding PATH
       When you run a command like python or pip, your operating system searches through a list of directories to find an executable file with that name. This list of directories lives in an  environment
       variable called PATH, with each directory in the list separated by a colon:

           /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

       Directories  in  PATH  are  searched  from  left  to  right, so a matching executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes precedence over another one at the end. In this example, the
       /usr/local/bin directory will be searched first, then /usr/bin, then /bin.

   Understanding Shims
       pyenv works by inserting a directory of shims at the front of your PATH:

           $(pyenv root)/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

       Through a process called rehashing, pyenv maintains shims in that directory to match every Python command (python,pip,etc...) across every installed version of Python

       Shims are lightweight executables that simply pass your command along to pyenv. So with pyenv installed, when you run, say, pip, your operating system will do the following:

       •   Search your PATH for an executable file named pip

       •   Find the pyenv shim named pip at the beginning of your PATH

       •   Run the shim named pip, which in turn passes the command along to pyenv

   Choosing the Python Version
       When you execute a shim, pyenv determines which Python version to use by reading it from the following sources, in this order:

       1.  The PYENV_VERSION environment variable (if specified). You can use the pyenv shell command to set this environment variable in your current shell session.

       2.  The application-specific .python-version file in the current directory (if present). You can modify the current directory's .python-version file with the pyenv local command.

       3.  The first .python-version file found (if any) by searching each parent directory, until reaching the root of your filesystem.

       4.  The global $(pyenv root)/version file. You can modify this file using the pyenv global  command. If the global version file is not present, pyenv assumes you want to use the  "system"  Python.
           (In other words, whatever version would run if pyenv weren't in your PATH.)

       NOTE:  You can activate multiple versions at the same time, including multiple versions of Python2 or Python3 simultaneously. This allows for parallel usage of Python2 and Python3, and is required
       with tools like tox. For example, to set your path to first use your system Python and Python3 (set to 2.7.9 and 3.4.2 in this example), but also have Python 3.3.6, 3.2, and 2.5 available on  your
       PATH,  one  would  first  pyenv  install the missing versions, then set pyenv global system 3.3.6 3.2 2.5. At this point, one should be able to find the full executable path to each of these using
       pyenv which, e.g. pyenv which python2.5 (should display $(pyenv root)/versions/2.5/bin/python2.5), or pyenv which python3.4 (should display path to system Python3). You can also  specify  multiple
       versions in a .python-version file, separated by newlines or any whitespace.  hy

   Locating the Python Installation
       Once pyenv has determined which version of Python your application has specified, it passes the command along to the corresponding Python installation.

       Each Python version is installed into its own directory under
       $(pyenv root)/versions.

       For example, you might have these versions installed:

       •   $(pyenv root)/versions/2.7.8/

       •   $(pyenv root)/versions/3.4.2/

       •   $(pyenv root)/versions/pypy-2.4.0/

       As far as pyenv is concerned, version names are simply the directories in $(pyenv root)/versions.

   Managing Virtual Environments
       There  is  a pyenv plugin named pyenv-virtualenv which comes with various features to help pyenv users to manage virtual environments created by virtualenv or Anaconda. Because the activate script
       of those virtual environments are relying on mutating $PATH variable of user's interactive shell, it will  intercept  pyenv's  shim  style  command  execution  hooks.  We'd  recommend  to  install
       pyenv-virtualenv as well if you have some plan to play with those virtual environments.

Advanced Configuration
       Skip this section unless you must know what every line in your shell profile is doing.

       pyenv init is the only command that crosses the line of loading extra commands into your shell. Coming from rvm, some of you might be opposed to this idea. Here's what pyenv init actually does:

       1.  Sets up your shims path. This is the only requirement for pyenv to function properly. You can do this by hand by prepending $(pyenv root)/shims to your $PATH.

       2.  Rehashes  shims.  From  time  to time you'll need to rebuild your shim files. Doing this on init makes sure everything is up to date. You can always run pyenv rehash manually.  You can disable
           this functionality by adding --no-rehash to the end of your pyenv init command line.

       3.  Installs the sh dispatcher. This bit is also optional, but allows pyenv and plugins to change variables in your current shell, making commands like pyenv  shell  possible.  The  sh  dispatcher
           doesn't do anything crazy like override cd or hack your shell prompt, but if for some reason you need pyenv to be a real script rather than a shell function, you can safely skip it.

       To see exactly what happens under the hood for yourself, run "pyenv init -".

Uninstalling Python Versions
       As time goes on, you will accumulate Python versions in your $(pyenv root)/versions directory.

       To remove old Python versions, pyenv uninstall command to automate the removal process.

       Alternatively, simply rm -rf the directory of the version you want to remove. You can find the directory of a particular Python version with the pyenv prefix command,

       e.g. pyenv prefix 2.6.8.

Command Reference
       The most common subcommands are:

   pyenv commands
       Lists all available pyenv commands.

   pyenv local
       Sets  a  local  application-specific Python version by writing the version name to a .python-version file in the current directory. This version overrides the global version, and can be overridden
       itself by setting the PYENV_VERSION environment variable or with the pyenv shell command.

           $ pyenv local 2.7.6

       When run without a version number, pyenv local reports the currently configured local version. You can also unset the local version:

           $ pyenv local --unset

       Previous versions of pyenv stored local version specifications in a file named .pyenv-version. For backwards compatibility, pyenv will read a local version specified in an .pyenv-version file, but
       a .python-version file in the same directory will take precedence.

       You can specify multiple versions as local Python at once.

       Let's say if you have two versions of 2.7.6 and 3.3.3. If you prefer 2.7.6 over 3.3.3,

           $ pyenv local 2.7.6 3.3.3
           $ pyenv versions
             system
           * 2.7.6 (set by /Users/yyuu/path/to/project/.python-version)
           * 3.3.3 (set by /Users/yyuu/path/to/project/.python-version)
           $ python --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python2.7 --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python3.3 --version
           Python 3.3.3

       or, if you prefer 3.3.3 over 2.7.6,

           $ pyenv local 3.3.3 2.7.6
           $ pyenv versions
             system
           * 2.7.6 (set by /Users/yyuu/path/to/project/.python-version)
           * 3.3.3 (set by /Users/yyuu/path/to/project/.python-version)
             venv27
           $ python --version
           Python 3.3.3
           $ python2.7 --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python3.3 --version
           Python 3.3.3

   pyenv global
       Sets the global version of Python to be used in all shells by writing the version name to the ~/.pyenv/version file. This version can be overridden by an application-specific .python-version file,
       or by setting the PYENV_VERSION environment variable.

           $ pyenv global 2.7.6

       The special version name system tells pyenv to use the system Python (detected by searching your $PATH).

       When run without a version number, pyenv global reports the currently configured global version.

       You can specify multiple versions as global Python at once.

       Let's say if you have two versions of 2.7.6 and 3.3.3. If you prefer 2.7.6 over 3.3.3,

           $ pyenv global 2.7.6 3.3.3
           $ pyenv versions
             system
           * 2.7.6 (set by /Users/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
           * 3.3.3 (set by /Users/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
           $ python --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python2.7 --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python3.3 --version
           Python 3.3.3

       or, if you prefer 3.3.3 over 2.7.6,

           $ pyenv global 3.3.3 2.7.6
           $ pyenv versions
             system
           * 2.7.6 (set by /Users/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
           * 3.3.3 (set by /Users/yyuu/.pyenv/version)
             venv27
           $ python --version
           Python 3.3.3
           $ python2.7 --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python3.3 --version
           Python 3.3.3

   pyenv shell
       Sets a shell-specific Python version by setting the PYENV_VERSION environment variable in your shell. This version overrides application-specific versions and the global version.

           $ pyenv shell pypy-2.2.1

       When run without a version number, pyenv shell reports the current value of PYENV_VERSION. You can also unset the shell version:

           $ pyenv shell --unset

       Note that you'll need pyenv's shell integration enabled (step 3 of the installation instructions) in order to use this command. If you prefer not to use shell integration, you may simply  set  the
       PYENV_VERSION variable yourself:

           $ export PYENV_VERSION=pypy-2.2.1

       You can specify multiple versions via PYENV_VERSION at once.

       Let's say if you have two versions of 2.7.6 and 3.3.3. If you prefer 2.7.6 over 3.3.3,

           $ pyenv shell 2.7.6 3.3.3
           $ pyenv versions
             system
           * 2.7.6 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
           * 3.3.3 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
           $ python --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python2.7 --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python3.3 --version
           Python 3.3.3

       or, if you prefer 3.3.3 over 2.7.6,

           $ pyenv shell 3.3.3 2.7.6
           $ pyenv versions
             system
           * 2.7.6 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
           * 3.3.3 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
             venv27
           $ python --version
           Python 3.3.3
           $ python2.7 --version
           Python 2.7.6
           $ python3.3 --version
           Python 3.3.3

                                   the Python Source code. If you have an unstable internet connection, you can use this variable to instruct aria2 to accelerate the download.  In most  cases,  you  will
                                   only need to use -x 10 -k 1M as value to PYTHON_BUILD_ARIA2_OPTS environment variable
