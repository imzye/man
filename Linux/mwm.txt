NAME
       mwmrc — the Motif Window Manager Resource Description File

DESCRIPTION
       The mwmrc file is a supplementary resource file that controls much of the behavior of the Motif window manager mwm.  It contains descriptions of resources that cannot easily be written using stan‐
       dard  X  Window System, Version 11 resource syntax. The resource description file contains entries that are referred to by X resources in defaults files (for example, /etc/X11/app-defaults/Mwm) or
       in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window. For example, the resource description file enables you to specify different types of window menus; however, an X resource is  used  to  specify
       which of these window menus mwm should use for a particular window.

   Location
       The window manager searches for one of the following resource description files, where $LANG is the value of the language environment on a per-user basis:

       $HOME/$LANG/.mwmrc
       $HOME/.mwmrc
       /etc/X11/mwm/$LANG/system.mwmrc
       /etc/X11/mwm/system.mwmrc

       The  first  file  found  is the first used. If no file is found, a set of built-in specifications is used. A particular resource description file can be selected using the configFile resource. The
       following shows how a different resource description file can be specified from the command line:

       /usr/bin/mwm -xrm "mwm*configFile: mymwmrc"

   Resource Types
       The following types of resources can be described in the mwm resource description file:

       Buttons   Window manager functions can be bound (associated) with button events.

       Keys      Window manager functions can be bound (associated) with key press events.

       Menus     Menu panes can be used for the window menu and other menus posted with key bindings and button bindings.

MWM RESOURCE DESCRIPTION FILE SYNTAX
       The mwm resource description file is a standard text file that contains items of information separated by blanks, tabs, and new lines characters. Blank lines are ignored. Items or  characters  can
       be  quoted to avoid special interpretation (for example, the comment character can be quoted to prevent it from being interpreted as the comment character).  A quoted item can be contained in dou‐
       ble quotes (" ").  Single characters can be quoted by preceding them by the back-slash character (\). If a line ends with a back-slash, the next line is considered a continuation of that line. All
       text from an unquoted # to the end of the line is regarded as a comment and is not interpreted as part of a resource description. If ! is the first character in a line, the line is regarded  as  a
       comment.

   Window Manager Functions
       Window  manager  functions  can  be accessed with button and key bindings, and with window manager menus. Functions are indicated as part of the specifications for button and key binding sets, and
       menu panes. The function specification has the following syntax:

       function = function_name [function_args]
       function_name = window manager function
       function_args = {quoted_item | unquoted_item}

       The following functions are supported. If a function is specified that isn't one of the supported functions then it is interpreted by mwm as f.nop.

       f.beep    This function causes a beep.

       f.circle_down [ icon | window]
                 This function causes the window or icon that is on the top of the window stack to be put on the bottom of the window stack (so that it is no longer obscuring any other window  or  icon).
                 This function affects only those windows and icons that are obscuring other windows and icons, or that are obscured by other windows and icons. Secondary windows (that is, transient win‐
                 dows) are restacked with their associated primary window. Secondary windows always stay on top of the associated primary window and there can be no other primary windows between the sec‐
                 ondary  windows and their primary window. If an icon function argument is specified, then the function applies only to icons. If a window function argument is specified then the function
                 applies only to windows.

       f.circle_up [ icon | window]
                 This function raises the window or icon on the bottom of the window stack (so that it is not obscured by any other windows). This function affects only those windows and icons  that  are
                 obscuring  other windows and icons, or that are obscured by other windows and icons. Secondary windows (that is, transient windows) are restacked with their associated primary window. If
                 an icon function argument is specified then the function applies only to icons. If an window function argument is specified then the function applies only to windows.

       f.exec command (or ! command)
                 This function causes command to be executed (using the value of the $MWMSHELL or $SHELL environment variable if set; otherwise, /bin/sh ). The ! notation can be  used  in  place  of  the
                 f.exec function name.

       f.focus_color
                 This  function sets the colormap focus to a client window. If this function is done in a root context, then the default colormap (setup by the X Window System for the screen where mwm is
                 running) is installed and there is no specific client window colormap focus. This function is treated as f.nop if colormapFocusPolicy is not explicit.

       f.focus_key
                 This function sets the keyboard input focus to a client window or icon.  This function is treated as f.nop if keyboardFocusPolicy is not explicit or the function is executed  in  a  root
                 context.

       f.kill    This  function  is used to close application windows. The actual processing that occurs depends on the protocols that the application observes. The application lists the protocols it ob‐
                 serves in the WM_PROTOCOLS property on its top level window. If the application observes the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol, it is sent a message that requests the window be deleted.  If  the
                 application  observes both WM_DELETE_WINDOW and WM_SAVE_YOURSELF, it is sent one message requesting the window be deleted and another message advising it to save its state. If the appli‐
                 cation observes only the WM_SAVE_YOURSELFprotocol , it is sent a message advising it to save its state. After a delay (specified by the resource quitTimeout), the  application's  connec‐
                 tion to the X server is terminated. If the application observes neither of these protocols, its connection to the X server is terminated.

       f.lower [- client | within | freeFamily]
                 This function lowers a primary window to the bottom of the global window stack (where it obscures no other window) and lowers the secondary window (transient window or dialog box) within
                 the  client  family. The arguments to this function are mutually exclusive. The client argument indicates the name or class of a client to lower. The name or class of a client appears in
                 the WM_CLASS property on the client's top-level window. If the client argument is not specified, the context that the function was invoked in indicates the window or icon to lower. Spec‐
                 ifying within lowers the secondary window within the family (staying above the parent) but does not lower the client family in the global window stack. Specifying freeFamily  lowers  the
                 window to the bottom of the global windows stack from its local family stack.

       f.maximize
                 This function causes a client window to be displayed with its maximum size. Refer to the maximumClientSize, maximumMaximumSize, and limitResize resources in mwm(1).

       f.menu menu_name
                 This function associates a cascading (pull-right) menu with a menu pane entry or a menu with a button or key binding. The menu_name function argument identifies the menu to be used.

       f.minimize
                 This function causes a client window to be minimized (iconified). When a window is minimized with no icon box in use, and if the lowerOnIconify resource has the value True (the default),
                 the  icon  is  placed  on the bottom of the window stack (such that it obscures no other window).  If an icon box is used, then the client's icon changes to its iconified form inside the
                 icon box. Secondary windows (that is, transient windows) are minimized with their associated primary window. There is only one icon for a primary window and all its secondary windows.

       f.move    This function initiates an interactive move of a client window.

       f.next_cmap
                 This function installs the next colormap in the list of colormaps for the window with the colormap focus.

       f.next_key [ icon | window | transient]
                 This function sets the keyboard input focus to the next window/icon in the set of windows/icons managed by the window manager (the ordering of this set is based on the stacking  of  win‐
                 dows  on the screen). This function is treated as f.nop if keyboardFocusPolicy is not explicit. The keyboard input focus is only moved to windows that do not have an associated secondary
                 window that is application modal. If the transient argument is specified, then transient (secondary) windows are traversed (otherwise, if only window is specified, traversal is done only
                 to the last focused window in a transient group). If an icon function argument is specified, then the function applies only to icons. If a window function argument is specified, then the
                 function applies only to windows.

       f.nop     This function does nothing.

       f.normalize
                 This function causes a client window to be displayed with its normal size. Secondary windows (that is, transient windows) are placed in their normal state  along  with  their  associated
                 primary window.

       f.normalize_and_raise
                 This  function  causes  a client window to be displayed with its normal size and raised to the top of the window stack. Secondary windows (that is, transient windows) are placed in their
                 normal state along with their associated primary window.

       f.pack_icons
                 This function is used to relayout icons (based on the layout policy being used) on the root window or in the icon box. In general this causes icons to be "packed" into the icon grid.

       f.pass_keys
                 This function is used to enable/disable (toggle) processing of key bindings for window manager functions. When it disables key binding processing all keys are passed  on  to  the  window
                 with  the keyboard input focus and no window manager functions are invoked. If the f.pass_keys function is invoked with a key binding to disable key binding processing the same key bind‐
                 ing can be used to enable key binding processing.

       f.post_wmenu
                 This function is used to post the window menu. If a key is used to post the window menu and a window menu button is present, the window menu is automatically  placed  with  its  top-left
                 corner at the bottom-left corner of the window menu button for the client window. If no window menu button is present, the window menu is placed at the top-left corner of the client win‐
                 dow.

       f.prev_cmap
                 This function installs the previous colormap in the list of colormaps for the window with the colormap focus.

       f.prev_key [ icon | window | transient]
                 This  function  sets  the keyboard input focus to the previous window/icon in the set of windows/icons managed by the window manager (the ordering of this set is based on the stacking of
                 windows on the screen). This function is treated as f.nop if keyboardFocusPolicy is not explicit. The keyboard input focus is only moved to windows that do not have  an  associated  sec‐
                 ondary  window  that is application modal.  If the transient argument is specified, then transient (secondary) windows are traversed (otherwise, if only window is specified, traversal is
                 done only to the last focused window in a transient group). If an icon function argument is specified then the function applies only to icons. If an window function argument is specified
                 then the function applies only to windows.

       f.quit_mwm
                 This function terminates mwm (but NOT the X window system).

       f.raise [-client | within | freeFamily]
                 This function raises a primary window to the top of the global window stack (where it is obscured by no other window) and raises the secondary window (transient  window  or  dialog  box)
                 within the client family. The arguments to this function are mutually exclusive. The client argument indicates the name or class of a client to lower. If the client is not specified, the
                 context  that  the  function was invoked in indicates the window or icon to lower. Specifying within raises the secondary window within the family but does not raise the client family in
                 the global window stack. Specifying freeFamily raises the window to the top of its local family stack and raises the family to the top of the global window stack.

       f.raise_lower [ within | freeFamily]
                 This function raises a primary window to the top of the global window stack if it is partially obscured by another window; otherwise, it lowers the window to the  bottom  of  the  window
                 stack. The arguments to this function are mutually exclusive. Specifying within raises a secondary window within the family (staying above the parent window), if it is partially obscured
                 by  another  window  in  the  application's  family;  otherwise,  it lowers the window to the bottom of the family stack. It has no effect on the global window stacking order. Specifying
                 freeFamily raises the window to the top of its local family stack, if obscured by another window, and raises the family to the top of the global window stack; otherwise,  it  lowers  the
                 window to the bottom of its local family stack and lowers the family to the bottom of the global window stack.

       f.refresh This function causes all windows to be redrawn.

       f.refresh_win
                 This function causes a client window to be redrawn.

       f.resize  This function initiates an interactive resize of a client window.

       f.restore This  function  restores  the previous state of an icon's associated window.  If a maximized window is iconified, then f.restore restores it to its maximized state. If a normal window is
                 iconified, then f.restore restores it to its normalized state.

       f.restore_and_raise
                 This function restores the previous state of an icon's associated window and raises the window to the  top  of  the  window  stack.  If  a  maximized  window  is  iconified,  then  f.re‐
                 store_and_raise  restores  it to its maximized state and raises it to the top of the window stack. If a normal window is iconified, then f.restore_and_raise restores it to its normalized
                 state and raises it to the top of the window stack.

       f.restart This function causes mwm to be restarted (effectively terminated and re-executed). Restart is necessary for mwm to incorporate changes in both the mwmrc file and X resources.

       f.screen [ next | prev | back | screen_number]
                 This function causes the pointer to be warp to a specific screen number or to the next, previous, or last visited (back) screen. The arguments to this function  are  mutually  exclusive.
                 The  screen_number  argument  indicates  the screen number that the pointer is to be warped. Screens are numbered starting from screen 0. Specifying next cause the pointer to warp to the
                 next managed screen (skipping over any unmanaged screens). Specifying prev cause the pointer to warp to the previous managed screen (skipping over any unmanaged screens). Specifying back
                 cause the pointer to warp to the last visited screen.

       f.send_msg message_number
                 This function sends an XClientMessageEvent of type _MOTIF_WM_MESSAGES with message_type set to message_number.  The client message is sent only  if  message_number  is  included  in  the
                 client's _MOTIF_WM_MESSAGES property. A menu item label is grayed out if the menu item is used to do f.send_msg of a message that is not included in the client's _MOTIF_WM_MESSAGES prop‐
                 erty.

       f.separator
                 This function causes a menu separator to be put in the menu pane at the specified location (the label is ignored).

       f.set_behavior
                 This  function  causes the window manager to restart with the default behavior (if a custom behavior is configured) or a custom behavior (if a default behavior is configured). By default
                 this is bound to Shift Ctrl Alt <Key>!.

       f.title   This function inserts a title in the menu pane at the specified location.

       f.version This function causes the window manager to display its release version in a dialog box.

   Function Constraints
       Each function may be constrained as to which resource types can specify the function (for example, menu pane) and also what context the function can be used in (for example, the function  is  done
       to the selected client window).  Function contexts are:

       root      No client window or icon has been selected as an object for the function.

       window    A  client  window  has  been  selected as an object for the function. This includes the window's title bar and frame. Some functions are applied only when the window is in its normalized
                 state (for example, f.maximize) or its maximized state (for example, f.normalize).

       icon      An icon has been selected as an object for the function.

       If a function is specified in a type of resource where it is not supported or is invoked in a context that does not apply then the function is treated as f.nop. The following table  indicates  the
       resource types and function contexts in which window manager functions apply.

WINDOW MANAGER EVENT SPECIFICATION
       Events are indicated as part of the specifications for button and key binding sets, and menu panes. Button events have the following syntax:

       button =~[modifier_list ]<button_event_name >
       modifier_list =~modifier_name { modifier_name}

       The following table indicates the values that can be used for modifier_name. Note that [Alt] and [Meta] can be used interchangeably on some hardware.

       Modifier      Description
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Ctrl          Control Key
       Shift         Shift Key
       Alt           Alt Key

       Mod5          Modifier5

       Locking modifiers are ignored when processing button and key bindings.  The following table lists keys that are interpreted as locking modifiers.  The X server may map some of these symbols to the
       Mod1  -  Mod5  modifier keys.  These keys may or may not be available on your hardware: Key Symbol Caps Lock Shift Lock Kana Lock Num Lock Scroll Lock The following table indicates the values that
       can be used for button_event_name.

       Key events that are used by the window manager for menu mnemonics and for binding to window manager functions are single key presses; key releases are ignored. Key events have the  following  syn‐
       tax:

       key =~[modifier_list] <Key>key_name
       modifier_list =~modifier_name { modifier_name}

       All  modifiers  specified are interpreted as being exclusive (this means that only the specified modifiers can be present when the key event occurs).  Modifiers for keys are the same as those that
       apply to buttons. The key_name is an X11 keysym name. Keysym names can be found in the keysymdef.h file (remove the XK_ prefix).

BUTTON BINDINGS
       The buttonBindings resource value is the name of a set of button bindings that are used to configure window manager behavior.  A window manager function can be done when a button press occurs with
       the pointer over a framed client window, an icon or the root window. The context for indicating where the button press applies is also the context for invoking the window manager function when the
       button press is done (significant for functions that are context sensitive). The button binding syntax is

       Buttons bindings_set_name
       {
           button    context    function
           button    context    function
           ...
           button    context    function
       }

       The syntax for the context specification is: context = object[| context] object = root | icon | window | title | frame | border | app The context specification indicates where the pointer must  be
       for  the button binding to be effective. For example, a context of window indicates that the pointer must be over a client window or window management frame for the button binding to be effective.
       The frame context is for the window management frame around a client window (including the border and titlebar), the border context is for the border part of the window management frame  (not  in‐
       cluding  the titlebar), the title context is for the title area of the window management frame, and the app context is for the application window (not including the window management frame). If an
       f.nop function is specified for a button binding, the button binding is not done.

KEY BINDINGS
       The keyBindings resource value is the name of a set of key bindings that are used to configure window manager behavior. A window manager function can be done when a particular key is pressed.  The
       context in which the key binding applies is indicated in the key binding specification.  The valid contexts are the same as those that apply to button bindings. The key binding syntax is:

       Keys bindings_set_name
       {
           key    context    function
           key    context    function
           ...
           key    context    function
       }

       If an f.nop function is specified for a key binding, the key binding is not done. If an f.post_wmenu or f.menu function is bound to a key, mwm automatically uses the same key for removing the menu
       from the screen after it has been popped up. The context specification syntax is the same as for button bindings with one addition. The context ifkey may be specified for binding keys that may not
       be available on all displays.  If the key is not available and if ifkey is in the context, then reporting of the error message to the error log is suppressed. This feature is useful for networked,
       heterogeneous  environments. For key bindings, the frame, title, border, and app contexts are equivalent to the window context.  The context for a key event is the window or icon that has the key‐
       board input focus (root if no window or icon has the keyboard input focus).

MENU PANES
       Menus can be popped up using the f.post_wmenu and f.menu window manager functions. The context for window manager functions that are done from a menu is root, icon or window depending on  how  the
       menu  was  popped up. In the case of the window menu or menus popped up with a key binding, the location of the keyboard input focus indicates the context. For menus popped up using a button bind‐
       ing, the context of the button binding is the context of the menu. The menu pane specification syntax is:

       Menu menu_name
       {
           label  [mnemonic]  [accelerator ]   function
           label  [mnemonic]  [accelerator ]   function
           ...
           label  [mnemonic]  [accelerator ]   function
       }

       Each line in the Menu specification identifies the label for a menu item and the function to be done if the menu item is selected. Optionally a menu button mnemonic and a menu button keyboard  ac‐
       celerator  may  be specified. Mnemonics are functional only when the menu is posted and keyboard traversal applies. The label may be a string or a bitmap file. The label specification has the fol‐
       lowing syntax:

       label = text | bitmap_file
       bitmap_file = @file_name
       text = quoted_item | unquoted_item

       The string encoding for labels must be compatible with the menu font that is used. Labels are greyed out for menu items that do the f.nop function or an invalid function or a function that doesn't
       apply in the current context. A mnemonic specification has the following syntax:

       mnemonic = _ character

       The first matching character in the label is underlined.  If there is no matching character in the label, no mnemonic is registered with the window manager for that label. Although  the  character
       must  exactly match a character in the label, the mnemonic does not execute if any modifier (such as Shift) is pressed with the character key. The accelerator specification is a key event specifi‐
       cation with the same syntax as is used for key bindings to window manager functions.

INCLUDING FILES
       You may include other files into your mwmrc file by using the include construct. For example,

       INCLUDE
       {
           /usr/local/shared/mwm.menus
           /home/kmt/personal/my.bindings
       }

       causes the files named to be read in and interpreted in order as an additional part of the mwmrc file. Include is a top-level construct. It cannot be nested inside another construct.
