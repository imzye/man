NAME
       getds - Create a DS record from DNSKEYing information

SYNOPSIS
         getds <domain>

DESCRIPTION
       getds will create a DS record from DNSKEYs for the specified DNS
       domain.  It does this by converting DNSKEYs to DS records using the
       specified hashing algorithm.  The results can then be passed to
       upstream DNSSEC-supporting parents or to DLV registries.

       getds will also pull the parent's published DS records and compare them
       against the existing keys.  It will then list any DS records not
       published in the parent, as well as any DS records that are published
       in the parent but which don't match an existing key.

OPTIONS
       getds takes the following options:

       -a ALGORITHMS
       --hash-algorithm algorithm ALGORITHMS
           This option specifies the hash algorithm to use when converting
           DNSKEYs to DS records.  It may be a comma-separated list if
           multiple algorithms are desired.  The algorithms to choose from may
           be either SHA256 or SHA1.

           The default is SHA256,SHA1

       -f KEYFILE
       --read-key-file KEYFILE
           This option specifies a file with a DNSKEY stored in it (such as
           created by bind's dnssec-keygen program).  This is helpful for
           comparing a known good key file against something that is actually
           published.

       -z
       --print-zsks
           This option causes getds to print ZSK DS records, as well as KSK
           records.

       -p
       --dont-check-parent
           Instructs getds to not check the records in the parent for their
           published DS records.

       -q
       --quiet
           Produces quiet output with no explanatory headers.  In other words,
           it only prints the DS records generated from the DNSKEYs.

           Note: Running with -q implies -p.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       By default, getds pulls data from the live DNS.  If your DNS resolver
       isn't configured so that this is pulled securely, then the results
       can't be trusted.
