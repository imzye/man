DESCRIPTION
       Linux Network Stack Test is a tool that supports development and execution of automated and portable network tests. For detailed description of the architecture of LNST please refer to project website
       (link listed on INTERNET RESOURCES bellow).

       lnst-slave is a daemon script that runs in the background and waits for incomming commands from a controller.

       -p, --port=port_number
              The port number lnst-slave should listen on for incomming commands.

CONFIGURATION
       lnst-slave will look for configuration in the following location:

       /etc/lnst-slave.conf

       For further description of file format or configuration options available, please refer to the configuration file itself, where each option is documented.

FILES
       Apart from configuration, there are few important locations that lnst-slave works with. All bellow mentioned paths can be changed in the configuration file.

   Log Path
       Every test exectution and all the commands run by lnst-slave during the test are logged to the following location:

       /var/log/lnst

   Cache Location
       Test modules and tools used by the controllers with this slave are cached in resources cache. The cache is by default located at:

       /var/cache/lnst

       The cache is fully under control of the lnst-slave daemon and is managed automatically. Making any modifications by hand is not recommended.
