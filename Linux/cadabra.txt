NAME
       cadabra - field-theory motivated computer algebra system

SYNOPSIS
       cadabra

DESCRIPTION
       Cadabra is a computer algebra system for the manipulation of tensorial expressions.

       The  output  of  cadabra is either plain text or UTF8 encoded Unicode (see the environment variables described below). The line-breaking properties of the latter are used to wrap large expressions are
       reasonable points. In addition to the standard output, cadabra can print status information, which is wrapped in special <status>...</status> blocks.

OPTIONS
        --silent
              Disables all output, except for output generated by the @print algorithm.

        --loginput
              Copy the input into the log file.

        --input filename
              Read the indicated file as input before switching to console input.

        --prompt string
              Set the prompt of the interactive session to the indicated string.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following variables toggle various features on or off, depending on whether the variable is set or not:

        CDB_PRINTSTAR
              Display a star to indicate products. Without this setting, a space is used.

        CDB_USE_UTF8
              Use UTF8 encoding for output. This in particular will introduce non-breakable spaces to group objects together, as well as zero-width non-breakable spaces to prevent line-breaks after brackets,
              underscore and caret symbols.  When this variable is not set, the output will be plain ASCII without any special symbols.
