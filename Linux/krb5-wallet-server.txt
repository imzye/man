NAME
       ad-keytab - Manage and display keytabs for Active Directory principals

SYNOPSIS
       ad-keytab create|update|delete|show keytab-id [keytab-file] [--ad_server=hostname] [--computer_rdn=dn] [--user_rdn] [--dump] [--help] [--manual] [--debug]

DESCRIPTION
       This script is a wrapper around msktutil and ldapsearch to simplify the creation of host and service keytabs.  The script is useful for boot strapping the Kerberos credentials required to use
       Active Directory as a backend keytab store for wallet.  The script shares the wallet configuration file.

       Generally, two keytabs will need to be created to setup wallet.  One host keytab for the wallet server host and one service keytab for wallet to use when connecting to an Active Directory Domain
       Controller.

       Note, this script does not update the Wallet database which means any keytabs created by it will be invisible from wallet.

ACTIONS
       create
           Add a keytab to AD and update the keytab file.  Fails if the keytab already exists.

       update
           Update an existing keytab in AD and update the keytab file.  Fails if the keytab does not exist.

       delete
           Delete a keytab from AD and remove it from the keytab file.

       show
           Show AD's view of the account corresponding to the keytab.  This action does not use msktutil and queries AD directly using LDAP.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       keytab-id
           This  is  either host principal name of the form host/<fqdn> or a service principal name of the form service/<id>.  Service keytab identifiers cannot be longer than 18 characters because of an
           Active Directory restriction.

       keytab-filename
           The name of the keytab file.  Defaults to /etc/krb5.keytab.

       --conf=filename
           The configuration file to read.  The script searches for a configuration file in the following order.

                 * The command line switch --conf
                 * The environment variable ADKEYTAB
                 * The file .ad-keytab.conf
                 * The file /etc/ad-keytab.conf

       --ad_server=hostname
           The name of the Active Directory host to connect to.  It is important what the script contact only _one_ server due to the fact that propagation within an Active Directory domain can be  quite
           slow.

       --base_dn=ou=org,dc=domain,dc=tld
           The base distinguished name holding both computer and user accounts.

       --computer_rdn=dn
           The relative distinguished name to use as the base DN for both the creation of host keytabs and searches of Active Directory.  The distinguished name formed will be computer_rdn,base_dn.

       --user_rdn=dn
           The relative distinguished name to use as the base DN for LDAP searches of Active Directory for service keytabs.  The distinguished name formed will be user_rdn_rdn,base_dn.

       --dump
           When displaying keytab attributes show all of the attributes.

       --help
           Displays help text.

       --manual
           Displays more complete help text.

       --debug
           Turns on debugging displays.
