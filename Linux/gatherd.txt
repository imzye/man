NAME
       gatherd - SBLIM metric collection daemon

SYNOPSIS
       gatherd [argument]

DESCRIPTION
       The gatherd program is a system daemon that collects performance metrics for various components via a set of metric plugins. Raw metric data is forwarded to a seperate repository daemon that is
       located either locally or remotely (see reposd(8)). The repository destination, location of plugin directory, and other controllable configuration options are described in the configuration file man
       page (see gatherd.conf(5)).

       The gatherd daemon can be controlled at runtime by way of the gatherctl(8) command. This provides the ability to load and unload metric plugins online without the need to restart gatherd.

       The primary goal of the the sblim-gather package is to implement the DMTF's Base Metric Model (DSP1053). While, gatherd, reposd(8), and their plugins can be used standalone, the greatest benefit comes
       from using their CIM provider layer in conjuction with a CIM Object Manager (see cimserver(1)). For more information about CIM and the Base Metric Model refer to the Distrubuted Management Task Force
       (DMTF) at http://www.dmtf.org.

OPTIONS
       argument
           gatherd daemonizes by default. Passing any value on the command line will cause it to run in the terminal.

FILES
       /etc/gatherd.conf
           This file contains the daemon configuration settings. See gatherd.conf(5) for more information.
