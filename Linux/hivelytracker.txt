NAME
       hivelytracker - Music tracker for AHX and HVL formats

SYNOPSIS
       hivelytracker [options] files...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the hivelytracker command.

       hivelytracker  is  a tracker program based upon the AHX format created in the mid '90s by Dexter and Pink of Abyss. The format was relatively popular, and many songs were created and used in scene
       productions and games. AHX was designed to create a very SID-like sound on the Amiga.

       It can import and export modules and instruments in the AHX format, but it also improves on AHX in several ways and therefore has its own instrument and module formats.

       Features over AHX:

              Multichannel (4 to 16 channels)

              Per-channel stereo panning

              Two commands per note instead of one

              Ring modulation

              A more feature rich editor
