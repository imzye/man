NAME
       sha1cdsum - SHA-1 digests with collision detection

DESCRIPTION
       sha1cdsum 0.2.3 Print or check SHA1 (160-bit) checksums with collision detection.

   USAGE:
              sha1cdsum [FLAGS] [files]...

   FLAGS:
       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read SHA1 sums from the FILEs and check them

       -h, --help
              Prints help information

       --tag  create a BSD-style checksum

       -t, --text
              read in text mode

       -V, --version
              Prints version information

       -z, --zero
              end each output line with NUL, not newline, and disable file name escaping

       --ignore-missing
              don't fail or report status for missing files

       --quiet
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       --strict
              exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

   ARGS:
       <files>...
              Input file(s).  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input

       The last five options are useful only when verifying checksums.

       The  sums  are  computed using Marc Stevens' modified SHA1 that detects collision attacks.  When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a line
       with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.

       If a collision is detected, '*coll*' is printed in front of the file name.

       Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems.

       This program implements the same interface as coreutils' sha1sum, modulo error messages printed to stderr, handling of non-UTF8 filenames, and bugs.
