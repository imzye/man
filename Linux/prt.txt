NAME
       prt - Command line frontend of App::PRT

SYNOPSIS
           $ prt <command> <args>
           $ prt <command> <args> <files>

DESCRIPTION
       prt is the command line frontend of App::PRT.

SUBCOMMANDS
       •   replace_token

           Replace "foo" token with "bar".

               prt replace_token foo bar

           Replace "foo" token with "bar" but target statements must have "bazz" token.

               prt replace_token foo bar --in-statement bazz

       •   rename_class

           Rename "Foo" class to "Bar" class.

               prt rename_class Foo Bar

       •   rename_namespace

           Rename "Foo" and "Foo::*" classes to "Bar" and "Bar::*" classes.

               prt rename_namespace Foo Bar

       •   delete_method

           Delete "eat" method from "Food" class.

               prt delete_method Food eat

       •   move_class_method

           Move "method" method in "Class" class to "another_method" method in "AnotherClass".  "Class"'s including packages are copied to "AnotherClass".

               prt move_class_method 'Class#method' 'AnotherClass#another_method'

       •   introduce_variables

           Print the variables in the source code. This command accepts input from "STDIN".

               prt introduce_variables a.pl
               cat a.pl | prt introduce_variables
               pbpaste | prt introduce_variables

       •   list_files

           List the files that "App::PRT" would process.  This can be used, for example, to search the contents of the Perl sources in a project:

               grep "some_regex" `prt list_files`

           The "-0" argument causes outputs to be separated by "\0" instead of the default "\n".  For example:

               prt list_files -0 | xargs -0 grep "some_regex"

TARGET FILES
       You can specify the target files to refactor.  For example:

           prt replace_token foo bar lib/**/*.pm t/*.t # Refactor Perl modules in lib/ and test files in t/

       NOTE: "App::PRT" does not glob (expand wildcards).  In the above command, the shell must expand the "**/*.pm" and "*.t".

       Without  target files, "App::PRT" detects source files in your project automatically.  "App::PRT" looks for a "cpanfile" to detect the project's root directory.  When executed in a git repository,
       all files in the repository are used.

           prt replace_token foo bar   # Refactor the project in current working directory
