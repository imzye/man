NAME
       xforms -   A GUI Toolkit for X Window Systems

SYNOPSIS
       Forms Library for X (xforms) is a GUI toolkit and builder for the X Window Systems and runs on all major UNIX platforms as well as OpenVMS and OS2.  Forms Library is too complex to be described in
       the  "man"  page  format.   Ask your system administrator for the location of the HTML, PDF or PostScript document or follow the links on the Forms Library's home page for an online version of the
       documentation.

DESCRIPTION
       Forms Library is a graphical user interface toolkit based on Xlib for X Window Systems. It comes with a rich set of objects such as buttons, browsers, sliders and menus integrated into an  elegant
       event/object  callback  execution  model that allows fast and easy construction of X applications. In addition, the library has support for image read and write, format conversion and simple image
       processing. The library consists of a flexible set of C-routines that can be used in C and C++ programs (As of this writing, perl, ada95, pascal, scheme and Fortran bindings to the  Forms  Library
       are in beta.)

       The  library is efficient and portable and runs on all major Unix platforms, including Sun, SGI, HP, DEC Alpha/OSF, IBM RS6000, Convex, Cray, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, SCO, Unixware, OpenBSD , BSDi,
       DecSystem(mips)/Ultrix and others.  Non-unix platforms include OpenVMS, OS/2, and Window/NT.

       Bundled with the library is also a Form designer, fdesign, which can be used to build interaction forms in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) way and to generate the corresponding C (or  any
       of the binding languages) code for you.  50+ demos in source code are distributed with the library.

OPTIONS
       All programs written using the Forms Library recognize the following command line options

       -display host:dpy
             specifies the server to connect to.

       -bw borderwidth
             specifies the border width to use for built-in objects.

       -flversion
             prints the xforms version information.

       -visual visualName
             requests a visual by name such as TrueColor etc. By default the Forms Library always selects the visual that has the most depth.

       -depth depth
             requests a specific depth.

       -fldebug level
             generates  some  info about the state of the XForms.  where level is an integer between 1-5 and controls the amount of information to output. Depending on the options used when the Forms Li‐
             brary was built, a level more than 3 might not be available.

       -sync runs the application in synchronous mode with debug level set to 4.

       -private
             requests a private colormap for the application.

       -shared
             requests a shared colormap even if the application needs more colors than available. For those colors that can't be allocated in the shared colormap, substitutions are made  so  the  closest
             matching color is used.

       -stdcmap
             requests a standard colormap.

       -name  newname
             specifies the application name under which resources are to be obtained, rather than the default executable file name.
