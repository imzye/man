NAME w_scan_cpp - an universal DTV scanner and successor of w_scan.
SYNOPSIS
       w_scan_cpp -fa -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan_cpp -fc -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan_cpp -ft -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan_cpp -fs -s <SATELLITE_ID> [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       w_scan_cpp scans for DVB-C, DVB-S/S2, DVB-T/T2 and ATSC channels,
       or, let's call it digital TV and Radio services.
       During a scan, this utility writes commands to your DTV hardware
       and reads data from it.
       Therefore, any other program accessing the DVB hardware
       with write access (like e.g. VDR, tvheadend, minisatip,..) has to
       be closed in order to avoid conflicts while running w_scan_cpp.
       Also, enshure that you start this tool with proper write
       permissions to your hardware, i.e using sudo.
       After a successful scan, w_scan_cpp provides the channels in
       different output formats.
       By default, the data is written as VDR channels.conf. If you
       prefer another output format, see OPTIONS section.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available.

       -f TYPE, --frontend TYPE
              Frontend type, What programs do you want to search for?
              "a" = atsc (vsb/qam; North-America)
              "c" = DVB-C (digital cable)
              "s" = DVB-S/S2 (digital satellite)
              "t" = DVB-T/T2 (digital terrestrial)[default]
              IMPORTANT: Depending on "TYPE",
              either of the arguments "-s" or "-c" is mandatory.

       -A N, --atsc_type N
              specify ATSC type (North-America only)
              "1" = Terrestrial ('VSB') [default]
              "2" = Cable (sometimes called wrong 'QAM' or 'clear-QAM')
              "3" = both, Terrestrial and Cable

       -t, --satip
              use a SAT>IP (network connected) tuner via VDR Satip Plugin,
              instead of a local installed tuner.
              see https://www.satip.info

       -c <COUNTRY_ID>, --country <COUNTRY_ID>
              Mandatory argument for ATSC, cable and terrestrian scans,
              see option -f.
              Specifies the country where you try to scan for channels.
              Argument is an uppercase two letter identifier, e.g.
              DE = Germany,
              FR = France
              GB = Great Britain
              US = United States,
              Use "-c?" for a list of all known identifiers.

       -s <SATELLITE_ID>, --satellite <SATELLITE_ID>
              choose your satellite here:
              S19E2, S13E0, S15W0, ..

       -F <VDR-CHANNEL>, --femon <VDR-CHANNEL>
              tune to a channel in VDR syntax and report signal status.
              For details about VDR channel syntax, see vdr(5)

       -H, --extended-help

EXPERT OPTIONS
*** General ***
       -v, --verbose
              be more verbose (repeat for more)

       -q, --quiet
              be more quiet   (repeat for less)

*** Services ***
       -C FILE, --sort-criteria FILE
              sort services in sequence, as given by FILE.
              FILE is a text file, each line gives the name of a service,
              optionally followed by a delimiter (',' or ';' or ':') and a comment.
              If 'name' is 7bit ASCII only, the comparison is case-insensitive.
              Otherwise, for non-7bit ASCII, the case behaviour depends on your system.
              w_scan_cpp tries to output services in the same sequence as your file -
              but only for those channels which are really found.
              If several services match the name, they are grouped together.
              Services not matching any sort-criteria appear after the sorted lines.
              NOTE: 'FILE' should be in the same encoding as used during scan, ie utf8.
              Example:
              Das Erste HD;ARD:
              ZDF HD
              :*** private channels ***
              SAT.1 HD;ProSiebenSat.1
              RTL HD:should be channel number 4.

       -R N, --radio-services N
              0 = don't search radio channels
              1 = search radio channels [default]

       -T N, --tv-services N
              0 = don't search TV channels
              1 = search TV channels[default]

       -E N, --encrypted-services (Conditional Access)
              N=0 gets only Free TV channels
              N=1 search also encrypted channels [default]

*** Device ***
       -a N, --adapter N
              use device /dev/dvb/adapterN/ [default: auto detect]
              (also allowed: -a /dev/dvb/adapterN/frontendM)

       --satip-server <STRING>
              do not auto detect the satip server, but use manual
              server settings, ie.
              192.168.2.66 (the servers IP)
              192.168.2.66|DVBC-1 (the server has one DVB-C frontend)
              192.168.2.66|DVBS2-2,DVBT2-2|OctopusNet (two different fe types and quirks for OctopusNet)
              192.168.2.66|DVBS2-2|minisatip:0x08 (RTP over TCP)
              NOTE: as this option is just forwarded to the vdr-plugin-satip,
              please refer to it's README for further details.
              NOTE: Server quirk 0x08 enables RTP over TCP use.

       --satip-src N
              selects the satellite orbital position for SAT>IP by index N (1 .. 255).
              The number of supported positions depends on the SAT>IP server.
              For the actual value of N, refer to the setup page of your SAT>IP server.
              The default value is 1.

*** DVB-C ***
       -i N, --inversion N
              spectral inversion setting for cable TV
              (0: off, 1: on, 2: auto [default])

       -Q N, --dvbc-modulation N
              set DVB-C modulation, see table: 0  = QAM64
              1  = QAM256
              2  = QAM128
              3  = all (SLOW!)
              NOTE: for experienced users only!!

       -e N,--dvbc-extflags N
              extended scan flags (DVB-C only),
              Any combination of these flags:
              1 = use extended symbolrate list
              enables scan of symbolrates
                 6900, 6875, 6111, 6250, 6790,
                 6811, 5900, 5000, 3450, 4000,
                 6950, 7000, 6952, 5156, 5483
              2 = extended QAM scan (enable QAM128)
              recommended for Nethterlands and Finland
              NOTE: extended scan will be *slow*

       -S N, dvbc-symbolrate N
              set DVB-C symbol rate, see table:
                      0  = 6900 kSymbol/s
                      1  = 6875 kSymbol/s
                      4  = 6952 kSymbol/s
                      5  = 6950 kSymbol/s
                      6  = 6790 kSymbol/s
                      7  = 6811 kSymbol/s
                      8  = 6250 kSymbol/s
                      9  = 6111 kSymbol/s
                      11 = 5900 kSymbol/s
                      12 = 5483 kSymbol/s
                      14 = 5156 kSymbol/s
                      15 = 5000 kSymbol/s
                      16 = 4000 kSymbol/s
                      17 = 3450 kSymbol/s
              NOTE: for experienced users only!!
